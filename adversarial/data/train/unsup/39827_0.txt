I live across the street from this location. However, every time I come in here I'm reminded of the glorious thing that is Amazon Prime, where the pet food is cheaper and you don't have to deal with some of the  trainwrecks that shop here.\n\nA couple weeks ago, I saw a man shopping with his dog who was pissing all over the store. He had to have noticed. Did he care? Nope.\n\nI've seen dog shit in the parking lot right in front of the dog waste station that also has bags.\n\nThere is always guaranteed to be a line stretched halfway through the store, with only one register open. Usually due to some crazy cat lady who has their cart filled to the brim with tiny individual cans of wet food. \n\nAnd I am saying this as a cat person and animal lover. This store makes me hate pet people. \n\n2 stars are only because the staff is always very nice and helpful.
