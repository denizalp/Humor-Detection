For breakfast\/ brunch this is one of the better buffets on the strip, especially with the BOGO offer. So yes, I do check in here a lot. As I do eat here a lot for breakfast. If you are lucky enough to get a BOGO coupon you can eat at this Brazilian Churrascaria, have an hour of All You Can Drink Mimosas\/ Bloody Mary's for under $13 a person! Together you and your breakfast mate, with the coupon, will spend $25 plus $1 for water (per person). That is an incredible bargain! \n\nThere is a little buffet that accompanies the meats carved tableside. There are nice breakfast items like French Toast, eggs, cheese omelets, breakfast potatoes, breads, etc. There are also other items like vegetables, salads, rice, beans, hearts of palms and so on. There is something for everyone!\n\nThe meats carved tableside are very good. The sirloin is always a favorite as well as the chicken drumstick. Two types of sausages make the round, both pork and chicken, as well as a delicious ham. It is not as big of a selection as during lunch or dinner time but for breakfast and for the price... I am not complaining.\n\nAs for the booze part, you can add one hour for $15 of All you can drink Mimosas or Bloody Mary's. I normally choose the Mimosas, actually the Cranberry Mimosa! I like to say that it is filtering my kidneys while the champagne passes through it. ;) They do serve a regular OJ Mimosa so you can always ask what juices they have for the day to make your Mimosa.\n\n\nFor tourists or locals, this is a great breakfast find! I just might see you there. Just look for the  table with the Cranberry Mimosa!
