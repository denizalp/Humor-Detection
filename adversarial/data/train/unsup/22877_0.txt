This location is underfunded and drab, but the service I get here is amazing. It's the only doctor I have and they're always available to meet and provide a full service exam and provide great advice.\n\nNever had any problems with scheduling.\n\nTo others who had bad reviews criticizing them - how about you volunteer with me to make a difference for women in NC? :) Just let me know and I'll steer you in the right direction!
