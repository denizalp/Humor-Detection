Best wings I have had! My daughter says she has had better wings once in New York but for Arizona, this is the best. Great place with all  the sports games on and good service. We started with the loaded fries. .They may be better than the wings! They have wing sauce, cheese, bacon and ranch on them and they are yummy. Wings we have now tried a few different kinds from their 50 or so sauces and rubs. My favorite so far is the parmesan. We get medium and it is perfect. Not to hot but a good kick. We have tried the blue cheese and the chipotle and they have all been really good. \n\nThey do have RC for their beverages which is interesting! Hadn't had RC in years! Wish there was one on my side of town but when we venture up to the Surprise area, this is the only place we will be eating!
