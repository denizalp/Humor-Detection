I've been to this location a few times already, usually either with friends or co-workers.  Every time I been here, the experience been good.  Never a bad moment then again never a fabulous one either.\n\nThey have always been quite neat, and the bathroom is always kept clean.  The restaurant always had appropriate lighting and the service has always been fast and prompt and the waitresses has always been friendly.  The food is good, not great, but not bad either... \n\nOverall a nice place with great service.  I do see myself coming back to this location, not alone though, that be quite awkward!
