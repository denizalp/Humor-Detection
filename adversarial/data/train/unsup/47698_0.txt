Every month on my bill I get a raise when I'm told I'm not.  I was told by another associate last time my bill will be $152 and would stay that way until new April of 2019.  I got a raise to $176  they said I didn't call in on time to save the $20.  I call in every month because they have raising my bill do to the fact their prices get raised by channels and the customers should pay the raise even if they haven't agreed to.  The lady I talked to today had to switch me to an annoying guy guy named John He said his employee number way 3150 from El Paso Tx  Is their some kind of utility agency that monitors this unethical behavior in the san Diego area?
