Well, all the other kids are reviewing it today.....\n\nI met Gabi K. for lunch here yesterday and it was quite nice.  I definitely got the feeling that it was a great spot for a girly lunch.  The menu is rather extensive and I suggest studying it before you order because I definitely missed a whole section of it.  They have all your standard choices you find at a lunch place.  One thing I wish they did have was the ability to make a half sandwich\/soup\/salad combo of your choice.  (You can choose the sandwich but the other parts of the combo have to come from a predetermined list)   There are lots of desserts in cases too which looked ok but not appetizing enough for me to order them.\n\nThere is plenty of seating and we chose to sit outside as it was a beautiful day.  (Aren't they all beautiful here?!)  We were definitely the youngest people there by a good 40 years.  It was fine though, I'm just saying the Borgata is designed for the older set.  As in your grandparents.  But the old people are cute, I love seeing old couples hand in hand.  Its heartwarming.  \n\nBut I digress.  After a bit of a wait our lunches arrived and yes, Gabi's was drowned in a thick brown gravy like sauce.  My salad was covered in cheese.  There was definitely not a lack of meat or cheese in my salad (the Italian).....I thought it was interesting that my dressing was served on the side yet Gabi's dish was covered in sauce.  The dressing was actually pretty tasteless which was a little bit of a disappointment.  It also came with a mini muffin (very yummy) and saltines (strange).  \n\nI would definitely return for lunch and the breakfast options look great too.  Its a great choice for a relaxing quiet lunch.  (Unless the old people start to act up!)
