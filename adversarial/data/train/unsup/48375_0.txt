I was recommended to J Crimi by a lot of people, and let me just say I was happy they did. J Crimi is the definition of service. The whole staff and owner are very friendly, helpful, and will do anything to make purchasing glasses a smooth process. \n\nThey offer their customers drinks, professional opinions, with a smile! I absolutely love this place, and I will never purchase glasses from anywhere else. I was buying my first pair of reading glasses and decided to go to walmart at first, the prices they give you seemed fair, but before I decided to buy anything, I stopped at J Crimi. Not only was the service better but the prices were actually cheaper than walmart, which shocked me! \n\nI got lucky because I purchased my glasses before Christmas so they had the best sale ever! I would highly recommend this place to everyone I know because I'm that confident in them. By far the greatest place to go!
