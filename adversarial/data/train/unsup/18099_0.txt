This is an a-ok spot on the main drag of Boulder City. They have live music some nights, which is pleasant. The patio area is heated, which is also nice. It's on the small side. It has lots of local regulars. The staff weren't exactly friendly or attentive. The beer list is meh. The menu has several options, but all were eh. Edible, but not actually good. In sum, come for the vibe and live music - but avoid the food.
