Simply Delicious Pies is truly a delightful little Lee Road gem!\n\nI stopped in here with a friend yesterday just to take a look at what they offered. The first thing that hits you when you walk in the door is the smell. It is that magical sweet and fruity aroma that hits you like a nostalgia train, taking you back to weekends at grandma's. Even though I just had lunch, I was starting to become hungry all over again!\n\nAfter a few moments of indecisiveness in the face of all the tasty sounding options, ended up leaving with a darling 6\" pumpkin pie. It was perfect! It had a smooth texture in the filling. It was not too sweet, which I appreciated, and had a lovely balance of the earthy pumpkin flavor and the spices (a balance which a lot of pies surprisingly seem to lack!). The crust was lightly sweet and buttery.\n\nMy friend got a 6\" mushroom quiche which had a delicious cheesy filling and a buttery, savory crust.\n\nThere weren't a whole lot of pies out in her display case by the time we got there at about 1:00, but still a pretty good variety. However, you could choose to order a pie in advance in 6\", 8\", or 10\". I've got my eyes on the carmel apple for next time!
