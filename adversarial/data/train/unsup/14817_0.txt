Went in for bubble tea. I ordered a sub and my wife shopped in their pre-made stuff. I ordered a sub and my wife said no she was fine.. needless to say she took one bite and \"allowed\" me 2\" of my sub..(which was much bigger). Food good. Friendly staff and a nice selection of Asian foods. And bubble tea was good. Or so I was told by my son... yep got nothing. Lol. Will go back without them.
