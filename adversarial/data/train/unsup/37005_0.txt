My favorite gelato place! I feel bad because every time I go in there I have try a whole bunch of flavors. I always have such a hard time on deciding which flavor to get. Everything that I've tried is good. I still haven't tried the coffee yet but I look forward to it. This place is pretty much the only reason why I keep going back to Downtown Summerlin.... until Shake Shack opens up that is. Oh, and the staff is always helpful and welcoming
