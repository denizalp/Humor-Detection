Wow I cannot describe my disappointment with the follow up customer service of this store. \n\nMy husband and I bought a BBQ from here on Feb 20th and spent over $800. Within three weeks, one of our burners stopped working. There is clearly a problem with the propane getting delivered to this particular burner because it will not ignite now matter what you do. I have been calling BBQ's Galore for the past six days to try and get this fixed to no avail. \n\nOn Tuesday, I spoke with someone both at this location and the Chandler location and was told that someone from the scheduling department would be in contact with me to schedule a service call. Fast forward two days and I have still not heard anything from anyone until tonight when I received a very disappointing call from Matt the manager of the Chandler location. Matt was beyond rude and unhelpful. He informed me that no service call had been ordered and pretty much offered me no solution. I was told that to order a service call I have to go into the store in person to pre pay for it - funny this was never mentioned to me by the other THREE people I have spoken to regarding this problem.\n\nThe bottom line is I would like to get my less than a one month old barbecue fixed and apparently the store that I bought it from has absolutely no interest in assisting me do so - how is this acceptable customer service?
