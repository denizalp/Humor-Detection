I was EGGspecting this restaurant to EGGceed my EGGspectations but it did NOT. An EGGsample of the horrible service was when our waitress did not bring out all our food!! She did not EGGsemplify what you would want in a waitress and we found her to be rude and aloof. She EGGsibited horrible memory recall. She did not display a SUNNY SIDE of disposition. We tried to EGGsclude her while we EGGsplained the problem to the manager, but the whole thing was SCRAMBLED and did not go OVER EASY. It was super EGGspensive and the most EGGscruciating experience of my life!! OMELETTE you draw your own conclusions on whether you want to visit this restaurant.
