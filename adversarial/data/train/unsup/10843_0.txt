When I decided to review the fountains of Bellagio, I thought my God what a cliche, it's like writing a review about the city of Las Vegas. But, as it turns out, this is the most reviewed and highest rated landmark in Las Vegas! I know, I can't say anything that hasn't been said already but the reason I decided to review this place is because of their music selection. It's like they know my favorite songs and tunes and know exactly what I'd like to hear at the moment. How do they do it??? \n\nI gravitate towards place. If it's up to me, I'll select a restaurant and a seat that has a direct view of the fountains. If I'm driving on the strip, I'll roll down the windows and lower my music just to hear the fountains. \nThat's all I have to say about that.
