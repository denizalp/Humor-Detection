So. Ive been here before. Steaks are second to none. Menu is great, service is great. But. And this is a BIG BUT. Be prepared  -  you are on a timer to eat. After dinner, for my mother-in-law's 60th birthday, and them kindly serving a chocolate mush with whipped cream and a sparkler for her (at my request, and free, for the record) I  asked for a dessert menu and a coffee. I was asked to wait a minute to see this that was ok. \"What?\" I know that's what you are thinking and is exactly what I was thinking. \n\nApparently there is an undisclosed policy that there is a 90 minute time limit for your meal. No idea if it scales based on your party size, but be sure to ask and avoid this place like the plague if you are intending on a cozy, relaxing meal. \n\nMaybe in the future they will put an egg timer on your table so you can pace your food inhalation properly.\n\nReally dissapointing when you are averaging 50-60 USD\/pp to eat a full course meal.
