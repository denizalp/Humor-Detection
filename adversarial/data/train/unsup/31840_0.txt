This is a nice, quiet, small location with a variety of sandwich and soup options. The veggie-head got a tomato basil soup and american grill cheese - I wasn't impressed by either. The soup tasted like it was store bought and plain; I could've made a better grill cheese sandwich at home. The carnivore got she-crab soup which had a very strong crab flavor but not much crab; overall the taste was good. We've decided to go back, try other items on the menu and give it another shot.
