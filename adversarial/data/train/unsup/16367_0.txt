I have mixed emotions about this place.  I walk past it EVERY day on the way to work and I eyeball the items in the windows.  If it's cute...I make a mental note....if I gasp...I'll walk in and usually will not purchase because they won't have my size.  grr.  I have to get a dress in a size large in everything so it won't look like a micro mini on my long legs. And Larges tend to fly off the shelves.  Lets face it....I'm not 20 anymore and I shouldn't be in a micro anything.  I'm all woman..hear me roar.  \n\nI think this location is a little bit \"hipper\" than the other location that is in the South Park area next to WS.  That location has some of the same pieces but I've been in there and the items would def appeal to the older crowd (40's) and then made mid 20s.  Today..... Uptown location made me proud. \n\nI had my eye on a Chevron Black and White LONG maxi skirt that was at another boutique in dilworth.  I called them and they sold out in about a week.  *tears* of sadness.  Oh WAIT...I thought to myself...I think Ivy & Leo had the same skirt....I'll check on Monday.\n\nWalked in today with a coworker and I couldn't find it on the rack.  *tears of sadness* I browse the sale rack as I morn in silence.  My coworker said \"is this it\".  A light from heaven shown down with all it's glory as she held up my beloved chevron black and white maxi skirt.  \"YES\"  and I snatched it.  Thank the good Lord it was a large.  I would have probably bought it anyway if it were a small and squeezed my thick'um thighs in it.  (Don't judge...you know you've done that before).   \n\nHere's where I get irritated.  I'm happy and I asked the sales girl to hold it for me as I need to go back and get my wallet.  I could have sworn she rolled her eyes in her head and I politely said that I would be back...no need to worry.  She just grabbed it and said \"Name?\"  wow....someone's got the Monday blues.  \n\nSo I went back and the OTHER nicer girl helped me.\n\nAnyway..that's my story.  Check it out.  It's a trendy little place and dangerous for me as it's on my way to work....blah.  I have a shopping problem.
