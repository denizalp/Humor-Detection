Like most others I was drawn to this place by good ole Guy Fieri.  They even have a large sign in their window that proudly states \"SEE US ON THE FOOD NETWORK.\"  \n\nWell Guy, you have failed me again.  My dad actually drove down from Tucson after seeing the same episode of DDD and we made a grand Father's Day event out of it.\n\nI have 2 words for you now, PAINFULLY AVERAGE.\n\nI would have rather gone to Old El Paso BBQ.  First of all they make you wait forever.  Our waitress set waitresses back 100's of years.  She was terrible.  She brought one plate out at a time.  She forgot appetizers.  I could go on but lets get to the food that has apparently won so many trophies.\n\nFirst things first.  It was cold, all of the meat was cold.  The brisket tasted and looked like dog food.  It just wasnt very good.  mashed potatoes were funky as hell and not in a good way.  Everything is drenched in sauce, everything.  Can good BBQ stand alone?  Yes.  Thee Pitts Again needs lotsa sauce.  Not one of us finished a plate.\n\nSo what the hell is Guy Fieri's problem.  Could he really believe this to be great food?  What about all the people stating its the best BBQ ever?\n\nIts a mystery to me.  But Thee Pitts Again really is the Pitts.
