Wow, what a place! We walked in and everything in my hungry body just said \"yaaaaasssssssssss!\"\nIt's everything I could want in a Vegas diner.\nIt's got the classic diner feel, but with the neon lights you'd expect from a rave or night club, but with a menu that everyone (including the hipster community) can love.\nI also really like the free photo they take of you. The mirrors everywhere add to the magical ambiance as well.\nDo yourself a favor and don't skip this because you think it might be weird. It is, but it's wonderful.
