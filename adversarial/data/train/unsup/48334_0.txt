When my boyfriend and I first started vaping we would only buy premium brands of juice online so it was hard when we wanted to find a local shop with good quality juice.  \n\nWe tried almost all of the shops in Vegas and were never impressed until we found this place\n\nAwesome flavors awesome quality and really great service!\n\nThey price match all merchandise with any shop in Vegas, if you can find it cheaper anywhere else they'll call the shop to verify their price and quote you the same price any other shop would, so you know you'll never get ripped off.  They also now have a rewards program, getting points for every purchase, last time we went in we got a free 15 ml bottle of any juice and also $5 off our entire purchase!! Pretty cool.\n\nCool little shop, they have cold bottled water for you for free while you're there, they have nice drip tips for each customer and each and every flavor is ready to go in a tank so you can try every flavor they offer super quick.  Don't like other shops that use shitty mods or drip tanks so you can't taste the full flavor of the juice you're sampling.\n\n\nThey also started a new locals only line, so in addition to the many flavors they have available, they've created 10 more flavors and put them into cheaper bottles and as long as you go into the store you can purchase them.... 15ml- $10, 30 ml- $15, 60ml- $20, 120 ml- $25, or 240 ml- $30.  Chose the nicotine level you vape at, Pg\/vg levels, and option to add menthol to any flavor as well.  So if you can find a flavor you really like you're gonna save a lot of money on juice.\n\nOur two favorites from the locals brand are the captain (captain crunch) and the love affair (red licorice flavor mmmmm so good)\n\nOff their original brand (more money than locals) my favorite was the fruit loop flavor and don't remember the name but the Apple custard one is yummy too\n\nFive stars for this shop! Won't go anywhere else :)
