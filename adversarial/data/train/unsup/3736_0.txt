Before I launch into this review, I should probably offer the following frame of reference: I have a fierce, crushing obsession with breakfast\/brunch at traditional American diner-type places, and The Peppermill met or exceeded pretty much every expectation that I have of this type of restaurant.  I will definitely be honest with my review, but if I ever come across as overly enthusiastic with the heart-eyes, that's why.\nFirst things first: If you go during high-time, expect a fairly substantial wait. We got there around 7:30am and were promptly seated, but when we left at 9:00am, there were people being told it would be an hour wait, so be prepared. \nProbably the first thing you will notice when you walk in is the d√©cor, and honestly, the ambiance was my absolute favorite part about this place! Trees all over the place, disco-ball pattern ceiling, stained glass, neon lights, fire pits in the lounge area, rainbow sugar in the sugar shakers (a favorite of mine), etc. This place is just plain groovy, like the true 70's definition of groovy. The attention to detail and dedication to the diner vibe is unmatched.\nFor breakfast, I ordered a decaf coffee (which I filled with rainbow sugar) and then pancakes with scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausage and my sister got caprese salad (this place has a lot of options). I thought the food was wonderful. 4 Stars. Not over-the-top incredible, but great and very diner-esque. Fluffy pancakes, whipped butter, and thick, crispy bacon.\nAs I sat in our 50's-style booth gazing around the restaurant with a tummy full of delicious breakfast, I vowed to come here for a meal every time I visit Vegas. And I recommend you do the same! Or, ya know, at least give it a try :) This place is special - it has all the glitz and glam and showmanship of Vegas, but with a vintage feel. One of a kind and just plain fun!
