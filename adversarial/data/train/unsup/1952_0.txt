You shouldn't be allowed to have this much fun. I mean, wow. Tents after tents with people offering you all the bourbon and whiskey and beer that you can stand. All of that is included in the entry fee and this year I decided to upgrade to a VIP ticket, which gets you earlier (12:00) and slightly more exclusive entry into the festival. Because after 2:00, it starts to get a bit crowded.\n\nIt wouldn't be fair to try to name the various spirits and beers that were on offer, because I know that I would miss some of them. It's a great opportunity to try a few things that you would otherwise never think of. Different whiskeys, double bourbons, odd and unusual beers. I had a strawberry beer (yeah, man card revoked) that was interesting as well as a coffee-flavored tequila. Completely out of my normal alcohol comfort zone.\n\nOh, and there's food. The food, sadly, isn't included in the \"all-inclusive\" price. Bummer, because I sure would have loved a nibble of this and a taste of that. Instead, it's lots of smoked and fried and sugared and sauced yumminess but unless you have a massive stomach, it's probably only one. So pick well. And if you have an issue with whole pigs on spits, you may want to skip it. I think it's a bit gross, but hey, that's just me.\n\nRecorded and live music from the bandshell is loud enough that you can hear it, but not so much that it drowns out a normal conversation as you decide which of these amazing vendors needs a second (or third) visit.\n\nTip: If you are not wobbly when you leave, you're not doing it right. Turn around and go back for more. And don't be an idiot - get someone else to drive!\n\nFantastic time, I strongly recommend!
