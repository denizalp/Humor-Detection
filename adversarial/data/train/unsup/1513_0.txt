This is the second location of Sushisamba I've been to, the 7th ave location in NY was my first, and it had been years since I went there.  Their Tuna tataki is great, and the El Topo is still one of the most unique rolls I've had at any sushi restaurant.  The price is surprisingly reasonable compared to some other aesthetically focused fusion sushi restaurants.  Just a great all around spot for casual food.  I'd never turn it down.
