Here is the deal, it  is not bad, it is not great, it is completely average. Like super average and needs a makeover. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch. Here is the pros and here are the cons. \n\nPro: A salsa carafe so you don't always ask for more.\nCon: Salsa is rather bland, didn't want more, chips were cold\n\nPro: They offer lunch specials\nCon: Very limited lunch specials and if you order off regular menu nothing includes rice and beans...so a meal ends up costing over 15 bucks for mediocre food\n\nPro: They have Mexican food (as they better)\nCon: Very average, underwhelming and little to be desired flavors \n\nPro: They have a bar\nCon: The bar resembles something from an Elk's Lodge (nothing wrong with Elk's Lodges, it's just this is a Mexican food establishment)\n\nPro: They have a staff\nCon: The staff is rather non-existent (busboy was the most help)\n\nProbably will never return. Needs a makeover, a menu revamp, a service training class, and then who knows???....
