Jose the bartender is great! Very funny, entertaining and accommodating. I love that this place is open late and has a very solid food selection. I recommend the ahi tuna, crispy gnocchi and flatbread. Everything else looks good as well. They have nice decor and a very chill relaxing vibe in the bar area. Good music!
