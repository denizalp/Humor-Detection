Metro Diner is the sort of place I've been looking for for a long while. When you don't want to go all the way into Uptown for Midnight, I can head here to Metro and be just as pleased with the food.\n\nI stopped in Sunday morning before the after-church rush started and had a comfy seat at the counter. Facing into the kitchen, I was able to watch the food being prepared, see how clean and organized it is, and watch the meals be finalized before being brought out to diners. Interesting!\n\nI stuck with simple stuff, the corned beef hash and poached eggs. They were *perfectly* poached and the hash was much more beef than potatoes. A nice large portion! Toast was done nicely and my meal was excellent. Great service, too.\n\nI'll be looking forward to my return to Metro.
