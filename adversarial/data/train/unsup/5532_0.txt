My touch's phone jack is shot. A design flaw. Luckily it's still under warranty. I booked an appointment via their web site. I guess they don't repair things there, just slip you a refurbished one. Alas a second gen refurbished touch was not in stock. I was told it would take 3 days. The \"genius\" (apparently a term not used sarcastically when referring to the a\/s jocks) gave me his card and told me to call.\n\nI called. Three times. Each time the line was busy.\n\nSo I booked another appointment via the web site and left instructions in the comments section that I couldn't get through to their phone line and if the replacement was not in Wednesday to call me.\n\nNo call. I made a second trip to the \"genius\" bar. And. No. Despite it being 5 days later, the touch was not in. They could not tell me when it would be in. I noted I called three times but the line was busy. The Manager had no explanation why the phone to the Apple store was busy. I noted left instructions in the comments to call if the unit was not in. They told me they don't read the comments. Ummm. Can I speak with the manager?\n\nHe was unhelpful and unwilling to let me walk out with a replacement they have on the retail shelf. He claimed they kinda sorta sometimes sorta read the comments but didn't read mine. So either their read none or just kinda sorta randomly read comments. \n\nOn the whole the comments field when you book an appointment is 100% useless. You may as well give instructions to your shoe.\n\nWell. I guess I have to make a third trip.
