I stopped in to Urban Beans on my way to work to treat myself to a local establishment's cup of joe (versus stopping at the brand new Starbucks a block away) and I'm glad I did. I ordered up a nonfat vanilla latte, iced and the gal that made it made it perfectly! The flavor is all there and the espresso--delish!\nI also ordered the farm egg sandwich. While it was good, I probably wouldn't order it again. The egg is mixed with peppers and spices to give it a kick but it wasn't my cup of tea. The sandwich was supposed to come with an English muffin but I actually think I was given a bagel. When you're trying to watch your carb intake, it was just too much bread. \nThis all said, I rate this joint 4 stars. coffee is 5 but the sandwich portion knocked it down one. I'll stop back in again for some coffee and after 10 visit, their loyalty program will give me 10% off!
