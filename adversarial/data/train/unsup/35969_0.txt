Had lunch here today..first time I've been here in a while. I had the cheese enchiladas, and chips and salsa. The \"hot\" salsa was actually pretty good, but its more of a \"medium\" than hot. The chips are good, not too salty, which is nice. I enjoyed my enchiladas, but it really is hard to screw up cheese enchiladas. I enjoyed the sauce as well. My coworkers were pretty satisfied with their dishes as well. I was a bad vegetarian though, as I didn't ask what was in the beans or rice...the beans definitely didn't taste like they were cooked in lard, but I will ask next time I am there. \n\nThe portion sizes were big, I didn't finish mine, and the price wasn't too bad...lunch for under $10. \n\nIt wasn't too crowded at lunch time, but the place is also pretty big.
