As a vegan in Cleveland, it makes me overjoyed to see new vegan businesses or even vegan friendly businesses springing up all around town. But I have to say I was pretty underwhelmed by the meal I shared with my mom and fiance on my birthday. \n\nWe all intentionally ordered different things. We split the cauliflower hummus which was possibly the best part of my meal. It had an interesting smoky flavor - probably from the paprika on top? I had the kale and Brussels sprout salad. Everything was finely shredded and it made my salad a little hard to eat. The lemon tahini dressing was pretty bland and didn't add anything to the salad, IMHO. My mom enjoyed her creamy potato leek soup but thought it was salty, and my fiance loved his cajun breakfast potatoes served with ranch, because what's not to love about potatoes with ranch? (the ranch is very solid for a vegan ranch - I bought some and took it home with me)\n\nMy sad salad was followed by the multigrain bake. If you're not a vegan and you think about what vegan food tastes like, this multigrain bake would be it - bland, dry, and not that great. I was really disappointed by it. So disappointed that my fiance traded me his beet burger. And the burger itself was ok. A little too crumbly for my liking, but it was alright. My mom's mushroom and kale omelette was definitely the best main dish that we tried, although it was pretty salty, too.\n\nI really hope I just went on an off day or that this iteration of the ever changing menu just isn't my thing, because I'd love for this business to be sustainable and I'd like other restaurateurs to see that a vegan business can be profitable in CLE. But for now? I'm in no hurry to rush back to Cleveland Vegan.
