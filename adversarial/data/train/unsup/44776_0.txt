We visited twice for the breakfast buffet and it exceeded our expectations. I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews. For a breakfast buffet, everything was fresh and tasty. The omelette station was quick and delicious.  Last year, we stayed and ate the breakfast at the wynn and felt there was no difference. The MGM buffet had everything from a full salad station with all fresh ingredients, fruit bar, full selection of desserts, full selection of eggs and egg dishes, several varieties of potatoes, taquitos,  nachos, meats, fried Twinkies, etc.  The price is right. Great food!
