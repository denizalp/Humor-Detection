What an amazing fun time... if you like adventure .. if you like ATVs ... this is a must to do in Arizona ..the tour guides are amazing , it's safe .. the trails are fun and you get to see the Arizona desert.  Not to mention ATV fun. I recommend this Stellar Adventure Tours to everyone visiting or lives in Arizona.. The tour lasted about 2 hours, and got to see a lot of the Arizona desert, while riding an ATV. They provide a helmet, goggles, they provide water and snacks .. the tour guides make it safe for you to enjoy every part of the tour.. I loved it and recommend it to anyone ..
