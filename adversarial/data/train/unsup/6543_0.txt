Stopped by during the final Browns game. I was disappointed that they don't have a Sunday liquor license. It was a forgettable experience. The menu offered basic low end bar food. It's the type of bar you would visit to sit undisturbed drowning your sorrows for getting laid off, and finding out your wife has been an escort for the last six years. \n\nI honestly only stopped in because of the name.
