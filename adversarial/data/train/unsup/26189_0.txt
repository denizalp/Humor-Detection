Got carry out - Brisket, Ribs, greens, slaw, beans, and a beef sandwich for ride home. (possible  - needed to half ass a towel \/bib  & it's worth it). Brisket was really good and the buns they give on side with the1# perfect for sammys. The ribs were excellent. felt like there were plenty of them for the $ and they nice and meaty. The flavor was really good - kind of sweet spicy bark from their seasoning and were done just right, not overcooked falling off the bone mushy more like the feel of a well cooked steak. Didn't think prices were out of line - essentially got 5 good meals with sides for under $15 each
