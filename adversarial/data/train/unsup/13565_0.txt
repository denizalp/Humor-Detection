How how how?? How can it get a 5 and 4 star. This really is such a run down place. As usual most of the products are expired. Please beware and check the expiry date on everything.\n\nThe vegetables look stale and rotten. Onions are the worst affected, not sure how can people eat that.\n\nUnfortunately this and another Indian store are the only ones around. So you dont have a choice. You are better off eating buffet or dining out at may indian restaurants on the strip.
