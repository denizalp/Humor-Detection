Since I love sushi, especially AYCE, my friend brought me here for lunch. Instantly, I noticed the ambiance. It's a really nice place compared to other sushi restaurants I've been to. Too bad the food sucks. Honesty. The sushi was really bad and it was missing something - I don't know what. There was no taste! The good thing, besides the ambiance, was the lunch hours. It goes until 4:30pm, which not many sushi places do. \n\nOk so, the real reason why it's a one star for me was because that same night I was rushed to the hospital with food poisoning. I don't know what specifically caused it, but I know for a fact (from a doctors perspective) that it was from the sushi. i've had sushi at SO many places and I've never had anything like this before. It left me sick for 3 days and it was just a horrible experience.\n\nI will never go there again. :(
