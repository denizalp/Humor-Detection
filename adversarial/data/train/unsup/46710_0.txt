Ok, This place is sweet. I mean really sweet there is chocolate every where and they take there desserts seriously. I like their croissants, considered by some the best in the city and they are pretty damn good. Make sure to eat on and for a second consider you are in Montr√©al - not France. Now for the rest of the sweets, what a great selection of options from desserts to more breaded goodness but almost half of the store is dedicated to their chocolate. No Fair-trade options, so I haven't tied anything, but there is sustainable chocolate options.
