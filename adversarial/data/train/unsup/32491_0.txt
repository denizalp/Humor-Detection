I was visiting South Mountain C.C. and on my way 2 the bus stop decided 2 stop in and grab a bite to eat. . .I ordered the two shrimp tacos combo. . .The reciept didnt show a drink listed with the combo so I didnt ask. . I paid nearly $9 . So I took the meal to go as I didn't wanna miss my bus.  .When I opened my food box. . .I ate the shrimp tacos, the shrimp looked a lil weird, almost purple-ish, but still tasted good. . the amount of rice given was like a lil spoon full, it was almost insulting. . . they didnt put the rice in a container like they did the beans, but it looked like the amount of rice given wouldnt have filled the same container. I will never visit Rubios again. I could get way more food for $9 at Panda or Subway.
