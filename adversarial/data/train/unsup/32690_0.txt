I spent 3 months searching throughout Charlotte for an apartment. There were a lot of great properties to choose from, but when i walked into Alpha Mill I knew I had found my home. I even went so far as to cancel my 2 other appointments scheduled for later that afternoon.\nWhen i walked in I was immediately greeted by Angie. She was warm, inviting and very enthusiastic about the property. Oh and had an infectious smile! She showed me the wide array of apartments from lofts with floor to ceiling windows and exposed brick, to modern recently built apartments. I eventually was sold on a reasonably priced 1 Bedroom fully equipped apartment with a great view of the Charlotte skyline. They offered a number of lease options that fit my budget. But the amenities are what pushed me over the edge. They have 2 well equipped gyms, three rooftop decks and a resort style pool. Plus dog owners will love the 2 dog parks. The grounds are immaculately maintained and the entire staff from management to maintenance are always available. \nAnd finally, The location is an easy 10 min walk to Uptown.\nI have not seen a property of this quality, in that price range that even comes close.
