Amazing food! There are vegan and vegetarian options here, the food is so good and the staff are friendly and kind. I love getting the spinach pasta salad with mozzarella cheese and tofu added. The drive to the restaurant isn't bad either and is pretty easy to find. I say everyone should try this place out.
