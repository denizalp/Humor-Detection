The worst place ever. I ordered 3 rolled tacos when I took a bite out of 1 of them I realized they were cold. I brought them back in and they reheated all 3 of them including the one I took a bite out of. That was the first and last time I'll go there. If the manager reads this it's the guy with the red and black cap on.
