I was so excited to find out my boyfriend sent me flowers... Until I got them. \n\nThe driver was rude and unwilling to answer any questions. The flowers were  ALREADY wilted\/burned on the edges, and did not last three days. \n\nThey claimed to attempt delivery that Wed., but the flowers were scheduled for Thursday. I made sure they had the right address, as my company is 24\/7, so there is always some one there, but no one had anything further to say about the attempted delivery. Not professional. \n\nIf you are going to order from here, I highly suggest to request freshly cut flowers - the bowl the flowers were placed in was clear, and I could see that the flowers were not cut same day or even day before. It is sad that flowers that another friend got me ($10) flowers from the grocery store and lasted two and a half weeks, yet my BF orders $80-$100 arrangement and died within three days.
