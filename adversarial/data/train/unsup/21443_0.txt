Why didn't they give themselves a proper English name?  They had the chance! Oh well.\n\nThis place has managed to maintain consistency in the preparation of all their dishes.  Since the restaurant has changed their location, I was a bit weary that it might've gone downhill.  It didn't. \n\nWe had four people eating a 3-4 person set meal with soup of the day, 6 lb. lobster, fish, veg, and black sesame dessert soup.  For just under $130 before tax and tip, it was well worth it.  \n\nThe restaurant is round, with tanks of giant lobsters, huge crabs, eels, etc., surrounding the dining room.  Kinda neat.\n\nI like the new menu set-up.  There are so many choices for 2, 3, 4, and up to 12 people.  Lobster lover?  They cook it in 4 different ways (Chinese style) your choice.  You want a variety of seafood?  You can get that too.  You can even wear plastic gloves to eat with your hands.  I guess it's a step up from eating with your bare hands.\n\nThis location has awkward parking, but what Asian mall in Scarborough doesn't?\nMake a reservation.
