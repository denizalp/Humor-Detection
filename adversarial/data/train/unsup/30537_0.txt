I like this place.... pretty new. Inside is very new and clean. The staff was nice. I really like the Neapolitan pizza. I did notice they sell wine and beer. My friends had the shawarma and they liked it. Only issues I had is the tend to forget my side orders, happened twice. I should check my order when I pick it up. Recommend you stop by and try it. \n\nWe ordered pick up 3 times and we have yet to receive the full or the correct order.
