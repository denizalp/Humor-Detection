Well they made everything right ... I called back to verify if there were more rooms\/floors for smoking ..Isabel at the front desk is who took my call regarding the wrong room preference.. she actually offered more than the second floor which was interesting because I was told there was only the second floor for smoking in the Paradise towers by David. She actually gave me options which included a suite in the HRH suites.. I told her to book me the room & I would wait for Stephanie to arrive at 11:00 to speak with her regarding the mistake .. Isabel said no problem .. I will book this room & will have Stephanie call you .. no more than 7 minutes later ..Isabel called back & said due to the inconvenience we will switch you to the suite at the same rate .. I told her thank You and she sent a bell man.. 10 minutes later Jeffery our bell man arrived & was GREAT.. he had a super sweet personality & good conversation .. NOW JEFF is a true definition of grand customer service. I must say .. Hard Rock Cafe redeemed themselves. I'll book here for Rehab come MAY 2017.. thanks Hard ROCK for making it right!!
