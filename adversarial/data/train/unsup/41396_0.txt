Bistro 19 is a quaint, upscale, modern\/classic setting.  Listed below is what we had and comments abut each one.\nMy husband and I split the Carpaccio appetizer = Fabulous.\nI had the beet salad = Fabulous\nI split the Sea Bass with my sister-in-law and it was the BEST Sea bass I have had.  I cook see bass frequently and never has it been this good.  I asked them and they generously shared how the prepared it.  They freely shared everything we asked about which is very nice!\nMy husband had the almond chicken served over risotto = Fabulous!\nService was excellent.  If you are in the area, this restaurant is a MUST!
