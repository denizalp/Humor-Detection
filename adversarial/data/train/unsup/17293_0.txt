In comparison to other LEGO stores, this one might seem a little small, but my husband and I unexpectedly came out with the $350 Bugatti Chiron. \n\nPick up your jaw. This is a collector's item. Lifelong learning. Keeps our brains alive. Just like puzzles, but he gets to teach me the parts of a car along the way so I can help him in real life with his classics even more.\n\nThe staff is really nice and helpful here.\n\nThis is a definite stop every time we are in Vegas as our toddlers love LEGO too now. Especially our older brainiac.\n\nTIPS\n- avid fans need to join the VIP loyalty program \n- if you spend an X amount of money (like $99 or more) you usually get a free set. We got a cool little Creative Storybook set.\n\n2018 Challenge #112
