It's just a little hole-in-the-wall but The Stand is a great place to go if you want a good burger, fries, and a Mexican Coke with real sugar.\n\nHowever, I'm only giving them three stars because of the fact that they no longer serve tacos at this location. I was a big fan of their tacos so I was disappointed to find that they are no longer available. Apparently they have decided to sell burgers on Indian School and tacos at their new location at Scottsdale and Shea. What, why don't you sell both items at both locations? They're both good, but neither one requires specialty equipment.\n\nThat being said, if you want a burger go here, but just don't expect to get tacos.
