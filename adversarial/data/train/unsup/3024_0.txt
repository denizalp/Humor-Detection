The owners of this bar need a serious reality check. This is a divey bar in Central Phoenix, not some swanky Scottsdale club. They took out the pool table and replaced it with a flat screen tv and couches that probably would do better in my mom's house...oh right, and the \"art\" they picked up at Big Lots (hung on the wall with caution tape around it hahahaha) is priceless.\n\nA few years back, my then girlfriend and I decided to hit up Z Girl for St. Patrick's day, as they were advertising no cover before 9pm.  We go there with at least an hour to spare, cool right? No, one of the owner's, Char, started going around the bar after 9pm hit and asked us for our $5 cover.  Excuse me? What part of \"no cover before 9pm\" did I not understand?  \n\nAlso, I was asked if I could play a gig here some time ago and I said sure.  Char's partner (her name escapes me) called and when I said hello she goes, \"uh...wait, um who am I calling again? Is this Jennifer?\" Um, ok really?! Can you please be sort of professional?  Anyway, we started chatting about the details of the gig, like how long I would play, what I charged and so on.  She calls me back and asks if I would be willing to charge less (I only asked for $100 bucks and was going to be bringing in a lot of people) and that they would be charging at the door...how does that make sense?  I said no, of course, and ended up not doing the show. \n\nAll in all, this place is a complete waste of time and money.  The dj plays crappy oldies\/disco...no thanks.  The only good thing I can say about this dump is that the bartender Machelle is always super nice and friendly and Fantasia and her queens make for a fun show on Friday night.
