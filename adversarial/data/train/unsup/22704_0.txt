This is the Beer Store closest to my house, so by default it has become my favourite location. They are open until 9:00pm most days and open until 10:00pm on the essential days, being Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\n\nThe people who work here are usually pretty young and energetic. I like this in a Beer Store. Sometimes when I buy alcohol I still feel like that little kid who looks down when being served by someone older. The people who work here are nice, chill, somewhat amusing and make me feel like I'm at a laidback location.\n\nThis Beer Store has two checkouts and the space itself is pretty large. It seems to be a \"high end\" location with no outdated signage and they even have automatic sliding doors. This location is also an LIC Pick-up so you can do bulk returns and other licensee services.\n\nPS... I love beer.
