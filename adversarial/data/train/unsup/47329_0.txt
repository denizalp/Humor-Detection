I run by Citadel every time I'm out for a jog... and I always think \"wow, that looks nice and quiet! I'll have to remember to check it out with my laptop sometime.\" And then, because of its location right by Eau Claire (facing the river), I forget about it. That is, until a meetup of working from home folk created Coffee and Keyboards and chose Citadel to work out of this week. \n\nParking in the area is like parking anywhere else, two hour time zones and ya gotta pay the man.. er, machine. The space is really nice... and still quiet! It's spacious with a lot of tables, a few plugins to choose from, a cozy looking fireplace in the middle and a decent looking lunch menu. They are also licensed if you're looking for a little after work spot.\n\nMy Americano was ok. Made first with the machine, and then hot water added from the large coffee pot machine... it wasn't as smooth as I've had other places. But the med was also under $3. I'm not sure what the sandwiches are like, but I'd stay away from the caesar salad. From $8, it really wasn't anything special. The free wifi was going strong though (password cafe2010).\n\nAll in all, a good spot to hide out in for the afternoon.
