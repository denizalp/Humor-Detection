I'm gonna say that I like this place. I was driving by and I saw this hole in the wall joint and I had to try it. This seems to be a Mexican restaurant that also specializes in creative burgers. They do serve breakfast items in the morning as well. \nToday I tried the Bulgogi Burger with egg and garlic parmesan fries for my side. I'm gonna bet that no Korean person will ever tell you that this actually tastes like Bulgogi, but nevertheless, it was different and I thought it tasted pretty good. The egg was a nice addition. The fries were a bit too salty for my liking but that could be just me. There are no fountain drinks here so you'll have to get your drinks by the can. Also, they give you nachos and salsa while you wait. After everything including tip, I spent about $16 here. Overall I was stuffed by the time I was finished and I thought it was a decent value for your money.\nFood came out fast and my server was very nice. He also told me that there is a secret\/variable menu that can only be seen on Instagram so I'm following them now. This place is a bit out of the way for me, but if I'm in the area I'll try it again for sure.
