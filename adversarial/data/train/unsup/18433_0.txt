I'm sure by now you can see how I love frozen yogurt.  When I found out that they opened a new frozen yogurt place by my house,  I was super excited.  This Zoyo store is very cool. They have a lot of favors that you can choose from and a lot of toppings too \n\nMy favorite favors are the red velvet, cookie & cream and the cheesecake.  You will have to come by and try Zoyo if you are in the downtown area. \n\nHappy Yelping.  :)
