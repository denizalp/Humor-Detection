***Southwest is a popular airline from LAX to Las Vegas so you will find lots of flights at reasonable prices, which makes Southwest both a convenient and reasonably priced airline for a Vegas trip (you can also check up to 2 bags for free); flight attendants on Southwest are friendlier than most major airlines and complimentary snacks are also provided; unfortunately, Southwest's baggage claim at McCarran International Airport was very slow***\n\nI am not sure what the parking situation is at Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport, but I imagine parking is expensive like other airports.
