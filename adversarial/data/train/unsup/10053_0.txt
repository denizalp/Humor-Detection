Ok, this store has a great selection of products.....however, the service here sucks, which is why I gave it 2 Stars.  I would have given it 1 Star but the selection of products bumped it up to 2 Stars.\n\nWas shopping with my son for a pair of shoes and had to ask for assistance.  There were 3 people working within 10 feet of us and none of them came up to ask us if we needed any help.  Meanwhile, my son was trying on shoe after shoe.....he tried over 10 pairs of shoes and still no help from anyone.\n\nWe finally found a pair he liked and went to pay for it.  It was about 30 minutes until closing and there was a line of about 20 people and 4 cashiers.  When we got to the front of the line, I could hear one of the cashiers say really loud to another....\"Damn, where the hell did all this customers come from?!  Don't they have better things to do?\".....now, she said this with contempt in her voice.  Clearly she wanted to go home right at closing, but with a store full of customers and a long line of PAYING customers, it was cutting into her free time.\n\nThat comment made me sick......in today's economy, she should be happy that they had a long line of people at the cash register!  Ungrateful.....she doesn't understand the value of a customer.\n\nBased on her comments & the lack of customer service from the 3 lazy people who was near us and didn't offer help.....I've determined that it's not a one-off situation, but a regular problem with this store.  Clearly they don't know how to service customers.\n\nI wish my son would have found something he wanted at the Adidas store....they were very friendly and helpful.\n\nWill I return?  ~with a frustrated voice~ Only because there aren't more options for Nike Outlet Stores.....just the one on the South End of the Strip, which is inconvenient for me.
