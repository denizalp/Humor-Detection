This just may be the cutest coffee shop in the Burgh!  It has great food offerings, a great atmosphere and most of all great coffee (or chai in my instance!).\n\nAs soon as you walk in you feel comfortable here.  There's ample room for you to sit down at a table with your laptop and a tea (which they serve in those cute little tea pots (!!!) and work.  Or you can choose to sit in a cushy rocking car and read.  It may be off the beaten path of Carson St., but I don't think it would work any other way.  \n\nSince I had never been in before, judging from only the outside, it looked like it would be incredibly tiny inside.  Not the case, at all!  It's huge!  There's one large room with the bar and some tables and cushy chairs, then another large room with mostly tables.  There's also a pretty decent size patio outside as well.  And the bathrooms, large and CLEAN!  Actually, it's all incredibly clean and well kept.  This proves the point that you don't need to be a \"perfect\" Starbucks, nor a down and dirty local coffee joint.  You can just be....adorable!  \n\nBut the best part, the drink offereings.  Intelligentsia to be more specific!  I love their Chai because it's a concentrate and not a gross powder.  Thank gawd!  They also have a full menu of espresso drinks and of course, coffee.  They offer a bunch of different snacks from various local vendors like scones, breads and sweets.  Just enough to grab for a snack while you're visiting.  \n\nI will most definitely make this a stop and chill point, a work spot or a meeting place.  Yay for my \"new\" adorable coffee shop!
