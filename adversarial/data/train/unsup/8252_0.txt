Stayed here on July 5-7th for our very first time in Vegas and first time ever staying at a Four Seasons Hotel. I've heard a lot about Vegas and there's nothing like staying at a Four Seasons in Vegas. I love everything about the hotel, except we had a longer time trying to find the front desk, we found the concierge and could not find the front desk until walking around for five minutes. Besides that, the strip view room is fantastic and guests definitely need to check out Verdana. They have buffets and they make donuts right in front of you! \nAlso, if you are staying at the Four Seasons Hotel, you have access to the Mandalay Bay pool as well. After staying here, I decided to start saving up to move to Vegas permanently, and will definitely come back to stay at Four Seasons Las Vegas again!
