I wish I could give it less stars. I went here because I was so sure I could get something that was gluten-free and dairy-free.\n\nIf you have food allergies, DO NOT GO HERE. They cannot tell you what is in their salad dressings. I tried to explain that I had food allergies in a very simple way, and was refused an ingredient list. She said they did not have one and she did not know what was in their \"homemade\" dressings. \n\nHomemade my ass.\n\nI left. I detest Applebee's but they were much more accommodating.
