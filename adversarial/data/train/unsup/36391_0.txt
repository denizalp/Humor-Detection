My husband and I love the Pop N Tea bar. We are always greeted with a friendly face ready to offer suggestions and tips for ordering the best tea or diamond bar. My husband is obsessed with their craft teas, his favorite is the Sun Devil Sweetea and the Phoenix Sunset. I am a huge fan of the diamond bars, I generally opt to make them \"delux\" which involves them being dipped in either white, dark, or milk chocolate (half or full), then adding toppings. My favorite combos are coconut diamond bar with coconut shavings, peanuts and half milk chocolate. The other one I enjoyed was pistachio, with pistachio topics and half milk chocolate. You really can't go wrong with any combination. I highly recommend you stop in for a refreshing drink or sweet treat.
