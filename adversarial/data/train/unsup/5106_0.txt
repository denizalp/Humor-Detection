Went here end of 2013 and will not be back.  Got the Poutine which is their signature item.  Its a Canadian classic, supposed to be cheese curds on fries with gravy.  This place used what tastes like Heinz canned beef gravy over fries with shredded mozzarella sprinkled on it.  Gross.  Too lazy to make homemade gravy and use real cheese curds?  Why even bother offering it then?  Thats like moving to Europe and opening a pizza joint and serving Totinos pizzas.  Got the meatball sandwich as well.  The meatballs were so tasteless and bland I couldn't believe my taste buds.  They taste premade and frozen.....and I say premade because I doubt anything that bland would actually be sold by a food distributor...so it has to be a homemade recipe but they taste like they have no Parmesean cheese or salt in them.....definitely no veal....just bland ground beef and bread crumbs.  We ordered some wings which  were okay but when we asked the waiter if we could get 1\/2 one flavor 1\/2 another he said \"well, you could....but it might piss off the cook, they dont like doing that\".  WTF?  I'm not trying to get my food spit in so....nevermind.  Got some sorta chocolate mousse dessert.  It ended up being chocolate pudding with chocolate chips in it.  Gross.  It was china buffet quality pudding....straight out of a giant refrigerated container.\n\nThis place is odd.  The building is like an old funereal home or something and the seating inside is weird.  Its almost like they must have something else going on to even exist.....like video poker or something in the back because I cant see how they stay in business with just the food.  Sorry =\/
