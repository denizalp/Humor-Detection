I guess I am the only one who is not impressed. \n\nAbout 40 years ago when my parents decided to torture us and move us to AZ our relatives took us here. Not much has changed. Not that it is a bad thing to remain the same. \n\nWe after going to see the Chihuly exhibit we decided to stop here for dinner. \n\nThe two women who greeted and served us were fine I guess. Timing when you put the order in to come out when salads are eaten would be nice, but what the hell. \n\nAntipasto Salad .........................................................Small $7.95 Large $10.95 \nArtichoke hearts, fresh Roma tomatoes, pepperoncinis, black and green olives, provolone cheese, Genoa salami, red and green bell peppers, radishes and cappicola. \n\nWe ordered the large for four people. This salad was a joke, three small artichokes were found, less than one full sheet of cheap cheese and salami were used and no Roma tomatoes. perhaps a half of a radish was sliced in to it and a bunch of lettuce all for $10.95 \n\nGus and I shared a medium: Red Devil Combo $17.70 \nPepperoni, chunky sausage, onions, mushrooms & green peppers \n\nThe taste was OK I guess even though the onion was the part I would throw away. But the crust was like shoe leather. I have all my teeth and could not bite through it and the knife too had one hell of a time cutting it . \n\nOur Friends ordered something else; what I do not know. \n\nThe prices here are much too high for the quality,
