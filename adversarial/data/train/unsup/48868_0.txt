This is a go-to if you're traveling to Vegas! Night or day it's always beautiful. It can sometimes be hard to find a good pot but you'll see it, it's a huge lake. There are sometimes people dressed in costumes asking to take a picture with them, but don't right after you take a picture they'll demand for money, you can easily ignore them. You can get views of the fountain show from the actual close up sidewalk, the Eiffel Tower restaurant, the High Roller, the parking garage of the Bellagio, some of the restaurants at the Bellagio, and the rooms from the Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, Paris, Planet Hollywood, Jockey Club, and Caesars Palace. Also since your at the Bellagio you should also walk inside and see the garden. The music the fountains dance to is pretty good! You have to go to the fountains to have the ultimate Vegas trip.
