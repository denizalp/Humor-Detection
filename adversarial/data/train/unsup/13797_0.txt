My BF calls me a hotel snob.  Can't blame someone for wanting to stay in a clean hotel room.  Since we knew we'd be in vegas for a wedding and the entire wedding party and guests were staying at Bally's we decided to do the same, for the sake of convenience.  I've never stayed at Bally's before so I had very low expectations.  Come on...I just came from The Hotel and Bellagio...\n\nThis is my rating and review:\n- 3 stars: Rooms were large, and you can tell they recently remodeled.  It was pretty clean but I didn't get the spacious bathrooms I'm used to having. (NOTE: this room only applies to the new tower.  I don't understand why they'd remodel one tower but not the other)  I guess we got lucky and got the free room upgrade \n- 2 stars:  ceilings are low and smoky, but it's an older casino so this is expected\n-4 stars: it's in the middle of the strip so it has easy access to everything you need.  Bellagio and Caesars are just across the way, and cabbing is not necessary so it saves you a ton of money. \n\nok, I agree with my bf...I am a hotel snob.
