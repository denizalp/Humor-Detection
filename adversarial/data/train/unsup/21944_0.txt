First timer! \nI went in for a dinner with my lover. I am a simple girl living in a simple world, so I decided to have a salad. My lover is a prime rib kind of guy, so he got the prime rib. I had a simple water, and my sweet love had chocolate milk, (PSA- they don't have regular chocolate milk, but we begged our server, Kendyl to demand chocolate milk, and she said, she will get it done)!\n\nThe salad tasted like a good salad. My dearest love told me to type this about his rib, \"cooked perfectly, very tender, excellent use of salt......the potatoes were okay\" \nThe atmosphere is very sporty, so I'm assuming this was a sports bar. \nThe food was unrivaled. \nOur server Kendel was sweet, (and although my love wanted Chicken Noodle Soup originally, Kendil talked him into trying the prime rib, and I was the one paying for it, so tbh I was a bit upset about that, so don't tell her, but I gave her less of a tip for talking my sweet love into getting that pricey steak!!!!)\n\nand the prices were on par with what I expected.\n\nThanks padre murphys people. it was fun. Will I be back? I don't know, I can't think into the future.
