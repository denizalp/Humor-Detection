Tried to purchase 2018 Season Tickets on a time plan.  No contract, casual pay, sounded great.  Then my job cut my hours.  Can't afford the tickets.  Made lots of calls (It's been almost 3 months).  Accounting lady (C) is a doll, but can't get anyone to respond.  D'backs are currently refusing to speak to me, can't contact anyone.  Received an e-mail from the SALES STAFF saying they would hold my money ($500!) until I found some way to spend it at the stadium (??)\n\nThey're simply stonewalling me now.  Refusing to discuss a refund for money they have no (contractual) right to keep.  \n\nSeason tickets are cool, if you can afford them, but DON'T MAKE TIME PAYMENTS!
