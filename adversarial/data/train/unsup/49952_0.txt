This place is pretty close to a five star rating, oh well heck - I just changed it to 5 stars.\n\nThe northwest needed a nonchain and nongaming restaurant like this.\n\nThe place is very roomy and open inside.  It has a welcome family feeling to the atmosphere here.  I have been there twice and the service has been good.  Also, they have specials everyday.  They had a special for the Rebel game, and in this town that has little support for the basketball program, this deserves a high five!\n\nThe garlic knots were really good.  The bread they bring out to the table tastes great too, I would buy a loaf to take home.\n\nThis time we ordered a spring street pizza with regular crust.  Meatballs, ricotta, red peppers, green peppers and topped with fresh basil.  The basil was a nice touch because the aroma gets the taste buds going right away.  The sauce is tasty - not too sweet but a nice fresh tomato taste.  The crust on their regular pizza is somewhat thin but still holds up well to the heap of toppings.  The crust had a nice crunch to it too.\n\nThey have a thick crust option and stuffed pizzas too.  The prices are reasonable especially if you consider one pie could fill up 3-4 regular eaters.  I was stuffed on 2 pieces.\n\nThis place just does what a restaurant is supposed to do: good service, they take pride in their food offerings, clean and welcoming atmosphere and fair prices.  It makes it obvious why some places are busy and some places close down...
