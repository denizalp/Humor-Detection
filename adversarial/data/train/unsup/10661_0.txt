So much hype around this place, and I get it, its a great Thai treat for Thai fans. I thought I liked Thai food cuz I love Chinese food and well, all Asian food is alike right?! I dont want any flack about that remark cuz all y'all asian restaurants serve spring\/egg rolls! I've eaten Thai rice at Peking Express (a block away from Sukho) and that rice was easily a 453 times better than this authentic Thai rice!  I just don't get it ppl, I eat and I eat and still, I just can't find a locale that gives a damn about MY taste buds... The rice was just OK (hence the 3 stars) and I sampled the Pad Thai and I can't tell you how big the sigh of relief was that I didn't order THAT. I know that everyone loves the Pad Thai, but I wouldn't care if the Dalai lama hyped this place up; I wouldnt go back. I could tell that all of their food has a similar flavour..    I did like the atmosphere, the whole family vibe was nice but I could not care for that rice if I tried.  The rice tasted like they boiled it with Mr Goudas soup base.  I'm conflicted cuz I don't wanna bash this place, but I don't wanna lie either...  It wasn't terrible, I personally just didn't like it so up it's! Oh!! AND the price did a number on my wallet!!  It was NOT cheap..
