Guys, this business worked a miracle with my drapes!  I had stored my drapes in a cardboard box in a basement for over a year and a half.  When I unpacked after my move, I realized the box with the drapes was in an area of the basement that must have flooded months earlier.  There was mold all over the box, and since my drapes weren't wrapped in plastic I was almost sure they were ruined.  They smelled horrible of mold and mildew.  I said a prayer, gave my drapes to MO'Wyz and in about a week they were given to me.  They restored them to the condition they were in before they were packed years ago!  Seriously, both my fiancee and I were in disbelief that they were once again usable.  We hung them this evening and could not be more pleased.  They have earned a loyal customer here!  Such an amazing and unexpected level of quality and customer service. This is a business that truly takes pride in their work and that is such a rarity.  Bravo Issac!!!
