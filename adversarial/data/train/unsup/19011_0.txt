The Little Foodie and me were finally up early enough to eat Breakfast!  \n\nWhen we arrived, I figured I would go with the tried and true breakfast classics, but I was told about the brand new Chicken & Waffles!  Seriously, the day I went I was told they were added to the menu...so how could I pass that up??\n\nWell I should have done that...passed them up.\n\nChicken and Waffles ($10). This was very disappointing! The waffle was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. There were only two pieces of what seemed like frozen chicken fingers, overcooked and bland. Pass! \n\nYes, I know they aren't a Soul Food kind of place, so my expectations weren't too high, but looking at all the other positive reviews, as well as all the personal recommendations (the reason I was there in the first place), I was underwhelmed.\n\nI'm sure I will be back to try the traditional breakfast items, and I foresee a much more positive visit than the last.
