This is solely a review of the casino.\n\nSimply: This is where dreams go to die. Last gasps of hope seep out of mouths with few teeth. The yellow tombstones chatter and clank against carcinogenic objects of choice, while gray eyes haze against the fading glitter of dilated irises. \n\nBodies are slumped against the adult video games. A day's work given to a machine promising a way out. The gorey glory of it all. The air is stale and I'm sure I've stepped in gum.\n\nThe longer I stay the more my throat burns. I don't know if it's the grape vapors being pumped in through the vents or the cigarettes. Either way I know it's seeping into my pores, and my clothes. At least I feel an ego boost in my casual garb. \n\nI plan my escape.\n\nWhen I finally make it back out to the parking garage, the mountains are high and the moon is low. This is my only favorable experience. \n\nI reek when I get home. \n\nI'm sure I've caught something.
