Hawaiian takeout, similar to L&L. Combo plates, teriyaki bowls, boba teas, and more are available on their large menu. I tried a combo plate with a side of poki for a takeout lunch. Plate size was large, with a generous portion of protein. I liked the flavors and appreciated that the teri sauce wasn't too sweet, but the chicken had an odd, thick skin I didn't care for and the $6.50 poki side was the size of a condiment cup. A friend raves about their roast pork so eventually I'll try more when craving ono eats in this area- props for picking a spot where they don't have much competition for this cuisine.
