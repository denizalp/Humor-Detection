Where do I start? The customer service here is phenomenal!!!\n\nI accidentally pulled my left side of the plastic bumper off on Thursday night. I called on Friday and Patrick told me to just bring my car over without an appointment. I told him I'm only free on Saturday's and he said no problem.\n\nWhen I got here I was quickly helped and lasted less than 20 minutes. Although, I didnt get my car \"correctly\" fixed because the part is unavailable, his team secured my bumper so I don't have an accident. How sweet!!!\n\nWhen I saw my car, I couldn't believe how good it looked without being properly fixed! (See pics).\n\nBonus to this place, the reception area is cleaned and has a very \"home feeling\". I am definitely coming back to get my car fixed soon!\n\nI highly reccomend checking them out. THANKS PATRICK!!!!
