Spectacular is the only word to describe this show. It is absolutely spectacular and this is coming from a girl who has seen many a Phantom of the Opera performance in a lifetime. I grew up going to this musical since it was housed in SF for many years. This show has some special affects that blow any other Phantom out of the water. I'm not going to go into details about the show itself because it lives up to the Phantom reputation that most people are already familiar with. The performers have flawless voices and the story-line is a classic. However, I will go into detail about how this differs from a Phantom show anywhere else. When I arrived and about to sit down, I was randomly upgraded by the usher to sit in some of the best seats in the house instead (row 10 orchestra) because the show wasn't full that night and they wanted the orchestra seats filled. Huge bonus! \n\nThis performance of Phantom is \"Vegas wow.\" Everything is bigger, brighter and bolder and it's done in record timing (for a Broadway musical) at only 90 minutes. It is Vegas after all so the normal three hour performance probably wouldn't sit well with those eager to gamble. \n\nLike I said, the dramatic affects will blow you away whether you are a fan of musicals or not. The balconies are lined with faux Opera goers, they have a full fireworks show on set, the sets themselves are works of art and the Phantom will appear when you least expect him. It was the perfect performance to wow me and entertain me in Vegas. The music was amazing and since it is Vegas, I'm happy it was only 1.5 hours. \n\nThis is a must if you are here and you won't be disappointed.
