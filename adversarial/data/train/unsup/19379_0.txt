Sometimes being a foodie makes you do crazy things.. such as driving ~600 miles from the culinary black hole that is the Inland Empire just to grab a meal and go back home. \n\nNeedless to say, having traveled purely for the purpose of eating, expectations were high for the 'Rising Sun' burger + those enticing shakes (drunken monkey).  I could see why so many praise the food but I've had much, much better elsewhere. \n\nBeing raised in SoCal, i LOVE me some avocado.. but is it necessary to fry it?! AS IF YOUR ARTERIES ARENT CRYING ALREADY. If at any point in my life I felt like I would overdose off of sodium\/ glucose content, it was during this sitting from that teriyaki glaze. The (virgin) Drunken Monkey was delicious, though. \n\nHad I opted for the alcoholic version of the shake, maybe I would've been happy enough to push it to a 4!
