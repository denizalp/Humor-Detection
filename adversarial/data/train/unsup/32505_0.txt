Today I went to the early baker and had the best french Macerons, croissants, and middle eastern food. My favorite dish is their eggplant dish. Omg to die for, ask for pita bread with it. You can get it with or without kabob. The owner makes custom cakes that look like they are too beautiful to eat. If you want to host private parties they are very affordable. I am hosting one there in June and can not wait to have more of their middle eastern food. Go there for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner. You will not be disappointed!!!!! Here is a picture of a cake there.
