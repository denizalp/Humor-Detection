We bought our Pomeranian puppy from Animart. While I think the price seemed higher than it could have been, the puppy came with all his  shots, dewormed, and \"fixed\". The staff was very friendly, and helpful. We even got $50 worth of supplies.\n\nI can't speak for the cat adoptions, but I had a pleasant experience there.\n\nOn a side note, I do recommend that you ALWAYS, check the humane society first before purchasing from a breeder or petstore.
