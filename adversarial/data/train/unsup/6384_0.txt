I needed my iPad repaired they made me schedule an appointment for two days later only to tell me they don't repair iPad screens all they can do is replace it if I had apple care but since I don't all they could do was offer me another iPad for $100 less than the actual price. Probably something I should have known before I left the store on Monday.
