I don't expect much from a place of this nature, however I have to admit I was a little happy to hear that breakfast became available 24hrs even if it is a limited menu.\nHOWEVER! It's completely asinine that breakfast now starts at 4AM !!!! Who is getting breakfast this early?! I mean, I get it but most people going here at 4am want greasy munchies to absorb all the alcohol they drank or ganja they smoked! Also it's quite amusing how the employee laughed at me for not ordering off the breakfast menu - if I hadn't just toked, it could've gotten ugly! Anyways the point is that f other places can do both breakfast & lunch like Jack n the Box - then McDonalds is PURE LAZINESS! I'm done with this garbage food- I didn't even want to eat there but it was open & close by. \nAfter learning how McD's exec's treated Burger King when asked to cooperate in a peace day burger, I never wanted to eat here again anyways. SCREW YOU McD!
