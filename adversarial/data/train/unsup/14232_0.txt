Two words: AZ BURRO. That is what you must get at D'lish! It is absolutely amazing and I honestly crave it on the regular. It is packed with smoked turkey, avocado, egg whites, potato, tomato, and feta in a sundried tomato wrap. It is huge, super filling and only $7! I promise that you will not be disappointed! It is great for any time of the day, not just breakfast! Another one of my favorite things about D'lish is that they have \"doggie bags\" for $1.50 which includes leftover natural turkey and basmati rice...the pooches LOVE it!!!!! And for $1.50, it is a lot of food! The line is sometimes very long, but don't get discouraged, it is worth the wait! You're welcome!! ;)
