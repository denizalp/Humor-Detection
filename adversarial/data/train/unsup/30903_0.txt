My buddy found this place while in Vegas so he said I had to try this place. They are a small Deli in located in the New York Hotel. They have sandwiches and lite food items. I ordered a corned beef on rye with chips and a New York style pickle. Priced about average this was a large sandwich and the corned beef was on spot. this sandwich was worth the price and I suggest you try one too.
