The Bellagio is a rated 5 stars by AAA, has been featured in numerous films, and has a reputation of excellence. Prior to staying here I envisioned that part of Bellagio's reputation would translate into something substantive. Unfortunately, nothing about the Bellagio is five stars. Management and front desk staff treated us like cattle. \n\nThe check in process was barely a step-up from the DMV. We were viewed as a nuisance and did not matter to management or the staff. After calling management several times due to issues with our check-in process and the room etc, we were ignored. Eventually I had enough and cut our stay short to 1 night instead of the 4 nights we originally booked. I was thrilled to leave the dated and over priced Bellagio.  Sorry Bellagio looks like the cattle decided to spend  money elsewhere. Not that you care.
