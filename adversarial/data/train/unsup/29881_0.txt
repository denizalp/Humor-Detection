Very clean.  The whole staff was very nice and accommodating.  We had a party of 21 and the waitress wasn't phased at all.  She gave us separate  checks, made sure everyone had what they wanted and gave us our check promptly.  She was a hard worker.  The cashier was also very nice and so was the other person who brought us our food.  Bathrooms were clean.  I'm giving a 4 star because the food was just ok.  We had the talapia and sirachi burger.   I should have taken pics. :(
