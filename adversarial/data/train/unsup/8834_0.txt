This place is pure magic. \n\nI have never actually eaten in the restaurant, I've always gotten my food to go and today was no different. I was in need of some bagel love in honor of National Bagel Day and the sadly the hot bagel spots are lacking in Henderson... on to Green Valley! \n\nI went with the, \"The Bomb\" bagel sandwich on an everything bagel and the layers of love never seemed to end on this heavenly sandwich. Get this... A three egg western omelet sitting atop a mountain of hash browns, bacon, and cheese fully surrounded by a massive everything bagel. This was a Viking sized breakfast that also became part of my lunch later in the day. \n\nThe bagels at Weiss are always warm, fluffy, and come with a light toast on them for that perfect crunch. The omelet was filled with flavor from both the ham and peppers, plus the added pile of hash brown was just the extra carb push I needed to get the day started off right. This is a solid tribute to the massive bagels of New York. \n\nThe weekend can get packed here so you're better off waiting until around noon or 1pm to cruise in for those weekend snack excursions.
