Merlot was a happy accident. I was out looking for a place to chow with my dad and ended up happening upon this nice little spot. The house made gerkins and pate are great, and the onion soup is in my top five... I was happy to find a French place cranking out decent fair within striking distance of my place... will certainly be back.
