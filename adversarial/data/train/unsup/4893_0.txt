After years of coming there today was my last time. The different between a good experience or a bad with this place is the guy behind the counter . If one of the young guys there- you're good. If the older , bold with glasses guy is there- go home. He will give you the feeling that his doing you a favor by doing his job, usually advices you to go with the most expensive \"solution\". Zero social skills, the opposite of good costumer service. He should definitely stay in the back room. I recommended this place to a friend that later on shared with me his frustration with this guy and I didn't believe, now I do!
