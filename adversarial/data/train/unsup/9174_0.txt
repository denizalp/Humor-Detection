I get my eyes checked every two years and this was my third time coming here in six years. The staff is great and the doctor is so friendly. They make me feel very welcome and I know I'm getting great vision care.  I called on Thursday to schedule an appointment and they were able to fit me in the next day which was great because I needed a new prescription. As long as I live in Las Vegas, I will continue to come here for my vision care.
