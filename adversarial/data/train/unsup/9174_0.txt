Good comfort food Mexican style!  Today l went for two Vegetarian Enchiladas stuffed with seasoned breading and corn and mashed potatoes with spinach and mushrooms.  I had them topped with their hottest red sauce which is super flavorful, and a cole slaw.  Service is quick and plates are steamy hot.  Ron had two cheese enchiladas also topped with their hot sauces. His cheese didnt melt all the way in the center so they reheated his food, and even gave him two free cookies.  We inhaled our lunch quickly and took Mr & Mrs Cookies home.  We'll be back!
