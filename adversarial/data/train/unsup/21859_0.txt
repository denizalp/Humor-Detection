As hotel guests of The Orleans we opted to use our $20 dining credit at this cafe. The portions were large but the positives pretty much stop there for me. My Philly Cheesesteak wasn't especially tasty. Our waitress seemed like she was really unhappy to be working and always seemed eager to rush away from our table even though the restaurant was less than half full. In my next visit to The Orleans hotel I won't be dining at the Courtyard Cafe. There are better dining options as well as a food court.
