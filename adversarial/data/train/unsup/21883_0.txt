Locals who have put in 20+ visits in its short history are better qualified to speak on this, so this will be a review based on one sandwich. But I'll get this out of the way: nice interior, nice TVs, better than average (for a bar) French onion soup.\n\nFor a late dinner, I had the \"Tri Tip Dip\" which is described as roasted tri-tip stuffed into a french roll served au jus.  Let's consider the lies.  First, it comes with some processed cheese not mentioned on the menu (correct me if I'm wrong). Next, this meat is clearly not roasted, but processed, tasting almost exactly like steak-umms. The meat itself contained some sizeable chunks of un-chewable gristle.  Tri-tip, even untrimmed, contains no gristle, so it had to be some other inferior cut.  Au jus means \"its own juices\", but this was certainly some sort of reconstituted powder (or worse) with very little beef taste to speak of.  But it did improve the sandwich.  Lastly, the roll has more in common with a hot dog bun than a baguette.  You don't get to call a roll \"French\" just because of its shape.\n\nThere was a distinct smell of skunk coming from one of the cars in the parking lot on our way out.  Must have been the chef.
