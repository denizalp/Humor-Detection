I would choose Buck & Rider over and over again as my favorite \" let's go out to eat\" spot in PHX. Complimentary valet to start, inviting and open space both within and outside. Oyster bar, outdoor bar, daily fresh catches and menu changing providing the freshest options to tantalize the tastebuds.  \nTheir desserts are fabulous too! Just try the lemon meringue pie! \nNever a miss when dining at Buck & Rider. Love it!
