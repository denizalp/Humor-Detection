A nice place for good comfort food. You won't have the most delicious Korean food you've ever had by any stretch, but the food is decently tasty, ambiance is very clean and modern, good amount of seating so it's fine for groups and families, and the soup options are hearty, comforting and delicious. \n\nLocated in the plaza directly beside\/south of the Newin Centre (southeast of Hurontario and Dundas), we visited on a Friday evening around 7:00 PM and it was quite busy! Full of families and couples, and there's lots of parking. There isn't as much variety to the menu compared to, say, Owl of Minerva, but there's a decent amount to choose from. We ordered: a) the Bulgogi Set Meal, which came with a good amount of soup, and a smaller portion of beef + white rice, and b) the Dumpling Soup, which was full of dumplings and rice cakes. We actually really enjoyed the soup that came with the Bulgogi Set Meal. The set was the perfect portion size, and the broth was spicy and flavourful. The Dumpling Soup was fine - the dumplings were the size of 2 golf balls, and they stuffed it with a lot of meat, but as Stephanie S. mentioned, the dumpling wrapper was really flimsy and the meat was spilling out. Broth flavour was tasty - not the best, but still good!\n\nOverall, a good place for a nice, casual meal - the soup options are great for these cold winter months! For two people, with tax and tip, we paid around $30.00.
