This is a very busy location. So be prepared to wait if you go on the weekends. I have been here before so I was a little confused as to why I had to wait for a table because when I was walking back to be seated I saw a ton of open tables and booths. \n\nAnyways back to the food. I am that weird girl who orders Salmon at a Italian Restaurant. This salmon is delicious though. It's a big piece and it's super juicy. Perfect portion for me. It's comes with broccoli but I did a substitution for something else. My plus 1 had the chicken Alfredo, which is always good. The salad was a little sloppy but for once it had enough salad dressing on it. Our server Joshua was very nice and works hard for us even though he was swamped with other tables and guests. \n\nIf you fill out their survey on the table kiosk the servers get brownie points from their manager if they were awesome.
