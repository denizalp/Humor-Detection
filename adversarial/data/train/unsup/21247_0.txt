So this place is out there... And looks kinda sketchy from the road... But the inside is very clean and Gary, the piercer, was professional and courteous. I stopped in on a whim to get my nose repierced. I had heard a radio advertisement for a special on piercings. I popped the address in to my GPS and followed it. When I first pulled up, I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't sketched out. I decided not to judge a book by its cover and walked in. Besides, I had just driven quite a distance from center city to get here. \n\nGary greeted me when I walked in and I was surprised to see a very clean, contemporary space inside. He asked me what I wanted done and I explained to him that I had already had my nose pierced but it had been years since I removed it. He took me back to the piercing chair and explained to me all the sterilization and sanitation procedures they have in place. He told me he opened this shop because he had gone to piercing studios with his daughter and he didn't like how they were dark and dingy. He wanted to open shop where he would be comfortable having his daughter go alone. \n\nHe washed up, put gloves on, and got to work. The whole process was over very quickly. I was in and out in less than 30 minutes. The piercing healed up nicely and I'm a happy camper!
