Pretty standard Mexican fast food. Super greasy, spicy, etc. \n\nI had the chile relleno, it was better than Filibertos but still kinda just meh. \n\nThe salsa bar looked like it could use a little more attention. There were no cucumbers and the red and green sauce were all mixed up.\n\nI liked the lettuce, pico mix up thing they had there. :)\n\nThere was some construction going on in the parking lot and some construction worker kinda yelled at us for parking in front of the restaurant... If they don't want people to park there they should probably put some cones up or something...\n\nI'll eat there again if I'm near.
