How it took me a year to go here I'll never know. Not as stuffy as Binkley's, the food is far more down-to-earth. We started with the pomegranate meatballs and kale salad, which were both excellent. We then had the duck and the bolognese. The duck was perfectly prepared, not gamy, and just melted in your mouth. The bolognese was one of the best bolognese dishes I've had in years. It was slightly zesty, with a delicious meat mixture that was spiced perfectly.\n\nDessert wasn't that impressive, we shared the chocolate puddin', and didn't finish it.. But I'd go back there in a heartbeat!\n\nIf you go, ask for Dylan. Great server!
