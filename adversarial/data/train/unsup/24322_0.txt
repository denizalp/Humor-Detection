I found Goodman's by accident, and I can't be happier about it.  \n\nIt's a dirty, crummy place run by an old Jewish guy (he's in his 90s) who opened up his first sandwich place in Brooklyn, New York.  \n\nGoodman's braises their own meat in house and stacks it high on their wonderful bread.  Lightweights should stick with the half sandwich options (it's plenty for me).  If you eat at Goodman's you'll experience the distinct pleasure of having the best corned beef sandwich you can find. \n\nThis is a diner with a lot of character, a long history, and great food.  You won't regret cracking open a can of pop, mowing on some fries, and indulging in one of the best sandwiches you'll ever have. \n\nA few tips -- Don't take a date there.  The place is a dirty diner.  Goodman's does not accept credit cards, so be sure to take cash.  Also, they don't have beer, but their cans of pop complement the corned beef nicely.
