This is pretty fun concept. Unlike most donut shop where you just pick a donut from those that are already made and placed under glass, Fractured Prune lets you pick the donut you want and then watch it being made. You can choose from the combinations they have or mix and match flavors and toppings to make your own. Write your order on a slip of paper and watch them go to work. You get to see them pour the batter, deep fry the donuts, and add the toppings that you selected.\n\nOnce you get your hot, fresh-out-of-the-oven, donut, sit down and enjoy it. We all enjoyed our selections and even split them up so we could try each others choices. Definitely a fun place to visit, although my waistband would regret going too often.\n\nFractured Prune, where it's only time to make the donuts when you're ready to eat the donuts!
