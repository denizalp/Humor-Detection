On the line waiting to check out behind 1 other person,  for about 5 min.   Now there is another line forming on the other end of the register  with about 5 people on it too.   What  does the cashier say,  she says can i help whos next.  Well everyone thinks there next.   Now the lady in front of me tells the cashier she was there first.  These people on other line think there next. I put my stuff down and went across the parking lot to walmart.  I learned my lesson.  Just go to stores with self check out.    1 cashier store is busy.  They need more help.  I will not be back.  Had the same experiance the last time i was here 2 years ago...   save yourself the trouble and go to walmart.
