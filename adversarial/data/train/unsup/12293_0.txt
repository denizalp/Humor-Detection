We found the building quite interesting looking.  It looked like a drive in diner.  I half hoped someone would roller skated to our car.  Just kidding.  \n\nWe only stopped by for ice cream in soda on a Saturday.  No, it was not on the menu.  Almost like a secret menu at Starbucks.  The code words were \"Root Beer Float\".  There you go - vanilla ice cream on root beer in a cold mug ($3.70 tax included).  The cashier was friendly and fast.  We didn't experience service issues.\n\nWhen done, be a boy scout and put the mug on the tray that is on top of the busing station.
