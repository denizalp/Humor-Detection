During my last visit at THEhotel, we opted to stop by here for our last brunch.  We finally found a place that had no wait and quick service.  Too bad it was our last day!     \nThe bacon, tomato and Brie cheese sandwich was awesome.  The tomato soup was a bit on the sour side, but still went well with the sandwich.  The pancakes were fluffy and the warm syrup added a nice touch.  \n\nI kinda like fries.  And what surprised me here were their TRUFFLE FRIES.  They rate up there with some of the best I've had.  Thin, crunchy on the outside, perfectly flavored, and plentiful....I would come back just for them.
