I just discovered this threading salon, and in general, I was really impressed! Having lived in Chicago for six years, I was anxious about finding a place in Champaign that offered threading (most places only offer waxing). Sure enough, it turns out this is the only official threading salon in the city (besides in the mall, which has really negative reviews)! The owner herself did my eyebrows and she had that magical touch...as in she managed to do the job quickly, thoroughly and with minimal pain. The best part is that it was only $6! \n\nShe's only been in town for a month, which is why she doesn't have her website up yet. I definitely plan on coming back (and not only cause I don't really have a choice)!
