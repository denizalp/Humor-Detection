Generous portions with even better taste,who wouldn't love!? It's been years since I been here but tonight I realized how much I missed it. I strictly remember always getting the tomato basil pasta and that's what I got tonight what a winner! This dinner comes with a soup or salad  and what feels like a pound of pasta.I also had a class of the moscato which was very good! From the moment we stepped in the door we were greeted right away! The man and woman greeting us were very friendly. Our waitress Tricia was spot on! Friendly, helpful and witty! At the end of the dinner Tricia brought us these homemade almond cookie treats, they were phenomenal! Thanks hoffstots and Tricia for a wonderful evening, we will be back!
