This place is legit! I just tried the wings here, and was extremely happy with them! To be honest, the flavour, size, and price was far better than All Star Wings. Homicide Honey Garlic is the best flavour! \n\nHere's a rundown of my favourite things to order at Toppings:\n\nMeat lovers pizza\nBeef bacon poutine\nChicken club sandwich with homicide sauce\nChicken wings \n\nEverything I've tried on the menu has been on point. This place is halal, but as someone who eats both halal, and non-halal, this place ranks right up there with one of my fav spots to eat.\n\nOwner is really helpful and courteous, and the staff in general are great to talk to and make recommendations. \n\nCome here, you won't regret it!
