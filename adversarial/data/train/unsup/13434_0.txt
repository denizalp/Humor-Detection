I will never go back here. I bought my drink and was playing games, like a normal person. The bouncer kept harassing me about wearing my hood! I felt so hurt and angry. Since when did it become a crime to wear a hood? If you don't want people to wear their hoods for whatever (probably super racist) reason, then turn up your heat! I was wearing my hood, because I was freezing. Also, approach paying customers a little more professionally. That was not okay. My advice to people thinking of going here? The service sucks, the drinks are expensive, and it's really cold.
