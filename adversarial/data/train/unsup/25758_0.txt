Had dinner here tonight. The hubby and I both got burgers and sat in the vault. We had reservations to sit in the vault, it was cool but the front door kept blowing in and it was chilly out, plus people are gawking at it while your trying to eat. Burgers were pretty good, prices decent. I think we will go back and I'll try the chicken sandwich.
