If I have the option to give negative stars, I would.\n\nI came in to look for a wedding dress for my sister who is currently oversea. I knew that the store was busy so I didn't bother to ask for help. I went straight to the Vera Wang section but didn't see any gowns so I asked the associate who was standing next to me for help. She was so annoyed and rude that she started kicking at the gowns and talked in a rude manner. I really do not understand why some people do not appreciate having a job in this economy. Seriously, if you hate this job so much then you should disappear from the store!
