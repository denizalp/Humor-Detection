This is a soul-less vortex of value that literally sucks the life out of me every time I go in, which, thankfully isn't often.\n\nI typically opt for Fry's across the street but will occasionally wander in here if I reserve a Redbox or need one or two quick items.  No question you'll find value pricing here, especially in the Health and Beauty section and especially compared to Walgreens on the corner.  Significant savings in this area.  The grocery prices are similar to Fry's although Fry's has a much larger assortment.  This store offers the basics your pantry needs.  You won't find any exotic or even semi-exotic ingredients here.\n\nThe perimeter of a store is my focus; produce, dairy, meat, deli.  All pretty sketchy here.  Mostly pre-packaged goods, produce is never impressive, limited assortment and at times unappealing.\n\nThe case lighting is motion activated in the back corner of the store in the freezer section.  It's dark and ominous as you head back there and then eerie fluorescent lighting from a cheap teen slasher movie comes on; very inviting indeed.\n\nIf you really want a trippy experience, go in between 1 am and 5 am when they're stocking the store which is open 24 hrs.  As a security precaution most of the entrances to the store are blocked off by carts and access is extremely limited and foreboding. \n\nI use this store more as a quick in & out convenience store when I need one or two basic items. The service is passable, if not friendly most of the time.  As a grocery store, you could do worse but not in this neighborhood.
