I have retained Mr. McFadden several times throughout the years regarding issues from car accidents to business disputes. He has always been very affordable, fair and provided me with excellent legal representation. He takes the time to explain things to me and I never feel like I am wasting his time. I would strongly recommend him to anyone.
