the plan was to eat cheap during our stay to have more money to gamble, so we got the $30 all day pass (and we had a 2 for 1 coupon). We totally enjoyed it... it's not the Rio or Bellagio buffet but it was still good. Prime rib was delish ...pizza was not... for breakfast omelet maker guy was awesome!
