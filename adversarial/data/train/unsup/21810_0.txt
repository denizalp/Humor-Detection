This market is literally around the corner from our house. I had driven by it a bunch of times when we first moved in but just thought it was yet another convenience\/liquor store until I read Kristin C's awesome review. I had no idea that that little place had so much history! I sent Kristin a compliment for her review and said that I was planning to stop by, but she wrote back saying that the place was under new ownership and that I might not find the market to be the same as when she went to it back in March of 2007. She was right. \n\nOn the way home the other night, we decided to stop to get some soda water and limes. We found it to be a fairly well-stocked market (they had limes but not soda water, although that seems to fairly common around here, since neither Fresh & Easy nor CVS carries it) with a good selection of wine and refrigerated goods (including tortillas). The woman working was extremely friendly and suggested a Mexican sparkling mineral water instead of the soda water they didn't carry. However, I didn't see all of the amazing homemade goods or antiques\/collectibles that Kristin described. These (along with the plans for dog treats and an adjoining restaurant) may have disappeared when the ownership changed. \n\nThat being said, this is still a great little neighborhood spot with tons of character and really friendly employees. Given how close it is to our house, I'm sure we'll be back all the time to pick up limes, beer\/wine, or other food items.
