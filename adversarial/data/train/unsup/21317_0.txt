During the last few months we've really grown to love Kool Cones.  We stop by pretty regularly, maybe too regularly!  Love those coupons!\n\nAll house-made soft serve and scoop\/hard flavors we've tried have been hits.  The red velvet cheesecake flavor is particularly special; it has so many huge chunks of cheesecake, and my photo doesn't do it justice.  Pistachio also awesome.\n\nService has been friendly and the employees knowledgeable, every time.  Recently I called to inquire about a family member's missing cell phone.  The gentleman who answered my call was more than helpful, searching the lost-and-found area in the building and the seating area outside while I waited on the line.  He even took down my number in case the phone turned up.  I appreciate that kind of extra effort.
