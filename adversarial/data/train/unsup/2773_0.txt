Hm I'm not sure why I'm reviewing the strip, but I guess it's because I CAN\nok so if you've never been to vegas before the strip is the main street where all the main hotels are, there are tons of restaurants and shops up and down the street, there is north strip and south strip, north has hotels like the venetian\/palazzo etc.. and south is more mgm, luxor, and four seasons\n\nit's usually hot as eff walking up and down the strip so be prepared for that, it's VERY packed and certain streets you can only cross by using a bridge so keep an eye out for that and don't get trapped and have to walk extra! \n\nif you've never been to vegas before it's definitely fun checking out and seeing what's around but there really isn't anything too exciting to be honest, lots of weirdos walking around too
