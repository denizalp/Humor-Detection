One of the nicer Burlington Coat Factory stores we have in town. Located off Stephanie in Henderson. It's large and kept relatively clean and organized which is key for me in a discount store. \n\nThe racks were plentiful and they had a decent amount of clothing, shoes and housewares at reasonable prices. The service was friendly when I requested help locating an item as well as at checkout. If I lived in the area I'd make this place a regular place on my shopping rotation.
