I've had breakfast here the last 2 days in a row for a work function (We were staying at The Graduate hotel). I ordered the minimum wage breakfast both days {eggs any style, bacon or sausage, potatoes, and toast}. It was good, not GREAT. It was pretty basic, but hey, I guess it suits its name! It definitely hit the spot and gave me fantastic brain power for a day full of meetings! \n\nThe potatoes were little small squares and I usually like extra crispy, hearty taters so they weren't the best that i've ever had. I also tasted a green smoothie and it was SUPER icy, they may need to invest in a new blender to get their smoothies the right consistency. \n\nI didn't get a chance to try their famous Bloody Mary but it definitely looks like it warrants 5 stars (...with a hamburger coming out of it and all!). I will be back to try that, for sure! The service was great and for a group of 14, quick!
