I hope more people find out this place is here because it's tucked away with other businesses. When I saw the sign after walking in that they had Boar's Head meats and cheeses I had a good feeling. There was a guy and girl working and they were both friendly. I ordered a hot pastrami sandwich and I am from Cali so it's generally the standard to just have meat, cheese, mustard and pickles on a pastrami sandwich but here they add a bit extra and I felt adventurous so I tried it \"their\" way. That meant of course the pastrami but it also meant 3 pepper cheese, pickles, peperoncinis, red onions and seasoning. I can't even believe all that worked as well as it did together but damn it really did. I enjoyed every bite of the sandwich and the size of it for just $7.99 and being quality meat and cheese is nice. The bread they have is sub rolls and it was very good too. My wife had a Italian sandwich and we both ended up tasting each others. We liked them both so much that we split the other halves of our sammies so we could enjoy both. They also sell Boar's Head mayo, oil, mustard, etc. After I ate I was full and satisfied. The only downside is that this location isn't on the side of town I live and that right now they are only open for 5 hours (10:30 am til 3:30 pm) a day mon - fri. I do work in the field so when I am over here I will stop by for lunch but i do hope at some point they open up on weekends.
