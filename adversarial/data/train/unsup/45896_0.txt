Great place for a business lunch, dinner with friends or martinis! I recently had a business lunch here and was very impressed with the speed and quality of the dishes. They are obviously cognizant of the fact that many people only have an hour for lunch so getting the food to the table in a reasonable tim for the patron to enjoy is key, kudos! I enjoyed the scallop lunch with sweet potato hash and can safely safe it was one of the top 3 scallop dishes I have ever had. It was the perfect size for lunch and the perfect blend of well seasoned and perfectly cooked scallop with a bit of sweetness from the sweet potato hash. My dining companion had the soup of the day and Caesar salad, and complimented them on the fact that the romaine pieces were cut into perfect bite size pieces not the gigantic pieces that some places cut them into. The service was expedient and friendly, we never felt rushed but knew that when we wanted the check we wouldn't be waiting 10 minutes to flag down the server. I highly recommend the martinis as well, sadly I didn't have the luxury or enjoying one during my business lunch though. They used to have a Lychee-tini during the summertime that was out of this world refreshing and tropical tasting. The Peanut Butter Cuptini is the most amazing dessert martini I've ever had and the Pina Colada-tini is tropical, sweet and creamy! I will say that often times the bar can become quite busy on a Friday or Saturday night so don't expect to find seating at the bar anytime after 10pm unless your lucky!
