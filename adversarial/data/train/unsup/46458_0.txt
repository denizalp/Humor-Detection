Though I have moved from Urbana, this is still my favorite place to get my tacos. BRING CASH unless you're ordering online. My go-to order are al pastor tacos (Mexican style), elotes, lots of green sauce. I'm not sure what it is about the horchata but I never feel so good after my meal if the horchata is involved. Some tips about ordering here: \nMexican vs. American style = Mexican is cilantro\/onions. American is lettuce and tomatoes. \nThey'll ask if you want salsa. There are two kinds: red and green salsa. The red is firey hot and green is slightly spicy but cooling. \nWait time is about 10 minutes. There's one picnic table to wait at otherwise you'll be standing around. \nPark in front of the blue building or behind the truck.
