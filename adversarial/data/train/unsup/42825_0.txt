We come to the University Area once a week due to my wife's classes at Charlotte Music School; unfortunately, I don't get to go to Fuse Buffet each time due to my waistline.  This is my second visit (which is a good thing) since there aren't many sushi buffets around town, and I do crave my sushi.  We have come an hour or two before it closes on Tuesdays, so it's never crowded, but I always feel like we don't get the best pieces of food at the end of the day, whether they've been sitting out or they don't want to put out fresher things despite kitchen closing at 9:30pm.\n\nHowever, I do like the options for the price of the 10.95 dinner.  They have a decent amount of sushi options (no sashimi), mongolian grill style, as well as the typical fare of  soups, honey chicken, spare ribs, wings, and the like.  I wish there were bigger pieces of fish in their sushi rolls, but I can't complain for the price.  Also, the desserts are standard but a little lacking.  Plus, no frozen yogurt at the end, only the unappetizing ice cream in a small cup with those little wood tongue depressor spoons.  There's probably better Chinese buffets out there, but this one has decent sushi that are more complex than basic rolls.
