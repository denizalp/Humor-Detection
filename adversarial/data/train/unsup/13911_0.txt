I have been to this theatre on several occasions but only once under the new name.  When this was the Aladdin Hotel, this theatre was the site of traveling Broadway shows and I saw some other shows there including a Mexican Independence Day concert with Placido Domingo.\n\nThe theatre is large and a part of it have been redone from the last time I was there years ago.  They have added runways so that Jennifer Lopez and B. Spears can come out closer to the audience but also to create high priced, pit seats for fans who are willing to spend the money.\n\nThis first time back with the name AXIS was to see Jennifer Lopez.  The theatre is good for a large show like hers.  My only complaint is that there is not enough of a drop between rows.  The person in front of me was not a tall woman but I looked at the back of her head for a good part of the show.
