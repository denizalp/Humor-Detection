This review is for the Loco Moco.\n\nIt was okay. The patty was a little too over cooked and I left eating less than half of it. The salad it came with was pretty yummy. I liked the dressing. It's really small inside but pretty busy so they must have some pretty good stuff. What I chose wasn't a winner so if I do go back I'll definitely try something different.
