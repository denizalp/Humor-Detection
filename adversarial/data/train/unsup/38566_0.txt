WOW, WOW, WOW!!!! Too bad you can't give 10 stars! This is a great place to get AUTHENTIC Italian food at a VERY REASONABLE price. Everything from salads and sandwiches to full meals. Real Italian creme sodas, deli, desserts, GROCERY STORE, you name it, they have it. We were visiting our daughter in Scottsdale. SO GLAD that she knew about DeFalco's. WOW, WOW, WOW!!! I had the eggplant Parmesan (it comes in two sizes, I should have gotten the small!) and my husband had their Italian sausage and peppers sandwich. My daughter had alfredo and her boyfriend had the meatball sub... all sandwiches come with your choice of homemade breads. The deli counter looked amazing and the smells... ahhhhhhhhhhhh! The first time we stopped, my husband and I shared the turtle cheesecake. The next time we were in the area we stopped specifically for their lemon cake... WOW! If you are in the old downtown Scottsdale area and you love Italian, YOU HAVE GOT TO STOP at DeFalco's!!!
