Shelby is a really responsive agent. Some agents say they are available at any time, but she really means it and her team has really good cooperation. \n\nI was really impressed with her knowledge of the Phoenix and Glendale areas, which is good because I wasn't sure where I wanted to buy. She has a good approach for making sure you think about all the parts of the transaction, including things like having good resale value and knowing what paperwork you need. I would use her again.
