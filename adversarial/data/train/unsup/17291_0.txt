Very disappointed in the service today. We found a hair in our food and they didn't seem to care. No discount no apology nothing. We as a family come here often and finding a hair in our breakfast was the most disgusting thing. None of the chefs wear hair nets to protect themselves. We will not be back to this restaurant again
