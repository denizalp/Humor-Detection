Last Cinco de Mayo wknd, I decided it was time to replace the factory tires that originally came on my '03 Highlander.  Yeah, I know.  Most people are more ahead of the game than I am on car maintenance but at least I got in there before I blew a tire...\n\nStaff get bonus points for friendly, customer service.  The guys in there helped me select practical options within my price range.  No pushy sales tactics to get me to buy something I didn't want or need.  My estimated wait time was a little over an hour despite the hoard of people in the shop on a Friday night.  \n\nThey accidentally 'recycled' the regular sized spare tire I recently placed on my front wheel axel instead of returning it to the trunk area--when the new tires were added.  After I explained the situation, they ordered a brand new regular sized tire for me--free of charge for their error.  AAA has also told me that if you purchase tires here they patch flats for free.\n\nThese guys rock.  You gotta go there next time you need tires.
