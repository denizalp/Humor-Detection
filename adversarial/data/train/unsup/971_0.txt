We came on a Monday night and got a small Chicago mix for 5.08\n\n- In Miracle Mile, next to Planet Hollywood \n- Chicago mix = Cheddar popcorn + Caramel Popcorn\n- Together is a perfect combination. But independently, way too flavorful. \n- Cheddar is salty and Caramel is sweet. \n- Make sure you bring your own water because you'll need it. $2 for just a Vitamin water! \n- Free Samples! \n- Funny bag. One side \"To Share\", the other side, \"Not to Share\"\n- After eating about 20 pieces of popcorn, it was enough to stop eating it. I felt like I needed to go to the dentist afterwards. \n- Good recommendation for novelty.
