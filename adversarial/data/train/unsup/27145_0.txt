They have a good selection of wines, but not a lot in a chilled section.  \n\nThe problem I've had with this place is the employees.  They are not helpful and are so slow at the checkout.  Also, seems they are always restocking and can't step aside to let customers through.   It is ridiculous.  They do have a good parking lot area.  \n\nI'll still go here because it's close to my house, just hope they can do some re-training with the staff.
