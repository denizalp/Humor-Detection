We ended up not eating here being 8 months pregnant I didn't want to wait in a bar with smoke everywhere.  A family came in behind us and they left as well.  You order in a small window inside this spot.  Even though the pizza looked amazing and reviews seemed great I am disappointed we couldn't enjoy this.\n\nThis place is very dark and had loud music as well. \n\nNot family friendly.
