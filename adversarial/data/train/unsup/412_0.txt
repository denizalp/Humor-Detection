Pretty good for Arizona Thai food. Had a few dishes to go. Food was fresh and tasty but just not as good as it is in other cities. This is a sister restaurant of there one in Central Phoenix. Friendly fast helpful service. I would give them 3.5 Stars I wonder when Yelp will wake up and realize there is more than complete Stars. Even when they put their reviews together you get half Stars so why not let us at least have that or even down to the quarter of a star. #wakeupyelp
