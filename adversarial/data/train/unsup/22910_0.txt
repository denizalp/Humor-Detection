In the last 3+ years, I've taken 3 trips to Cali and\/or Vegas.  One thing is for certain, a trip out west is not complete without a visit to In-N-Out Burger.  On my trip earlier this month, I was fortunate to have In-N-Out Burger twice, once in Los Angeles (at a wedding!) and once at this location just off the famed Las Vegas strip.\n\nGoing to In-N-Out is always an experience.  The restaurant sign is reminiscent of all the bright neon lights of the strip.  You pull into the parking lot and it's packed with cars, plus at least 5 taxi cabs too.  When you walk into the restaurant, there is a line to take your order, but it moves at a decent pace.  Above the counter is the menu.  It's pretty simple and minimalist.  The hubby and I ordered two Cheeseburgers at $2.45 each and an order of Fresh French Fries at $1.65.  Including tax our order came to $7.08.  Wow!  That's the cheapest, most affordable meal we had in our 4 days in Las Vegas.  My husband called me a cheap date!  But hey, when you have an In-N-Out craving, nothing else will suffice.\n\nThere is definitely an interesting crowd inside the restaurant, so we opted to take our food to go and brought it back to our hotel room to have with a bottle of red wine, classy I know.\n\nI really wish In-N-Out Burger would expand to the East Coast, but I'm also pretty sure this will never happen as all of their food is fresh and never frozen, so it cannot travel too far from their processing centers.\n\nI highly recommend stopping here on your next trip to Vegas!
