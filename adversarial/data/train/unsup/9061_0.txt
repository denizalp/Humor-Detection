Very good food I must say , but it's always slow every time i come , or maybe it's just the in between lunch and dinner hours that I come . I would usually come here with my cousins and we would always order : Chicken Saut√©, Thai Style Papaya Salad, Beef Jerky, and a side of soup (depends what I'm in the mood for that day ) for appetizers . Our main course to share : Country Style Pad Thai, Basil Fried Rice, Penang Curry, Or sometimes I would order the Duck Soup . The setting of the restaurant is nice for a small place . They have purple table cloths that makes it very fancy and wine glass for water. Service is not always great , just depends when the waitress feels like being nice or whatever , even on slow days. When she does come and check up on us, she doesn't really speak up so we would always say it's ok and we would always ask for water to be filled. I find it kinda weird for a waitress to wear sandals in the summer and boots in the winter , and not a regular pair of tennis shoes or shoes that would be appropriate for a server to wear . I guess it's a small family own restaurant or something that doesn't really care much about that , but that's just me, I like to pay attention to a lot of things and that's why I enjoy being a helper I guess !
