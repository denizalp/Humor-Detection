Sushi Burrito? Of course, it exists! I love the setup of this place as it reminds me faintly of a Chipotle-like fashion only with sushi, burritos and bowls! I've been to other sushi burrito places but this is the only place that I know of where it actually has a DIY option. \n\n1) You get to choose: bowl? Nachos? Burrito?\n2) Add your proteins!\n3) Add your toppings and sauce!\n\nThere's also some premade items on the menu for you to choose from as well. We got the twin dragon, which comes with shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, surimi crab, lettuce, crispy wonton strips, unagi sauce and sweet chipotle mayo. I opted for the DIY so I got salmon, yellowtail, chipotle mayo, baby spinach, cilantro, cucumbers, roasted corn and cream cheese. You can also mix and match different sauces if you like (without an extra charge!)\n\nOverall, both our burritos tasted really great. Prices are good too for what you pay for. I would definitely come here again! Credit cards accepted and there's plenty of parking.
