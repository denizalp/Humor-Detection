Food was good, but there are better executions of similar menu items at places like Echo & Rig.  Service was spotty.  Amazing waitress, but then when it got busy, she forgot about us as she had too many tables. So we waited over 30 minutes for a dessert we ordered before receiving our final round of sharing plates for our dinner! Manager came over to introduce himself and check in, but then when we needed him, even getting the check took way too long.  That said, Cleo's food was above average and prices were ok for the Strip.
