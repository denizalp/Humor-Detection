Not Just Noodles is the perfect example of \"you get what you pay for\".  The restaurant itself looks like a dingy dump, but the food and the price you pay makes you forget all that. The staff is really nice and the food comes out really quickly.  I recommend getting the hot and sour soup. They don't skimp on the tofu and bamboo shoots and it's the perfect amount of sour and spice. The set lunches are definitely the best deals so go between 11-4.
