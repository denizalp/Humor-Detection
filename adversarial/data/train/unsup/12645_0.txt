This is a nice little local spot. Friendly employees, and some good food. When looking for a lunch spot, I think it's important to find a place that is a locally owned small business. Pesto Prima is that place, and offers really tasty sandwiches and salads that are made to order.\n\nI cannot think of one reason to choose Subway or any chain, over a locally owned business like Pesto Prima. Instead of meat that has been sitting around for days at Subway, here you get artisan croissants, fresh meats and cheeses, and crisp garden veggies. \n\nNext time you want to treat your taste buds, check out Pesto Prima- you won't be disappointed.
