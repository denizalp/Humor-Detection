Not being a native of Charlotte I was kind of perplexed when my friend asked if I wanted to go to Common Market at around 10pm for a Friday night out. I suppose I was thinking what's so fun about going to a grocery\/deli at night? Well I was in for a surprise when I got there. The place is packed and parking was almost impossible, and it didn't help that people parked extremely close to me after I arrived making backing out of my parking spot a very tedious job.\n\nOnce inside you're greeted by music, friendly people and a huge selection of drinks. They have tons of beers here and it seems like a great hang out spot. However I'm allergic to beer so it wasn't really an option for me and since they don't really have much else to offer in the evenings I felt a bit out of place when I was pretty much the only person who didn't buy a beer.\n\nThe location is great during cool\/warm weather since it is close to a lot of other attractions of the Plaza Midwood area though. A variety of bars such as Snug Harbor, and Petra's along with restaurants such as the Diamond are in walking distance of where you park!\n\nNot really my type of scene but the sandwiches sound extremely delicious here so I'll have to stop by for lunch to try them out sometime.
