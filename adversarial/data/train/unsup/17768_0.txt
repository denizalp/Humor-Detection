Like the Arby's commercial (which I love), meeeeee likey.\n\nWhen I lived in CA, I frequented CJ quite a bit and never had a disappointing meal.  I think I'm secretly in love with the chocolate mother lode cake and disguise it by saying how much I enjoy the restaurant and think their food is great, yada, yada, yada.  \n\nI was happy to see this location in NV and decided to get my favorite salad, the California Citrus Salad, to go.  It's a great combination of greens, avocados, mandarin oranges, green onions, golden raisins, cranberries and candied walnuts.  Soooooooooo good!  \n\nWhile waiting for our orders, my co-worker and I decided to get a brownie to split.  It was big, of course, so it was like having one whole \"normal\" brownie.  Sad to say, this was the first disappointing thing I've had.  It wasn't as moist inside as I expected, not as chewy on the outside as I would have liked, and I now realize I don't care for nuts with my brownies.   Oh well.  It was chocolate, so there was no way I wasn't going to finish it.\n\nIf you haven't been to CJ, you're in for a treat.  Just save room for the chocolate mother lode cake!
