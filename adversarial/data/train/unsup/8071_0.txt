I've been to Nori twice and both times were impressed with the food and service. I enjoy the bright, green decor, staff is super friendly and we were even presented with $5 cards for a return visit. On one visit we had a couple specialty cocktails. I believe one was a strawberry mojito and it was quite delicious and not skimpy on the alcohol. \n\nI've had edemame (free with yelp check-in), philly rolls and shared another roll with a friend. Everything was tasty and at the perfect temperature. I will be back when I am in the area and have a sushi craving.
