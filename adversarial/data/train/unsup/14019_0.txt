When you just wanna watch the game in a loud, comfortable place, I can't say this location is going to disappoint. Clutch a giant beer, or one of their zipparitas , and leave in time for the REAL party to start. \n\nI mean, you could come here late at night to eat, but it's going to be dark, loud, and kinda boring. They've got a pool table and patio, but it's not enough to give this a real dive-bar feel that it's going for. \n\nThe drinks are fine. They're inexpensive, and have daily specials...any reasonable person could get plastered here for under $20, which is amazing. Zipparitas get the job done, but taste so strongly of alcohol, it's reminiscent of a mixed drink 19-year-old Taric would have made at a house party.\n\nThe food on both visits leaves much to be desired, as on both my visits it was made quite haphazardly...like a pizza with virtually all the toppings dumped on one side, or nachos with golf-ball sized chunks of unseasoned ground beef. Compared to the other location I've visited (Scottsdale), the kitchen doesn't even try.\n\nOverall, I'm not gonna complain if you drag me here, but please don't make me eat here, or make it THE destination. I've got better things to do.
