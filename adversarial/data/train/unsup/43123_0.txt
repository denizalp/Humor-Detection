I would like to add, this was the first dining experience in Vegas. After checking in -- a 4 hour flight -- we were super hungry. This was right downstairs and you could smell the delicious food outside. The ambiance to this place was great. The service was okay. We ordered a couple of dishes and they were all great. Overall, this was a fun and relaxing experience.
