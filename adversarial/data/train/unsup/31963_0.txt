I booked a flight and purchased the Trip Flex option.Two hours later I needed to exercise my paid right from the trip flex option and needed to cancel the flight. So, I called to cancel the flight I and asked for my refund.I explained i have purchased TripFlex-in the term and condition says i will receive my full refund  back,but the lady on the phone was extremely rude and refused to refund my money and said I am  getting a credit voucher.So, I asked to speak to a manager and she put me on hold. The same representative came back on the line and said, \"sorry I can't help you.\" I am really disappointed from your the customer service I received I was just asking for my full refund back, an option that I PAID for, NOT for a credit voucher. \n\nBeware Ripoff business
