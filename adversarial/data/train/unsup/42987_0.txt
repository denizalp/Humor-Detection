Incredible!!! Staff is consistently nice!! Food is always amazing!!! We always order the same thing...Chicken Fajitas! Being from Texas, we love fajitas. Juan's are the BEST!! We always ask for extra jalopeno and onion (they are delicious). The staff NEVER gives us attitude or acts annoyed. Sometimes we think of trying a different place but we can't seem to break away from Juan's. They have been consistently wonderful since they opened!!! Keep up the INCREDIBLE work!!!
