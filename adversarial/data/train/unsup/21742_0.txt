I don't write many reviews but I felt that I needed too so others don't get burned here.  They are very high pressure before the sale and then don't stand behind their product when there is a problem.  My wife purchased a case and holster for me before Christmas as a present.  When I went back they said it was more than 7 days.  Get real it is a Christmas present!  The problem that I had was that the silicone pealed back when removed from the holster.  I took it back and the gave me another holster and said to put the phone in upside down.  This did not help.  I went back saying that the silicone is obviously stretched and wanted it replaced. They said they couldn't do that and another would do the same thing. The one I tested there never did that.  He tried then to sell me one without the silicone for $30.00. He then said he would give it to me half price.  I said they need to refund the original case.  He asked what he was suppose to do with the returned case?  I said that his company should stand behind their products.  He then through the returned case in the trash and said just take the one he was trying to sell me.  No customer service at this place!
