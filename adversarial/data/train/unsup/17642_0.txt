The cheese pizza and garlic knots with marinara sauce is amazing! Why haven't I visited this place sooner! They have a pretty good selection of Italian dishes and would love to try them one day after I drop 15 pounds lol\n\nThey have lunch deals for 4.99 and Monday's they have the large pizza special for 9.99. \n\nIf you haven't tried them, what are you waiting for!
