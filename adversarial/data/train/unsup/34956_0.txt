I absolutely love this place. My wife is a huge fan of crepes and we found this place about a year ago. Since then we have been there six more times together and she has went with her mom and daughter a few additional times. She loves the strawberry\/banana crepe, but I have turned her more toward the savory. The Grand Prix is a definite winner with a great piece of pork belly. I also have ordered the Jamaican Jerk Pork multiple times. The latte is wonderful, and she loves the selection of tea. The restaurant used to be very crowded and it was difficult to find seating, but they have expanded and solved that as best as possible. There is also the option to sit outside. Two savory crepes, a latte, and tea will come in around $26, but it is well worth it.
