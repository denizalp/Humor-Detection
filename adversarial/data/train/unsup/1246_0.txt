Raffles is definitely not in the \"super-nommy-alicious\" category however, if you are staying at Mandalay Bay or The Hotel, it's in the \"super-convenient\" category. The service is just plain slow, getting seated is slow, getting your order taken is slow and getting your food is slow. Depending on when you go, you could end up with the nicest server you have ever met, or the worst person Vegas has to offer, I have never met an in-betweener here. \nThe seats are comfy though and the food is alright. They take part in restaurant.com, which I highly recommend getting if you are staying at Mandalay Bay because chances are, you will be coming here for at least one meal. I have had the lobster omelet, which was sadly bland, but very fresh. The BLT is actually the best thing on the menu, as far as I'm concerned. My daughter raved about their pancakes which were huge, two kids could easily share them. \nMy biggest complaint about Raffles is that you cannot put in a take out order unless you are sat at a table. So if there is an hour wait, you have to wait an hour and sit at a table to order milk. Yes....that happened.
