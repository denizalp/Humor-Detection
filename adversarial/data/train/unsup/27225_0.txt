Hotel\/Casino is beautiful and room was nice, but that's all. At check-in, the girl tried to up-sell us every room possible for an additional $150-250\/per night, for which she would \"waive the $100 early arrival fee\" (what!?).  We had already booked a suite for over $250\/night and when I told her it was our honeymoon she did not even say congrats or acknowledge it. We declined the upgrade and checked in hours later. The WIFI fee is $40 per night, and the WIFI is so bad that the hotel was sending contracted people in rooms (without advance warning) to confirm it didn't work properly.  I had to call the front desk to see if this intruder with an ipad was legit, since we hadn't even complained (despite the nonoperational $40\/night WIFI).  The toilet paper is the cheapest ever -- it shreds coming off the roll dispenser (and you can see through it).  The \"luxurious robes\" you can buy from your room for a mere $65 felt like old sandpaper (we're skinny people and the robes were too tight to close).  If you touch the mini bar, you will be charged for the item, regardless of whether you used it.  Want a massage?  $200-300\/person. This place is over-rated and over-priced.  We have stayed at many other places on the strip, and all were better.
