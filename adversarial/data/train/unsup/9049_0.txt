Came here the other night 15 minutes till close and the Walgreens employee was standing outside the store smoking a cigarette and not letting anyone in. when i showed her it was 15 minutes until close she said my iPhone was fast... interesting because 2 people came up after me and all our phones were the same time. Horrible representation of this popular store.
