Steel Cactus, yet another property from the ampd group, the company that's synonymous with plagiarizing other already established restaurant ideas and menus, has now copied The Gobblerito from Mad Mex. I'm waiting for the day when they announce $.99 Chalupas \"inspired\" from Taco Bell .\n\nThe actual burrito isn't bad. It's basically a thanksgiving dinner rolled up into a wrap, and I think the gravy is a cheesy turkey gravy that's smothered on top. Still, overall a better option than the mediocre menu options they try to pass along to us on a daily basis.\n\nStill, all things aside this company has never done anything that's impressed me or anything that's original, for that matter.
