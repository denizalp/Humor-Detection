After much too long away from Yelp, I'm so tickled to have PCG as my first review back! \n\nI LOVE this sister restaurant to Sierra Bonita. The atmosphere is dark and cozy with a SW flair. Always friendly servers who know Nico's family from way back...but I am certain they are this nice and prompt with everyone. \n\nI've been 3-4 times now and I can honestly say that the Pork Tenderloin with corn & goat cheese cakes was THE best pork dish I have ever had. It was AMAZING! We went once just for appetizers and they were all so darn good. The Brie dish in particular was divine. \n\nFor a special night out or just drinks in the bar (hopefully Frank is working when you go), you will not be disappointed!
