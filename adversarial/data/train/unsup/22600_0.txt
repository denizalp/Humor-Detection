Yelps 365 Review Challenge 2014 - Los Angeles #24 - #365\n\nIf you want to experience French cuisine in a romantic or casual setting, than, \"Mon Ami Gabi\" is the perfect choice for you. This restaurant is located across from the Eiffel Tower ride in the casino and along the Vegas Strip where you can watch the Bellagio fountains from the outdoor patio. Everything here was exquisite, from the staff, restaurant decor and of course the French FOOD!\n\nI came here on a variety of occasions; wedding receptions, birthdays, family and friends. Every time I dine at Mon Ami Gabi, it always works out to perfection and it's hard to fault on anything except for the wait, but that's minor. \n\nSome of the items I've ordered in Mon Ami Gabi:\n\n+Oysters  Du Jour - $15.95\n+Wild Escargots De Bourgogne - $13.95\n+Onion Soup Au Gratin - $9.95\n+Caesar Salad - $11.95\n+Filet Mignon - $35.95\n+Au Poivre Burger - $13.95\n\nEverything here was delicious and the service was 5 stars all the way. If any of my friends of family were visiting Las Vegas for the first time, than Mon Ami Gabi would be on my, \"Must Do List!\" Especially the patio seating because it offers some of the best views of the center strip and it can be hard to get a table there. \n\nTip: Book a table in advance!\n\nBon Appetite!!
