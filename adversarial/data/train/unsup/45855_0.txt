We went here on a Tuesday night on a warm winter night and the place was packed! It was very unexpected and we had to wait for about 20 minutes. We've been to Demetre's many times before, but did not expect it to be so busy on a weeknight.\n\nWe got seated by who I believe was the manager. Unfortunately, he did not keep track of who was in line and they gave our table away to customers who came after us (they were a party of 3 and we were just 2 but we still got a big table).\n\nThe waffle was great and done in a very timely manner even though the restaurant was very busy. Once our waffle was finished, I asked for the bill and the manager told us the that our meal was on the house because we were kind enough to wait so long! He was a very nice individual and would go back for that reason alone.
