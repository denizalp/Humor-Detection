Been here, was watched intensively by the chefs and staff, not sure what they were staring at. Mayb they didn't like my Jeans, or T shirt, or food choices, who knows, idc, But reading several other reviews seems that must be \"just how they do things\".. Eventually it will effect their revenue and people will stop patronizing the business if they continue to treat people in this manner. It's unfortunate that they have acted this way towards quite a few people, myself included. Have to co-sign in the disdain of considering a return trip...  Nope, too many other choices, I'm out........
