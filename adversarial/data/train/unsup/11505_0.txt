Great food and service.\nMy husband and I ate a late Sunday lunch here because he was craving meatball sliders.haha The service was great, Garret was our waiter and he was very attentive. We ordered the calamari, a small pepperoni pizza, and the meatball sliders. The atmosphere is very lead back and casual. It's a great place to go for groups and families.
