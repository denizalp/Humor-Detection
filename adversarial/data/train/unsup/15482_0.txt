This is an overpriced tourist trap filled with chain everything... the only thing that i liked about this place was that it was attached to jobing.com arena, cardinal stadium and they had outdoor entertainment (performers)... Ohhh and the cremation advertisement was pretty funny as well.\n\nIf you want to go to a game here parking is partially free during games. However in some areas it is $25 or more!!! yeah I was totally surprised by this... So if you show up early, its free, if you dont you pay! This mall is multiple stories of restaurants, shops, a theater, and who knows what all else. \n\nPro Tip: Avoid this place unless you are going to a game here...\n\nThis place is also good for one last thing, people watching. I was laughing pretty hard as a couple of girls wearing lingerie and fishnets strolled by on their way to a bar. What was super funny was they were not the type of ladies you would want to see wearing lingerie and fishnets out and about in public. Perhaps this is the only city around where this is not out of the norm and no one, I repeat no one did a double take.\n\nSeriously Phoenix and its surrounds are super unique and have some very humerus moments to say the least. So keep your eyes peeled if you come here and if not, count yourself pretty dayem smart... The restaurant I went to here really sucked as well...
