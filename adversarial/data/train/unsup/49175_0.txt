The quality of service here is absolutely fantastic.  I brought in my '06 Audi after banging up a rear wheel quite badly (a power-slide gone awry...), and they gave her excellent care.  They were quick to hop on the problem, good at interacting with my insurance (who had no complaints about Car-X trying to do any unnecessary work), and kept me up to date as the problem(s) got solved and parts came in.\n\nAfter a few things weren't quite perfect (just a natural occurrence for the number of things that went wrong), they bent over backwards to accommodate me.  They've made a lifetime customer out of me.
