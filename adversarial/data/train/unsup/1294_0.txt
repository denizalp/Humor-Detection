I will, on occasion, eat like I really don't give a crap about my diet. On those days, I think about this place. It's my go-to place for chocolate truffles whenever I go to Fremont Street. If you need a chocolate fix, go inside the Golden Nugget and look for a tiny shop right across from Vic & Anthony's Steak House. They have cupcakes, gelato, macaroons, and other types of chocolate candies. After spending the day on Fremont Street, I usually pick up a couple of travel companions - a White Russian, and a Tiramisu Truffle. That makes the ride home much more pleasant!
