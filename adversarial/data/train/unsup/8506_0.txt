I've gotta go with Lydia J on this one! \nChipotle has long served as my quick and easy (and mildly good for you) destination mid-day and I've been to some terrible ones. I mean rough. BUT, this location has it going on. It was packed PACKED when I was there, and the staff seamlessly worked through the line, it was unreal to watch. I think I was there for 3 minutes before I was back in my car. The store itself is super clean, meats and salsa looked great (not always the case at the location on State) and everyone working had a friendly smile. I think my favorite part of the experience was when one guy said, \"alright guys, we rocked it... 15 more minutes till things slow, keep up the great work.\" Heart him. And the fact that for fast food this location has found a way to make the experience personal.
