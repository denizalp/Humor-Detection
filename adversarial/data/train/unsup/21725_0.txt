Was super excited go try Bobs as I just moved to the area and was happy to have a cute diner! My fiance and I stopped in around 1230 for a late breakfast. It was not crowded at all with many empty tables, which typically means fast service! We were sat at our table and waited 10+ minutes and still no one came. There was a waitress cleaning tables in area and a hostess who sat more people behind us. Still no one came. So we left. We shouldn't have to call a waiter over or have to tell someone to service us. We won't be back. Extremely disappointed!
