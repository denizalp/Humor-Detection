My husband and I were running late for a Megadeth concert at The Joint and needed food fast. Pizza Forte was really the only option that fit the bill on the premises of the Hard Rock. It's a small restaurant with a cramped layout and filled with all the carbs you could dream of. I went with a square Sicilian piece and my dude chose a caprese wrap. The tab came to the extremely reasonably price of $14  (considering it's inside a casino and all). \n\nThe staff warmed up my pizza in the oven, but when I received my pizza it just looked like a brick of old dried out pizza. It was mediocre in every sense of the word. My husband was happier with his wrap. Pizza Forte definitely wasn't our first choice, but it got the job done and didn't break the bank. Affordability and convenience are key here.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #63
