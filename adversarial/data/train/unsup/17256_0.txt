I just stayed at the new Palazzo for a work event. I must say their rooms are huge. Suite style of course! The rooms look exactly like The Venetian so if you ever stayed there, you won't be surprised with your room at the Palazzo. 3 flatscreen tvs, huge couch, separate living room, vanity, etc. My only complaint are the pillows. Although thick and fluffy, it's kinda small in width. I wish they had larger pillows for that size of a bed I had. Elevators were quick for me and I was on the 44th floor. \n\nThe service at this hotel is great too. Very overly helpful. Lots of shoppes and restaurants to choose from. Easily connects to The Venetian and The Wynn hotel.
