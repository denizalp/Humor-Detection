I don't think I'll ever ride Greyhound again. Their customer service stinks. The busses aren't very clean and they are never on schedule. \n\nI traveled from El Paso to Los Angeles and back. I was stuck in Phoenix for 4 hours because we were told there was no driver. I had my 7 month old daughter with me. It was not a good experience. \n\nOn the way back there was a rude man yelling and cussing on the phone at someone and the driver didn't ask him to quiet it down once. This happened from Phoenix all the way to El Paso. From 10PM until 5:30 AM! The profanity and yelling was too much to handle. On this trip back I also had my 4 year old son with me. Its not quite something we wanted to hear. \n\nNo thanks. I suppose I'll drive next time.
