After my perinatal visit I decided I was really hungry. I wasn't sure what I was craving, but I knew this side of town had a vast amount of restaurants that I had been wanting to try. I consulted with Yelp and settled on Thai food. \n\nThe restaurant was very spacious and clean and the host was welcoming. There was only one other table occupied as I came in at a weird \"limbo\" time of about 4pm. I ordered Thai coffee and Basil Noodles with seafood ($13.25) spicy level medium. I gotta say, pregnancy seems to have made me into a wuss when it comes to spicy food. Either that, or subconsciously I was not looking forward to the punishment that is severe heartburn. The portion was extremely generous, I would say enough for two people to share. I had them box up about half of it and had it for dinner little bit later. It may appear pricey to some, but it was an entree big enough to share. My total with tip was a little over $20..so not exactly cheap for one person, but as I said before, the portion and the quality justify the price. They did not skimp on the variety of seafood either. \n\nTheir menu has a tapas section with many appetizing options. I am only giving them a four star because I want to try more of their menu before I decide it is emergerd the best thai food eva!\n\nThere are enough items on their menu that I still want to try, so I will be back for sure.
