Well, we finally did it and now we are the proud owners of a 2010 Clear Sky Blue Metallic Insight.  Getting there was not the easiest process.  When we first came here, some friends had suggested we speak with Celeste.  That was certainly a great suggestion as she is very sweet, helpful, and quite possibly the most honest person I have ever met.  I really appreciated that.  As far as the stock goes for this place, it is one of the better ones and I noticed that they have lots of models in lots of different colors, so that is really nice for people who aren't sure what they want.  So after we chose our cars and set our appointment for 3:30 p.m we started the paperwork.  Now I understand that this is standard but my issue is with the irritating financial guy.  He took his sweet time doing everything, and despite Celeste telling him we were ready, he didn't do any preparation so we had to wait FOREVER for him!  It was really annoying, but thankfully I have a take charge husband who was sick of waiting.  Once we signed everything we met with Celeste one more time who was so nice in the way she was sharing our excitement over a new car.  Definitely a great place to get a car, but beware of the financial dude, he's really irritating.
