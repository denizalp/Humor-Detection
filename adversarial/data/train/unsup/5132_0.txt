I've experienced many different hookah lounges. You have the chill ones with the meditation type music. You get the trendier ones. Then you get whatever this is. It feels like this place has two owners. One that really wants a trendy hookah lounge with good live music and an owner who really wants a PTs. The motif never settles on either.\n\nThe place is very open and the hookah lounge area is very comfortable. The seating is nice and it is conducive for conversations until the music starts up. The constant annoyance in this place is that while the hookah lounge area is dark and cool, you have the bar area lit up with harsh florescent lighting. For some reason, the bar is lit up like if NDOT was adding lanes to the bar or something. Plus, the bar was enormous and looked better suited in a Coyote Ugly.\n\nThe staff, unfortunately, also fell into the PTs type category. You have these diner waitresses, older women with permanent scowls, scurrying about the place. They loathe their jobs. We wanted to eat but every waitress couldn't be bothered with taking our order. Even when we wanted to pay for our drinks, it was a hassle just getting them to stop. You know your waitress is horrible when they don't even want to take your money. \n\nThe dealbreaker for most people will be the music. I don't particularly care for music in a hookah lounge as I'm usually trying to talk to people. I will admit the singer and acoustic guitar player they had when we went were very good. The music was melodic but not overpowering. You could still have a conversation, it just took a little more effort. People who don't care for live music, avoid this place as live music apparently happens quite often.\n\nOr avoid this place altogether. The service is very off putting and really outweighs the benefits of the place.
