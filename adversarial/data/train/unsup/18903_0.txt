I'm pretty surprised I've never reviewed this Great Dane considering I've been here dozens and dozens of times over the years. As with many people, I fall in the camp that the Dane is a great place when you have a mix of interests and backgrounds and want to go out. Whether you're with hipsters, bros, parents, or coworkers, the Dane is going to satisfy everyone, if not actually downright please them. \n\nOn the food and drink side, there are plenty of options that mostly hover in the pub food genre, but there are enough unconventional options to keep it interesting. They brew their own beer so the selection is limited in some sense - Great Dane brews aren't at the top of my list, but I truly enjoy the Stone of Scotch Ale and ordered Crop Circle Wheat for years before that. Favorite food items include the James Madison Pub Picnic in the winter, the California Turkey Club, the Webster Street Chicken salad, and the Dane Burger. I almost always order the mashed potatoes as a side. While not everything I've sampled is spectacular, I've also never had a \"bad\" meal. \n\nThe thing we end up at this Dane the most for, though, is Big Buck Hunter. I have no interest in hunting and am in general not a video\/arcade gamer, but there's something my group has found addictively fun about this game. At the Dane there's plenty of room around the machine for us to play as a group, and they recently got Big Buck HD - I don't like it as much as Safari, but it's more challenging and the technology is more responsive. NERD NERD NERD. \n\nTL;DR - the Dane's got something for everyone.
