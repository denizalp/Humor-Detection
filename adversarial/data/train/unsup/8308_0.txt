Summary: the chicken, sauce, and yucca fries are delicious and worth the slightly higher price and somewhat average portion size.\n\nTop Must-Get: half chicken brasa with yucca fries\nTop Regret: french fries (and parking)\n\nLos Chicos was quite popular among locals in its first location by Markham Rd and 14th in the plaza across Costco - and with good reason: they served, in my opinion, the best rotisserie chicken in Markham. In its new location (right next to Congee Queen), they have the old menu and a new exclusive dine-in menu.\n\n*This review focuses mainly on the takeout side of things*\n*Tip: takeout is cheaper than dine-in!\n\nFOOD\nChicken: the dark meat is juicy, tender, well-flavoured, and borderline addicting. The Peruvian spices\/seasoning really hits the spot. Add in their Chico house sauces (comes with every chicken meal) and you've got yourself a winner. The white meat is not nearly as tender (naturally), but still good.\n\nHaving said that - the portions lend to the slightly smaller size, so I do recommend the half chicken at minimum (and I'd go with two sides to even begin to try to satisfy those with big appetites...) Having said THAT - this Peruvian taste does not come cheap: half chicken with ONE side goes for about $15+.\n\nSides: they offer a variety of sides - here's a breakdown.\n\nRice: yellow rice, standard fare, slightly small portion size. Tastes really good with the homemade sauce.\n\nFrench fries: seemed to be a little soggy, but I rarely order these, since they have...\n\nYucca fries: yucca is a root, and they deep fry those roots to crunchy perfection. Worth trying!\n\nThey also offer corn (no longer on the cob) and salads (below).\n\nSalads: Their potato salad is on point (4\/5), and their Caesar is solid too (3.5\/5). They also offer a Peruvian salad, which somewhat resembles a garden salad but with zucchini instead of cherry tomatoes.You can add chicken to any of the salads (totaling around $10) and that brings them to a 4.5\/5\n\nSandwiches: they taste pretty good! The meat is fairly juicy, and they pack some of their sauce into it, so that's always tasty. I'd recommend the half chicken meals over this in general though. (3\/5)\n\nSERVICE \nExpect friendly folks who are always smiling. Sometimes they get pretty busy, so expect at least 15-20 minutes to order. This is NOT fast food.\n\nTheir dine in menu is considerably different with many more options, including seafood and beef. You cannot ask for the dine in options as takeout, which is a bit unfortunate. \n\nYou don't come here for a cheap and quick meal with giant portions. This is the place for a really tasty meal to satisfy a rotisserie style chicken craving in a local, authentic Peruvian restaurant.\n\nUltimately, this is a 4.5\/5 for takeout, but closer to 4 for dine-in. Clearer instructions about the take out\/dine in separation would be great - we came here one night and it was full, so we tried to get some takeout... But the items we wanted were dine-in only. They make no exceptions, even for a regular like me. That was a little off-putting.
