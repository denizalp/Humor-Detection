Abysmal.\n\nI was really looking forward to a romantic dinner with my long-distance boyfriend, who visited all the way from Arizona. After hearing nothing but wonderful things about Le Papillon, their patio, as well as the newly-instated corkage program, we were excited to check it out.\n\nSuch a disappointment.\n\nWe arrived sans reservations and waited nearly 15 minutes to be seated while there were plenty of empty tables. Our server was friendly however we waited at least another 20 minutes before someone came by and offered to open\/pour our wine that we had brought in. We quickly placed our entree orders, as we were getting hungry: my boyfriend ordered steak frites and I ordered the mussels. \n\nNow I am not exaggerating when I say that we waited over an hour for our entrees to arrive. Our server explained to us that the dumbwaiter (food elevator) was broken, and that's why our meals were taking so long. \n\nI'm sorry but seriously? Nobody could carry two plates of food upstairs???\n\nOur food finally arrived to the table. My mussels were cold to the touch, they'd obviously been sitting around for a while. My boyfriend's steak was overdone. \n\nFrustrated and famished, we asked our server to take the food back and bring us the bill, which she did and kindly profusely apologized. Although they did not charge us for the entrees, we shockingly still had to pay the $15 corkage fee.\n\nWe essentially paid to sit hungry on a patio for an hour and drink our own bottle of wine. We could have easily done that at home - for free. \n\nThe real kicker of this whole saga was that the owner, Danielle Bigu√©, mingled and said hello to every single table on the patio that evening - except she conveniently avoided ours. She didn't even have the decency to approach us after the food was sent back or apologize.\n\nWe will not be returning.
