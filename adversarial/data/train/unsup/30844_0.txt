If you're ever out in Vegas and feeling hungry for some bomb food, I would highly suggest you go here. The food is diverse and delicious. And I really do think it's well worth your money, just make sure you go on an empty stomach. \nI'm not a huge fan of buffets, but I've been here twice already and wouldn't mind going again on my next visit to Vegas! It's just that good.
