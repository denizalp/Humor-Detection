I HAD to go to this shop because the guy who backed into me, and went down my passenger side, had Liberty Mutual insurance and AZ Collision is one of \"their\" shops.  I went to get an estimate, at my appointment time, and had to wait for a long time before I was attended to.  In fact, he helped someone who came in after me while I sat their waiting.  (Why make appointments?)\n  \nWhen he finally got to me, he said he was really busy and would just look it over, take pictures, and EMAIL me the estimate.  NOONE EVER EMAILED ME THE ESTIMATE!  The next thing I know, I get a v\/m from a gal at Liberty Mutal saying they were sending me a check.  What?  I NEVER asked nor talked to anyone about a check.\n\nWhen I got the check I almost passed out.  For a guy backing into the side of my car and going down it, AZ Collision estimated $300.00!!!  That would be reasonable for a full detail NOT a repair for a crushed in side of a car! \n\nHERE'S THE SCAM:  AZ Collision is in bed with Liberty Mutual.  They GREATLY, UNREASONABLY, RIDICULOUSLY underestimate damages so Liberty Mutual can issue checks that people who want or desperately need, will cash.  Since people take the money and never actually get the work done, Liberty Mutual saves a fortune and never question the scam.\n\nI didn't take it.  In fact, I called them and told them AZ Collision NEVER sent the estimate to me and I wouldn't accept any money\/check.  All I wanted was to get my car fixed properly.\n\nI've found a very reputable body shop who said someone would have to be intoxicated to think that anything could be fixed for $300.00.  They estimated $1,500.00  (This isn't one of Liberty Mutual's shops).  Two other body shops, of my choosing, said almost the same thing ($1,475.00 and $1555.00)..\n\nI decided on a body shop today and Liberty Mutual is giving me a hard time.  If I didn't know my rights, they'd have successfully bullied me into \"their\" shops.  \n\nIf you are paying for your own repairs maybe you should consider AZ Collision since, apparently, they can do repairs at DIRT CHEAP prices.  I can't attest to the quality of their work but I can say they gave me terrible customer service, NEVER provided me an estimate, and aren't trustworthy (based on the fact that THREE other body shops not affiliated with Liberty Mutual told me their quoted price was completely unreasonable).  Caveat Emptor!
