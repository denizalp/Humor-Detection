After completing the tour El Hefe's in AZ and Chicago, this is consistently one of the best places to watch a game. Whether it's NHL Playoffs or NFL season it's always a fun and energetic setting. The place is extremely popular hence it's packed on the weekends yet people act overly surprised by this. I understand people not being psyched on paying more for 'street tacos' but if you step up off the value menu to a Torta then I think your experience will be that much better. Also, the Happy Hour is fabulous as well and highly recommended whenever you can make it!
