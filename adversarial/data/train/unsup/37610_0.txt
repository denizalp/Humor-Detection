Stopped at Molsons on our way through Calgary Airport. Saw the reviews and the \"ugh\" on my boyfriend's face but there wasn't really anywhere else to eat and enjoy a beer. We were seated promptly and served by Shannon, who was great! She asked about our boarding time to make sure we had enough time to eat, and made recommendations on the menu for us. BF got the farmers market turkey sandwich and I had the beef dip, both of us had fries as our side. The food was quick, hot and a pretty big portion which was great considering the airport price. One word of caution - both sandwiches were messy. Fries were hot and seasoned well.\n\nFour stars, I would eat here again if had a connection in Calgary.
