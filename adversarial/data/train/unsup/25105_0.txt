Back and neck pains are not fun, and I've been looking for something that can help me with that for so long.. I've seen so many chiropractors , and been searching for the one that can see beyond the pain that I felt...I mean, any chiropractor can do the cracking, but sometimes it's not enough.. and you need a true healer who can see through the pain and work with a lot of patience .. and that's what I love in Dr. Edwin, he's so knowledgeable and listens to you even without speaking and will do exactly what you need! He's number 1 in town, that's for sure
