This is my favourite Jimmy's Coffee (although I've only been to one). \n\nI was offered a free coffee during my first visit to Jimmy's. The gesture had made me felt so lucky that I managed to ACE the interview and landed a job nearby! Since then, our relationship had blossomed beautifully. \n\nJimmy's is like the boyfriend you always wish you would have. He holds space for you when you need to chat with your friend! He offers special coffee (starting at $1.75) on a cold winter day! He is your coffice when you need to work! He carries delectable healthy and unhealthy treats (starting at $0.75) when you are down! He warms your heart with delicious breakfast (starting at $3.75) when you forget to eat! He even surprises you on his own birthday on Dec. 10th with free drinks and cakes! \n\nWhat more can a girl ask for? Just date him already!
