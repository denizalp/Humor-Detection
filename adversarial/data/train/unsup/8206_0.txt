Oh my god, what a pleasant surprise!! Incredibly authentic Italian. I had a beautiful seasonal pizza with zucchini flowers. They are so hard to find and here they were on this beautifully presented pizza.... You're welcome. Then the affogato was one of the best I've ever had. The espresso and ice cream quality were just wonderful, they didn't try to make anything fancy just beautiful fresh ingredients. I am so impressed
