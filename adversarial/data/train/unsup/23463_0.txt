We visited this spot on a Thursday evening and snagged a table on the patio since the weather was so nice. First impressions from walking inside: it's quite dark and loud so the patio was a good option for us. The lovely Kelsey W. and I came here for their infamous chopped salads so when our waiter came by with our drinks, we let him know we were ready to order. She was able to make some dietary modifications to the salad which was nice, I kept mine as is. They came our relatively quick and we dug in and mixed them. It's a beautiful dish with an array of colors, textures and flavors. I must have been hungry because after I finished it, I could've gone for more. It wasn't like the chopped salad at Cowboy Ciao but it was still good. We just missed their happy hour so maybe next time that will be an option.
