You probably don't want to live here... and you deserve better for yourself and your family... But hey, I lived there.\n\nFirst off, the rent is perfect and if you catch the right deal, your total monthly cost can be unbeatable. Also, it's in the best part of town... Yes, West Side, where all the neat stuff is.\n\nMy neighbors, the ones I share hallways and stairs with, were excellent, friendly and respectful.\n\nOtherwise, the rest of the people in my area were ghetto, obnoxious and play unnecessarily loud music in the middle of the night.\n\nThe police are here frequently and property security is not around enough.\nAfter several murders and robberies, I took the F off.
