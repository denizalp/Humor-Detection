So, I will start by saying the vast majority of this resort is a 4 or higher star.  In general the service was fantastic.  The drinks were lovely. The surroundings and food was also great.  However, this particular property falls (and fails) on the adult\/spa pool.  \n\nI like to have a calm, yet helpful, atmosphere at a pool (because I'm crazy like that).  If I'm going to relax, I like helpful people at the pool, waiters checking in and a quiet peaceful area (shocking).  Unfortunately this was a MAJOR Westin #fail.  Loud clanging gates (PAD THEM!) were annoying each time someone entered or left.  I'm talking about really loud and random.  just BOOM.  The staff was...wait, what staff?  One sorry guy running around in the heat as fast as he could?  With 52 people?  Hey, GM - let's talk about bad decisions.  Horrifying.  Not a single person at the pool was happy or relaxed.  Also, anyone cleaning up when people leave?  At 6pm only.  Ick.  This needs a major overhaul.  We also really enjoyed the power washing going on outside the pool.  That was heavenly and the same as a massage.  And by \"massage\" I mean hammers on our skulls.  \n\nSadly, this ruins an otherwise very nice resort.  The staff is nice, helpful and the hotel is exceptionally cute and clean.  Other than the pool situation, there is a slight issue with the name of the main bar \"The Rim.\"  Um, awkward.
