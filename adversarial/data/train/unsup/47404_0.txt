If I could give the Las Vegas Avis Rental center 0 stars I would.\n\nTheir latest \"program\" charges you $13.99 for 0-75miles driven--we specifically were asked during check-in whether we wanted to opt out of the program, so naturally we said yes. The woman was very rude, but made it clear that we had to decide there because it was an opt-in\/out program.\n\nWe refilled the tank to full as usual, and noted upon return that we were charged a $18 fee (after taxes). We immediately turned around to inquire about the additional charge and were told this was for the $13.99 EZFuel program (or whatever it was called). We made the mistake of paying the $8.05 in gas in cash (we're in vegas after all, cash dealings is almost the norm), so we did not have a receipt to provide to \"waive\" the fee. \n\nWe got the manager out--a youngish guy--extremely rude and poor customer service (none at all really). The contract specifically states that yes, a fee will be charged \"if rental is returned with less fuel than originally rented\". There's also one line after that that says \"00-75 miles will be charged $13.99, present receipt to waive\". Based on our questions and experience during checkout, we had every reason to believe that this was an opt-in program. Our mistake on not getting a receipt, but it's clear the tank is full--how can anyone justify charging $13.99 for returning a car with a full tank?\n\nApparently Avis can run this kind of racket. The manager even had the nerve to counter, and I quote, \"How do I know you didn't just drive 20miles and didn't refill the tank? You could do that and the meter would still show full.\" Excuse me? That's your customer service? Snarky comments? Our odometer readings checking out and back in clearly shows we drove 64 miles. \n\nThey would gouge you out of $18 of hard-earned money and lose the business of us and all our friends (we're spreading this around to everyone we know) because they can justify charging for a full tank in their fine print, and misleading instructions). \n\nThe manager by the way, offered no help at all in terms of retrieving a receipt. They could've called the gas station, refunded us the 8.05 once confirmed, or let us take another car out to retrieve the receipt (gas station was 2 blocks away). But no, nothing. No concession. \n\nThis is a new program, we've not seen it before mind you. But based on the nature of this program and the misleading directions by Avis's personnel and non-existant customer service, I suggest everyone rent elsewhere.\n\nEnterprise, Thirfty are other options we've had no problems with. Give your hard-earned money to honest companies that earn it.
