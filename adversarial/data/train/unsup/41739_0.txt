Very cute designs and interesting flavour combination make this place an asset to Scarborough.  Came here a week ago to try their confectionary creations and while I can say they have nice selection, their inventory was very low and macaron texture a little disappointing.  \n\nSelection - 3\/5\nTaste - 4\/5\nTexture (crunch\/ chewness\/ softness) - 3\/5\nService - 4\/5\nPrice -3\/5\n\nWould I go back? Maybe after a few more months when technique has improved a bit.  Considering there are many cake and macaron places popping up in toronto, richmondhill and markham area that have a constant even selection at lower cost, they have a bit more to go.
