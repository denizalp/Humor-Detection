So dogs, which their vaccines are highly regulated, are not allowed in the store, but rabbits, which can potentially carry myxo and RVH (due to no regulation in canada) are ok. Saw a customer carrying a rabbit around the store and the workers here said nothing. Won't be back here again. Gross.\n\nEdit in response to comment from Justin: The girl had the rabbit in her arms while placing her order. Thanks.
