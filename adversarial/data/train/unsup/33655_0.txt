AMAZING!!!!\nWe had the Vegetarian Chef Tasting. Every course was better than the last-fresh ingredients and perfect flavors. You cannot beat the naan-the garlic was my favorite\nIt is soooo much food that we had an entire meal for the next day, so it was DEFINITELY worth the price.\nThe service was also great, and all staff members were extremely helpful and friendly.
