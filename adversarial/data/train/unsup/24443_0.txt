We spend the day furniture shopping and hit up many of Ashley's competitors such as the Brick, Leons, etc.  The experience at furniture stores is relative since they're all trying to get the most margin out of their product lines.  The big difference maker in my experience seems to be service.  The people who work at the Brick and Leons are unacceptably ignorant of customer service.  At least at Ashley I was able to find the manager who helped me work through our questions.  The showroom is nicely staged and the product line seems to be of better quality than the competition.  The furniture is made in the US (not China) and like many furniture stores, the price is flexible.  That's a major point to note since your experience in the price category is completely up to how good a negotiator you are.  We haven't gotten delivery of our pieces yet but hopefully that side of the experience is as positive as the purchase was.
