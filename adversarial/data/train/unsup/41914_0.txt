For who has a sensitive skin and love natural products like me, Lush is the best choice. I used and using many kind of products. If u have some pimples, or want to refresh ur skin, want ur skin glow, use Mintmagnity mask, really cool. It depends on what kind of ur skin, the seller will help u choose one suitable on yours. The shampoo bar also very good, but u need to buy a box to put it and save. But sometimes, if ur shampoo is stilm wet, very difficult to open and it will stick inside also. Dark angel also perfect, clean very well ur skin. \nCome and try some, and if u like to relax in the bathtub, buy one bathboom.
