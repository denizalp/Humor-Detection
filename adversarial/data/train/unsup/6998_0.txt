No more military discount:(  \n\nBut came for regular #8 crepe with whip cream, ice cream, strawberries and chocolate drizzle!  Yum yum went my tum-tum. \n\nLocated in Fashion Mall at the food court.  Take the elevator from any floor up to level three.  Chairs in food court look like old wooden chairs, time for a face-lift!\n\nService was great!  Crepes are fresh, fluffy and delicious!
