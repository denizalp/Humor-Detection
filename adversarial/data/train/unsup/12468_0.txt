We are in a recession, correct?  So why is that the food portions here are insultingly tiny but the prices are set so high that even hedge fund owners who spend the money dining here would later ask for a bailout? *ZING!* \n\nInside, this place is VERY NICE.  It's absolutely gorgeous inside with a mood that befits all out class that previously, only former AIG employees could indulge in. And you know it's serious high end when a dress code is strictly enforced.  I'm totally down to spend the money at a nice expensive restaurant, but when the prices are this high , I begin setting really REALLY R-E-A-L-L-Y HIGH expectations on the food.  Especially when the smug waiter kept reminding us that the portions are very small and to really get your food's worth, look to spend minimum $40-60.  We get it.  You want us to blow our cash and go crazy...and tip you mucho.\n\nJust to benchmark, I looked for the cheapest offering. $17 for \"appetizer spaghetti\" and meatsauce?  Double-down for double the portions (That's $34)?  Goddamn, that better be some high-end Kobe beef they put into this shiznet, with fresh-made noodles and sauce 'cuz this place is ballerrrrrr.  I couldn't tell, but there wasn't any baller meat for sure. I admit the noodles tasted good, but for all I know I could very well have been eating Chef Boyardee \"Premium Select\" canned pasta and still be duped.  Seafood? it's fresh but I've had it equally as fresh for much cheapper...c'mon, I'm Asian! If you're gonna con me $100 for seafood, just hand me the fish alive and I'll bite right into it...now THAT's as fresh as things can get.\n\nService was slow.  We were there for over 2 hours, most of the time waiting.  And even our buffet sessions don't last that long. At least they were friendly.
