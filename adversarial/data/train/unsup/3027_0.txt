We came on a Sunday afternoon and had to wait about 25 minutes for a party of two. There is parking along downtown: there's a parking lot right next to the restaurant (with underground parking) and there's also three hour parking along the streets.\n\nThey have happy hour 11am-6pm daily and all day Thursday. You can check in and get chips and salsa for $3.99.\n\nPIG WINGS ($11.50) - They give about 8 pig wings per order. I really enjoyed the tenderness of the wing along with the sweetness and spiciness of the sauce. It was literally fall off the bone which is always a good sign. 4\/5\n\nSPICY MAC-N-CHEESE BURGER ($15.50, REHAB) - There are two different sizes of burger patties: 10oz Rehab and 5oz Relapse. We got the rehab because we were splitting the burger. I expected the burger to be spicier than it was given that spicy is in the name of the burger. The mac n cheese didn't have as much cheesiness or just taste in general. There were a couple jalapenos but even those weren't really spicy. 3.5\/5\n\nSWEET POTOTOES - We ordered these alongside our burger and oh my goodness these are so addicting. I could eat these for days and would never get enough of them. I loved dipping them in the orange-colored sauce (don't know what it is but it was delicious together). 5\/5\n\nIf you're from the SoCal area, this place reminds me a lot of PB Cantina and Cabo Cantina in terms of their decorations and drinks. Their happy hours are a lot better but Rehab has much better burgers and other foods and isn't only a place to get wasted but a family friendly place to get lunch or dinner (doesn't mean you can't get wasted here though because their margaritas are good and strong).
