This was so disappointing. We were so excited to try this place out, cuz let's face it, it's Guy! But honestly, just entering the place you get bad vibes. The server seemed like he didn't like his job, he forgot that I had ordered the tattooed mojito, so I had to remind him. The food literally took like 40 minutes and we ordered a burger, trash can nachos, and the fireball wings. Then we ordered the truffle fries. Honestly the truffle fries were the best thing there. The nachos were ok, but it was like canned cheese. the fireball wings were gross. They were dry, and the taste of the cinnamon easy gross. Like if they bought them frozen and just fried them. The burger was a burger, but honestly who smashed the pattie flat? Just dries put the burger over all. The servers just stand there doing nothing although there were like 2 doing their job. Please save your money and go somewhere else.
