A few points to know if you were not familiar with Vegas like me and had to stay at this hotel because your company booked it...\n\n1. Check in is at 4pm, however the bell desk people are quite friendly to take your luggage before you are able to check in.\n2. BRING GOOD EAR PLUGS. I lived in Mardi gras building so not sure about the other tower. The NOISE from outside continues until about 4-5am everyday. Why do I know? Because I could not sleep at all for the nights I stayed there until the noise dies down around 4 or 5.  \n3. Buffet is super average, it is $30, they do have crab legs \n4. Check out Mac King's afternoon show, it was surprisingly entertaining despite his old school appearance.
