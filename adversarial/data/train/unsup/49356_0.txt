Great place to relax, indulge yourself with wines, beers,  and cheese.  The owner puts together really interesting taste combinations that awaken your palate.  I love their deluxe cheese tray.  The cafe offers local foods and has a strong environmental mandate which meshes well with my beliefs.  Service was wonderful as well.  I felt well taken care of :)\n\nI highly recommend this place to any lover of cheese, wine, or beer.
