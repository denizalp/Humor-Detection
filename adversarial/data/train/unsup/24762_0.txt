Was expecting better\n\nWe were looking for a quick bite to eat and decided to stop in at New Asian Star . The staff at New Asian Star were friendly and it seemed to be a very popular spot with the locals.\n\nOn this visit we ordered the lemon chicken, egg drop soup, fried wonton, egg rolls, and chicken with vegetables, we were a little disappointed with both entrée's. The seasoning level was okay, however,  the chicken was overcooked and there was just to much sauce. Next we tried the Eggrolls and Fried Won Tons, once again those items were just okay. Our meals just okay, maybe I was expecting something more. \n\nI love Chinese food however, New Asian Star wouldn't be one of my first choices. But since there is a big selection on the menu, maybe the other entrée's  are better tasting.
