Wish it still had the pool!  That way I would forget about the food that was served here and just keep having fun.  In its defense, if your looking for something just outside of the old town madness but still willing to pay a premium for drinks and so so food, this is the spot!  You are sure to get a seat here every time no matter the night or occasion.  Just be sure you remember the location if you plan on coming back in a year as this place will most likely be named something new.  Most places in old town try to revamp themselves into new and exciting places yet this one fell short again as did its neighbor.  In the 2 years I have been going out in old town Scottsdale these 2 locations will have been 5 different names between the 2 of them!
