There was six of us and we were seated immediately. Service was attentive and professional. Manager was checking with everyone in the restaurant, to make sure customers were satisfied. I ordered Texas Rice. Lots of Shrimp, meat, and chicken on Spanish Rice with a cheesy cream sauce that was delicious. We all decided we would come back for more.
