Do NOT take your puppy do this place! \nGave this pet resort many many chances after chances. \nTheir staff is very poor with customer service and communication.\nFinally spoke to the manager or owner whoever she claims I be, and insists on charging her customers after her staff that she hired fail to communicate appropriate information. \n\nIn addition to all of this dealing with incompetent employees, were sure and our vet is sure this is where my puppy got worms. The best part is the staff wants to blame and say my puppy cane with it when he has been only home and this is the only day care he's ever been to or around other dogs. \n\nBeware of this place Becuase the owner does not take responsibility for somethings that are such small issues, you definitely should NOT trust them to take care of your loved pup!
