I've been staying here for a few months and I do like it's convenience and the closeness to the grocery store and the shopping centers. On the outside the apartment complex is very nice looking. Nice scenery and waterfalls. However a LOT of the apartment \"section\" signs are missing multiple letters which looks extremely tacky.\n\nWhen I signed my lease here the woman I worked with was very kind and got me a SEMI-renovated apartment for a cheaper value and for what I pay it is not that bad but the cabinets are still old, they have just been painted brown and the counter tops were very scratched up and old. I do like that my walls aren't paper thin and I cant here everything my neighbor is doing.\n\nWithin my first week I had to put in several work orders to get a faucet replaced among other things. However, the work orders were answered in a timely manner. \n\nOne of my biggest issues is the dismissive attitude of the leasing agents in the office. No one told me that rent and packages were only supposed to be picked up from the Clubhouse and not the leasing office, so when I went to the leasing office to get my things I was ignored or dismissed with a \"you should have know they were at the clubhouse\" kind of air. Another issue is that the rent has a convenience charge added to every bill and it's great that you can pay with a credit card but it's TWENTY freakin  DOLLARS ($20...everyone) to pay with a credit\/debit card on line or via phone...like....who wants to do that??? I usually just pay with a personal check.\n\nI like that the area is mixed company. Meaning there are all races and all socioeconomic classes living here. Also everyone that stays in my section of the neighborhood are very friendly.\n\nEhhhh...they gave me a $500 gift card when I moved in and a cheaper rental rate.....I cant really complain......yet. I would give it a strong 6 on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being highest.
