What can I say about the Golden Spoon?  Could I say that they sell Frozen Yogurt? Could I say that their spoons aren't REALLY golden? Yes, and Yes.\n\nI could also tell you that the selection of yogurts is decent.  If I had to guess, I would say there are about 15-20 different flavors.  When you add the 20-30 different toppings into the mix, there is potential for some creative and tasty surprises!\n\nMy favorite flavors (though I have probably tried them all) are Strawberry Cheesecake and Cake batter.  I always get the same toppings, Graham Cracker crumbles and strawberry topping.  Why am I such a close-minded topping orderer, you asK? Frankly, Mr. Shankly, because I ordered the crushed after-dinner mints once and it ruined my entire experience!  It was like chewing grated wax candles. Seriously! Don't Laugh!\n\nMy advice is to stick with the norm and stay away from the after-dinner mints.
