We needed to grab a bite to eat before heading over to a friends house so we stopped here.  We were greeted quickly and our ordered was up in no time. I had the standard sesame bagel with a cream cheese shmear and my guy had a sandwich. A nice pumpernickel bagel with ham, swiss cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato and a side of potato salad.  The food and service was good and we will happily return.
