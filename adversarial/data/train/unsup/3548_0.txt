Have I REALLY not reviewed the Curzon? This has become the goto bar for our friends in the east end.. when we want something more bumping than the cottage. \n\nThis place is NOT for everyone. A girlfriend of mine commented that it \"smells like old furniture.\" And it does. The crowd is a mixed bag. Sometimes you get a fun and friendly crowd of eastenders, sometimes a bunch of hipsters and hip hop peeps.. last time we got a bunch of very very drunk girls in baseball caps and a grandma in leather pants. Really you never know, but its part of the charm. \n\nThe bartenders are nice, drinks reasonable, no cover. Good patio space on the back and on the side.  \n\nNote that the music is LOUD and some of the djs are terrible. Like TERRIBLE mixing skills (isn't it all MacBook these days? how the eff do you mess that up?) but you can retreat to the patios for some quiet. People here love to crowd the tiny dance floor.
