I have driven by this place a few times but it wasn't until I looked at my Yelp-check in offers that I was intrigued (35% off any one item). I took my 4 year old with me who fell in love with almost everything she saw there....budding fashionista? Hmmm? Like my daughter, there many things I just loved. I found the prices incredibly reasonable, too, for a vintage shop. I can't stand vintage\/thrift stores that are way overpriced. \n\nThere was a variety of men's and women's clothes, some kids clothes (although I would have liked to see more), jewelry, bags, shoes, other miscellaneous accessories. There was even a sale rack. \n\nSpeaking of racks, I didn't try on some of my favorites because I didn't think they would fit mine. Like a previous reviewer, I have my doubts what this curvy girl can fit in but when I don't have a rambunctious child with me, I'll be sure to try it out!\n\nHours are great, too...every day until 6 p.m., I believe, which is easy to remember!
