this is not the best sushi restaurant in the city, but it is good. the prices are reasonable, the restaurant is spacious and clean, and the atmosphere was nice.\n\ni felt that the waitresses rushed the food. although the food was brought out quickly, they gave us the main while we were still eating the appetizer. the sushi itself was good. they don't use a ton of rice just to fill up the plate.\n\nthe menu is also huge, although can be confusing sometimes. there is no shortage of options. overall, i would eat here again.
