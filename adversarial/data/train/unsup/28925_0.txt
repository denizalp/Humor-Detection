Very unimpressed.  WE rarely wear shoes inside and have no pets.  They try to upsell you to condition or scotchguard.  The couple stains (very small) are still there.  The charge $35\/room to condition but because the stain was so small Patrick said it would be $15 (area may of been approx 2 feet- max).  Don't bother with this company look elsewhere.  Patrick and his assitant were nice that was the only positive of this experience.  I did  have a groupon and maybe because of the groupon discount everything is extra (I don't know).
