This place truly deserves all 5 stars. They're instructors are excellent at leading the classes, you can tell they work out hard themselves because they have amazing\/strong bodies, and the classes really work out your full body. I've done each of the following 3-4 times:\nTRX Cardio with Premyer Tamayo - he's energetic and you will work your bootie off in this 45 min class.\nBarre with Kaitlyn Bergen - she's excellent at rotating through barre exercises and body weight\/weights so that by the time you're getting sick and tired of the barre it's time to move on. \nBallerina Bootcamp with Gabriella Walters - this lady is amazing. She has great energy and really knows her stuff. She's going to enforce good form and was so great about giving me alternatives since I'm pregnant.\n\nWhat I love about this place is that they really emphasize form over reps. The other barre studio I've been to in town was just trying to get in as many reps as possible no matter how sloppy. \nTry this place, you'll love it!
