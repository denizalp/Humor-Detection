I am leaving feedback today because of the previous reviews I read. I have been going here on and off for the past 5-6 years.  I have sprayed tan which the dark isn't really dark and it didn't last long (maybe my skin oils?) so I was having to come back every 2 days so I switched back to regular tanning.  Everyone that I have had interaction with is friendly, professional, and once we start talking they become extremely friendly regarding their personal life. I enjoy talking to all of them when I go in. The only time I was some what unhappy after my interaction (and it really wasn't a big deal) was when I was switching back from the spray tan membership to the regular membership and the person gave me incorrect info. I knew different which is the only reason I knew what she told me was incorrect.  As far as the bed not being cleaned until you get there that has happened a couple times but they went and cleaned it right away. Maybe caused a couple minute delay but come on if your cutting your time that close then you probably shouldn't be trying to fit tanning in right then. Plus you don't know what led up to that chain of events there could possibly be a good reason for that.  Give the girls a break......it's really not that big of a deal.
