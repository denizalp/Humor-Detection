Simply fantastic. The food, ambiance and service were all top notch. \n\nWe arrived a few minutes early, and were seated immediately. When we made our reservation, we let them know we were part of a bachelorette party, and they welcomed our bride with a nice congratulations card. A great way to start the evening.\n\nThe ambiance is dark and sophisticated, very clean lines and simple designs. There was nothing too fancy. However, we did appreciate how the restaurant had separate rooms. Each room had three to four tables, which made it feel very intimate and warm.\n\nThe food... is good. The baby beet salad is hearty with four varieties of beets and a simple dressing. I also enjoyed the artichoke salad. It was light and refreshing. Portions of both were very big.\n\nFor the main course, I had the sirloin. It was tender, flavorful and cooked just right. A girlfriend of mine got the lamb shanks - It was SO good... I wish I had ordered it instead of the steak! It was also a very large portion, probably enough to feed three people. \n\nFor the sides, I highly recommend the cremini mushroom risotto... if I wasn't wearing a tight dress, I could have eaten the whole thing by myself. :)\n\nI'd take off one star because while the restaurant was fantastic, it does not have any WOW factor that is often in many Vegas establishments... I could probably get the same experience in Chicago. I'd suggest they do something different with the decor. Something fun!\n\nStrong drinks. Great wine list and pairing recommendations.\nDress to impress.
