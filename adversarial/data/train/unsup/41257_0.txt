A very nice atmosphere to enjoy good southern food !! Enjoyed the bar which is very tastefully decorated with the southern accent and style !! Very nice people !! Wines and the food selections were excellent !! Courtney and Hailey were very nice and made sure we had a great time !! Eric was very personable and made sure everything was to our expectations. Will most definitely recommend this place anytime !! \n\nThx\n\nDR MD
