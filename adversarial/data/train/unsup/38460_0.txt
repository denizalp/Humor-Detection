They have a pretty good craps game over here, friendly dealers and good patrons.  Won a little the first night, lost my ass the second in about 10 minutes but that's how it goes.  They also serve Guinness which is a big plus.  The interior of every casino looks the exactly like the next on Fremont so this one's nothing special but worth checking out when wandering around downtown drunk, aimless and with a few bucks left in your pocket.
