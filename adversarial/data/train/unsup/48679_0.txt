Good service although pricey. \n\nAll the office staff and technicians were professional and friendly. \n\nThey started on my car straight away even though I was 1.5 hr early to my appointment and told me I couldn't wash the new windshield for a few days. \n\nMy car hadn't been driven for weeks so it was filthy, after replacing my front windshield, without me asking for it the technician proceeded to wipe clean the rest of my side and rear glass as well as side mirrors!
