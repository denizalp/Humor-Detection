Pros:\n- delicious food (especially the grilled calamari)\n- friendly staff\n\nCons:\n- really small portions (they seemed to have decreased the size as compared to before)\n- pretty expensive\n\nFood: (3 stars)\nFor appetizers we ordered saganaki and green leaves.  Both were very delicious but pretty pricy.  (4 stars)\nFor the main course we got 2 orders of grilled calamari appetizers (7$ cheaper than main course option and just come without salad and rice).  It was decently sized and very tasty (5 stars)\nWe also ordered a mousaka and a souvlaki meal.  The souvlaki meal was really disappointing, for 26$ there was a single row of meat (4-6 pieces), a few vegetables and a few spoons of rice.  \n(2 stars).  Tasty however nowhere near the price level.  \n\nEveryone left pretty hungry. \n\nWith a bottle of wine it came to $50 a person including tax and tip.  \n\nAmbiance: (4 stars)\n4 of us made reservations on Friday at 6pm for 7:30.  When we got there most of the restaurant was empty. \nThe restaurant was clean, and the washrooms were well kept.  \nThe restaurant had greek sculptures and vases and was playing greek music.  \n\n\nService: (5 stars)\nWe ordered a bottle of wine as suggested by the waiter, but when it came we found it to be a bit flat (after 3 people tried it) and requested a new one.  Without any trouble he obliged.\n\n\nSummary:\nGo there if you want delicious food, and are not too hungry.  The place was not crowded even on a Friday night so if you want a quite dinner this is a good option.  I would have given it 4 stars, but the cost was a bit too much, so I had to deduct an extra star.\nI would go there again, but only order appetizers and not expect to be filled.\n\nIf I was really craving greek food, I would go to Danforth to any of the restaurants there.
