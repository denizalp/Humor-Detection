Banana Bread French toast was good, but should have been cooked longer as it was mushy in the middle. Service was not very good and they weren't even crowded. Our waitress never came back to check on us after bringing us our food. We were done eating when she finally came around and asked if we wanted more coffee-we replied no just the check please. After waiting for over 8 minutes to get the check we got up and went to the counter. I will go back as the menu has lots of great choices I want to try, but will definitely get a different waitress.
