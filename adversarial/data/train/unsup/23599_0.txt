this has got to be the worst store ever!\n\nit's located inside fashion show mall which i avoid if i can help it.\nbut the hubby needed to go to the microsoft pop-up store and i needed to exchange a gift at a&f so off to the mall we went.\n\nthe customer service is horrible at this location.\ni asked one of the employees about exchanging a couple of items that we received as gifts with the gift receipt and because the 60 day return policy had passed, she was utterly confused and asked us to speak with their manager on duty.\nthe \"manager\", who seemed to be a 16 year old high school kid at their first job ever, had no clue what their return policy was either.\nthey insisted that the items i was returning would be reduced to the current selling price regardless of the gift receipt.\ni ended up reading the policy to her that was printed on the back of the receipt and, even then, she had no clue what to do.\ni tried with all my might to explain it to her but she was unable to pick up what i was layin down.\naggravation set in...\n\ni ended up just exchanging our items for a couple of other things and ended up paying the difference because i just couldn't waste anymore time with these incompetent people.
