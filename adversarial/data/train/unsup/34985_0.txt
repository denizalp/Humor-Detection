I love living here. You can't find a better community that are peaceful, law abiding, mind their own business and family oriented. It's very peaceful here, and I have no problems with maintenance staff. I keep my place clean and haven't had any bugs. If you don't clean up your place, like anywhere else, you'll attract that sort of thing. The apartments are well built- concrete block keeps out the noise. But you won't find all the noise pollution than you would anywhere else. You'll find professionals who have family values. And the beautiful minimalist design of the campus is wonderful for walking and taking in nature. Nice pool, basketball and tennis courts and gym. It's not cheap here, but you get what you pay for.
