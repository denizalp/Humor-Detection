The Shamful Tiki Room is a \"Tiki\" style bar located in Parkdale on Queen Street.\n\nThere are no see-through windows, therefore just look out for the logo on the window, and enter behind a curtain to paradise.\n\nThe vibe is mellow, breezy, and makes me feel like I am in a different place. \n\nDrinks: Blue Hawaii and Mai Tai. The Blue Hawaii was great, had a nice coconut taste. The Mai Tai was quite strong, filled with crushed ice, and topped with a flaming lime! Cool!\n\nI will come back next time and visit with more friends so I can try a volcano bowl! They occasionally have rum club meetings, burlesque shows, and other performances!
