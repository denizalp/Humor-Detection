This is definitely a good hole-in-the-wall place with very affordable lunch, perfect for students and broke peeps. U can easily be full with a $9 lunch of 3 choices of sides, a bowl of rice and jasmin tea. \nIt's not pretty and the food isn't the best you will ever have but it gets you where you need to be: full. And this review is based on what that is.\nThe neon lights and the chinese movie playing on the tv makes it feel like you are elsewhere for a moment, it's interesting...\nWe all took the 3-choice plates but I think we'll come back to try the soups and the baos.
