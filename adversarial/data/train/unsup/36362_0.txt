Great clean store with lots of healthy food options. Rather than sell the typical chips and pop, they have fresher options of items that are even made in store.\n\nThe fresh food bar is great. Lots of options but a little pricey. Half a box usually runs me about $12-14 so careful how fast you fill up.
