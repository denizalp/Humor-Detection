Standing in line writing this review. This has to be the most unorganized Cell phone store I have been to. Not even sure if the store has shift leadership because they don't have any answers. It's my fault for waiting in line but I'm already here. Last time I'll be coming to this location. Sad thing is that it is right down the street from where I live. 1 star is too many, however I have to utilize it to leave my review
