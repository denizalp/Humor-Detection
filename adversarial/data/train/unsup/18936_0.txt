Food:\n-Ham\/brie\/tomato was just okay, I mean, it's exactly how it sounds, good salad on the side\n-Sweet potato fries were not made in house and were pretty much burnt\n-Crawfish mac and cheese was bland, texture of the macaroni was too mushy, only positive (depending on who you ask) was that it was a huge ass portion\n\nService, omg so fail:\n-One waitress running the small restaurant, didn't seem to know the menu at all, had no idea what gluten free meant, unable to give any recommendations, brought my friend and I both the wrong things, wtf\n\nAside from the small diversity my friend and I brought to the restaurant, the place was strangely filled with all old white women. Did we eat at a retirement community instead? That'd explain the (lack of) service and food quality.
