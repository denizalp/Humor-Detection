Maya worked magic! Previously I went somewhere and got my eyebrows waxed and the lady completely messed me up. One eyebrow was significantly higher than the other and they were so uneven. For about 3 weeks I just let my eyebrows grow freely, in hopes that I could fix her mistake. I went to Diya's on a leap of faith and based off of some reviews. Somehow she got my eyebrows even again. My eyebrows still need time to grow out but they are the perfect shape. I am so pleased!! The employees are so sweet and welcoming! This is my new eyebrow place from now on!!
