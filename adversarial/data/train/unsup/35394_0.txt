I've tried for two years, to get to this place. When we come to Vegas, it's on my list, but something always happens. Not today! I wasn't going to let anything get in my way of going to this place. I've heard about it and wanted to try it, so today was finally the day. \nWhen we walked in, it was exactly how I thought it would be. Old school Italy. We were finally seated and pleasantly surprised to see the red and white wine, already sitting on the table. I wish that was where my story ended, but alas, no. We were given soup or salad choice and the salad was a basic salad. Nothing to write home about. The garlic bread, while plentiful tasted like that frozen bread you get in the grocery store, with too much seasoning. Still not that big of a deal. I ordered lasagna, my husband spaghetti and meatballs and my daughter chicken parm. Well, I guess we drew the short straws, because my daughters was above average and our was not great. My husbands spaghetti was equivalent to junior high cafeteria food. And for $25, it should be a heck of a lot better. The cappuccino that comes with the meal, tastes like hot chocolate, which is weird because I hate coffee and wasn't looking forward  to this, but it tasted like hot chocolate, so I drank it up!  If I was forced to go back, I'd get the chicken parm, avoid the salad and bring a light bulb with me, because it's so dark in there, it's hard to even read the menu. You get the old school Italy vibe, but the food doesn't do this place justice. I didn't take pictures. You wouldn't be able to see them if I had, because it's so ridiculously dark in there.
