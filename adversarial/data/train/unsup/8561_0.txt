Buffets are never worth it to me, because I can't eat more than half a plate. (Then how are you so fat Dan? I have no clue). But I decided to bring my parents since they haven't been to Vegas in 20 years and you need to do a buffet, right? Anyways, this buffet is $60 and completely not worth it. First off, you have to wait in a 2-hr line, or you can enter your phone number and they'll text you when to return. Sounds great right? Nope. After you receive the text and return, you still have to wait another 45 min! Ok...\nNow the food. Not great. I've had $20 buffets better than this place. I don't know who is giving this place high reviews, but the food is not great, at all. The meats suck; dry and chewy. The seafood sucks; oysters are dirty and huge, snow crabs are cold and limp, steamed crab is slightly better. Sushi is horrible and so limited, cannot even call it sushi. Asian food sucked. Everything basically sucked. \nThe only decent section was the desserts. But cmon, $60 for horrible food and desserts? Plus the huge wait? Take a pass everyone, and go somewhere else.
