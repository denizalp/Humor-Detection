My family of 3 stopped by this Restaurant the other night for dinner. Upon our arrival we saw a few empty seats inside. We waited to be seated for about 5 mins. When the hostess hollered at us she escorted us to an outside patio. After 10 to 15 mins it stated to rain. I went inside to let her know it was raining and asked for a table inside. She literally barked at me and said that everyone else  also wanted to be inside , even though there were plenty of  free tables she never sat anyone on them. She is  very rude ! It would be best for her to not be there at all...\nThe food portions are large but the food is Greasy. The service is terrible. They don't have a liqueur license either.\nI also witnessed a couple who were seated beside us, they had to wipe off their chairs themselves because they were wet. When they asked to move inside the waiter spent about 2 mins arguing with them even after she demanded to talk to the manager.! By the way the manager never show up!\nPlease, do yourself a favour and by pass it the next time you are in the area. \nSave the aggravation, the money and most important YOUR TIME!
