Two down and counting!\n\nI had to give this event 4 stars comparing it to last year's course in Beatty, NV.\n\nHere's the rundown...\nPROS:\n1. Great weather for event, it even almost rained on us which would have been awesome! \n2. Along the way we made a new friend to complete our mudding experience which evened out the group for couple related obstacles. \n3. All the groups were looking awesome representing their team shirts.\n4. Our starter announced that WWP has now raised a total up to 6 million dollars to help our troops! :D\n\nCONS:\n1. I feel like they could have had at least 10 more obstacles in between all the running. There were more challenging ones in Beatty location. \n2. We ran by the whole Lake Mead the whole time and not once did we get to take a dip into it at all. (got to swim across a lake in Beatty)\n3. During my tight cramping in my quads, I had asked multiple EMTs for salt tablets, and not one was able to help me out.\n4. \"Electric Eel\" obstacle is not at this location. (very fun to watch friends lol)\n\nI personally didn't enjoy this event due to the fact I did not heal properly the week leading to this event. Major cramping issues in both Quads throughout the whole second half.\n\nIn conclusion, some tips for completing a ToMu...\n1. Make sure you can easily run 3 miles nonstop without a problem.\n2. The difficult obstacles that I had seen most people had problems with were the body weight ones, so train your upper body! (especially back muscles for pulling)\n3. One week prior to the event... hydrate, increase your salt intake, and load up on lean carbohydrates.\n4. While healing, stretch and foam roll out all your soreness around your body.\n5. Know what you are getting yourself into. (watch YouTube videos)\n6. And last but not least, the more people the merrier\/easier. It makes it that much more fun when you have family\/friends by your side completing this epic event. Then again I've seen loners do this by themselves, for themselves.\n7. And last but not least, HELP EACH OTHER OUT! \n\nRandom information...\nYou will get cold. You will get muddy. You will be exhausted. You might draw blood. And most of all... You WILL get shocked!\n\nMessage me if interested on joining my next mudding adventure, becuase I'm going to Cali, baby! :D
