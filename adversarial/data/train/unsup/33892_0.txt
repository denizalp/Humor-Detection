Made my first delivery order on Wednesday to be delivered Thursday. They call me Thursday morning to notify me their driver did not show up for work so I would not have my groceries delivered today and that I need to go online to reorder all of my items for a future delivery. Are you kidding just because someone called in sick does it mean that a business has to shut down this is terrible customer service.
