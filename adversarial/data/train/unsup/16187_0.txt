I'm not sure what the reason is for all of these low ratings. Overall my experience was pretty great. \n\nDoh sushi and tapas serves an AYCE menu of Japanese\/ Korean sushi and tapas.\nDoh gives off a very modern classic setting, very different from what is currently in Chinatown. In the front of restaurant you will find a study with wooden bookshelves. Feels like a scene out of the popular korean soap opera, Coffee Prince. There's a huge map on the walls of the restaurant. I like that they did not stick to the typical solid walls because it forces you to take minute and experience the restaurant and notice things like the molding throughout the restaurant,the color schemes they chose, and the sushi bar in the back.\n\nI tend to overeat whenever I go to AYCE restaurants but that's the point...The problem with stuffing your face until you are at the point of bursting is that most dishes start becoming forgettable unless they were amazing! Dishes that would normally be good also start tasting like they lack or overdid something. \n\nI did not like all of the dishes that I ordered but some of my favorite were;\n-The Bulgogi \n-Dragon Roll\n-Salmon Sashimi\n-Salmon skin salad\n-Avocado Bomb\n\nTheir servers did miss a few of the items that we tried ordering but we were so full towards that middle of the meal that we decided not to even mention it. Service can be a bit slow but there is a server that walks around to check up on you and see if you would like to order anything else. \n\nI suggest requesting half rolls because not every roll is great. \n\nMy experience here was pleasant. I love the interior of the restaurant.
