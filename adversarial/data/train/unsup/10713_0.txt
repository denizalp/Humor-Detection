Five stars, however, El Chorro deserves more than just lowly stars. \nEl Chorro deserves a rating system of a different sort. \n\nEl Chorro, for all its perfection, deserves a rating system using little baby unicorns decked-out in jewels and adorned with splendid colorful pageantry. \nThe unicorns would smell heavenly too; a blend of newborn baby and warmed Ghirardelli chocolate.\nUnder this rating system, I'd give El Chorro the highest rating possible.\n\nFrom beginning to end, the El Chorro experience was impeccable. \nService, ambiance, food, and drink; all were flawless.\nI even liked the valet for Christ's sakes.\n\nThe duck breast was so delicious, each bite had me wishing ducks had more breasts, like dogs. If they did, I'd devour every last one of them.\nIn fact, the preparation was so perfect with its melt in your mouth texture, I'd have no reservations about eating the bill, feathers, webbed feet, private parts, and quack. I've never sampled duck breast this delicious!\n\nFor appetizers, consider the tomato and burrata cheese plate. The cheese is velvety smooth and creamy. The balsamic, thick and sweet, likely from Modena and not Milwaukee. The tomatoes come from their garden; red, ripe and dripping with sweet juicy goodness. In concert, these flavors will excite your taste buds, giving them little tiny taste bud boners.\n \nFor dessert, try the strawberry shortcake.\nThe chef prepares a wonderfully delicious shortbread cake, presenting it in a small pond of berry compote.  And in the berry pond, a plethora of fresh berries, feverishly swimming about in an ill-fated attempt to avoid my fork. \nThis is a dessert to behold and I strongly recommend you consume it at warp speed, this so you can steal shovelfuls from your dining partner's plate when she's not paying attention.\n\nProbably the best reason to visit El Chorro, other than the aforementioned is the stunning view of Camelback mountain at sunset. Truly remarkable.\nI recommend patio seating for the best view.\n\nThe next time I visit, I'm bringing a toaster along so I can electrocute myself after taking my last bite.\nMainly because I can't imagine life getting any better than this.
