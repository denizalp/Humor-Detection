been a regular at this place but the last time we were there will be our last. Cains is better alternative! \n\n1) they ask you how you want your burger made but it's never delivered the way you ask. I ask for med rare but always get well done. \n2) their shirts say be nice or else but they themselves are not that nice. the place is like a click, they choose who they're nice to. \n3) the food is drenched in salt and you feel like a prune even after drinking a gallon of water. I felt like crap the rest of the night after eating here\n4) they nickel and dime you for extras. especially the PACKAGED avocado! gross
