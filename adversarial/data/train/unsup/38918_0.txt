Man, this place really knocked it out of the park. It's clean and spacious on the inside, so it's got a really good, welcoming vibe. Definitely a good place to wander into on a cold night.\n\nService is consistently attentive; several things were off the menu that night so they had to make some special arrangements with us, but it never negatively affected the meal. Rather, it felt like they were working to find solutions, which is what a really good restaurant does. Conversely, it never felt like they were hovering over us.\n\nBut, as with all restaurants, the selling point of a restaurant is the food, and the food delivers here. I went with the creamed corn and grilled shrimp, and I have to say it was the best creamed corn I've ever eaten: spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. My girlfriend's ravioli was equally delicious and would have been so even without the bacon in it. \n\nThe entrees are a little on the smaller side, so I would suggest getting an appetizer. The mussels worked really well for us.
