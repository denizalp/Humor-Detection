Dr. Yu is rude!!!  this was my referral to Dr. Yu from my primary dr. The females taking me back have no personality what so ever. I am a medical assistant and I  always introduce myself to new patients and try and be a little friendly even if it's for a minute if we're really busy. Not these girls. The biggest complaint I have and is the reason I'm even writing this,  Dr. Yu and I were talking about sleep apnea and I told him I don't think I have it because my husband has it and I don't seem to have the symptoms and he called me \"a little chubby and  that could cause it\" which I know I'm not the skinniest person in the world I'm fine with that but working in the medical field for almost 6 years that's not what u say to someone especially how rude he said it... every dr I have worked with always mentions a patients bmi or something similar. Never called a patient chubby or fat.. also he was talking really fast about the meds he was putting me on so I had to ask the nurse practitioner again what he said and what meds I'm getting. I was just very unhappy. Luckily I'm not letting it ruin my day!!!
