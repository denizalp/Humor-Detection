When I first went into this store, I thought it was magical. The decor captivated me. I have bought jewelry here and a very beautiful, great quality hand made leather bag for my husband for a very good price. They have unique pieces from all over the world, from jewelry to decor to musical instruments, essential oils, etc. Customer service is impeccable. Great place to buy unique and beautiful gifts or just beautify your home. Highly recommend.
