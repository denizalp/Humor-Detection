This place is downright amazing, I had a great time. The bartender was super nice and the dancer that approached me was so smooth! He even made my awkward self feel very comfortable--gave me the best lap dance of my life. \n\nAnd his chest was E V E R Y T H I N G. \n\n\n100% 10\/10 would come again.
