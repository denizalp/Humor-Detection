Khao Soi with chicken with Thai level spiceness...waited 35 minutes for this delicious meal. Not sure why this restaurant has only a few servers working. \n\nThe meal was huge and packed with chunky chicken and lots of flavour. The crisp noodles were my favourite to eat with....fun to play with your food. The curry reminds me of Guyanese curry mixed with coconut milk.
