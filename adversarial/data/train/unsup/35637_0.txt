SUPER CHEAP!!\n\nThis is located in Vegas and it was a wallet saver for sure! They have very small menu so it's really easy to decide what you want.\n\nTheir food was not bad for the price. Their staff are nice and friendly as well.\nI like how everything was simple.\n\nIt's extremely busy so you gotta wait a bit and I guess that's the downside of it.\n\nTheir milkshake was excellent too! I gotta have more of those next time I go!
