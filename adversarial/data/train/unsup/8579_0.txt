DO NOT RENT A U-HAUL FROM THIS LOCATION.\n\nThe customer service is HORRIBLE.  The employee there worked sooo slowly that I believe he intentionally wanted to inconvenience us.  They have a sign written at the front counter that reads \"service is as good as you are\"... like, wtf?\n\nI spoke to one of U-Hauls district managers about my experience at Speedy Motors.  He said they were taking the matter seriously and assured me that this wasn't the first complaint they had received about this location.  I can only hope that U-Haul will get rid of these jerks as one of their distributors and find some other place who will do it.\n\nDo yourself a favour and DO NOT pick up your U-Haul at this location.  Honestly, you might have to go a bit further to pick it up, but in the end you'll save time without having to deal with the slow idiots behind the counter.
