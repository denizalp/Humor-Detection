If your looking for a real hole in the wall, no help, no service kind of bar than this is your spot. Would have had a 40$ tab but couldn't get help because Christin and the other chick were too busy stuffin their face with nachos. So I would not recommend but if you're looking for a 3$ non happy hour beer with limited selection up to kilt lifter with no service than this is your spot. And as I write this we have rookies barfing in the bath room.
