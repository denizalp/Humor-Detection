Worst front desk staff!!! My appointment was at noon and I've had to wait as long as 20 minutes before. I signed in at 11:55 and asked where the bathroom was. At 12:30 I asked how much longer and the woman said Oh do you have an appointment. I said yes I signed in and checked I had an appointment. She said well you didn't give us your paperwork. I said I don't have any it's electronic and usually you call me up and ask once I've signed in.  I've been scolded in the past if I try to give paperwork before being called up. \nThey made me wait for the last half hour for nothing. I asked what the point is of signing in if they don't look at the sheet. The front desk woman said we dont always see people when they sign in. I replied that I asked her where the bathroom was when I signed in. She just gave me a blank stare and no apology or anything. Three minutes later I was called for my appointment. I definitely avoid this location in the future.
