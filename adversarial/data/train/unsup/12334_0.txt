I travel to Cleveland every other week and lizardville is always a must for an evening.  Was there last week and they change the food menu, now it's just a nice bar with bad bar food like winking lizard.  Will have to find a new place, sorry for those who never had a chance to go there when the food was great, really added to the nice whisky selection
