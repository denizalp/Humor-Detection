Unlike the other review I actually stayed here. Was during a convention (which I was not attending), and since I arrived late at night and only needed a room to sleep in for a few hours, I did not want to pay the $360 that MGM was charging for what would be a few hours of rest, before I checked into a much much better hotel.  That was a big mistake. This is the second worst motel I have ever stayed in, the other was the Berkeley Inn in Berkeley.   \n\nHere is the actual review of the room:\n\nSheets\/Blanket: Felt dirty and scratchy.\nHeater\/AC: Did not work very well.\nBathroom: Very few towels, dirty looking floor, shower head that was about chest height (I am 5-10) and to top it off, my girlfriend at the time flushed the toilet and broke the handle. \nTV: Old, I mean old from the early 1980's. Did however, have a free porn channel. \n\nStay away, this part of Vegas is called the \"Gateway District\". It is literally one of the worst parts you could stay in, unless you want to get mugged or die.
