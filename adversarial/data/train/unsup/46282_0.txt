Finally, there is a new restaurant in the old Sliver Spoon Cafe of the San Carlos Hotel. Serving Breakfast & Lunch. Omelet's, B&G, waffles, soups, salads, sandwiches, coffee, and gelato. Plus, a few specials each day including a daily soup. \n\nThe service was friendly and the place was clean. Mismatched chairs add to the cute bistro feel. The counter can get a little crowded when ordering, but that's not really a deal breaker. Until the hot summers create sweaty customers, I guess. \n\nI ordered the Cobb salad to go and had to wait just a few minutes. I very very pleased with my salad and I am a bit of a salad freak. The Cobb seemed to get better with every bite with a generous amount of bleu cheese, bacon, and grilled chicken breast.. I choose Balsamic vinaigrette (of the creamy variety) and it was yummy. Nice mix of romaine, red leaf & iceberg lettuce. I'm picky about my lettuce and this lettuce was fresh and green, not pale and wilty. \n\nWhile this was just my first time here, I look forward to going back again and again! Maybe in a few hours for some gelato . . .
