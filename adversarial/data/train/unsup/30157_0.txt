Worth every single penny and then some! Jennifer truly is an expert! She took the time to review all the products I was using and suggest some changes based on my budget. She didn't push me to purchase anything, but I did end up getting three products which I LOVE. I am getting married in less than two months and was panicking over my broken out skin. It's been two weeks since my facial and I look like a different person! I'm using less product and having way better results. I wish I had taken a before picture because words can't describe how happy I am with the changes I'm already seeing. I would highly recommend her to anyone!
