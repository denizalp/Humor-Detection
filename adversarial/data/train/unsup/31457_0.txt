After taking over the previous dive of a sports bar, I was curious to see what the folks associated with CYD had to offer Fort Mill. The interior looks slightly different after they took some time to re-do it. I wouldn't consider it to be a sports bar anymore, more of a family restaurant. Even though they still have the flat screens from the previous bar, they are not open late like a sports bar.\n\nThey definitely disappoint on the food side of things. The waitress talked us into the catfish \"bites\" as an appetizer, as you can see in the photo - \"bites' is not an adequate description! You could definitely consider these a meal by themselves! They were tasty indeed.\n\nI ordered the meatloaf with side of collards and red beans\/rice. The meatloaf was very good! So huge I forced myself to stop eating half way or I would need to be rolled out to my truck! Jeez. My friend is a po-boy connoisseur and he came back with two deep fried thumbs up after chowing down on the shrimp pro-boy.\n\nThey do not offer draft beer, but they have a very small list of bottled beer including some Louisiana favorites. They bar can also assist in select liquor drinks. (Editor's Note: Unless you;re craving a vodka\/red bull, they do not stock red bull.)\n\nSimple. Cajun. Goodness. I would return.
