The best pizza I've ever eaten!!  Service is personal and outstanding. Highly recommend!!!\n\nWide variety of choices including specialty pizzas. Veggie pizza is made with fresh vegetables! Have subs, calzones and strombolis, salads, and lots more.\n\nWhen I need a place to just get away, this is my hide-away.  Shhh... don't give away my secret.
