I am officially the owner of a fabulous pair of cowboy (cowgirl, to be exact) boots thanks to this store.\n\nLocated in Old Town Scottsdale, this is one of two Saba's locations only a mere block apart from one another. Despite the name and merchandise, they could not be more different in service, with this location exuding friendliness and smiles from the get go.\n\nI tried on pair after pair after pair... and the sweet older man helping me was so patient and helpful. From answering all my questions to giving me some advice on different boots and styles. I walked out confident and content with the pair I chose. My wallet however was not as happy but a girl needs a good pair of cowboy boots so it was totally worth it!
