Decent AYCE sushi spot on Southwest of Vegas. Lunch is $21.95 and dinner is $25.95 which is in the same price range with other AYCE sushi spots. Even with our party of +15 people, service was attentive throughout. Staffs here are extremely friendly too.\n\nSince our group had so many people, we decided to have a lead person order for everyone. Of course it didn't work out when one person yelled out \"wait I want tuna,\" while another yelled out \"Give me lots of Salmon.\" Confused as mofo, I just ate whatever was given in front of me. \n\nSomewhat disappointed that sushi here had a dense block of rice which I am most decidedly not a fan of. All fish tasted fresh so that redeemed a little. I must say their Uni was the only memorable item. My favorite AYCE sushi spot Sakana limits on uni so I liked the fact that I was able to order uni until I fell in Koma. Ha. It was fresh and buttery.\n\nStuffed myself with lots of sushi then finished off with a scoop of green tea ice cream which sadly ended up falling off my spoon and down to the floor. Our party all left satisfied after a great time sharing sushi. Not my favorite sushi spot but I wouldn't mind coming back again.
