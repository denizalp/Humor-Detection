Great food, but absolutely horrible service especially at the check out. The guy who helped us with the bagels was rude off the bat, but once we decided to head over to sit down to eat, he started staring at us and complaining about us in our presence to the cashiers. We were very rudedly told, almost reprimanded, that we were not allowed to sit down if we were going to take out the food. We just didnt know! We understand that there are policies, but the way that the staff explained that to us was very inapproprate. It was as if they were mad and we were children that needed to be scolded. When paying for the food, the cashier rudely told us that we cant do that. We ate our food in our car, annoyed and upset. The food was good, but not good enough to come back despite the bad customer service.
