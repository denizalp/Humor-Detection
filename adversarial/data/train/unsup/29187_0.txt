I love Thai food and always judge a Thai restaurant on their curry, usually green or panang. I ordered the Singapore green curry and pad Thai to try this spot out. \n\nThe green curry consistency was thick and gelatinous, which I do not like. There was not much liquid in the dish like usual green curry. It was also very spicy and they did not ask my spice level preference so I assume it is pre-made. I also found a dark eyelash in my bowl while I was eating it. Not what I want to see in my dinner!\n\nThe pad Thai noodles were rubbery and it was just 'okay'. A little dry. \n\nI got take out on my way home from work. Although the price was good ($17ish for the 2 dishes), I will not be returning here. The search continues to find the best Thai food that I can pick up on my route home from work!
