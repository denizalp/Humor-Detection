Warning friends, if you PARK valet or handicap, your car might get a dent on your fender from the Valet guy. Check your car out. Or carry lots of insurance, making dining even more expensive there. \nI was parked in handicap and he dented my rear fender, but unfortunately I didn't catch him.\nMe, next time I will have to sit by the window and watch the car every second.
