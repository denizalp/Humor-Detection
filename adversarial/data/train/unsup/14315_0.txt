Pretty expensive for just dessert and pastries, but hey everything is expensive in Vegas. This location is better than the one at the Bellagio, that one is hard to find and hidden near where all the conference rooms are at. This one is bigger and much easier to find.  Love how they have different stations for everything. I have to admit the pastries, Macarons and other treats are to die for, you can get a crazy sugar rush from just standing in this sugar store. Will definitely be back for more deliciousness.
