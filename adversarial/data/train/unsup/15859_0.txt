Not a steakhouse. \n\nI repeat - NOT a steakhouse!\n\nPerhaps my Central Valley roots are showing but I immediately began thinking which cut of beef I'd be opting for during our coworking lunch date. \n\nTo my surprise, this was anything but a steakhouse. Truth is, I rarely eat red meat. Which is likely why I'm anemic, so when I saw this little shop of salads my heart skipped a beat. \n\nThe menu was small but adequate. Overwhelming menus are so pass√©. Keep it simple is the way to go - and they use that motto in more than just their menu. Their ingredients are simple too. Actual healthy raw fruit and veggies. Natural goodness that you don't have to worry about. Real food. Vegan choices. Gluten free choices. All the foods for all the peoples!\n\nI immediately ordered up a meaty bowl of spicy Korean steak (hey, I needed the meat!). The brown rice v forbidden rice was a choice I failed on. Always go with forbidden. In life and at the ChopShop.
