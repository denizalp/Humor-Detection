Hitting up Cadillac Ranch just in time for their Happy Hour!  As advertised, it's Mondays through Fridays from 4 pm to 8 pm - half off all drinks and half off appetizers.  (It's actually $7 select appetizers, but half off all drinks still!)\n\nWe ordered a couple of drinks off their cocktail menu: \n* Pear...fect 59 Cadillac \"Enjoy our signature cocktail made with Grey Goose La Poire and fresh pear puree.\" ($10) - We were surprised to see it arrive in a martini glass, something to think about if you're expecting a pint glass.  It was sweet and you can definitely taste the pear puree.\n\n* Seville \"Experience a delightful and refreshing blend of Sauza Hornitos Plata, Citronge, Fresh Mango Puree and Fresh Lime Juice.\" ($10) - This arrived in a pint glass and you could definitely taste the alcohol in it.  Decent overall.  \n\nWe were initially going to order a bunch of their half off appetizers, but changed our minds after we saw their $7 select appetizer menu.  \n\nThey did offer a Complete Dinner for Two for $29.95 from Mondays to Fridays from 4 pm to 8 pm.  (Add 2 Well Drinks - $34.95)  You can choose one select appetizer to share, one select entree each, and one select dessert to share.\n\n* Kettle Chips \"Thinly sliced potatoes deep fried to perfection and served with garlic cream sauce and blue cheese crumbles.  Finished with a Balsamic drizzle and scallions.\" - A hearty portion of tasty potato chips with a yummy creamy garlic sauce and a decent amount of blue cheese crumbles.\n\n* Candied Pecan Pork Chop \"One thick-cut chops grilled and crusted with candied pecans.  Served over caramelized onion mashed potatoes and green beans.\" - Their regular entree course includes two pork chops, but you only get one in the dinner special.  A nice crust on that pork chop.\n\n* Bourbon Sirloin Steak \"8 oz. beef sirloin seasoned and broiled to perfection, then placed on a demi glaze.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans.\" - The regular entree course is a 10 oz cut.  Ours was also served with corn.  \n\n* Strawberry Fried Cheesecake - Only available on the dinner special.  Asked the waitress about it and she couldn't say much beyond that she really liked it.  She didn't think it was deep-fried since it wasn't oily.  It's actually a flaky pastry with the cheesecake mixture inside and covered with cinnamon sugar.  Served with a strawberry sauce and cream.\n\nFood and service were okay, nothing special.  The busboys were quick about clearing out the dishes as they needed.  We probably wouldn't eat or drink here without it being happy hour or they were offering a special.  \n\nSome specials they are offering: \n\nSundays: Salsa Night, 8 pm to close with a salsa instructor from 9 pm to 10 pm\n$3 Corona and Corona Light (from 9 pm to close)\n$5 House Margaritas and Cadillac Margaritas (from 9 pm to close)\n\nMondays: Kids 12 and under eat free, from 11 am to 10 pm with purchase of any full priced entree, free bull rides for all kids
