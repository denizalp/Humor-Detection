3.5 stars. Love tapas (a favorite cuisine) and was pleasantly impressed with Jaleo. \n\nCuisine 4-star\nService 3-star\nAmbiance 4-star\nValue 3-star\n\nRECOMMEND:\n- Pan con tomate & Manchego: satisfying crusty bread with delicious manchego. While tasty, this is filling and would not recommend for those interested in trying more dishes.\n- Tortilla de patatas al momento: cooked to order ftw\n- Chilled almond and garlic soup with crabmeat and green grapes\n- Sliced apple and fennel salad with Manchego cheese, walnuts and Sherry dressing: light and refreshing\n- Warm Brussels sprouts salad with apricots, apple and Serrano ham: satisfying, hearty with the Serrano\n- Steamed mussels with bay leaf and olive oil: didn't discern the Bay leaf but tasty nonetheless\n- Seared scallops with pine nuts: delish!\n- Gambas al ajillo - can't go wrong\n\nExcellent restaurant layout. High-energy, see-and-be-seen, that Cosmo vibe!
