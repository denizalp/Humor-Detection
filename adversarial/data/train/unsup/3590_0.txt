It was awful trying to find a decent lunch spot for the July 4th weekend at Caesar's. Bacchanal had a nearly 90 minute wait for a $53 brunch and we were denied at Mesa Grill because they had a dress code for lunch (screw you Flay). Our fallback was the more casual Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill.\n\nAnything with Ramsay's namesake should scream quality and consistency, but most of the plates fell short of expectations. We started off with the little piggy deviled eggs, which were presented with the yolk separated for self-serving. From there, I went with the shepherd's pie, which came lukewarm. The mashed potatoes had an unpleasant texture and I didn't get much of the cheddar cheese. The ground lamb and peas had no distinguishing flavor. The steak & ale pot pie came off as salty, but at least I enjoyed the crust. \n\nThe sides we tried included the truffle fries and the lobster mac & cheese. The fries were far too similar to the regular fries and didn't have enough truffle oil. The lobster mac & cheese was worse than the Kraft blue box. While there was a generous helping of lobster meat, the mac & cheese itself was very watery and no crispy crust. We declined the popular sticky toffee pudding for next time.\n\nOur waitress was great and sold us on their imported beer menu. Her entertaining small talk was probably the highlight of our meal.
