It's ok! It's handy having it there near the library and metro, and Herve is exactly right, the huge windows and free wifi make for a chill space to spend some time, especially in the winter when we need those sunshine vitamins! The woman who works here the majority of the times that I've passed by is a total sweetheart who recognizes every regular and has a professional attitude and kind smile. \n\nThe food and coffee is Café Vienne standard, these spots are basically equivalent to Second Cups these days ie; truly not great. I like the oatmeal cookies which remind me of my high school cafeteria, and the corsé filter coffee ain't good, but it ain't bad!
