Still one of my favourite Japanese AYCE place! Been coming here for years and the quality has been consistently good \n\nsashimi is fresh\nunagi rice is so good! (Sometimes I hit too much sauce) \nGold fried shrimp is also a must \n\nA good variety of food overall \n\nService is fast and staffs are friendly \n\nPay cash and get 10% off!
