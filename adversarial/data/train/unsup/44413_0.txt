I DO NOT recommend moving here. The only recent good reviews they have are bc they had a contest that you're entered in by leaving them a good review. I've only been here about 3 months and the water has been shut off probably 10 times. They CONSTANTLY lose packages. ONE of the times they lost my package for like a week, I called the post office and they remembered dropping it off here so I went back to tell them and they magically found it. It also ended up being empty and I had to file a missing mail claim. Once again I'm in the exact same position where they can't find a package usps says was delivered. I'm at the point where I don't feel like I can get anything sent here ever again. Most of the staff acts like they don't even care. My mailbox was broken for the majority of the time I've been here and it took me going to the office every day bugging them bc I needed my bills out of my mailbox. They've been renovating the paint and Parking lot of the complex the whole time I've been here to make it look nice on the outside while having sooo many issues on the inside that they don't seem to be working on. The reviews were horrible when I moved in too but it looked so nice on the surface that I decided to give them a chance.. Don't fall for it like I did.
