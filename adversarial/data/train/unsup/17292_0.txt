If you are a Filipino or non-white do not buy ping golf products.  They are a racist company.  I went there in 1997 to get fitted.  When I was there I was told to sign in and wait.  I waited for a long time but did not mind at all because I like ping irons. I like the feel, forgiveness and it can be customized. Also it was local.  So when it was my turn, the male person that called my name had an expression on his face of disappointment and disgust.  He gave an excuse that they were no time for him to custom fit me.  I am thinking, WHAT there was nobody else there waiting to get custom fitted but me.  Also if there was no time why would the person at the reception area tell me to sign in. I did not want to argue with the guy because who wants to get fitted with a racist.  I know that a racist guy does not equal ping golf is racist company but when it happened again then it must be the culture of ping golf to treat non-whites as none deserving customers and should be ignored. The second incident was when I wanted to cut an inch off to shorten my ping anser putter and adjust for 2 degrees flat. When I picked it up I noticed no difference at all with the length and loft when I was doing my putting motion.  In the corner of my eye I noticed the guy was laughing silently.  He thought I did not noticed but I did.  Told him that I will just pay for the grip and not pay for the shortening and the loft adjustment. When I went home I took all my ping irons, putters and ping golf bag and went to Vans Golf to trade them.  I was so hurt and angry that I had to do that.  I missed my pings but I can't buy and use them when I know they are racist company.
