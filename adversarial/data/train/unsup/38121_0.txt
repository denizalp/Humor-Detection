My fav cheese stand in the Market!  Ive been taking my daughter there since she was born..she walks behind the counter and they give her a tiny cup of local yogurt and a slice of Swiss to go.   They all know her name and treat us VERY well.  They have lots of local foods, which I love.  Please support these fine ladies and get cheesy!
