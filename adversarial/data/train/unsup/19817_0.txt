Fun coaster ride. I had more fun viewing the sights, while receiving whiplash, than the actual thrill. The thrill was ok. I could be a bit biased because I'm a Six Flags fan. So the intensity of this coaster was a bit watered down but just enough to give you that \"Yay I'm on a roller coaster\" feeling. We did sit in the front. It was a fair ride.\n\nThe cost to ride is $14 and $7 for a second whip around. $10 to ride if you are a resident. The wait time was minimal. About 6 minutes at the most. We went on a Thursday around 2p.\n\nBefore your ride they snap your picture and once again while you are in motion. They charge $17 for one picture and $22 for two. \n\nHappy that I did do it. The memory is more important than anything. If you like roller coasters it's worth the experience :)
