I will give yardbird a two star just on presentation. First off I was blown away by the prices of the food considering it's southern food. Southern food is usually cheap or reasonable.  I didn't expect the prices to be as high as they are. However, I don't mind paying for quality food. I ordered the chicken and waffles ($36) shrimp and grits ($28) , and Mac n cheese ($10) for an appetizer . As soon as the server walked away from the table the Mac n cheese came out within 5 minutes . I thought to myself hmm that's kinda quick, but didn't mind it because it's Mac n cheese and maybe it's pre- prepared given its a side. So I began to eat the Mac n cheese which wasn't to bad, but wasn't anything special and holy cow the chicken n waffles is being served (approx 5minutes) . Now I'm concerned because fried chicken cooked to order should take longer. As expected the chicken was lukewarm as if it had been sitting under a warmer. The chicken was cool to touch and was soggy. I tasted the chicken and the chicken was very very average and to top it off wasn't fresh. The waffle was dry and had a bourbon inside. Terrible terrible mix. Approx 10 minutes later the shrimp n grits arrived . The grits were under cooked and hard and had no flavor like it it was nothing like southern style grits . The total bill came out to $86.00 . I wasn't pleased at all given the price of the food and quality. I will never go back. Eat there at your own risk!
