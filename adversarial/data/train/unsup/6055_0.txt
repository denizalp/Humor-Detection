Am I really that picky? I don't like \"chain\" restaurants much to start with....but I thought I would give them a try. \nIck! Can I say \"Houston's\" but a few notches below?? \nFirst of all, they brought out their \"bread\" which were the greasiest croissants I have ever had. I had to eat one of course.....\nI found the menu terribly B-O-R-I-N-G! All the usual boring menu items...nothing fun or exciting. I had the veggie burger. Since the place seemed like a Houston's I thought I would compare. Houston's definitely out shines theirs. It was just ok. My \"dinner friend\" had their swordfish. It looked like something served at a hospital cafeteria. It did taste just ok. They also have no clue how to make a dirty martini. Hello? Olive Juice, please!  My glass of Hess Chardonnay was thankful not \"corked\". \nThe only reason I would come back would be for a glass of wine (or a bottle) since the atmosphere was not bad and it is so close to home.
