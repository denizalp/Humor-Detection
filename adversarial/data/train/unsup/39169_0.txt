Went to Vegas to celebrate 29th wedding anniversary. Went late at night around 11pm after peak crowds. They close at 1am. Our waiter Michael D was great at explaining the menu.  The sea bass was great and just melts in your mouth. I enjoyed the pork belly ramen (spicy). Service was great by everyone. I inquired about cold sake and he offered Dewazakura Dewasansan Junmai Ginjo. It has a light and subtle fruity flavor. Very nice. He topped our evening off with a nice chocolate cake topped with ice cream in a maple syrup. Delicious. We will definitely back.
