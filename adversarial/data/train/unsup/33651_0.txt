Okay COME ON! When you are in LAS VEGAS and you tack a CELEBRITY name to a CELEBRITY chef, expect to wait and expect to pay! I cant believe people are shocked!\n\nOkay, now on the MY review....\n\nI just ate here Friday night and couldn't have been more pleased. We had a reservation for 7pm and were sat right away. As for everyone complaining about service we had a waiter, a water boy, a bus boy, someone even brought a little stool for me to put my purse on and someone came and swapped our wine glasses and utensils between each course. \n\nYes it was expensive, but we know that going into it. Also, when you order a steak expect the meat on a plate, nothing else. The bread basket was nice and tasty, the guacamole left little to be desired, but my Petite Filet was delicious! I ordered it Medium with the Red Wine sauce and it was delicious. We also had the Skirt Steak and Halibut which I didn't hear anyone complain about! As for sides we just shared some good old Green Beans and Mash. Nothing fancy, but very tasty.
