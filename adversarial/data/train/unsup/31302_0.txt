My daughter Kristen attends the Wigwam location. She's has been taking lessons since June and I'm extremely happy with this swim school. The reason I decided to pick safe splash was because the swimming classes are in a indoor swimming pool and air conditioning compared to the henderson recreation center swimming pools, that are not indoor and not air conditioned. I had no idea what to expect when I came to SafeSplash Swim School, but I wanted to give it a try , and I am extremely happy! The instructors a awesome and are very patient with my daughter and other students, plus they make it fun! My daughter enjoys the classes and has grown tremendously in her swimming abilities! I'm no longer worried when we is in the pool. She has much more to learn but she understands and knows the basics of floating and treading water, which makes me feel less stressed near a pool with her. Thank you to the instructors, Mr Jeff, Mr Noah, Ms Amanda, Ms Betty and staff! Keep of the good work ! Thank you ! Thank you !
