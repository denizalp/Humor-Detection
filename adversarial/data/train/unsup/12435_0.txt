My husband and I had the most amazing little ceremony here. The staff is fantastic. I made an appointment online about a week ahead of time. We were married on a Saturday afternoon. We arrived about 10 min. late but it wasn't a problem. We had to wait a little for 2 weddings that were ahead of us (this didn't take long). I received our photos on Monday (7 photo package). There was an issue with the photos sent to us, but I let the chapel know and they fixed the issue and sent us a few extra for free. I purchased our wedding video the next morning and it was sent to me a couple of hours later. Our photos were BEAUTIFUL. The video was GREAT. The minister was lovely and her speech was BEAUTIFUL. The ceremony room was equally BEAUTIFUL. Overall, we had a wonderful experience and I would recommend this chapel to anyone.
