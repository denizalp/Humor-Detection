A great place for gluten free people. They have gluten free buns and bread and the french fries are gluten free. A welcome addition to places to eat. Prices are a little on the high side. They need more coupons and specials. Very busy and noisy because there just aren't enough restaurants in area. Only have been one time looking forward to going and checking out some more of the menu
