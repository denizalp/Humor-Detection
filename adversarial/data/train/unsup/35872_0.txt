Rude staff. Food - underwhelming at best.\n\nThey were out of corn tortillas. I found this out after I had ordered and forgot to specify corn. I went over to correct my order and was told they were out which is why I was not given a choice. Would have liked to know this before I ordered...I asked for them to leave out the tortillas and received the most pathetic looking piece of fish in the world - small and flavorless. My drink was slammed down on my table with no eye contact from the server, and now I am waiting way too long for my bill.\n\nUpdate: they gave me a 10% discount,  still 2 stars though,  but I appreciate the gesture.
