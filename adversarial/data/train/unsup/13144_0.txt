What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas right? \n\nHa! Not with me, I LOVE to share my adventures, well some of them at least ;-) Can't reveal ALL the good stuff, however I can tell you that one of the places I like to stay in Vegas is The Mirage. I have a rule, and my one rule I'll ONLY stay on the strip, I like to be in the middle of the action. The Mirage has always been good to me which is why I keep coming back, they always offer me a room upgrade when I come in so I've ended up with suites every time I've stayed here (maybe they think I'm someone I'm not? Whatever it is I'm not complaining) Reality is, I really only paying to store my things and to on occasion sleep for a few hours, other than that, I'm out living it up in Sin City.
