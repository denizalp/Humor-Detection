Rule #1 of the Phoenix Metro area: Strip malls hide more secrets than your crazy ex. Mom was right, looks aren't everything. And a Safeway parking lot can house a day spa that is just as luxurious as places with much better digs. \n\nThe woman that shared all of these gems of wisdom with me, my mother, took me to Athena for the first time. We went for pedicures; the service was so-so but I was blown away by the atmosphere. \n\nThe salon area is a high-ceilinged room with Greek columns,  and a dome expertly painted with cherubs dancing around a sky scene. The nail area was behind the salon, and it featured several high-end massaging chairs and nice nail stations. The room also featured a large window that faced a fenced off area behind the spa with water falling across the window. The massage rooms are centered around an in the ground pebble-tech jacuzzi. This area is so beautiful and well designed; it is probably the crown jewel of an overall beautiful spa. \n\nThe staff is very friendly and try to go above and beyond to create a relaxing environment. Since I have no problem kicking back, I had a fabulous time. My poor mother, who usually hates when strangers touch her, loved her pedicure and massage as well. \n\nMaybe you don't want to believe everything she says about your love interests, but take mom's advice on this one: Athena Day Spa is a great place to get pampered in the West Valley.
