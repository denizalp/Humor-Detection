Like Geoff I needed a ride from PHX to Scottsdale. I didn't get Benny, but another Ridesmart affiliated driver. He showed up on time and his car was clean and comfortable. The driver's command of English was fairly rudimentary, but he was able to get by ok and got me to my destination smoothly. I was able to prepay for the ride, but had to use cash for gratuity.
