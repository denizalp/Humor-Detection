I came here on a Sunday for the Jazz Brunch. The view, the ambiance, and the service were great. It's not a huge buffet, but everything on average was good. There were cold crab legs, shrimp, oysters, crawfish, lamb, gumbo, sausage, and a great breakfast-oriented selection you can order through the waiter. I recommend the poached egg with barbeque smoked pork.\n\nThe only unexpected thing was the 10% \"entertainment tax\" they add on to the regular sales tax if you come during the brunch when they have live music. So instead of a $59 brunch, it's actually a $65 brunch + tax + tip.
