Li Wah is an authentic Chinese restaurant along with Bo Loong and Siam Cafe located at the heart of Asia town in Cleveland. As you sit here, do realize that there are two menus -- the American-Chinese menu a.k.a. the solo menu for \"westerners\" accustomed to having one meal all for themselves OR the authentic Chinese menu, a.k.a. the group menu which features several large dishes meant to be shared.\n\nIn the group menu, I'd go for steamed whole grouper, yang chow fried rice, salt-baked fish fillet or pork. If in a larger group, one could also order a set course menu of several courses. Again, all served in the middle of the table, meant to be shared.\n\nIf you're here for dimsum, order things like the pork shumai, shrimp dumpling, pork spareribs, steamed pork buns, or chicken feet if you're up for it.\n\nIf you're clueless or actually appear clueless, they'll give you the American menu so that you can enjoy your General Tso chicken, whoever he is.
