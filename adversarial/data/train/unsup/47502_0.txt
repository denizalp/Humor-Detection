Friend and I had a fantastic dinner at this little Italian kitchen.  Authentic Italian food served up in a simple, non pretentious setting. The servers are friendly and personable as well as knowledgeable about the menu.  \n\nPortions are quite large for pizza and pasta.  They don't skimp out one bit. I had the house chardonnay which was great and only $6 for the glass.  We spent about $40 for two entrees and one glass of wine.  We left feeling very satisfied.
