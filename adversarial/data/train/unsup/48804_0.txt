Service was excellent from entrance to exit.   Entrees?  Not so much.\n\nHave you ever sat around a table talking and when the food arrives, everyone just keeps talking?  Nary a word about what has been placed in front of them.  It has been two weeks since we dined and no one has ever said a word about their food.\n\nI ordered one of the night's specials, Short Rib Ravioli.\n(sigh)\nThe \"short rib\" came as ground meat and just a scant dollop at that.  Afterward, I remember sitting in the Love Theatre thinking, \"what did we just spend money on\".\n\nWith four diners, the bill was substantial.  The food was not.
