shopped at living spaces 4 times, bought quite a bit of furniture, show room is so nice and the sales people are very friendly, but once you make your purchase..BEWARE, 2 out of 4 of my purchases I received badly damaged furniture...and that's where living spaces completely SCREWS you, they will take your money very quickly but once it comes to fixing their mistakes, it will be a long drawn out process!! they will expect you to pay for delivery to return their broken furniture, then YOU must take pictures and submit them to living spaces and wait around until someone decides to approve or deny them! so NEVER again will I shop with living spaces, terrible customer service! What a shame
