Great people here. The little outlet inside Target is where I've gone for contacts and glasses for some time now. You can expect the same good service from them as you would from Target.\n\nDez and Gabe were taking care of filling my contact prescription today and were super busy today. Dez (who I'm assuming is the manager, or \"Team Lead\", or \"Optical Grandmaster\", whatever Target is calling their managers these days) was juggling training Gabe and helping two other associates assist customers. Considering how busy they were he was doing a fantastic job; definitely overburdened at that moment but didn't once let it show, smiles the whole time! \n\nUnfortunately my companies' vision insurance isn't the best and I decided to pay out of pocket. Dez did everything he could to get me the best discounts and I was very pleased with the final price.\n\nThey can schedule eye exams for the Dr. next door and will handle all insurance claims. You can also schedule exams online at the Target Optical site. All questions I had about a rebate program were throughly answered as well. \n\nReally happy with my visit today. I spent a little more time here than I wanted but Dez and his team did superb! Great job, guys!
