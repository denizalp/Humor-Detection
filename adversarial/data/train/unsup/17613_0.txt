No doubt the coup de grace of yet another fabulous trip to Las Vegas. If you haven't been to the Fountains of the Bellagio, the experience can be summed up as this: decadent, unique, and memorable. \n\nAside from the obvious dancing streams of water that are in sync to the timeless voices of Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Dean Martin and many others that happen to be Vegas icons, the overall ambiance on this side of Las Vegas Blvd has the romantic and sexy, while at the same time, the strange & bizarre. The latter of which is attributed to the many sideshows that you will see passing you by: from half-nude women, magic shows, guys selling you $6 bottled water that they've obviously bought at Sam's Club for $3 a case, to the many other cartoon characters such as Mickey Mouse and a host of others. All of this, combined with water shows that run every 30 minutes, help to make one of the most exquisite hotels in the city (if not the world) stand out in comparison to what is offered by its neighbor, Caesar's Palace. \n\nOverall, this is a must-see when in Las Vegas. If you don't bring your spouse\/partner\/fling buddy here, you are truly loco in the head. \n\nViva Las Vegas! Viva la Bellagio!
