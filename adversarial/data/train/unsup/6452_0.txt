This place NEVER disappoints me. Probably the best pizza place In Las Vegas hands down. I've never left this place and thought anything less than 5 stars.\n\nThe Settebello pizza is a trademark. I get it every time. It's become my number one pizza BUT lately we've been getting the Diavolla. It's got crushed tomatoes, peppered salami, roasted bell peppers, crushed red peppers,  garlic and mozzarella. It's got a great kick. That pizza is slowly reaching for the number one spot. Also if you go during HH, you can get the Diavolla as a pizzette for just $5! What a steal. \n\nThe appetizers are amazing also as well as the salads. During HH they have this crostini con crudo which is so good. The balsamic reduction on it is delicious. \n\nThe best part about this place is the Tirimasu dessert. It is one of my favorites. It's not too big where you won't be able to finish it after a fulfilling meal. But it's not too small where you'll be like I need another. It's perfect way to end an amazing meal!
