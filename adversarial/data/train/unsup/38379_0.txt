A wonderful southern experience. Small little place but with big Heart. They have a long family dining table in the middle that is first come first serve and you find yourself sitting and talking to the people next to you. Very warm and comfortable vibe. The food was amazing!!! Spicy, sweet and southern. I loved everything we got. WWIII was amazing and the shrimp and grits to die for!!! Come early they fill up and they have outside seating as well!!! Great little brunch and place :) A+ $-$$
