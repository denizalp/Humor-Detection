Ellis Island has been selected as \"Best Slot Club,\" \"Best Karoke,\" and \"Best Microbrewery\" by the Las Vegas Review-Journal for 2007. For 2008, I would like to nominate them for \"Best Bang For Your Buck Restaurant.\" Does that category exist? No? Too bad, I'm making it happen.\n\nAn Enterprise Rent-A-Car employee at the nearby Westin Casuarina Hotel suggested that we go to Ellis Island when we asked her for a place to eat. It was just half a block down. Upon entering, I was enveloped with cigarette smoke. I hate the smell of cigarettes and all of its carcinogenic qualities. That was a very bad first impression. However, that was the only bad impression that this place left on me.\n\nWe went to their restaurant area and I almost couldn't believe my eyes when our waiter handed us the menus. Everything on the menu was incredibly cheap! I had never seen so many items on a menu that were below $10 before! But then my instincts kicked in and wondered if the price fit the quality of the food. \"You get what you pay for\" has always been my philosophy with anything you can buy. I was hoping they would give me the benefit of the doubt.\n\nIt was mid-morning so I decided to order their Ellis Island Classic Omelet with ham. I got it with bacon and it also came with toast and potato...potato...errrr...\"silver dollar potatoes.\" That's the best way I can describe them. What can I say...they shut me up. The breakfast was surprisingly tasty and fulfilling! The omelet wasn't overcooked and was filled with chopped ham. It was the best $5.99 I've spent, that's for sure! Oh, and how could I have almost forgotten about their orange juice.\n\n\"What? WTF is so awesome about orange juice?\"\n\nBaby, this orange juice was the shiiiiiiiit!!! It's totally fresh squeezed, homey!! But if it wasn't really fresh squeezed, I'd like to thank Tropicana for making some damn good OJ!! Get the large OJ, you won't regret it.\n\nCome here if you're on a budget and want good food. The next time I'm in Vegas, I gotta come here again and try out their steak and eggs that almost every Yelper has praised here.
