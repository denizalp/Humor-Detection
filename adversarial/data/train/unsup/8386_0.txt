We hit up The Dillinger after our hike at The Arizona Hot Springs! According to our Fitbits, we had burnt almost 3000 calories so anything and everything sounded delicious to us. We found The D, on Yelp and with a 4 star rating all 11 bellies from the hike were DOWN! The interior itself it pretty small, we had 11 peeps in our party so we had to sit at 2 separate tables, all good. Our server Stephanie was chilly answered all of our questions and was patient with us although we may have had a few extra demands. Thanks Stephanie! \n\nI ordered the chicken wings, bone in and naked (ofcourse!) along with their \"\"blazin' spicy sauce on the side for my dipping pleasure. Wings, definitely a 5 out of 5, the spicy dipping sauce I absolutely LOVEd! So good that I brought a little Extra home with me, yayuhhh! The wings were great! For my main I ordered the Palla burger which has a spicy jalapeño aioli, fried jalapeños and grilled onions, with jalapeño jack cheese! Burger was good, but it was great after I put some of the blazin' sauce atop! Burger and fries were so much, I ended up bringing  leftovers home with me! Double yay! \n\nAll in all, my belly was so happy to have food in it especially after that 8 mile hike. Be sure to eat here if you're in the area!
