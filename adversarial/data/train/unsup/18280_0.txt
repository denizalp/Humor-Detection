This is a tough one for me.  I've been to Switch several times and I'm really pretty torn.  I've experienced some pretty terrible service (both times on the patio) and I've only really loved one item on the menu.\n\nI tried the Spartan Pita the first time I was there, and the last time I was there I got the pesto chicken sandwich.  Both were pretty average, especially for the price.  I recently took the boy here and he ordered a burger- he said it wasn't anything special.  Lately I've been having some beef envy (as I am very close to the one year no beef mark) and I had zero desire to take a bit out of this piece of cow.  \n\nI'm a huge fan of their seafood crepe because it is delicious.  I also am a fan of $1.99 brunch beverages.  I'm just a bit weary of heading over here on a groggy Sunday morning when I need things like water constantly.\n\nI live way too close to not come back here often, and I'm hoping that other menu items and slightly more consistent service will make me feel less torn about Switch.
