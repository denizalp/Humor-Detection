I will never rent from this company again. I had a car for a month waiting for body work to get done. I found out this week that there was an issue with my insurance company continuing the rental and no one called me. My damage waiver was also discontinued because of a screw up on their end. They have refused to pick the rental up at my body shop because THEY don't have a relationship with them!!!! I have to drive to Enterprise which is out of may way and then they will take me to the body shop?????
