I am not a sports person and I don't go for the thousands of TVs on the walls. I go purely for one thing: the calamari. My sister and I regularly go there for our lunch dates JUST for the calamari. It is always so tender and the batter is nice and flavorful, kinda salty but that doesn't bother us. We literally devour it within minutes. It's amaze!
