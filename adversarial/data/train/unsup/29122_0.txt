Ok burgers and mac and cheese... not a fan of the poutines. Drinks are creative and sweet, everything is sugary if you like that kind of stuff. It is a burger bar so the decor is appropriate, but I always find that when the cheapest burger is 15 bucks... its a little expensive. Staff was nice but the place is insanely noisy... not a good place for a date unless you like screaming
