Blah.\n\nI've definitely experienced better.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered a cheeseburger \"all the way,\" meaning that it has all the toppings. I ordered a hamburger with mushrooms and grilled onions (boring, I know). We also got seasoned fries to share and two fountain drinks. We spent almost $30 on two burgers, seasoned fries, and two drinks. Honestly, I wouldn't mind spending that much or even more if this was some fancy burger joint, but it wasn't. There were piles of peanuts everywhere, fries in cups, and burgers wrapped in foil. All they need now is a ringmaster and an elephant to justify the pricing. \n\nOur food came out within 7 minutes or so. We ripped open the fries bag for easy access and the first thing I noticed when picking out my first fry was that they were all pretty soggy. Don't get me wrong, I used to love soggy fries as a child,  but nowadays my boyfriend and I both like our fries nice and crisp, which is not what we had here. The burgers were in the same state as the fries. I understand that they're known for wrapping their burgers in foil, but c'mon, that just makes them all sweaty and soggy. Since my boyfriend got everything on his burger, the bottom was soaked in sauce and not in the delicious Carl's Jr. lookin' way. He said it was okay, but didn't end up finishing it. Mine on the other hand wasn't drenched in sauce, BUT it did look like someone wrapped it in foil and b*tch slapped it. It was all round except for one side that was flat. How does that even happen between the time they finish making it and giving it to us? The mushrooms were all droopy an didn't exactly look fresh. I finished my burger, but I was not satisfied. It was just boring. I could've gotten a better tasting burger for much cheaper at many other places in town.
