I heard so many great things about this place. The reviews and photos of the food made it \"must try\" in my Yelp bookmarks. The food definitely did not disappoint. The service, on the other hand, was not the best. Having worked in the service industry in the past, I can understand how a short staff can really hurt service, so I was sympathetic to the fact that they were down a few people. When the crowd finally thinned out, however, we were still left wondering when someone would come and bring the check. As the last patrons in the dining area, we were still somewhat over looked. At one point, we observed the staff sitting at a table doing their side work. Not cool. Nobody was rude, they just didn't match service with atmosphere and food quality. That's a shame too because I'd love to tell people to give this place more business. If they are not staffed well enough to take care of their patrons, I can't safely say the trip would be worth it. Unless you're just a foodie without high expectations for service. \n\nAs far as the food goes, the tartar was tasty. The flatbread was fulfilling. The scallops were scrumptious. The spaghetti with mushroom and bacon cream sauce was sinfully satisfying. So good, in fact, that one of the people I was dining with, after eating her meal, ordered a plate for herself. \n\nIn summary:\nGo for the AMAZING food, but be prepared for mediocre service.
