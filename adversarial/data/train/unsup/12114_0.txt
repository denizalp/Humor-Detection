First time I thought food quality was good, but not great. \n\nSo we (group of five) went there again last Saturday night.  Wow, what a disappointment.  Food was complete dried out. \n\nAppetizers (large sampler) was so small.  So we ordered a second.  Was substantially larger, but not enough again.\n\nGot the donor kebab.  It was as tough as leather. They smothered it in sauce which had little to no flavor.  \n\nTwo from the party ordered lamb chops which they liked a lot.  Said it was delicious.\n\nService was very very slow.  \n\nNot going back any time soon.  Sorry, had hopes this could be a regular place to visit.
