I was recently forced to purchase a new car In a short timeframe.  I had no idea what I wanted or where to start.  I went to this dealership and had such a great experience!  Car shopping is stressful, but I felt very comfortable here.  There was no pressure, they encouraged me to take my time and look at everything. They invited me to a tent sale to give me the chance to look at all makes and models, in the end I purchased a new accord which seemed to be out of my price range, but they were very helpful in making it work for me, so that I could get the only car that made me excited.  All in all a great experience, or as good an experience as car shopping can get
