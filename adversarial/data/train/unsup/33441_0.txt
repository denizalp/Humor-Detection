Wife and I came back here because of a previously great experience here.\n\nWe were not disappionted. This place is a hidden gem. \n\nYou enter from a pr√≠vate elevator and enter into a beautiful dining area. \n\nPerfect place for a romantic dinner. Clean, elegant, great wait staff and reasonable priced.\n\nDon't miss out on this hidden gem when in Las Vegas.
