Okay food, but too expensive. The real downfall of this place is the disgustingly rude owner and his daughter, who clearly haven't been educated in proper common courtesy towards their customers and employees. I decided for this reason to make a yelp account and would like to share just one example of the last time I went:\n\nA law school buddy of mine and I went about a month ago and he asked for some tiramisu from the front. The man working there scooped a generous amount up, put it on a plate, and brought it to the register where the owner's likely mentally unstable and\/or deficient daughter proceeds to use expletives as she slaps half of the tiramisu off the plate and throws it out, just as my friend had his credit card out and about to pay for it! Furthermore, she proceeds to berate and harass the worker in front of the entire restaurant for giving my friend \"too much\" tiramisu. This made for an equally awkward and terrifying situation for everyone in the establishment. \n\nThe rest of the waitstaff are semi-friendly, but it doesn't offset the negative attitude and atmosphere exuding from the owner and his family. I have been here many times and at this point, am done with the overall rudeness. There are plenty of better Italian restaurants out there that don't have mediocre food and a family of psychos running it.
