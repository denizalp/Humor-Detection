Breakfast\/Lunch was not all it was hyped up to be.... Just okay. Why would anyone add orange flavoring to flan?! Flan is already good the way it is.... Well, Bellagio just had to tweak every one of their dishes in such a way. They experimented with foods that were good simply just for being normal, and added extra ingredients which needed not to be there in the first place.\nMandalay Bay's buffet is much nicer\/fancier. And I heard from a guest I met at The Buffet that Planet Hollywood's buffet is actually much better than Bellagio's....\n\nI might go back but only to check out dinner. Breakfast was just, meh....
