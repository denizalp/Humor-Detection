This is a typical CVS with all the things you would expect at a CVS. It's a very central location and has a drive through which to this recently relocated city girl is really neat. \n\nWhere they excel is that the pharmacists are so helpful here. I'm fairly new to town and therefore have a new insurance plan that is a bit odd in what it approves and what it doesn't. They have been very helpful in my challenges for my allergy eye drops that are not covered, they offered possible other ways to get them and they looked up alternatives and costs. \n\nThen there was a problem with my birth control pills bring given to me as generic when I prefer the formulary. I brought them back with no receipt but clearly unused or opened. They looked it up and oddly the formulary is free but the generic had a charge. I was refunded with no problem\n\nThere have been additional situations requiring more time and attention than usually needed with filling a prescription. Each time I have had different people help me and each time they have been very helpful, knowledgable and understanding. Kudos to the pharmacy staff here!\n\nAlso the front cashiers at this location are incredibly friendly. They always greet you as you enter and leave the store. \n\nI never thought I would review CVS on yelp but this one is pretty impressive.
