I really enjoyed the Certified Local First Fall Festival. With about 30 + local vendors, restaurants, and shops you can feel good about spending your money with someone who lives just down the road from you. I always love to see local business doing well - and that's what I call 'Winning'.\n\nWe sampled foods from Urban Cookies, Nami \/ Green, Culinary Dropout, Spinatos pizza, a few other random food stops of which I can't remember. Many samples were $1, some were $2, some spots even handed you a coupon or discount to come check out their full menu or local shop. \n\nI can't wait to join in the fun next year to see more locals doing what they do best, providing great service and personality to our local community!\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix!
