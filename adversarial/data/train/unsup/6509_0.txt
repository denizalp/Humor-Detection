Guess what?\n\nFirst review of the year, and this review is an update. I received a message from Holly C. Guessing Tammy's boss, and here's what she said. \n\n\"Thank you for taking the time to reach out to us. I apologize for any confusion regarding our ID policy. In an attempt to be socially responsible we card every individual that appears to be 30 or under in an attempt to keep our product out of the hands of minors. We are the largest privately held alcohol retailer in the country so we adhere to the letter of the law and enforce state laws more strictly than some other local retailers. We have signs at the front of all of our stores stating that everyone has to be 21+ or with their parent or legal guardian be within our stores, as well as signs at the cash register stating \"we card under 30\" to try to avoid any confusion. I sincerely apologize for any inconveniences this situation may have caused.\"\n\nWell Holly, thank you for that run down but, I was there 3 times this week, 2 times last. All times with someone under age 30, and GUESS WHAT? They weren't carded. Stood in line with me, like my wife did, stood next to me as I was purchasing, like my wife did, but they were not carded or told to wait outside in the cold. Signs at the entrances, but selective carding and screening. HMMMMM.. guess who rung me up the last time I was there, and guess who rung up the other individual and did not card the person with. Yes Tammy. \n\nStill, no mention for the rudeness of the employees, but great at educating on policy. If you want to constantly mention this to me, uphold your own policies. I now know exactly nothing more of how Total Wine cares for its customers, and more of how to bury their staffs bad service. Largest privately held retailer needs more customer care training David and Robert Trone.\n\nI'll pay more at a convenient store for a honest, considerate, and helpful staff.
