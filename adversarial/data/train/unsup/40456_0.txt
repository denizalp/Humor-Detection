Food has always been okay but the service is not. It seems we always have the same waitress every visit and we are made to feel like an inconvenience and there is no communication throughout the meal. It's weird. But the pizza and wings are okay but we wouldn't make a special trip based on service. Haven't tried any of the entrees. Just don't feel very welcomed when we go - maybe take out is the answer?
