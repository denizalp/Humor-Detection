Looking for the best hair extensions in town, well this is it. A hidden gem at the end of 17th Ave S.W.. You barely notice Bea's is there. The outside almost looks desolate, but inside is where the magic happens. They know exactly what they are doing and they do it for an affordable price (although I think all hair extensions are overpriced). \nThey even offer classes for braiding and weaving!
