If you want to have ramen in Charlotte, I think this is  a good spot to go. The Miso ramen and Tonkustu ramen are worth tasting. I really like the broth and pork belly in the ramen and furnishing style of the restaurant. The only deficiency might me the noodle because I think it's a little bit hard not soft enough.
