I've been going to this salon for a couple years now and love it. The nail technicians are all friendly and do a great job. I get my pedicures and gel manicures done here. They have a huge variety of nail polish colors to choose from. They are open 7 days a week so it's perfect for my schedule to just walk in whenever I want. Definitely recommend this salon to everyone.
