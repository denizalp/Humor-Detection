They did a good job washing my sedan, but I won't ever bring my SUV here to be washed again. I got my highlander washed here yesterday, and when I came home, I noticed that my roof was still very dirty. I came back today, and when I explained what had happened, the lady at the booth looked at me perplexed, but she called her manager, and said I could go through again. I watched the sedan in front of me, and sure enough, the guy gave the roof a good scrubbing. When I went through, I paid close attention, and sadly the scrubbing brush never touched the top of my car! I pulled through and asked for a refund. While the lady got her manager, I watched another SUV go through, and once again, the roof wasn't touched! They have me a refund, and while one guy whom I am assuming was a manger was surprised that my roof wasn't cleaned, the other lady who I am assuming was in charge of the car wash mentioned that they just do not wash the roofs of SUV's because they can't reach with the brush. If that's their policy, that's fine, but I don't appreciate the way that it's not mentioned. I think that when people get their vehicle washed, they expect the roof to be included. They did give me a refund, and weren't rude about it, so they get 2 stars, but unless their policy changes, I won't ever return.
