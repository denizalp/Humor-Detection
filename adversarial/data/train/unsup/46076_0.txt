Dinner was wonderful! A bit pricy, but I enjoyed it. The staff was definitely on it- attentive and friendly. Their infamous chicken with waffles and watermelon was a fun dish. The hot sauce that came with it was good! We used it for both our chicken and watermelon. OOOo mouth watering!!! I'm craving spicy watermelon now. They also offered us a round of speciality shots for the birthday girl! Talk about customer service. Love it!
