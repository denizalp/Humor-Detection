It's past 10p on a weeknight and I'm hungry and pregnant! I wanted something quick and close. I've never eaten at Culver's before - why? Because they are a fast food joint and I don't expect the food to be good. However, I thought anything tasted good at this point so I'll try it... boy, do I regret it.\n\nI ordered the Swiss mushroom burger and cheese curds. They were both so awful! The burger tasted old, soggy, greasy and tasteless. The cheese curds tasted like it was in the fryer way too long. I probably had three bites and I threw the rest away. Ugh, thanks Culver's for confirming that I was right. Your food isn't good. Sorry.
