I loooove this place! I'm surprised it has mediocre reviews - I've never had a bad dining experience here. Well, if you decide to go, order the Mediterranean Wrap... all you need to know is that it's made with HUMMUS! You also get a trip to the salad bar (which consists of tons of goodies) when you order the lunch special. The girl at the counter is sweet, too... she helped me with my mess of an order (as usual) and substituted everything I wanted. Repeat customer, most def.
