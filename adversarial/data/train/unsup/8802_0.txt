I thought I was getting a bargain, $37\/night through Groupon. However, they tacked on a $29\/night \"resort fee\" that erased any financial advantage of the deal. The rooms were large and well-appointed, quite nice, in fact. But what made this visit nearly unbearable was the poor air quality throughout the casino and even in the room. We took our service dog and left him a couple of hours in the room while we went to dinner. When we came back, he was wheezing. A quick check online suggested it was an allergic reaction to something in the environment, so I gave him an antihistamine and took him outside, and he improved immediately. However, every time I entered the casino, I hit a wall of smoky air that nearly took my breath away. My eyes burned constantly from irritants in the air, and my nose was constantly dripping. Both nights the dog wheezed after spending the night in the room, so I got him outside as soon as possible, and left him with a friend outside the resort when we took in a show. \n\nThe spa and fitness area seemed relatively free of these irritants, and that was a relief. The gym was adequately equipped and hardly used, as far as I could tell. The spa was luxurious and nice. \n\nOverall, the superficial glitz of the place quickly gave way to the dreariness of a hell hole that never sleeps, where zombie-like patrons listlessly play slot machines in a choking, smoky atmosphere without joy or even the seeming ability to get up.
