Yummy!  I didn't realize this was an Emeril (the \"BAM!!!\" guy on the Food Network) restaurant until I looked at the menu.  Cherylynn N. made reservations for a friend's 30th birthday dinner celebration.  Our reservations were at 7pm, but part of our party got lost so we were seated around 7:15-7:30pm.  \n\nAMBIANCE:\nWell lit, but dim which created a \"romantic\" setting for those looking for a date night.  As we had 9 people in our party, we were set up in the middle in umm...an oddly shaped table (see Cherylynn N's description).  The restaurant was packed, but the noise level wasn't too loud.\n\nSERVICE:\nGREAT service!  The waitress was very attentive.  When the food was brought out, there were 5 servers which each carried our entrees in each hand and simultaneously placed them in front of each of us at once.  It was truly a sight to see.\n\nFOOD:\n**Note: Most dishes are ala carte, so you'll probably want to order sides.  Sides are big enough for 2-3 people to share**\n\n-Crab Bisque ($12) - Delicious, creamy, and full of yummy flavor!!  This was on the Chef's special list, therefore I am not sure if they have this on a regular basis.  The bisque soup is the same as the lobster bisque, but instead of lobster pieces, its generous portions of crab.\n\n-Jumbo Lobster Tail ($48\/Market Price) - As I am not such a big meat eater, a lobster tail was my alternative.  I didn't expect such a generous sized portion to come out.  It was heaven!!  Delicious!!  Tender!! \n\n-Creamed Spinach Side ($9) - It was good, but didn't have the additional pieces of bacon that most restaurants have.  You could definitely tell the spinach was fresh though.  \n\n-Creamed Corn Side ($9) - YUMMMMMMM!!  I must come back especially for this side!! The corn was so sweet with a light crust on top.  Words cannot describe how yummy this side was, definitely a must try!!\n\nSo I know this is a steakhouse with steak, of course, being their specialty.  My friend insisted that I try some of his rib eye.  I'm not a meat person, but I will admit that it was tender and full of flavor.
