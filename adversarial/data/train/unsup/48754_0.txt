I must have ordered the wrong stuff based on everyone else's reviews, but how can you mess up a quesadilla? Literally everything I had was gross.\n\nI had the carne asada quesadilla and it was below average. Flavor wasn't there at all. Large portion, but that really doesn't matter when it's not even palatable.\n\nBorder guacamole tasted just like bland avocados--again, no real flavor.\n\nSparkling white peach lemonade was absolutely disgusting. Tasted more like straight up sugar syrup with a hint of citrus. No peach at all. Drinking it made me want to rinse my mouth.\n\nSeems like this place is meant for brunch, but after this awful experience, I wouldn't waste my money to give them another chance. Very below average experience, service was absent, and prices for bad food was a little painful.
