Jorge has been here for 17 years & was fantastic!  I arrived before 6am & was shocked they were opened.  He was fast, friendly & awesome.  They serve alcohol, breakfast, Jersey Mike Subs & Nathan's Hotdogs.  \n\nI ordered my usual Turkey & Provolone Sub #7 & a Citron Vodka & Club Soda.  The guy next to me got the Nachos & wow, it looked delish too!  \n\nThanks Jorge, it was a great way to start the early morning before my flight.  Will see you soon!
