I'm only giving BFB a 4 out of 5-star rating because it was the only dress shop I went to so I have no other shops to compare it to. However, I did not leave disappointed.\n\nMy mother and maid-of-honour flew in this past February after one of the worst snowfalls so far this winter, which meant that the roads were in poor shape, at best. Since they were coming from out of town and I had booked the appointment, we (including my future mother-in-law) decided we were going to make the trek from Brampton to Etobicoke regardless of the weather. I'm glad we did!\n\nI made sure to read tips on how to try on wedding dresses (strapless bra, shapewear, put some make-up on, bring heels, put hair up, etc.) in order to make sure my experience was less stressful. \n\nWe showed up right at 10:00 a.m. on a Saturday and were one of the first groups in. It turns out that we were the only people who had a reservation to try on dresses that morning (the others were trying on bridesmaids dresses downstairs). After taking off our jackets and putting on slippers (as is customary of bridal shops) we were introduced to our consultant, Lucy, and given a small container of yellow binder clips to put on hangers of dresses I liked throughout the store. I was a little worried I would be overwhelmed, but it actually went a lot easier than I thought.\n\nHere's the trick: don't bring too many people and don't bring people with FAR different tastes than your own. Thankfully, my group was open to all suggestions and even picked out a few contenders.\n\nSo, I clipped about 8 - 10 dresses and headed towards the large change rooms to get started. Lucy brought my dresses over and helped me into every single one, and even showed my maid-of-honour how to do up the corset back. \n\nI almost could have stopped at the first dress - it actually turned out to be the runner-up. However, after 8 dresses, I found THE ONE. A $1,200 Mori Lee illusion neckline dress from the 2013 Spring series. I LOVED it. I decided to go ahead and put the deposit down right then. Which is great because they have a deal where you get $100 off your dress or $100 worth of accessories when you buy the dress the day of. \n\nMy mother also found her dress and it looked great. For $400 a gorgeous dark grey dress with jacket. Very sharp looking - my mom looked great.\n\nI even got to pick out my bridesmaids dresses too - a black, cocktail-length Mori Lee lace number that matches my dress. At a great price too!\n\nThis shop is very clean, spatious and well-tended to. While I lucked out on a day where it was essentially empty (thanks to the storm), I could only imagine what it would be like on a busy weekend. They even have \"interns\" to assist the consultants to ensure that everyone is well looked after.\n\nI would definitely recommend this shop to friends and family after my experience. I have no critiques of this shop. Great work, ladies and THANK YOU LUCY! :)\n\nI can't wait to go back in June for my first fitting!\n\nVanessa
