Love it, love it, love it! I'm here every Friday, that's why I'm currently the DUKE!  The staff is awesome at P on a F, they are all really friendly.  The only complaint I have is my shirt stinks like delicious smoked BBQ the rest of the day. I order the brisket sandwich with sweet potato fries. I'll be in every Friday defending my Dukedom and stuffing my face!
