Worst experience ever. Was LIED to about price when we arrived & were told they would honor the print out I showed the man at the gate.  When we left, the female attendant could not have been more rude or dismissive about the pricing saying she did not know who we spoke with and she would not honor the price confirmed at our entry. Complained to management and they STOOD by this dishonest practice. Save yourself the grief and park somewhere else!
