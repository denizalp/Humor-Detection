Worst Car wash experience ever you could get in the valley \nRegretfully , I was subscribed in Ultimate wash and I found that my car didn't get any Ultimate options services like the Rain protection foam neither Hot Wax . In addition to that my Fast pass was not working for many times and every time I pulled over my car to ask for help and I hear tons of worthless excuses . BTW i was lucky if I could get a chance to find a helpful person over there .last time I asked a person working over there for help 3 times and in last time I asked him by saying \" Excuse SIR I need....\" and you could imagine how this person was disrespectful and he didn't pay any attention but the interesting thing is the attitude of one of the manager who was defending him and he said it is not his business to help you because he is working in Glass repair ...!! ... Really a nice way to encourage your employee to be more courteous toward this place customers .\nNote: I checked my car several times when it went on car wash belt and other times when I took my car by myself to wash it in express way and for both ways I got just the basic service which is half the cost of what I paid monthly...!!\nAnother issue , if you try to find someone in charge to speak with , surpsrisingly you will find couple of people claimed that they are the Manager ...!!  every one is manager over this place Cobblestone Tempe Baseline ....lol.....!! \nI realized after a while that this plcae has new manager every couple of weeks .... Don't bother yourself and try to  look for names on the wall that supposed to show  the administration staff names to customers having problems .\nFinally , I asked one of the dozens managers over there to cancel my subscription and he gladly helped me to do that....!!...Such an Excellent and professional  Manager who feels Happy when see a customer cancel his subscription without doing anything to satisfy a customer paying $500 a year to his employer company....!!. ..Wow.
