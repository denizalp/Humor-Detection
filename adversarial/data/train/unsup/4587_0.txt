Wow, i can't believe how many reviews this place already has.  From the outside the place didn't look like it was open. then upon entering you feel like you have just found a diamond in the rough.  I felt Leanardo Dicaprio in the beach making new discoveries on his travels. anyhow,  we had the thai spring rolls and saigon egg rolls for starters. I really enjoyed the egg rolls. spring rolls were good as well but there was just 2.  For the main courses we had Xa HO Fun with beef and chicken. dont get the beef just chicken as the meat is mediocre. The waitress mentioned this to me  but I have ADD and did't listen!  We also had the house dynamite and this was very good.  the cookies that come with the bill were GREAT!    Cool atmosphere and really enjoyed Simon lutrin's artwork which can be seen  at simonlutrin.com.  check it out you will be glad you did!
