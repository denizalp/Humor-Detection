This has become one of my favorite brunch spots. I love the venue, and service has been solid for the most part. I typically spend a few minutes debating what to get before deciding on short rib hash, but there are so many good things on the menu I am always tempted to switch it up. The quiche changes every day and is always good and oh my gosh - the flat bread... both the salmon and the brisket are a great way to start the way.\n\nI'm not a huge bloody mary fan myself, but that's what M&P is famous for so while you're here, definitely try one. If you are in need of coffee, try the Irish Breakfast. The whipped cream is made fresh and maple-flavored.\n\nAnd last, whatever you do, remember that there is NOTHING wrong with eating dessert after every meal, including breakfast so save room for whatever dessert they are serving. I rarely recommend splitting dessert (since I hate sharing it) but in this case I'd say half a cupcake is plenty.
