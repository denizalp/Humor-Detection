I have no idea why there are so many good reviews. The customer service was horrible. The lady taking my order had an attitude the entire time for no apparent reason. I was hoping the food would be as great as the reviews but when I returned home I was greatly disappointed. I would have rather drove the extra 3 miles to Robertos.
