The Green Beanery I find is a good place not only to find coffee related equipment (items I haven't found available in any other shop in Toronto) but also some really good freshly roasted coffee. Looking for a Vacuum Pot coffee maker or a decent home coffee grinder? Chances are you can find more than a few models to choose from here. How about some fresh roasted coffee from regions all over the world? Yep, they have that too.\n\nThe establishment itself is spacious with roomy seating and lots of headroom (I believe this corner of Bathurst and Bloor use to be a bank). Plenty of natural sunlight through large windows makes for a pleasant spot to sit and sip alone or with friends. They even have a private \"vault room\" for those who wish to plan out their design for world domination over coffee.\n\nWhat I don't like about Green Beanery, as mentioned by others, is the staff. One always gets the feeling that serving customers is their secondary duty. Maybe that is because, as their website claims, Green Beanery is staffed by \"Environmentalists\" and so they are too busy saving the world to properly attend you as you desire a cup of joe or wish to inquire about a coffee related product in their store. For example, twice I've bought coffee there and did so stressing that the coffee was for a French Press (course ground). Both times the person who ground my coffee (doing so with a regretful sigh as he was apparently busy doing other...Stuff) ground it espresso (finely ground). What kind of cafe' can't properly grind your coffee?\n\nThe coffee by the way is excellent. Many good varieties and all fresh and delicious. I just wish the staff would be more attentive to the customers they are their to serve.
