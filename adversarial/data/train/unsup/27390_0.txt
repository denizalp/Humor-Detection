Excellent fro yo spot!  Super friendly staff and great selection of flavors. I like that they have seasonal items as well and there is always something new to try! No cinnamon though when I asked. Boo! :(\nAh well I settled for a pistachio almond and cheesecake with graham cracker crust crumbles and shredded coconut. Delicious!!
