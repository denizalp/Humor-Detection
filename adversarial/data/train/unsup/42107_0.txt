This was my second trip to this restaurant and this time it was just average.  It was a pretty busy Thursday night during March Madness and we sat outside which was great.  They were showing the basketball games which was also great but a group a college kids were getting unruly using obscene language and arguing with the group across from them.  The management did nothing to stop them and it was really annoying to the other diners some of which had children at their table.  The other issue that night was that the bartender was having a really bad night.  Of the 4 drinks that came to our table 3 had to go back due to mistakes.  The waiter was obviously very frustrated with the bartender and you could tell they had words.  The positive was that the food was excellent again.  The portions are huge but the quality did not suffer.  We each ordered a separate dish and all walked away extremely impressed.  I had to take off for the lack of crowd control and the poor bartender service but the food was great.  Will definitely go back.
