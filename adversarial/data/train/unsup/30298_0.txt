PROS:\nSeated promptly after we arrived in a Sunday evening at 5:30pm. There seemed to be a wait closer to 6pm that day.\n\nThe noise level is not out of control. My dinner-mate and myself didn't have any issues hearing eachother. Bad acoustics can sour a meal.\n\nThe margarita pizza is decent, definitely not the best I've had, but I'd consider getting it again as there are not many vegetarian choices.\n\nThey will make some substitions to accommodate vegetarians.\n\nCONS:\nWe weren't the only ones that noticed how chilly the temperature was inside.\n\nThey don't have many healthy-ish vegetarian options. Pasta Primavera anyone?
