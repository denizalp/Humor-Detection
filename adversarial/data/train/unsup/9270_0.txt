Took the young man to see this show. They do matinees generally and on some days they do an earlier show and a later show at 4pm.\n\nGregory Popovich has a history with the Moscow Circus and it shines through in his act. Along with cats and dogs he's rescued from the animal shelters, he's created a show that's fun filled for the whole family. It's hard to believe that you can train cats, but Popovich has definitely managed to do so.\n\nThe young man and I are allergic to cats so we took some Benadryl before going in -- we survived. Even though this particular show is amateurish in comparison to the bigger names such as Cirque du Soleil, it's really heartwarming to see how a man's undying love for animals has brought him to where he is today!! This is definitely a family oriented show because Popovich had his daughter Anastassia on stage too performing juggling acts etc. The 16 year old is an aspiring model and definitely has daddy's talent!
