Wicked Spoon is still one of the best buffets in Vegas.  The decor still looks brand new with no signs of wear and tear.  The food is still good quality and served in attractive non buffet small plates which Wicked Spoon pioneered here in Vegas.  If you don't feel like biting the $52 per person bill at Baccahnal Wicked Spoon is a good option.
