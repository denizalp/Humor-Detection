Local bakery with a cute inside. Unfortunately, I've never been to a bakery that felt like a coffee shop...in that you wanted to hang out inside. This one's no exception. They have it set up with homey country-kinda d√©cor and lots of little tables, but it's too quiet (or something) to hang out inside. Also, I can't sit around and eat sweets without something to drink. They had a pretty limited drink selection and were out of Diet Pepsi, so my only option was water.\nI liked the selection of goods: cupcakes, some sugar-free cheesecakes, strudels, cookies, brownies. We had a chocolate chip cookie (good, but pricey at $2.50 I think) and a cheesecake strawberry strudel . I had really high hopes for this one, but in the end it was just kinda bland. The streusel on top was missing something...sugar? salt? something...\nAnyway, it's a decent little local bakery, but not good enough to drive that far (especially considering I'd be driving past Freed's).
