Great place to grab a bite, with an option of healthy (skinny) or sunny (fat). Came here for a casual lunch yet turned into an unexpected pig out. \n\nLocated in middle of nowhere on Dean Martin Road. Place is easy to find with their smily face logo on the garage door facing the road. Ambiance is hip and cozy with limited seating.\n\nFrom taco section, we ordered both taco from fat side: ahi taco-san and picata piñata. Although both were flavorful, I can't handle much spiciness so I personally liked ahi taco-san better.  4\/5 for ahi taco and 3\/5 for picata piñata.\n\nOpted for hot mess as an appetizer. Basically a fusion nacho that comes with pieces of fried chicken topped with spicy sauce and sour cream. Indeed, it was an hot mess to eat but it was amazing. 4\/5.\n\nTwo entrees, again from the fat side of menu. Steak eye is their version of chicken fried steak. It was chicken fried steak on a biscuit with creamy mashed potato. 4\/5.\n\nBomb diggity is a BLT sandwich with lots of crispy bacon. Some pieces were over cooked and rather chewy than crispy. Simple and good. 4\/5. \n\nAll were good but nothing memorable. I don't appreciate how they clearly mark and section off the healthy and fat section because it makes you feel guilty for choosing everything off the fat side especially when you are pigging out like myself...jk  I will be back again!
