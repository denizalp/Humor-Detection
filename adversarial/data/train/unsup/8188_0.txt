I really wonder why this place has such a good review. Maybe because there's really nothing else in AZ...\nI had the chicken with gravy and onions. I eat fried chicken all the time, but never feel so close to a heart attack. It was too much! Too much of everything. Too much flavor, too much gravy, too much onion, i don't know. Just thinking about it make me full...\nAnd they have a very limited selection of soda (who would have thought?!). No sprite, no ginger ale....
