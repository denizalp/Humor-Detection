I love this little boutique hotel! It's cozy and it served me well until my apartment was ready for me. \n\nAlthough, it doesn't have some of the amenities of a larger hotel, which is perfectly ok because there are so many places nearby and that deliver. What you can't beat is the hospitality and top notch cleanliness of the grounds and room.\n\nThe staff is attentive to your requests, preferences and concerns. \n\nThe stone shower was my absolute favorite! It made me feel as if I was in a spa. \n\nWhat you get for the price is unbeatable. So if you are visiting or just want a hotel break this is your place! You won't regret spending a night here! It has 2  from me! Yelpers let me know if you experienced something to the contrary because I highly doubt you will!
