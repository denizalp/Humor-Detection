I purchased two one-month trial passes awhile back during an event at this location. I paid in cash and was told that two accounts were set up and ready to go in the computer system whenever we wanted to use them. I gave Dragonfly a call prior to using them to make sure we were good to go, and \"Tola\" the manager told me that the accounts weren't in the system, and even went so far to accuse me of lying.\n\nI'm pretty frustrated. I'm not sure why the accounts aren't there, but being accused of lying by a manager and being robbed of our money are horrible business practices. I'm surprised that a place that treats potential customers like this is still in business at all.
