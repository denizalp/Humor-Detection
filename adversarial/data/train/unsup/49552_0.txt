Recently hired A Wise Move to move from one house to another. They were early to arrive, very nice and did a wonderful job. Pricing was fair for 3.5 hours $292.00. They also reassembled all our items and moved things from one room to another as I decided where they should go. All of my possessions arrived in perfect condition. I highly recommend this company for fast, efficient and great customer service for anyone needing to relocate.
