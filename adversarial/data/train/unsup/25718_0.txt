First of I would like to say WOW!! Amazing food, great customer service & friendly atmosphere! This is a small family startup restaurant for which I could definitely see great potential for in the near future! Small improvements to be made but I am sure they will come once this place starts getting the attention it should be getting!! If you have not tried this place you have to. When my family and I first walked in her ( I have to be honest) were a little skeptical but in the end we are so glad we did! Don't be fooled by the furnishings and decorations (they are just starting guys). This is REAL Mexican food reminds me of back home. BTW they make fresh handmade tortillas from scratch!!! Bomb.com
