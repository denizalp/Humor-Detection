The food is an awesome fusion of Mexican and Chinese food. When you get a combo you get a lot of food, enough to share. Ordering can be a but confusing but they are always helpful and they leave you with a complimentary cookie that tastes homemade. I do think it is strange that there is never any music playing in their huge dining area.
