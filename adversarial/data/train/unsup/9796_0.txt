$20 per person ehhhh I would never come again, if it was $10 yes but $20 too much.  Beautiful cute and fun Dolphins, awesome tigers and leopards but that's pretty much it.  They do have a family room for your child to color and a gift shop however I felt this place was a waste of time.  We were here for 30mins and left, I say skip!
