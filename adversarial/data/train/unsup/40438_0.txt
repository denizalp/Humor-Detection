This is the best fast food burger I've ever had. The burger was a nice size and juicy. I also loved the taste of the animal sauce and the crispness and freshness of the veggies. Totally worth it. The double double combo is less than $9...impressive to find food of this quality for this cheap in a town with so many overpriced establishments. The chocolate shake was also very good. My only complaint is that the fries, while tasty, were a tad undercooked, hence the one star deduction. Highly recommended.
