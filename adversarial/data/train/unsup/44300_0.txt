Excellent customer service and beautiful products. Sarah was the sales person who helped me out and made my usual fustrating bra shopping experience not bad at all. Although she was in training she was very knowledgeable and gave her genuine opinion. It is very difficult for me to find bras in my size and was relieved when I saw their selection.  \n\nThe only downside is that it the bras are expensive. If I didn't have such a difficult time finding properly fitting bras I would have opted for a cheaper option.
