The food was flavorful, and portions are big.  When you ask for an XL bowl you can really expect extra large and it was definitely very filling.  \n\nWe ordered a few noodle dishes, 2 which we asked our meats to be fully cooked, however, when it was brought out to us the raw meats were still raw.  I specifically said it a few times to make sure the staff member understood me, the staff member repeated after me several times and thought she got the message.  \n\nThe wait wasn't long and we were seated within 5 to 10 minutes with a small line out the door. \n\nI would come back here if I were in the area.  The soup base was definitely one of the best I have had but the raw meats being raw when I specifically asked for cooked meat.  The water wasn't refilled unless asked.  Minor things that they could definitely improve on.
