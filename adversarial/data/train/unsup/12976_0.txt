I'm writing this while I'm waiting for my car. The line is literally out the door, I've been standing in it for 25 minutes, and there is 1 person working behind the counter. Oh, but there are 5 other people who work for this place that aren't helping anyone. And the lady behind me is sick and coughing on my neck. GET ME OUT OF HERE!\n\nUPDATE: Took over an hour to get my car, when I mentioned to the guy behind the counter that the line was long and none of the employees were helping anyone, he said \"Yeah that happens\".  Seriously? Never going to rent from them again.
