OK...I like to eat. \nI eat a lot. \nI like to eat good food. \nSo far, I haven't experienced that here. \n\nSure, the portions are humongous and it's dressed up all pretty and nice, but that's just about it - It's all style...no substance. Yes, there's all kind of celebrity pictures complete with their signatures on the wall endorsing this place as the best place to eat. So did Planet Hollywood. We all know what happened there. I'll have to agree that it's the best place to pig out, only if you can shove all of that mountain of food into your mouth. \n\nI wanted to like it this time around hoping for a better experience, but it just fell flat again leaving me wanting more and unsatisfied. Yes I was stuffed, but I was still hungry. \n\nDoes that make sense? \n\nHow is that even possible?\n\nThey give you a mountain of food, but it lacks flavor and heart. A good example is their Chicken N Waffles. How can you mess up Chicken n Waffles?\n\nWell....they use breast meat and deep fry the living sh*t out of it and what you're left with is a dry piece of meat that is hardly edible. In this case, looks is very deceiving. Again, all style and no substance just like some of the stuff you see in Vegas. I have to also mention that we had the creepiest server ever. He lurks around with his big bugged eyes, who reminded me of Smeagle on Lord of the Rings. \n\nMy precious....\n\nI also made the mistake of ordering their Mint Coffee. The only real mint they had on this was the garnish they placed on top. The mint they used to have that minty flavor is mint syrup which gives it that artificial flavor. It's overly sweet and undrinkable after a couple of sips. \n\nYeah, I gave it another chance and it's time for me to move one.
