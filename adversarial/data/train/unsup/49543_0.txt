We went to Pittsburgh for the Steelers game for about the 12 time since it opened. This is a great venue to see a game and experience the NFL. When you go there you can see why the Steelers are so respected in the nfl with this stadium and the experience they give. My only complaint about he stadium is the escalators or lack there of. More are needed but that won't happen. Make sure you check out the Great Hall on the East side
