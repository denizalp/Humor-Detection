Four years ago this used to be my go to bar on Friday nights. Bunch of good looking military boys and cheap drinks kept me coming back. \n\nCame here Saturday night with my sister's and niece and I left within an hour. \n\nTalk about nasty! Girls there were half dressed. Ass's hanging out of the skirts and they weren't even cute enough to pull it off. Talk about a fat girl bar! I am a bigger girl myself but holy hell made me feel like a super model in this place. \n\nIt's sad because I used to have so much fun at this bar and the fact that I live so close to it would have made me happier to be a regular again. But sadly the people who attend this bar now are not my crowd and I will not be returning unless they really revamped the whole place.
