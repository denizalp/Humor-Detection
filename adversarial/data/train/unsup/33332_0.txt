My husband and I went for brunch and he got the chicken and waffle. It was good, but I wouldn't recommend it or order it again. You just want one bite. I got the biscuit and gravy and it was DELICIOUS. We both loved it and would definitely order it again. The vegan butter and jam for the biscuits was great too. Good coffee!! I turned my meat eating husband into a vegan believer. The meal has kept us full for hours.
