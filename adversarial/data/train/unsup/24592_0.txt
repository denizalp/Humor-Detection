A friend wanted to try this place, I was reluctant.\nI am SO GLAD that I said OK! Our dinner was really great.\n\nI ordered the caesar and cheese tortellini....I know a little boring I was feeling \"classic\" (don't judge! LOL). The caesar was dressing was creamy and flavorful. I think the tortellini was homemade. Not sure if it was made right there, but either way tasted very homestyle! Yes, that is a good thing!\n\nMy friend had an Arugula Salad - It was SO SO SO good! (better than my caesar) and spaghetti carbonara. Delish as well.\n\nFor desert we had a piece of chocolate cake that was as big as my head! There you go, judging again! LOL....It was GOOD!!! And no, we did not even eat 1\/2 of it! Although I wanted to! \n\nGreat place, and it can get busy because Downtown Summerlin is catching on as the new spot to go play and eat! If you are thinking a weekend night, I suggest making reservations
