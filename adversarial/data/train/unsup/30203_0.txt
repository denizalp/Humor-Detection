We tried this place out after seeing it on Yelp and it was close to our house. The restaurant was really spacious and clean. We ordered a Jade Red chicken rice bowl and a combination plate with Jerk fried rice, black beans Machaca quesadilla and Emerald chicken. The Machaca quesadilla was tasty & crispy. Also the Jade Red chicken was good. However we didn't care to much for the Jerk fried rice, beans and the Emerald chicken. Overall the food was ok and your food comes out fast.
