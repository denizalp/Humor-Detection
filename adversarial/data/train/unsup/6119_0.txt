This afternoon, we went here on a whim, and experienced a memorably bad bout of poor customer service and even worse food. \n\nWe were looking for a cheeseburger place and spotted this in the area. Knowing this was a chain, we expected it couldn't be lower than average (or shouldn't be, with all the money they pump into the sameness of things). So, it was puzzling to us that people that ordered after us were getting meals, and we were still waiting. It was even more puzzling that all the people in the back we staring at us and seemed to be pointing. We discovered that they had a shift change and had forgotten us! At least that was what we were finally told. It was well over twenty minutes that we waited on our food. That is an eternity in fast food.\n\nFor entertainment, we got to watch one of the girls who worked in back, have a lip lock fest with her presumed boyfriend in front of the store by our window. Nothing like young lust to make one lose one's appetite.\n\nThe food we finally recieved was a pitiful mess. The onion rings looked like those cardboard inserts you see in some dress shirts. The burgers were a cardboardy variety of  some type of meat (presumably beef). Good thing we also ordered some of those wimpy, droopy, cold french fries.\n\nNo amount of piped-in Country music or anemic County-fried hokey-doke menu items could have saved this meal.
