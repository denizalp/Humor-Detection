Lets be real, Apple is on a downhill slide. This store is a prime example. \n\nI went to this store to have my girlfriend's iPhone 6 fixed. The screen has been unresponsive for about a year now, it's just totally inconvenient to go all the way to the store for a $600+ purchase that hasn't lasted 2 years. She also has a $2,000 Macbook Pro purchased in 2013 that was having serious overheating issues. The laptop would occasionally freeze then overheat to the point that it felt as though the processor was going to burn out the bottom of the laptop all while only running Safari.\n\nWe got there a bit early and waited, the first thing I noticed was an Apple employee with a very long beard. I couldn't help but notice that he continued to stroke his beard while helping customers and touching technology. I also observed that he never disappeared to wash his hands the entire visit. This is the type of employee Apple wants to put in direct contact with their customers?\n\nAfter our appointment came up, we brought up the issues with her screen. Her screen has been mostly unresponsive for about a year and finally it gave out. The genius bar employee stated that she would be charged $129 or so for a screen replacement. I know that this iPhone screen bug is a widespread issue and when I brought that up, the employee would only say \"I have seen it before\". I have seen it before? All it takes is a 5 second google search to find out this screen bug was worldwide and likely accounts for 10-20% of genius bar visits. When I brought this up, he stated again \"I have seen it before\" like a robot. I do not enjoy being mislead by an employee who knows that this issue is very, very common in the iPhone 6. We opted out of the screen replacement and decided to get her a different phone (obviously not an iPhone considering my iPhone 7+ was freezing from day 1 out of the box).\n\nThe second issue was the computer. He ran diagnostics on it and the battery does need replacement as it has been used for 4 years. But this does not explain the freeze\/overheat issue which started happening about 8 months ago. The battery did not say that it needed to be replaced until 2 weeks ago. Anyways, they offered another $129 battery replacement. Opted out as the battery still holds charge and this is obviously not the issue with freezing\/overheating. It is likely a RAM\/SSD\/Fan issue - nice job genius bar, should I just hop around the desk and do your job for you? I have been building PC's for 15 years, listening to a genius bar employee treat us like morons was like nails on a chalkboard.\n\nLong story short - Apple products do not last, genius bar employees act superior yet when asked real technical questions cannot provide any useful response and most of all, Apple does not stand by their products.
