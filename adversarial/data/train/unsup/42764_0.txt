Great service, delicious food. I love their menu - they have a huge variety of dishes, for meat eaters and veggies alike. Not just typical diner fare but fun stuff with chiles, protein focus, etc. the Cracked Egg even offers coffee cake instead of toast - they deserve all the props because of it. Yum!
