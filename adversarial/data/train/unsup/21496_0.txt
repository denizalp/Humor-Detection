May my travels always take me to delicious ice cream. May they whisk me away into the lactic land of lickable delactable, cones con sabor, and flavors that flirt with my heart and my mind. \n\nCracks, cocaines, opioids of all shapes and sizes ain't got nothing on ice cream when I'm out of town, and like a junkie after his next fix I found my way into Ripples to get the good stuff.\n\nI've had some doozies of an ice cream stop before, and this one ranks up there. It was late at night and I was making one last stop before heading back to my delightful little Airbnb. It's hot as can be in Montreal this time of year, and so I needed one last blast of cold before finding my way up the five flights of circular stairs and into the furnace of an apartment I have rented. \n\nAs I made my way slowly into this tiny shop with everyone around me sweating just like I was, I had time to eye the case. But I knew right away which two flavors I'd be having on my small sugar cone. There's one called 6x Chocolate, and one that's Sesame Halva. I dare you to find two flavors, especially when paired together like that, that will simultaneously send your heart soaring and break it into a million pieces, just like those two. They are perfect, beautiful, and where I want to spend the rest of my life; except they are so delicious and temporary and vanished way too soon. \n\nI think the double scoop plus $.50 for the sugar cone upgrade put me at just below $5CAD for the whole adventure (cash only unless you have a Canadian debit card). On the way out I noticed the line had gotten much longer, so in the heat of summer you may have to sweat it out. In the right company--the kind who likes 6x chocolate and halva--I'd probably come back every night; totally worth it.
