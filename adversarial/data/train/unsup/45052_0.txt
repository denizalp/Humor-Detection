This place was a borderline 2 stars but luckily they gave out a 30% off promo right now.  The food is decent.  Just average, however prices are RIDICULOUS without the 30% off\n\nMy order:\nTensai Shooter - 3.00 for a small shot of citrusy yellowtail and \"truffle\" sauce (didn't taste)\n\nSteam Mussels - broth was good, but i literally counted about 8 tiny mussels.  Seeing that your normal pubs and bars will load you up with mussels and fries for about 10-12 bucks, you definitely don't get the bang for your buck here.\n\nGarlic Chicken - Average, was a bit soggy and cold - had decent flavor\n\nLamb pops - cubes of lamb meat, not tender and a bit over cooked.\n\nOverall - dont come hungry or you'll end up spending a pretty penny.  you can get the same quality and way more foods at ANY ayce sushi joint
