This Domino's is probably the most technologically challenged of the lot (online ordering is bunged up, no debit, and credit cards...well, you'll see) but they are fast. Delivery is promised within 30-40 minutes but it's never taken more than 20. Pizza tastes acceptable but it's the cheesy breadsticks that keep me coming back.\n\nMan, I get such a kick out of my delivery guy and our little \"routine\". It's like sketch comedy every time he comes over. My doorbell doesn't work so he has to climb over the brambles and bushes in my front yard and pound on my window to alert his arrival. \n\nBy then he's already giggling, and when I whip open the door and hand over my credit card he gets all embarrassed because not only do they not have a pre-auth system when you order, but he doesn't have a digital box OR even one of those imprint machines. He pulls out a penny and does the imprint manually using the front door for leverage. \n\nBy this point we're both crying with laughter because it's so archaic. And he just keeps repeating in between giggles \"it's so embarrassing, ma'am. So embarrassing. I'm so sorry.\" \n\nI always look forward to my delivery days!
