This is hands down, THE best meal that I've had in 2016 so far. I called ahead and snagged 2 seats at the bar for the 60$ 5 course menu. They called to verify any allergies and to make sure about any other dietary restrictions that we may have.\n\nThe menu here is constantly changing as it's based on what they find at the market that looks awesome. My dinner mate had some beef that made her tear up, it was THAT delicious and I had the yummiest fish with just the perfect amount of sauce, they truly nailed it. The vegetables were all done perfectly and we could see 90% of the prep done right in front of us which is always fun.\n\nThe wine list is large, but solid and they have quite a few by the glass. Definitely sit at the bar so that you can watch the action and meet cool new people. There aren't many tables as the place is tiny (it's the old Van Horne), so if you aren't a bar person, be sure to make your reservation WELL ahead of time if you really want a table. They've also got a hella fancy Japanese toilet, so don't wait until you're on the brink of being unable to wait, because people seem to take their time in there playing with all of the settings (12 minutes, lady...seriously.)\n\nI felt like that lady in the IKEA commercial that is speed walking out of the store yelling \"Start the car!! START THE CAR!!\" because for 60$ for that incredible meal, I feel like it was a serious bargain.\n\nThe time that the staff spends to explain each dish and ingredient to you was a highlight and the presentation knocked it out of the park. Is your date a food snob? Bring them here. If not, invite me and I'll join you :)
