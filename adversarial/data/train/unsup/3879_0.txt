Yelps 365 Review Challenge - Los Angeles #11 - #365\n\nRecently stayed at the Cosmopolitan, for a family vacay and I happen to have a excellent casino discount for December 27 - 29th, those dates were packed with Vegas tourists and hardcore clubbers. My parents weren't really impressed with the Cosmopolitan and said they have stayed at other 5 star hotels that were more impressive than the Cosmo, I disagree.\n\nThe check in clerk tried to up-sell me a suite for $50 more per night, I kept declining since I was hardly in the room and was a waste of $50. Instead of staying in the, Studio Terrace Room like last time, we stayed in the City Room with 2 Queen Beds in the West Tower. The Room was clean and much better than our last room at, Caesars Palace, the part of the view was blocked off by the Polo Tower and had a small view of the Center Strip and the Polo Towers tennis court.\n\nI just loved the kind of clientele, the Cosmopolitan attracts; young, hip, and trendy. I haven't tried most of the restaurants while I was staying there, except for the Henry (Separate Review).  \n\nWhat I dislike about the Cosmopolitan:\n\n--Unorganized Check In\/Out Lines\n--Some of the table dealers were rude\n--Young Drunks in the wee hours in the morning around the casino with no security controlling it\n--Security guards by the elevators don't check guests for room keys\n\nWhat I like about the Cosmopolitan:\n\n+Chic decor around the casino and hotel rooms\n+Hospitable hotel staff\n+Location\/ Footsteps away from the strip\n+Terraces in some of the hotel rooms\n+The Henry, Bond Bar, Chandelier Bar, Book and Stage\n+The Boulevard Pool\n\nWould I stay here again? \n\nHell Yeah!\n\n\n**TIP   Please leave the kids at HOME!!
