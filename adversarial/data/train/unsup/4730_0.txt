The husband and I used to like coming to Mi Amigos when we first started dating b\/c we would see a lot of movies, you know go on movie dates, these dates are pretty funny b\/c you don't have to actually talk to your date for a good duration of the date-- it's so brilliant!   But this is also why \"dinner and a movie\" is so popular.  \n\nSo we would have some dinners at Mi Amigo's until the frightful night.  The night we ate at Mi Amigos and I ordered the tamale for the first time (usually I stick with tacos at Mexican food restaurants and I just love tacos).  It was delicious and I enjoyed every last bit of that tamale.  We go to the movie, he drops me off at home, I go to bed and am up at 4am with the taste of tamales in my mouth.  I feel like I might have indigestion, but NO. NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO-- I had my very first date with food poisoning.  \n\nYou know the drill on this so I won't go into detail.  I can't give the place one star b\/c of all the other times we went and had 2-3 star  food and decent service.  So I gave 2 stars but told you all that I got food poisoning here.  It really should be 1.5 stars.  The  worst part is I can never eat another tamale again, ever.  .
