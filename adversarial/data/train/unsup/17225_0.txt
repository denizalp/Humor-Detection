Yes!  Yes!  Yes!   I gave them 5 stars!  That rarely happens!\n\nOk, here is the scoop ---\n\nOther reviewers might complain about the wait -  I got there at 10:45a and was 10th in line.  They opened promptly at 11a.  I ordered my food at 11:10am.  This is consistent with the 1 to 1-1.5 minute wait per person.  It was 104 and sunny today and I am sooooo happy that I waited. \n\nI had a 2 meat platter with brisket and ribs.  I selected grits and slaw for my sides.  --- DELISH!\n\nI also tried the sausage and shredded pork.  Both outstanding!\n\nTo top it all of I tried the pecan pie.  Fantastic!!!!\n\n1\/27\/2016 - now a regular visitor!  Still a wait and still worth the wait!\n\nWorth the wait!!!!!
