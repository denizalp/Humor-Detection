There really is something about Lavazza! The service was great as well, I showed up during a rush in between seminar breaks for a conference and watched the staff move the line quickly, efficiently & even gracefully. Prices are decent for Vegas. Rosa was exceptional! Her smile and energy put me in a good mood (hard to do before coffee), she even made giving me a sample of a delicious almond cookie a memorable experience and took the time to learn my hard-to-pronounce name, which she then actually remembered! Somebody give the girl a raise! ;)
