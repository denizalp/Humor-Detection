The Taliesin West tour takes you for a 90-minute guided tour across six buildings or so constituting the winter residence of famed architect, Frank Lloyd Wright.  I did not take any architecture classes during college and knew next to nothing about architecture or Mr. Wright before this tour.  I was impressed not only by the interior and exterior structures, but also by the functional aspects.  You know that acronym STEM ought to be renamed to STEAM, since the Artistic aspects can indeed go with the other technical fields, especially in design.\n\nMy favorite parts of the tour:\n\n* The gift shop was pretty cool - from souvenirs to actual art pieces.\n* The simplicity of some of the furniture, and how comfortable they were, especially those seats in the living room and music\/performance hall.\n* The demonstrations of lighting in the movie room and the acoustics demo in the music hall.\n\nOpportunities for improvement:\n\n* Would have been nice to show the fire-breathing dragon demo for all tours and not just the evening ones, especially for the same ticket price.\n* I saw some cookies and hot drinks in the movie room, but they didn't offer any for the tour group.  Why leave them in plain sight?\n* The tour lasted about 90 minutes and then some - at the end they did a bit if a sales pitch for memberships.  Great if you're a hardcore architecture buff, but not so great if you have dinner reservations and have to cut out.
