Best breakfast burrito I have ever had. It was wrapped in a crepe instead of a burrito and it was fantastic. The dessert crepe we had after was really good too! It did take about 25 minutes to get our food but they told us that ahead of time so we got some banana bread (also great!) to tide us over.  Will definitely become a repeat customer!
