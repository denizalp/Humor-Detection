Car shopping turned into a night mare when our car keep turning off everywhere. We were almost sure it was the battery. I'm glad I went to this autozone, Gilberto M took care of us, and we r grateful he did. He took his time to help us out and make sure it was the battery that needed to be replaced. We didn't even ask him to check it he volunteered. Keep in mind the place was packed. I wouldn't say great customer service all around because I would overhear the other cashier being boarder line rude to the other customers.
