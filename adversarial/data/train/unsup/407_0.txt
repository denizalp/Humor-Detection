I have a love\/hate relationship with this place. I say that because when it's late at night and I want something to eat, I always think of their adobada fries, chimichangas or their chicken tacos. However, when I get it I either love it or immediately regret it. \n\nI still think that adobada fries are wayyyyy better than carne asada. It's marinated differently though I don't know how, it tastes better. Clearly I can't explain the difference but trust me, it's a must try. \n\nTheir chicken tacos are delicious but it drips oil, lots  and lot of it! I personally don't like having to blot my food before I put it in my mouth. The strange part was one was oily the other was not. Imagine the horror on my face when I picked up my taco and so much oil dropped off of it, even with a gentle touch! They give a whole new meaning to fried foods. Extra greasy. No good! \n\nOpen 24 hours, has a drive thru and even the dinning area is 24\/7. Most of the time they get my order right but once in a while there's some kind of misunderstanding with my \"no beans\" preference. Certainly a hit or miss.
