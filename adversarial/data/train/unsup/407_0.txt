I was crushed by the promises of a great burger. \n\nThe bartender told me their burger here is great and he prefers it over their pizza. Burger came out bland and dry. It became harder and harder to digest each bite as it went on. Also sitting at the bar, i witnessed a lot of bickering between the staff here. It just made the dining experience a tad less enjoyable. \n\nAt least Crush has a good Happy Hour menu...
