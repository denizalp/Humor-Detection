Ok, as a person of Mexican decent and with a strong Mexican cultural background, there hasn't been a place I've came by that has some authentic tacos al pastor del trompo. I'm not talking about like the kind other businesses claim they make and its grilled with a huge slice of pineapple. I'm talking real street tacos al pastor del trompo, on a meat spinner and they cut the meat as it falls on your corn tortilla. A native of California, a frequent visitor to Mexico, and now living in a city that's predominantly Mexican decent AND a border state but can't get any good damn tacos al pastor del trompo?! That's kind of disappointing. But not anymore my fellow Yelpers! This place is amazing. I'm assuming it's gone under new ownership. Peep the picture I've posted. Tacos come with all that, including free guacamole. Salsa is just right and washing it down with an authentic bottle of soda, this just takes me back to the street tacos my family and I enjoy when visiting Mexico. They also serve food outside on a stand. Great for pre or post movie date. Definitely coming by again since the food is delicious, staff is friendly, and the owners are super nice people. Finally, something on the West side.
