Decent place but exquisitely gaudy as most of Vegas is. The casino and rooms are of a decent size. The room was called a suite but it was just a room with a big living room. The cleaning wasn't impeccable unfortunately. Room price was reasonable for the location-central on the strip. Tonnes of big name chef restaurants including Batali and Boulud which was really nice. We ate at Carnevino. Prices at all restaurants are a little crazy-kinda like you're in the airport. We were at a conference there and the meeting rooms were large and well equipped. Tonnes of stores from Barneys to breguet. If you're looking for class-go elsewhere, but be prepared to pay.
