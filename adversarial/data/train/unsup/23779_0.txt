It was so disappointing to see that the Serendipity 3 in Vegas looks nothing like the Serendipity 3 in NYC. The decor has been Vegas-ified; it's the cheap knock off version of the real thing. \n\nWe came in right before closing & the wait was only about 10-15 minutes. Our waiter wasn't completely unfriendly but it was obviously the end if a very long, busy shift. \n\nOur order was small & simple but still completely gluttonous:\n--  nachos: a humongous portion of chips (yellow corn & red-colored ones) covered with cheese, beans, tomatoes, onions & chicken. Tasty comfort food, but I can't say I'd ever get it again. We ordered it b\/c you have to eat *something* before you can have dessert. \n-- banana split: even shared amongst three people, this was a sickeningly gigantic portion of vanilla, strawberry & chocolate ice cream topped with traditional toppings & 2 bananas. If you don't control yourself, this dessert has the potential to give you a serious tummy ache. \n\nBeen there, ate that. I only needed to experience Sependipity 3 in Vegas once. The food is average, which can be said for the NYC location as well, but at least they've got the ambiance & quirky atmosphere to justify the visit.
