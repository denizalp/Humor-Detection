As the vegetarian at the table I ordered the poutine and an Oreo Creme brûlée milkshake. I liked the milkshake but sent the fries back because they looked and tasted gross. There were no cheese curds, the dish was warm not hot, and the gravy was thick and looked like...unappetizing. \n\nFour stars because this IS a burger place and all the meat eaters at the table loved their burgers!
