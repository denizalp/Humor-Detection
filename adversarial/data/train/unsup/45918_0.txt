Horrible customer service.  I cannot count the number of times I was interrupted and belittled while speaking to the receptionist regarding my frustrations; not once was I allowed to speak a complete sentence without being \"Ma'am\"ed and talked down to.  She made me feel invalidated as a paying customer and, frankly, an adult.  Last time I was talked to that way was probably by my kindergarten teacher.  This woman has clearly never learned how to de-escalate a situation and has no business dealing with customer care.  Even as I tried to tell her I am trying to verbalize my frustrations with her company, she promptly interrupts me with a \"ma'am!\" and proceeds to tell me \"you already did.\" \n\nMa'am's = 25\nComplete sentences spoken = 0\n\nThe only thing I would like to thank her for would be getting ahold of American Home Shield quicker than I could and canceling their service with me.  So thank you, Crotchety rude woman, for again throwing customer care 101 to the wind and not making any effort to make your customers happy.
