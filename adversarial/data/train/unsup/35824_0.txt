Matsuda is a safe option when you don't know where to go. This is one of those AYCE places you go to when you have cravings and want lots of sushi. Quantity over quality. Make a reservation if you want to come on a weekend. \n\nMost of the stuff on the AYCE menu isn't too bad. Recommended dish is the sirloin steak with garlic, available for both lunch and dinner. If you want maki\/rolls I generally love the spicy salmon and salmon roses. They don't have alot of rice in them compared to other places, which means it won't fill you up as much.\n\nThey have a long list of desserts available. The mousse is just flavoured whipped cream with food colouring. Still a guilty pleasure though.
