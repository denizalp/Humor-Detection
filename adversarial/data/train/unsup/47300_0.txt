My regular hair dreser is on the south side and I live in Avondale & needed to find someone closer. I did my research & decided to on Luxe Appeals b\/c of the reviews. So i I visited Zanette at the end of June to get a relaxer Touch up. she wasn't fully paying attention to what she was doing and and more concentrated conversing with her father so I probably shouldn't have been surprised when I realized that getting half through my hair with the relaxer she had to mix another bowl, I knew right then my hair was gonna be over processed. She washed it more than a couple times and conditioned it so I thought that maybe she had neutralized it enough... wrong, the next day my edges were itching like crazy. b\/c I was going on vacation I had to wait a week to get it deep condition by another stylist somewhere else b\/c my edges felt like hay and were breaking off really bad. I was able to save the front but by the end of July the back of my hair was gone, bald. Now my hair was pretty long, mid shoulder blade length when i went to her, all of that is noticeably damaged even after multiple deep conditionings. Here we are in September and my hair is still falling out. I should request free conditioning treatments, but now I dont trust them. She might be great with weaves, but dont let her relax you.
