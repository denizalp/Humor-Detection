This is my favorite 99 Cent Store in town because of its huge selection. They have things that the other 99 Cent Stores don't have. I know I'm semi-crazy for knowing that. The employees aren't always the friendliest, but I don't really mind as long as the line is moving. \n\nI purchased some chips here once, but didn't bother to look at the expiration date. They expired before I could eat 'em and I had only the chips for less than a month.  The best things to get here are school supplies, seasonal decorations, and gift bags.\n\nBut, if you don't find what you need here, there's a Dollar Tree in the same shopping center.
