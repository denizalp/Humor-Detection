If I could give ZERO stars I would. If I could delete my last RAVE review I would! I  loved this store but my recent experience has me beside myself.  My son opened 2 junk toys (the over priced plastic crap every grocery store sells) in the aisle and played with them.  HE DIDN'T STEAL THEM.\n  I realize now that he can't be trusted in the store without me  but they caught him on camera and FORCED me to pay for the toys.  My 25$grocery order became a quick 40$. They had the packaging in their possession and could have easily taped them back in to the boxes but refused.  I've seen Wal-Mart do this with their items all of the time.  I confronted the manager who said it was out of his hands. I scanned the packaging and realized that they were TRYING to make me pay for cardboard so I made my son get the toys THAT WERE STILL IN THE AISLE so I could pay for them.  I think this is BULL SHIT. Believe me my KID'S in trouble but I'm not coming back EVER.  THIS WAS MY FAVORITE STORE.  WHAT a BOGUS experience.  Had he stolen them I would understand but he didn't. The clerk that was listening to what they were putting me through was actually on my side and told me that she knows kids do this all of the time every day and their parents aren't charged. I made my son donate the toys I was forced to pay for that were STILL IN THEIR POSSESSION to Good Will.  Sorry Win-co you have a poor way of dealing with children. I'll spend the extra money closer to home.
