This buffet is pretty good. There was a wait to get in but I made my party wait in line and I ducked out and played some nearby slot machines and won $15.00. \n\nWe came at the end of breakfast and the beginning of lunch so we got to try both at the breakfast price :o) They have really good breakfast foods...I actually preferred the breakfast food to the lunch food. I think it's harder to screw up breakfast. \n\nThe waitress was really prompt and kept our glasses filled up. As with all buffets there are a lot of people so sometimes you have to navigate through that and that can be annoying. I will be back here again the next time I stay at the MGM Grand.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here because there are just so many buffets at every hotel.
