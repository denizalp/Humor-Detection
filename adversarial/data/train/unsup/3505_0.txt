Starting a remodeling project and needed a place to temporarily store things out of our way.  Dropped by Glendale Bargain Storage and was really impressed with the manager and the customer service she provided.  She took the time to understand what I needed to store and then showed me a few spaces that she felt would work best.  The rates were great and they were offering a free month with every rental.  I was sold on service but the price got me to rent it.  A+
