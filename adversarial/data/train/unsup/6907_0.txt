Who would have thought you could find a real German Beirgarten in Las Vegas?\n\nIf you are looking for a relaxed, intamate dinner, this is not the place to go. However, if you want to drink litres of bier on a long table with friends and strangers eating delicious German food and singing along with live Oompah bands, this IS the place.\n\nThis place is a party, it is impossible not to have fun here. Rather than seat patrons on individual tables for each party, guests of Hofbrauhaus are seated on a long wooden tables; per biergarten tradition. The food is amazing, great schnitzel and potato salad. Lots of heavy strong German beer, served by the litre. They also have a full bar if that's your thing. They have live music with lots of audience participation. On a good night you'll have girls dancing on tables, fat guys blowing in alphorns, and drunks making loud, joyous merryment. A must for any Las Vegas trip!
