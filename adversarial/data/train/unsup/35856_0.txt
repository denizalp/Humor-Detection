Wish I could give a 0 they are homophobic big time!! Went here on a Saturday night with a group of 8 plus people, from the moment we stood in line I notice the guys at the front door all laughing and given me dirty looks, I am a gay man and it not hard to tell, so it was apparent they did not want me in here, they let all my straight friends in and told me for some reason I \"wasn't\" allowed in because I had on a tank top, even tho me and my friends saw about 20 other guys with tank tops on. So when my tall blonde girl friend came out to talk to the guys at the front all of a sudden it was now ok to let me in. So I went in even after I was publicly bashed and humiliated, because I just wanted to dance with my friends, I got a drink at the bar, witch the girl bartending was very nice and don't mind that I had on a tank top, so I began dancing with my friends and all of a sudden this huge bouncer jerks me by the arm and literally dragged me outside, making several of the patrons upset seeing how disgusting I was being treated... I saw about 20 people leave along with other yelling at the Bouncer for getting physical with me and refusing to let me close out my tab at the bar. There was also another bouncer that came up with one of his friends that dose not work and the both of them told me to \"get the fuck away faggot\"... Even tho I am gay I have never he a professional establishment treat me in such a manner and I hope this place gets shut down. I hope the owners know the guys running the front are homophobic and racist and are causing them a lot of money and clientele.
