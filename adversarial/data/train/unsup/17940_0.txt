I don't even think this place deserves one star. We took our daughter's Ipod in here not once, not twice, but three times to get it repaired and it still isn't right. First the screen was put on incorrectly and it kept falling off. Next it was pinched down to hard so the buttons didn't work. Finally the screen kept coming off again. Now the wifi isn't working. We took it into another place this morning and learned Quick Mobile Repair CUT the wifi wire. Lovely, just lovely. Don't waste your $$$ here. We WILL BE getting our money back plus the cost of the new repairs. I can't believe how this place stays in business.
