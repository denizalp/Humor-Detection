I expected something fanciful and fantastically French.  Maybe my expectations were too high for a well known chef w\/numerous restaurants worldwide and even garnered three Michelin stars at his first venture.  \n\nI found the meal disjointed, at many times off putting in tastes and textures.  I don't care how 'fine' this dining is, if it doesn't TASTE good, it's really not worth the dough we paid. Believe me I'm willing to shell out for a great orgasmic meal.  \n\nThe only tasting menu is called the 'Gagnaire Spirit'.  To me, a tasting menu should reflect the culmination of the season and chef's best.  After tasting the 'Spirit', I can wholeheartedly say Gagnaire's Twist is not food I would gush about or eat again.  \n\nWine pairing: Generous pours and fairly priced.\n\nCanapes: The four items did not complement each other and the cookie tasted stale.  I did like the flax cracker and the subtly fishy cream.  Haricot Verts w\/diced veggies were overly salted and acidic.  I found the Guinness & Jack Daniels gellee, strange & extraneous.  \n\nMy favorite savory dish of the evening was the clams, unagi & beets.  Balanced flavors and beautiful presentation.  The combo of ingredients was innovative and simultaneously delicious.  \n\nThe octopus w\/foie tuile & serrano ham had odd textures and flavors were muddled.  I didn't like all the side dishes which accompanied the  main dish, wasn't complimentary and really just confused me.  It almost seemed like different courses were piled next to each other all at once.  Overload!!!  If they are supposed to be together, put them all on one darn plate!\n\nThe intermezzo is a COURSE on the menu, what a gyp!!!  But it was good, OK, I admit it. \n\nThe bf thought the prime sirloin was a hit, it was nothing special in my book.  \n\nProps to the pastry chef, they know what they are doing.  We cleaned house.  I love when desserts are light.  It's always wonderful to see savory elements woven into a course which is traditionally sweet.  There was some sun dried tomato!\n\nMany other French tasting menus on the Strip to spend my hard earned money on. PASS on this one!!!
