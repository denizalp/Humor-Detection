Had a chance to finally see this sweet store of delectable cupcakes, plethora of flavored popcorn and  hand dipped chocolate delights!  It was amazing!  Jake was a very helpful host who gave me a tour of this family owned business.  The aroma as you walk past is breath taking and when you enter in such an air of sweet fragrance.  Sweet and savory is what it is all about!  Jake directed. Me to their #1 seller-Dichotomy Corn (Popcorn) a blend of sweet, crunchy Carmel with cheddar cheese!  Others flavors include \"New Cinnamon Roll\". If you like it hot try \"The Extreme Dichotomy\". Yep, you can sample first!  Next I was shown the Tree of Cotton Candy a popular treat for the kids in Lakewood.  Pinky and fluffy just like you see at carnivals!  Next I saw all the luscious cupcakes!  Talk about cupcakes,  these are cupcakes from Heaven!  Made daily on site!  Had a hard time choosing!  The most popular seller is Vanilla Wedding Cake.  I bought the White Velvet and Chocolate Raspberry!  Light and moist!  Filled with drizzles of Raspberries over a plethora of chocolate! Also available are hand dipped chocolate covered pretzels!  The combinations are amazing!  Rocky Road Pretzels!!!  Jake told me they first dip the pretzels in Carmel then smothered with marshmallows, nuts and chocolate.  The flavor combos are unique and enticing!  The Chocolate Buckeyes were huge!  Just as good as Malley's!  All in all an amazing store for those looking for gourmet flavored popcorn, unique homemade cupcakes as well as hand dipped cookies, pretzels, marshmallows, grand crackers smothered with lots of chocolate!  Whether it is dark chocolate, milk chocolate or white Campbell's is a delectable delight!
