My office is a mile away and this is by far my favorite spot to eat. There are probably a hundred restaurants within 3 miles but I always end up at Parsleys. Jo and Lizeth are always amazingly helpful and the portions are huge. If anyone is looking for the most delicious steak, chicken, or veggie wrap for $10 this is definitely the place to go. Definitely 5 star food and service
