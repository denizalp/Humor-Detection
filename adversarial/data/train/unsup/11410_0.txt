I am more then impressed I am lost for words. It has been a couple years since I been to my neighborhood spot and boy have I been missing out. \n\nI made it just in time for happy hour. After immediately being greeted I was given a nice warm basket of now my new favorite garlic knots with marinara sauce. Those babies were finger licking good. I took advantage of the 10inch pizza and fresh fries. Killed my diet but it was well worth cheating because everything was mighty tasty. So good you best believe I packed up my leftovers.\n\n\nQuick notes:\nThe Resturant was clean\nService with a major smile \nImmediate refills on the soda\nQuick service an checkup from waitress\nGood fast and fresh\nHappy Hour Specials Daily\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
