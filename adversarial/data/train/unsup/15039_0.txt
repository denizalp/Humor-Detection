Generally overrated! Good for gawking at plastics in dental floss dresses that leaves nothing to the imagination, 6-in stilettos, and 20 layers of makeup for your viewing pleasure. If you are wondering if she is his daughter or his girlfriend, that's his girlfriend! \n\nI finally made it here to have dinner to see what the hype is all about. I had been told by several friends that it was impossible to get a reservation, which I truly don't understand.\n\nThe view is nice but significantly lacking from the one at Paris or Cosmo, mostly due to the fact that the restaurant is on the 2nd level and not much higher. The Bellagio fountains are obstructed by the crosswalk bridge over Las Vegas Blvd, so not my much of a view. I probably saw more weirdos on the strip my whole meal more than anything else.\n\nThe service was ok but considering this is a fine dining establishment my drinks were not refilled during the meal & I actually had to ask a busboy to do it. I ordered an entree and an appetizer. The bacon wrapped dates were very good $16 for 5. However, my entree was terrible! Small plate of whatever it is that I had 3 bites of and left. Cost $28 and was a complete waste. The only thing that kept me from going home hungry was the complimentary bread with a variety of salts and butter. \n\nDefinitely would not come back.
