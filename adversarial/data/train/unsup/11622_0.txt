Needed clothes for the black and white event, so I stopped in after my physical therapy. selection was shocking, I was overwhelmed without my wife! Thankfully there was a nice man who was willing to let his wife spend my money for a few minutes.  I got nice shoes(steve maddens),pants(alpinestars) and shirt(perry ellis) for less the $100, and only took ten minutes. thats how guys like to shop, quick or forget it!!
