This place used to be better but I had a terrible service experience there today. \n\nNo leaf lettuce for my wife's lettuce bun. They used to do this and the guy who was taking our order understood that's what she was asking for. Didn't find out they don't do lettuce buns anymore until they brought her a burger on a pile of shredded lettuce.\n\nMy son can't have the ice cream they give with the kids meal so we asked about maybe doing a couple lug nuts, cinnamon donut holes, instead. This super reasonable request was met with a firm \"No!\" from the jackass manager.\n\nWhoever this guy is, he's running this place down. No clue about how to properly handle customers. Used to be a regular but now I'm not going back.\n\nCan't wait for Bad Daddy's to open at Waverly!
