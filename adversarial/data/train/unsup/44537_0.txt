If you're planning on paying for a buffet on the Strip, allow me to convince you otherwise, because it is definitely not worth it. However, if you find yourself with some complementary buffet vouchers, let the Wycliff flow! Most of the food here is standard buffet, which is to say, bad, but there are some palatable items to be had if you look carefully enough. I went with the gyros, available near the salad bar. Also acceptable-looking were the salads themselves. For dessert, I hunkered down for some frozen instant pudding (or gelato, as they call it around these parts), which tasted good enough. As an aside, I noticed a lot of people putting their faith in the raw bar here, and I haven't heard news of a salmonella outbreak, so that's something. Sparkling wine is complementary, so drink up!
