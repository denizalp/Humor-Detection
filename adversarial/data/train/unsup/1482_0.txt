This'll hit 5-star soon.\n\nThe cocktails are phenomenal. Like, I know I use some grand terminology in some of my reviews (because I try to bring you the *goods*) but seriously fantastic drink mixing going on here. (It's hard for me to use the word \"mixology\" without irony).\n\nRight now they're figuring out their kitchen story and their service story, so the food is straight off of Sidecar's menu from downstairs, and their service is handled by the bartender. The food is therefore great, and the service is therefore talky, but in a nice way - the man loves what he does and wants to share with you. We were an interested and engaged group, too.\n\nAs for what to drink, lordy. The gin and tonic is made with their own in-house tonic, the cuban is beautiful and flavourful without being over-rich, and their \"New Old-Fashioned\" has this crazy burnt orange business going on, owing to the orange that they burn; tasty.\n\nBut those drinks, those offerings that would be the gem of most relatively well stocked bars, are the window dressing here. The main event, whether you've had one elsewhere or not, is the Cilantro Mule. 2 of us at the table decided it was one of the five best cocktails we'd ever had. Gin and Ginger Liquer and Cilantro and citrus and wow. Really great drink - tasty, surprising, well balanced.\n\nYeehaw.\n\nBeing a private club, it might be tough to get in, but they're still selling memberships, and any member can bring 3 friends.
