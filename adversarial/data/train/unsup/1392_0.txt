I'm giving this restaurant a 5 star review because I hate myself. I woke up this morning wondering how I could make myself miserable and remembered how terrible the last two times I went to Peter Pan. So I put on some clothes and headed over. I will say this, when you first walk in the ambiance is pretty great. There's cool shit on the wall and the bar is nicely set up. I was kind of pissed off actually because my first impression was good. Luckily though the service reminded me why I came here again - because I hate myself. The beer was warm, the server was inattentive and my English muffins were burnt. It was perfect! When I left I felt a terrible rush of dizziness from the poor quality of ingredients. It took me nearly an hour to feel like a human again. \n\nAnyway, if you are like me and truly hate yourself, check out Peter Pan.
