Phone was ringing off the hook - only 1 person there and I waited 10 minutes before someone finally came out. She then told me that she needed a band aid her finger was bleeding.  When I got back to my office I was horrified to see smeared blood on my box.  I will not touch this pizza and demand a full refund.
