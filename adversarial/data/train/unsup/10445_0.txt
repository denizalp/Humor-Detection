A good 10 minutes walk from my office, this place was small but clean, with decent amount of seating.    Co-worker and I was told this place was the best so we had to give it a try.\n\nThe service was fast and efficient, the workers were friendly, kind, and professional.  I wasn't able to check out the loo, since I didn't really need to do a two, but I'm pretty sure it was decent nonetheless.\n\nThe food was excellent quality.  I like how they used the white cheese and not the orange one.  It makes the food taste better.  I ordered their Carne Asda Ribeye Tacos and it was amazing.  The beef was beefy with a good high quality beefy taste, was freshly cooked.  The tomatoes and onions were pretty decent too.  I also ordered a cheese crisp.  It was made with the white cheese as well, amazing stuff!\n\nOverall an excellent experience and we will definitely be back in the near future.
