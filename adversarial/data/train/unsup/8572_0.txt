This is my favorite place to get affordable, delicious shawarma sandwiches and plates. They fill the pita with flavorful meat, fresh veggies and yummy hummus and sauce. The plates come with a pita so you can actually make 2 pita sandwiches and still have more meat, veggies, rice and lentils, and hummus leftover.\n\nTheir goal is speed and quality. You place your order at the back then move to the assembly line where you see them making your order (you can tell them what you want and don't want on your food), then you move to the cash register where you grab your drink from the refrigerated case then pay cash for your order (they don't accept cards) and pick up your food to the right of the cash register.\n\nDon't worry if there's a line up because it moves quick.  There are only three small tables to sit at but most people order to go. It's a hole in the wall place that serves up savoury, mouth watering food.
