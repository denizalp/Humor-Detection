I went on a hunt for some naengmyun (cold noodles) on a scorching hot day in Las Vegas. I found this place out in the outskirts of Vegas and it was a great experience. When we walked in, we were seated right away. The service was amazing. The server was kind in giving us so much banchan (side dishes) that we couldn't even finish our meals. We were also served Korean tea and mandoo (dumplings) on the house. The cost was very reasonable, the service was great, and the food was delicious. I would definitely come back here again.
