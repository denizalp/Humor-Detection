I really have to disagree with all the great ratings of this place. I was wholly disappointed when my husband and I made this our dinner stop for the first night of our staycation on the Strip.\n\nLocated at NYNY, but actually outside of the casino, the outside of the restaurant is visually appealing, and draws the eye. Once inside you get immediately wrangled into a queue in front of their large menu board. This is nice as you can decide what you want while you wait in line.\n\nI got a single ShackBurger with everything ($5.19), my husband got a double ($7.99). Note, this is just the burger, doesn't even come with fries or a drink. Maybe I'd be OK with the jacked up price - if the burgers were not BABY-SIZED. Seriously, they're tiny. Ya, they're good, the taste is awesome. Yes, very well cooked, but STILL. And yes, I know it's jacked up strip pricing. Still don't care.\n\nAlso got the black and white shake (small) and a large Fat Tire that came with a plastic souvenir cup, and a bottle of water\n\nAll in all, two people, for dinner at a fast-casual place ended up being $36.98. Yes, almost $40. We could have actually had a sit down meal for that much. \n\nWill not be back.
