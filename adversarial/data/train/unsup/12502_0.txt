Cool store though I have come to find out they always look different then on the show.\nIt fairly large but a completly different set up than I imagined.\nIt was pretty full, but I have seen lines out the door at other times so this was good.\nThey have a ton of people working there, of course none from the show.\nStill it was fun to walk around and look at items for sale we have all seen on TV, they also sell a ton of Pawn Stars memorbilia, I'd say about the same amount as pawned items.\nTV will do that to ya, worth checking out if you are in the area and love Pawn Stars.
