Only reason I will give 1 star is our server (I think it was Jesicah) was really nice. I never go to Dennys anymore but one of my kids asked if we could go there one time and I relented. What a disaster. My two boys and I sat down, ordered our food, and then.......we waited, and waited, and waited. We were there 30 minutes and never got our food and I finally walked out. I decided to pay for our drinks because it wasn't the server's fault. However, the managment and the kitchen staff obviously have no idea how to plan and execute their roles and responsibilities. This is Denny's. The food is relatively simple. If you have a small party like us, with an easy order (one omelette, two orders of pancakes), you should be in and out in 20 minutes.\n\nI'm sticking to places like the Good Egg excusively.
