I'm so excited The M resort pool allows locals for admission without needing to have a room there! For that alone makes me want to give them 5 stars because it's frustrating calling other \"neighborhood casinos\" and they don't allow locals unless you buy a cabana or have a room. \n\nThe pool scene at M is really nice and very spacious. We didn't have a cabana today but still found a couple lounge chairs. There was plenty of sun. It's also great for kids too; there were plenty lol. But they were enjoying their time as I was mine so it wasn't an annoyance. \n\nWe weren't able to get a drink or food from a cocktail server. There were busy. We went to the bar for a drink, it took awhile even though it wasn't busy. We got impatient and walked around. Later we went to Daydream, the dayclub right next door that had a DJ. It was a smaller pool and the seats are bought out but we put our feet in the water. Prior to that we got good service at the bar. \n\nWe ran into a couple old coworkers and a friend and met new friends! We will be back to soak in the sun and look pretty in our bathing suits! ;)\n\nWe wanted to get something to eat in the hotel after but there weren't many good options by looking at Yelp.
