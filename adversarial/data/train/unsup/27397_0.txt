Me n the wifey came to Los Dos when her co-workers recommended it to her....I dont mind trying new places.....but it was a so so place....we went on a Saturday afternoon....not many people...nice place....quiet.....I had the Carnitas plate n the wifey had the Flautas.......the Carnitas were excelent....beans were good....rice was bland with no taste.......over all it was an ok meal....the service was ok.
