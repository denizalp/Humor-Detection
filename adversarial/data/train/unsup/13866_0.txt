A few weeks ago, I asked my student where she would like to go for her farewell lunch. She wanted to go to Heart Sushi. She can eat. It's impressive to see how much food she can shovel down at an all-you-can-eat place.\n\nI was in Sweden when I was determining which Heart Sushi we should go to. There are two in Mississauga. The one closer to the office was temporarily closed. Instead, I booked a reservation to visit this restaurant at Heartland Town Centre.\n\nI drove a few of us over to the restaurant. Parking in front of the restaurant is limited. I was lucky to nab the lone available parking spot. However, if you walk away from the front doors, there is plenty of parking available.\n\nWhen you first look at the restaurant, it looks like someone decorated the windows with flowery tissue paper. Hey, whatever works!\n\nI checked ourselves in. I pointed out that we had a reservation. We were promptly seated at our table. It's interesting that their seating procedure is to put everyone together as they come in.\n\nThere was a special on Sapporo beer, which was going for $4.50. Pretty much everyone ordered one.\n\nYou order on the iPad that comes on a stand. We went crazy. I loved everything. Here are some standout items:\n- Shrimp tempura (crispy and perfect)\n- Gyoza (pan-fried nicely)\n- Edamame (perfectly salted)\n- Beef fried rice (delicious)\n- General Tao's chicken (chicken morsels were tender)\n- Raspberry cake and coconut ice cream (must-order items)\n\nThe only item that I ordered and wasn't a fan of was the spicy beef. It was overcooked. You could slurp it down without chewing. It was that soft.\n\nWith most desserts, you need to order them through your server and not the iPad. The raspberry cake with the coconut ice cream were terrific. I highly recommend this combination of tartness and creaminess.\n\nThe restaurant's interior is pretty and cozy. The ceiling is high. If you're tall, you do not need to worry about hitting your head on anything.\n\nYou can only pay by cash or credit card. Debit cards are not accepted.\n\nI had a great time with delicious food and decent company to send my intern back to school on a high note.\n\n(332)
