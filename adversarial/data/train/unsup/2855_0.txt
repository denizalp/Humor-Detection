Thursday nights are packed here. Probably 400 to 500 people? I dunno... but it was damn fun! There's a big corral where people line dance. A mechanical bull for the retarded and miniature bowling for $2. \n\nDrinks were not cheap which was too bad. I was confused over \"ladies' night\" since I was told drinks were cheaper. But... I paid a $1 cover and the beers were like $6 a piece. Crazy.\n\nI had a great time and recommend this place to out-of-towners because it's so different than what's available in the casinos.
