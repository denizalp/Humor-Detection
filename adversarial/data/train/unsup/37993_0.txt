Its a very cute & friendly environment but if youre looking to eat or youre not into unusual food I do not suggest this place! There are not many food options & sometimes I feel like they just throw any topping onto the plate. For example I ordered garlic cheese bread & it came drenched in caramel NOT a good combo! I was pretty disappointed but the idea was cute
