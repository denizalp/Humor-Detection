After dinner and a drink at the restaurant in the hotel (see my review for Gallo Blanco) we took a stroll around the pool, lobby, and rooftop bar area. I noticed a few things I really liked, and MANY that would keep me from ever recommending someone to stay here. \n\n1. The pool area has obviously had some thought go into decorating, and they pay respect to the city with a giant Phoenix bird sculpture, awesome!\n\n2. They have art all over from different parts of Arizona, as well as Arizona license plates on the rooms and directional signs. I love the sense of pride for where we are from.\n\nThat's about all the good qualities we could find. . . the bad....:\n\n1. The windows on the outside of a building are those from a disgusting slum of an apartment building. It's obvious you took a shortcut and couldn't spend the money to finish the remodel.\n\n2. You have disgusting stairs, carpets, and rails on all the outdoor common areas. Again, did you want to finish this remodel?\n\n3. The hallways we walked through at the end of the building smelled like puke, and had worn out carpet along with thick coats of paint that appeared to be centimeters thick. Did you strip the walls before you started the remodel? The smell of vomit went away as soon as the smell of marijuana from someones room took over.\n\n4. Your elevator buttons don't light up, and the elevator is scary with stained carpet. I felt like I was picking up an STD just standing in it.\n\nThis place feels like a Daytona Beach spring break hotel from the 90's or perhaps one of the trendier hotels in Rocky Point. It feels like a third world attempt to be upscale, and it's obvious that someone wanted to half-ass their way through a remodel. Not to mention the fact that I've watched the owner go on various chat boards and forums across the internet only to talk shit about every property in town that is worlds nicer than his. I hope that anyone who stays here is used to Motel 6, enjoys watching people making out in halls, and likes thumping techno, because that is the only way they will be impressed. \n\nThis place is like third world spring break 24\/7, and I'm pretty sure the \"bar\" on their rooftop is actually a folding Costco card table.
