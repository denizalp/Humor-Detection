We love our new signs! We were looking around at many sign companies and it seemed to be an exhausting adventure. Getting signage for your business is one of the most important decisions you will make during your business venture so, talking to experienced sign companies is key. If your signage doesn't work for you then you will be experiencing a huge heartbreak when you have to spend your hard earned business dollars on replacing it, unfortunately we had to travel that path. When we started looking around at other businesses signs to get ideas of what looked catchy and what did not. When we asked business owners with great looking signs who fabricated the sign and design we were told Diamond Head Signs Co. on a pretty consistent basis. Viola! We contacted them right away and the staff promptly came over and spent a good amount amount of time explaining the pros and cons of the array of signs they offer. They were not the cheapest game in town but when your talking about professionalism and attention to detail there is no surpassing the amount of traffic we are now witnessing. Thank-you Diamond Head Signs Co.!
