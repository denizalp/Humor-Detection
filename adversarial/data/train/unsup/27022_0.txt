I honestly wish we could give this business 0 stars.\nThey are a joke. \nWas told they would be here between 8-12 they didn't show and I called at 12:30. The woman cut me off and put me on hold for 10 minutes without saying she was doing so. She then proceeded to tell me the technician could \"Maybe be there at 1:30\". When I asked her why they told me 8-12 when they wouldn't be there she proceeded to say \"well he can't be there until 1:30\" they then said they can't rebook for another 4 weeks and that they won't fix it on the first round no matter what.\nWhat a JOKE. PATHETIC excuse for a business I would NEVER use them
