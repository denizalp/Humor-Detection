Even though I'm a fan, I'm not allowed back without a helmet. \n\nMy daughter has attended many wonderful birthday parties here. This is a great birthday facility for toddlers - tweens. \n\nBefore you go into the rooms, the kids and adults watch a video about safety on the slides and bounce rooms. One of the rules they emphasize is *getting out of the way* when you get to the bottom of the slide so you don't get hit by the next kid\/adult on the slide.\n\nWell, my beautiful girl did not listen carefully, got all spaced out at the bottom of a slide, and slammed by some kid at the party. Next thing I know, she is screaming in my arms  that her arm hurts. The party starts to move into the next bounce room, and I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to calm down my screamer and get in the other room so the next party can start in the first bounce room. Every time, I moved, the screaming increased a few decibels. The people that worked there came to assess the situation and help, but I told them proudly that I had it all under control. Then I fainted. \n\nI woke up in some big man's arms all confused. When you wake up dazed and confused in a stranger's arms, the first thing you do is make sure you have clothes on. Check! Next thing was panic - where is my little girl? When I fainted, the party moved quickly to the other room with all the kids including my screamer, and three parents and two staff members stayed behind to revive me. My husband picked us up and I have been too embarrassed to go back since.\n\nEven though I have to wear a helmet to parties here, I still think it's a great place and highly recommend it! Just make sure your kid is well rested before they get there, and maybe run through some fire drills on quickly getting out of the way.
