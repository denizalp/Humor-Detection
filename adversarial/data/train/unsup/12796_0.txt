Simple and straightforward smoothies and juices for the healthiness that one is striving for when in Vegas!  \n\nI needed a refreshment in the hot heat and to treat my digestion well with ginger and greens after a night out of heavy drinking!\n\nHole in the wall.  \n\nMy berry drink was for $15 with requested added ginger juice.  It was a whole serving and I felt full.\n\nIt's expensive to be healthy.
