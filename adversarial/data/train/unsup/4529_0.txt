My first visit and I received awesome service!  Walked in and Jonathan immediately greeted me a hello and offered his assistance.  Needed a set of three windshield wipers for Mom's car, preferably Rain-X, and was taken directly to the computer.  I commented \"Oh, you don't have the book?,\" and Jon said \"We do, but the computer is so much faster.\"  :)  He quickly assessed the inventory and retrieved the wipers.  Since the shop was out of the Rain-X brand for the rear wiper, I had to settle for a generic.  What really impressed me was his offer to install the wipers right then and there!  Too bad I wasn't driving Mom's car today, but I asked if the offer may be extended on a future visit, and he said yes.  \"Do I need a receipt (for proof-of-purchase)?\"  He shook his head.  I was blown away!\n\nCool prices (considering what I had paid for a complete set for my car, which matches my Mom's, except for the color) and terrific initial customer service.  I hope that my next purchase here, ideally not anytime soon, will be as great an experience as tonight's was!
