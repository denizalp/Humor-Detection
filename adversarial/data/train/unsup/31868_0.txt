Honestly as good as it gets. We struggled to find an honest vet that cared about our 'fur kids' just as much as we do until we were referred to Crossroads. Dr Howard, Michelle and Ashley (just to name a few) were amazing and made sure we understood all aspects of our dogs care before leaving and did not subject us to unnecessary tests. AND, their prices were reasonable. FIVE stars to an amazing team. All our animals will be back.
