So here is the story. I sent my hard drive to them on Jan 18th, they notified me that it was received in the facility on 1\/22 - I paid 5.50 with insurance and signature using the US Mail, against their preferred shipment methods DHL, UPS or FedEx, I have not heard from them for a whole two weeks, after sending several e-mails, calling and leaving several messages I finally get ahold of them just to hear that they sent me a quote on Jan 26th - I looked everywhere, spam folder - no quote...it of course made me a bit suspicious of how thorough their service is. \nBriefly - I did know that the failure of my HD is mechanical and - their diagnostics weren't at all surprising - I got quoted $260 to retrieve the data with a local Data Recovery Company (which I will follow up with and if they are able to recover the data for $260 I will post all their information - their quote was $1100.\nWhat really aggravated me is the type of \"hard sale\" they do - they know we need our data and we will try to do anything. The rep also went to the extent to tell me that even if I was to get my hd back, I won't be able to extract the information at all - ever. - why? I asked, is it that you opened the drive and didn't put it together the way it was before - even broken? If this is the case, they will have a ton of trouble with me, I don't like hard sales, I don't like payment plans ( 50\/month for the duration of the payment - you only get your drive when its fully paid - I calculated for the 1100 it will take me only 22 months to get my data back! \nYou got to be kidding me? Does it at all make sense to you, to pay for something they \"tell\" you is repaired for 2 years,,,, What is it is not?  I won't do it... so I asked for my HD back, again - painful conversation is continuing... \"We can just dispose of the HD for you - Don't you get it??I do want my HD back, and I want it exactly in the state it was sent to you\". \" I don't want you to dispose of it I WANT IT BACK. \nand again \"But you won't be able to do anything with it!\" - Really, because you guys are clairvoyants over there ?? Just send the damn thing back! Thank you! \nSo, bottom line don't get fooled - I was trying to be cheap, I am a student, I just dropped $1100 for a new computer,  and wasted a whole lot of time and now money too, (they will take 10 days for ground delivery of my HD (weights about 18 oz.) and charge me $15 for it. Fine! We all learn from our mistakes, please do not make one too. \nThe positive was that the representative kept their temper cool and it didn't escalate into a quorel, so this is why they are getting two stars. \nTo me this is a \"bait and switch\" - $60 my behind! \n\nData recovery is data recovery, there is nothing these people can do that other data recovery can't . I thought I'd share my thoughts and experience with you.
