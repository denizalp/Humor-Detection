Sitting in the place where Pho Van once ran their business is this familiar face from Mesa.  Guys, it's unPhogettable's second location!\n\nGone are the tacky strings of light and up goes the vinyl bamboo decals you might recognize at their first location.  Everything is clean, everything is new, and the staff is nice.  It really is a breath of fresh air.  This location is just as solid as the Mekong Plaza location.\n\nWe got the Pho Dac Biet Bi Vien and had some Mi Thap Cam.  The broth for the pho isn't as light and clean as some other places but instead is full of meat flavor.  It feels heavy and I was definitely ready for a nap afterwards.  The noodles itself were springy and chewy.  As for the spring rolls and egg rolls, what can really be said?  They're all great.\n\nUnPhogettable has always been in my Top 3 for pho in the valley.  They're not #1 but they make a solid pho.  I wish their second location much success!
