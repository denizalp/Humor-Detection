If you're looking for an uber-cheap place to sleep in Vegas, Circus Circus might do it for you.  Our room was surprisingly spacious and updated - clean, comfortable and gobs of room to unpack and hang out.\n\nHowever, that's about the end of anything remotely great that happened here.  The rest of the casino \/ hotel felt dirty, old and uncomfortable.  We couldn't wait to get out the second we stepped in.  It felt like walking into a bad part of town Walmart, except instead of the elderly greeters you have massively depressed looking employees and clowns everywhere.  Oh mah gah.\n\nAlso, for some reason I had a hard time figuring out where to check in upon arrival.  Maybe I'm distracted by blinking lights to easily, but the front desk was a bit tucked away and caused a luggage lugging excursion around some very drunk gamblers.  \n\nMajor bonus points for the Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas flashbacks though.\n\nBoy was it a fabulous relief to check out and head over to the Aria (which was perfection) for the remainder of our Vegas stay.  If we ever return to Vegas with our little daughter, we might (might might might) return for a couple of hours to hit up the Adventuredome - but we will stay far away otherwise.
