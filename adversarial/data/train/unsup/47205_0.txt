Always like to see new and interesting places to eat in Rock Hill, and being a wing joint is all the better. The location beside Cherry roads Publix seems well and good. Half a dozen tables inside with 4 or so outside, almost  all were full, not bad to start. The cashier was friendly, helpful with the menu and professional. The menu is wings, burgers etc, wing are made fresh daily and were cooked when ordered. The wings came out spicy, hot, cooked perfectly, not too dry, not too wet. So you ask, why only 3 stars? Fair enough.. the menu should have an option of wet and dry wings, and... AND the ranch dressing should be made in house, the bottle type really is notable and takes away from the total experience. \nOn the positive side, the sweet tea was spot on, and for a northern franchise that in its self deserves mention.
