Delicious!!!! Love this place so much we had the Vegas fries which is a must!! They came with a buffalo sauce and blue cheese we also had the Mayor of flavor town which is a burger with pastrami, come slaw and beef. Both were equally amazing. They have an amazing menu and everything sounds different but delicious service could have been better but it was good. I love the layout nice cool place they had a bar as well. Will definitely be back to try some more things on this menu!!
