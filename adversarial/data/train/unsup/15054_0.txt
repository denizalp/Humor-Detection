The food tastes the same as the other location. It's still excellent so instead I'll review the service.\n\nI went with my boyfriend on a Friday night. The place was really empty even though we were there for 6pm ish. They were all very friendly! They explained the menu to is, not that we needed it but it was really appreciated. They also checked in with us a couple of times during the meal to see if we were ok.\n\nMonday to Friday they have a special 5-7 deal where some poutines\/burger\/hot dogs are 10$ and some cocktails\/beers are 5$. So we got 2 poutines and 2 drinks. They don't have regular ice tea on the menu but the server offered to make me a homemade one that didn't have any alcohol in it. \n\nService was also very fast, because they were empty I'm guessing, we ordered at 6:30 and for the food at 6:41. 11 minutes is not a long time to wait and the food was fresh and warm!\nI really like the way it is presented too, much more restaurant friendly. \n\nI will say the the poutine mac and cheese is not as fun as the hot dog mac and cheese. I LOVE mac and cheese and the taste was just a bit lost with the poutine gravy. It still tasted good but I wish they had a mac and cheese option!! It's so good there. Next time I'll try the burger :)
