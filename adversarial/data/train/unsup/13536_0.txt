2nd time around and it reminded me how great the sandwich tastes. The crispyness of the bread, the generous portion of meat in the sandwich. \n\nit's a place to stop by when you're in vegas and feeling hungry but not hungry enough for a buffet nor willing to pay the pricey meals in a sit down restaurant.\n\nmy favorite: the montagu's ... man, now i want one for lunch.\n\nhey, it turns out that this place is now opened 24hrs! if only i knew i would have came here for a quick bite at 2am instead of going to McD's.
