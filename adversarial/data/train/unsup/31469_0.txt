Never had a bad experience at this store but today was even better. Came to exchange and return a few things I bought online. Unfortunately, they didn't have the size I needed in stock. Reordering and refund was easy peasy thanks to Kim. She took care of everything for me. It doesn't hurt that she has a very sunny personality as well.\n\nThey also offer military discount btw.
