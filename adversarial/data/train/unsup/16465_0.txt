I just went to the most disgusting Ross store I've ever seen. The fitting rooms are beyond disgusting; they smelled like piss & the specific one I was in had some type of liquid on the floor and I accidentally stepped in it !! \nI told the people working near the fitting rooms that it smells like piss & it's disgusting & I said they should clean them!\nThe girl responds; \" haha , I kno it smells idk who cleans them\" \n( like wtf is so funny?!!\nI then went to the manager & she says \" I kno, I tried cleaning it earlier but didn't kno what room it was in\" \nLike ok?!?! CLEAN THEM ALL THEN DAMNIT!!! what'd you just give up and not clean at all cause u didn't know which room it was in?! They ALL look awful!\nSo now I have to go all the way home & take a shower & sanitize my feet before I continue my errands! I'm not happy.\n\n#pissed #filthystore #lazyassholes
