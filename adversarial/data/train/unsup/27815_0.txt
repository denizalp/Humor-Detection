I have a father that knows everything about electronics. He's made his own 'high fi' back in the day and now puts together computers to give to his kids and grand kids. He told us about Fry's and we didn't have any idea what he was talking about, we had only seen the usual stores for electronic gear like radio shack. But then, we learned Fry's was coming to town, and well we had to see what all the hype was about. \n\nWe went during the grand opening a few years back, but didn't really appreciate it for what it was. We attempted to buy a gift card for my father for father's day, but back then they didn't have the cards like they have now, instead we were given a sheet of paper that we stuffed in an envelope and sent to him. \n\nSince then, we have grown to appreciate this store for what it is, a great place to purchase electronics at good prices, (check out the ad in Fridays paper each week for their specials). It's also a great do it yourself kinda of place. \n\nWe had been given one of my dad's computers in 2002, and well one day last fall it just went up in smoked and we were forced to rely on our lap top. My husband thought if my old man could put together a computer, perhaps he could too. So he bought a book and began to study the matter. \n\nOne day we walked into Fry's to take a look around and it was the first day for the newest release of computer chips and before we knew it we had purchased a new computer at a bargain price and once we added the monitor, had what we now refer to as our perfect system. It wasn't something that we expected to find that day, but the price was just right and didn't make sense for us to start from scratch at least with the price we paid for this system. \n\nI think my husband still has a bug to put one together and have no doubt that he will, but at least it's good to know that there is a place like Fry's to find what we need. And we'll be back for sure.
