Sandy is an amazing photographer! 5 stars for sure! She shot our wedding last year. Not only is she super talented, but she is one of the most generous, sweetest, and kindest person I know! The first time we met Sandy, we totally clicked and by the end of our initial meeting, my fiancé and I knew we wanted Sandy as our photographer. We didn't need to look any further. She was THE ONE! You can tell she is truly passionate about what she does. She went above and beyond with our creative shoot and created a beautiful set up made with some handmade elements (which I loved coz I'm such a DIY gal). She listened to our love story and found a way to incorporate what was really important to my fiance and I, in our wedding photos. You can feel that she genuinely wants to get to know you and your fiancé and with that be able to reflect the kind of photos you want on your big day. If I could do it all over again, I would hire Sandy again in a heartbeat!
