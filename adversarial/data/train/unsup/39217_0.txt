This was a second visit for Sunman and my first visit.  It is conveniently located right off the strip in the Linq hotel\/casino LasVegas.  The staff are extremely friendly but can't get a simple order correct for the life of them.  Wine is wine and there aren't that many beers to overwhelm the average bartender.\n\nWe spoke with other diners who had ordered turkey burgers and were not happy.  We had ordered the nachos with beef short rib which we had ordered without cilantro.  To our dismay, the nachos came with extra cilantro and were sent back.  On an afternoon with very little business, I would have expected that the order would be correct.  It is very loud and lacked a special lure as compared  to other sites along the strip.  Customer service was only so-so.  The next trip to Las Vegas will not include a trip to Guy Fieri's spot.
