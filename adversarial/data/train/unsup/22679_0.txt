Woah! Talk about a savory burger! I was craving a burger, and something other than In-N-Out (not that I have anything against them, it's just I've had their burgers so much the past few weeks I wanted to try something new and different), and thanks to my fellow Yelpers, found Caveman Burgers. It is quite the little gem, somewhat hiding in the complex -- I probably annoyed a few drivers looking for this place. (For those geographically challenged like me, Caveman Burgers faces Bell Road, and you can see Pollo Loco and Village Inn from there.) \n\nI walked in and was greeted by the friendly cashier, ready to take my order. I was super hungry and everything looked so good I didn't know what to order. I asked the cashier what his favorite was and he told me he preferred The Savory-Toothed -- Natural Angus Beef, Bacon, Pickles, All-Natural Peanut Butter (I totally turned my nose up at this one), Ghost Pepper Aioli, Cheddar Cheese on a Fresh Baked Bun. The cashier saw my reaction and assured me you couldn't actually taste the peanut butter... because peanut butter and beef, eh, didn't sound like a good combination. Well, I figured what the hey, I drove all the way here and would try something different so I went for it; I got The Savory-Toothed Burger, and boy was dead wrong -- peanut butter and beef is a heavenly combination! The burger was extremely juicy, and savory, and brought out the \"caveman\" in me, as messy as I got while eating this burger. But I didn't care; I was pleased with my choice. I also got an order of yummy fries, which didn't stand a chance (oh so good!) \n\nThe staff here are extremely attentive and friendly, and will actually check up on you to make sure everything is to your satisfaction and will bring you anything you need -- which gave it that step above the rest with other burger joints. I definitely will be back to have another burger here; it was good stuff!
