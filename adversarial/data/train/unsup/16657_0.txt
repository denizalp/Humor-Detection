Finally a gym that I can slam my MAX weight down, grunt, and feel satisfied after sets and then everyone looks at me shakes their heads and laughs saying what that's it!? I hate it when the girls lift more than me.\n\nHonestly I like that they have classes, friendly staff, functional equipment, heavy and light weights, free weights, various machines, tanning, movies, and other things my usual gym don't have. For what they offer I like it. They also have free WiFi.\n\nEquipment is a little old and worn down but they keep them clean and in working condition.\n\nNo basketball, racquet ball, pool, or running track. Standard gym for working out.
