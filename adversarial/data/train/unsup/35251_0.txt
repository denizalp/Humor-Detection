Great service for any budget! \nRob and his team created a fabulous feast for our daughter's wedding; we had 120 guests and he helped us by offering delicious options that both looked wonderful , and fit within our budget. \nOur guests enjoyed appetizers followed by a plentiful buffet of pastas with several sauces, chicken , steamed veggies, etc.\nWhether you want exotic or basic , Chef Phoenix is your ticket!
