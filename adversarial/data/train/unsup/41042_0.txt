First night of my yearly March Madness trip to Las Vegas I like to go out for a nice dinner . . . tonight's was GREAT.\n\nStarted with a cocktail from the bar . . . the Midnight Stranger . . . and it  was unbelievable . . . already a bourbon fan, but this took me to another level.\n\nFor my appetizer I decided on the Grilled Octopus . . . the octopus was grilled perfectly . . . but the sauce really brought out the flavor and my it unbelievable.\n\nFor my entr√©e I selected the Sea Bass with a side of brussel sprouts . . . cooked to perfection and again, the layering of flavors from the sauce made this great.\n\nI loved the atmosphere and the staff . . . and this place is definitely on the must try again list . . .
