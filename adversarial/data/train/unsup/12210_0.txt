I called Parker & Sons for the first time this morning after my garbage disposal decided to go out... of course, just in time for the holidays and family coming to town! So in a panic, I called to see if they would come by that same day to get things back in working order.  To my relief they said they would be able to come by that same day, but  the time frame they gave me was \"sometime this afternoon.\"  Luckily I had the luxury of waiting around, but I lucked out and didn't have to wait long at all!  Few minutes past noon I got a call that they were to the rescue!  \n\nWhen the plumber arrived he got straight to work looking at my garbage disposal.  After working for a few minutes on the disposal, he flipped the switch and voila! it was back up and running again!  He even taught me a few tricks for how to fix lil' problems that might occur and cheep alternatives for keeping the disposal clean.  Thank you Parker & Sons!!
