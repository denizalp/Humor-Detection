Wawawewa! Yelp buddies Jen and Chad, thanks for taking me to WOW Sushi.\n\nMaki set lunch ($12) was pretty delicious. And the portion size was big for lunch. \n\nI didn't try any of the sashimi, but it was obvious from Chad & Jen's meals that the fish here is ridiculously fresh. Next time I will go for the Chirashi for sure.\n\nService was the usual over-the-top Japanese friendliness. (THANK YOU BYE!!!!, THANK YOU BYE!!!!)\n\nEverything was perfect here except the decor is really quite simplistic. Makes for a great lunch but I can't see wanting to do a dinner here (especially a date)  since it's somewhat lacking ambiance.
