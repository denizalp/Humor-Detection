We bought the $20 for $38 deal on yelp and went to get two foot massages. Wen we walked in it was really dark and we actually questioned if it was actually open or not. \nThe lady at the front didn't speak English and didn't understand the deal that we had purchased but was still trying to convince me that it was only worth $20. This went on for about 10 minutes then she finally brought us back to a seat and said we will w with you in 20 minutes. She got on the phone with someone and came back to me like 3 times telling me that I owed them $20. After arguing some more, she disappeared for 15 more minutes and we walked out. I am trying to contact Yelp to get my money back because I never redeemed the voucher and was extremely disappointed. I have NO IDEA how they have the rating that they do. \nI would highly recommend staying away from this place.
