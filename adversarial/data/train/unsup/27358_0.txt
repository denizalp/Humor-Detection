Jamba Juice is a great place for a quick smoothie. We had great service and there was no wait at all. The prices have gone up quite a bit in the last couple years. However, the quality and selection has also gone up. We both ordered the chocolate peanut butter love that includes protein in it. I would recommend this place to anyone.
