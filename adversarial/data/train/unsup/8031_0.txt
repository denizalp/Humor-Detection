This dealership has gone down hill! The sharks were waiting inside but pounced before we even opened the door. Did not bother introducing himself or asking my name. Gave the minimal effort when showing us the car we were interested in, didn't even bother to offer a test drive. Low balled the trade in and tried to hide it the numbers. Clearly did not want to make a sale today.... or ever again with me. Your loss because car dealerships are a plenty.
