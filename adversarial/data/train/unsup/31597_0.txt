Cafe Tranquilo at The Clarendon Hotel in Phoenix is amazing!!! The food is so fresh and yet still made quickly. Because we were staying at the hotel we had dinner and then breakfast the next morning. The menu had something for everyone in my family. My daughter is so picky, but even she said that she loved the food. (Mom is happy about that! She ate her whole meal for a change!) Our server, Jacob, was so  friendly and helpful.  (We were lucky enough to have him as our server for both meals.) It felt like we were having a meal at a friend's house or something! At breakfast, he recommended the flapjacks and they were so fresh and perfectly cooked! Served with real maple syrup too...Yum! All in all a great restaurant in a great hotel!!! We will comeback to Phoenix just to stay and eat here!!!
