Tried the shampoo (and inherently, conditioner) treatment and my hair is now surprisingly soft. Was relaxing and enjoyable. Not as much of a true scalp massage or scrubbing as I had expected. Now in the middle of an awesome foot massage by Jenny. Wow, I needed this. Nice location with barbecue and other good choices in the vicinity.
