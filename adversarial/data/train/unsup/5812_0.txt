I have been living away from Toronto since 1999.  When I went back for a visit last month, a good friend of mine decided to take me to the Distillery since I like all things artsy and unique.  The temperature was something like -9 degress Fahrenheit so when my friend suggested going to a \"chocolate place,\" I was open to the idea but had very little expectation of it.  I have never been too fond of chocolate outside of Europe (Christian Constant of Paris being my favorite of all time, until now) and didn't think anything made in North America would be worth the calories.  After 15 minutes of looking, smelling and tasting (the friend bought me a cup of hot chocolate and shared with me the pyramid of dark chocolate she bought), I came out of the store with about $45 worth of cookies and chocolate.  All of Soma's chocolate products incl. dark chocolate, were extra smooth with no bitter aftertaste.  I love Soma and am so proud that Canadian-made chocolates have risen to European chocolate standard.  Soma chocolate products are pricey but definitely worth the money.  Soma beats big names such as Godiva, Teuscher, Neuhaus, etc. any day in terms of taste and quality.
