Somehow this chain charges as much as a fancy steakhouse for some entrees. My two chicken cutlets served over potato cakes and with a bacon tomato sauce was about $20. The other entree was a stuffed baked potato and that was about $14. Both entrees had their moments and were easily edible, but over priced by about $5 each. The entrees were served with soup or salad and they were average, but the free garlic bread thing was excellent and buttery. The ceasar was standard, pre-made and chilled waiting in a refrigerator for customer to order, while the soup had no taste and the potatoes were cut incorrectly which made the soup tough to eat. Chopped would have been better. \n  \n   Ok, my main beef with this place was the use of fake or plastic cookies in the display case at the front counter. The cookie in that case looks real and it looks good, almost like a smores cookie. Yep, all those cookies were painted to look good, so when I ordered a cookie to go from the case and it did not look anything like that cookie in the case, I became curious and learned of the fake cookie thing and fake cake too. The cookie was still good, but the one in case looks better, but probably would not have tasted better. Either way, put some real cookies in the case cause it is basically false advertising on this chain's part.
