My friends and I decided to eat here after watching a movie due to it's decent prices and convenience of already being at the Red Rock. Also because we've all mutually agree that military messing facilities and a good 80% of airline food we've eaten is better then anything the \"Feast\" Buffet can offer.\n\nGoing here was like the opening scene from Saving Private Ryan. Cabo met all our demands for a place to eat that offered variety and good food to cost ratio, similar to how  Omaha beach was chosen for the invasion of Normandy. \n\nAfter we ordered everything looked alright as we departed from our transports out on the sea of waiting for food to come. When it food came it was chaos.\n\nDisappointment ripped through me like a German Machine gun net hacking apart sea sick soldiers trying to land. The pictures on the menu looked nothing NOTHING like the hell that looked back at me on the plate.\n\nThe beef was overcooked and had parts of dark dry red areas suggesting it's been cooked earlier, thrown to the side, then heated up again. The pork was whole instead of shredded from the picture. The chicken...oh god the chicken...so many hormones and antibiotics used in our live stock yet the most pathetically small chicken breast i have ever saw and it looked like half of it was blown away by German motar fire. \n\nDuring the entire meal i felt like the medic struggling to maintain myself and stop of bleeding of this poor wrenched soul of a meal. One bite of a piece of shrimp, SUCCESS!! the bleeding stopped!! there's something to look forward to!! another chew and a stray bullet penetrated that poor soul's helmet sending him to his preferred afterlife....all that effort...for nothing. \n\nAs we walked away from the meal i told myself...'never again...never again'\n\n(Note - There are many ways i could have written this review. I choose to do it this way for it's the most entertaining for me and for readers)
