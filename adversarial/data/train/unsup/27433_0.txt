This company was hired to clean after a Christmas party.  Their booking was confirmed several times as well as an additional phone call that was made after they were 20 minutes late. (no answer to that call, left a message) They finally arrived an hour after they were due with no cleaning supplies (apparently) available.  By that time, our volunteers were almost finished doing the cleaning themselves so the services of Fiv5 Star were unnecessary.  When I told them to go away, they tried to pressure me into paying them anyway.  Obviously, I told them that I don't pay people that don't show up!
