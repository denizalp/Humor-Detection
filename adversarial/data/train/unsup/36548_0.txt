This motel was absolutely disgusting. I will give credit to the woman at the front desk, Dee, for being willing to give us a refund no questions asked. The first room we were given smelled disgusting so we asked for a new one. We got keys to a new room, opened it, and everything had been used. Sheets were all over the beds, drawers were open, etc. We received a refund and went across the street to the La Quinta that was a million times better. I don't understand how the city gave this motel a 94 for cleanliness. Absolutely horrific.
