Fantastic prices for being on the strip. Has been around for a LONG TIME. Food is pretty good I would go again. Service isn't their best attribute but over all good and again a great price. House wine sucks but hey its included with your meal so you Dont have to feel guilty not drinking it. Skip the cappuccino but say yes to the salad they offer and chicken parm! Yum!
