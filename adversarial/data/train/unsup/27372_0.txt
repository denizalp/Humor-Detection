I know when you think fremont street there is nothing great to eat but I found grotto. The golden nugget seems to always be busy and we had a gift card for grotto. Service was good, BEST chicken parmesan ever! Outstanding cheesecake and the grotto red blend house wine is super delicious. I never would think a house wine would be good. The pasta was nothing crazy and the salad too. The prices were equivalent to Carraba's. \n\nPROS: Grotto house wine, chicken parmesan, cheesecake, service\nCONS: Pasta, salad\n\nGet the seats by the aquarium!
