We've previously dined here before and had a great time but I guess they've gone downhill since then (or at least this location). There's no valet :( we waited a few min before we were sat at a booth, we let our server know we would need a steak to go and she advised us to order it after we get out meal.We started out with the carpaccio and pork belly, the carpaccio is still the best in town but the pork was dry and underwhelming at best. The salads followed we had the Caesar (great flavor) and Flemings (very bland). This is where the bad starts my husbands NY strip was cooked properly but mine and my friends were not I ordered med rare ( I received med well) my friend ordered med (got med rare) I sent mine back, the server was not happy with that. After 15 min I got my new steak done right, at this point the rest of the table were finished eating so we ordered dessert and reminded our server we wanted a meal to go and our check because we had to leave soon. She seemed very busy and I had to flag down another server to pay our bill, after 25-30 min we finally had our meal and could leave. Bottom line I think next time we want a good steak we'll go to the Scottsdale location or City Hall!
