Truly a legit Asian establishment. I swear they have a million pictures on the wall to confuse the hell out of you. Through my experience eating here, I would recommend the spicy fish, jade tofu, the greens, house dumplings, and eggplant something I can't recall. They even have the HK style baked pork chop but it takes unusually long for them to make the order, so I don't see it worth the time. \n\nAnd it's no doubt ALWAYS open. Always.
