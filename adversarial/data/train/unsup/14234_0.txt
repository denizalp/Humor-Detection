Great food, great service. Expect to pay a pretty penny, but worth it for a splurge in Vegas (esp if you win some $$!). Ladies, wear your fat dress for this meal.. you'll thank me later.\n\n+ bone-in ribeye medium rare (9\/10): amazing steak! Perfectly cooked and they were generous enough to split it in half for us when we said we were sharing. One of my friends pieces had a bit too much fat though..\n+ bone marrow 8\/10: yum yum yum\n+ creamed spinach, potatoes au gratin, creamed corn 8\/10: deeeelicious sides. Recommend all, esp the potatoes!\n\n ~ table-side Caesar 6.5\/10: maybe it's the fact that they make it at your table so it's more fun, but this was simple and delicious. Def a pretty pricey salad\n~ scallops 5\/10: prob my least favorite starter. Was tasty, but nothing special compared to other scallops I've had. And, it was $20 for 2 tiny scallops!
