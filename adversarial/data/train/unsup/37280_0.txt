Seems like they stepped up their game lately with the salsa. It's got a hell of a lot more of a kick to it.\n\nAlso got a potato and chorizo gordita this time around. It was amazing, and I hate sausage. The chorizo blended with the potatoes in a way that made it seem more like an additional flavoring to the potato rather than random chunks of meat. The potatoes were buttery and thick, and gave the whole gordita a delicious and interesting consistency. I was so excited to eat it that I burnt the hell out of my mouth in the process.
