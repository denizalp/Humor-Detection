It's unpopular opinion time!  I really don't think this place is very good.  In fact, there are large parts that I actively dislike.  You can read all the great wonderful stuff in all the other reviews, but check it out - here we go.\n\nThe Wait:\nSo, 11am on a Tuesday, I waited for an hour.  To be fair, it could have only been 40 minutes, if not for the girl who ran in squealing to be with her friend who had waited without her.  This girl came in, ordered a cheesecake, and giggled her way out.\n\nIt should be noted that until this point, I was #12 in line.  She pushed me to #13.  The is important because they only make 12 cakes at a time.  Rather than having my cheese cake and being on my way, I was stuck waiting for another 25 minutes for the first of the following batch.\n\nNow, I have no problem waiting around, and my review doesn't take that into account.  That's just something people should be aware of.\n\nThe Staff:\nThey're just quiet little worker bees going about their business, saying nothing to anyone.  Which must be weird, as people who have waited in long lines, and just got inside, are glaring into their souls, waiting for the next batch to come out of the overs.  \n\nWhen I was there there were six people working.  I say working, because I think they were being paid, but really they just stand around.  Every 20 minutes they get together, do something, and then stand around a lot.  This place could be run by 2 people, and needs no more than 3.  It's odd, but hey - job creation is important.  I think it's bad business, but I don't fault it.\n\nI don't even fault the fact that they don't have enough ovens to meet demand, because obviously a big part of this place is the status of being seen carrying the bag around, because it says, \"I waited.\"  It's what makes diamonds so popular.  Without artificial scarcity there'd be no buzz.\n\nBut my review doesn't take that into account either.\n\nThe Cheesecake (and other things):\nYup.  That sure it cheesecake.  It's $10 after tax, so that's a fair price.  It's nothing special though.  It's kind of bland.  It would make a nice base for something that has flavour, I'm sure.  But as it is, it's just... a thing.  If I could walk up to the counter, pay ten bucks without waiting, and be off - would I care?  No.  I would not.  It's just not very good.\n\nBut wait - they have other baked products.  The Marigolds (or whatever they're called.  Little muffin things.)  I wondered if people had to wait in line if they just wanted those, no cheesecake, but couldn't be bothered to ask.  \n\nAs I bit into one of them, I realized something upsetting: Boy was I glad I just bought one, and not the bag of four that everyone else seemed to grab.  They were TERRIBLE.  They were incredibly dry, and once more, without flavour.  It sure was a baked good, but it wasn't a good one.\n\nOverall:\nSo - the price was fine.  The wait was ridiculous.  The food was not so great.\n\nWould I go back?  No.  Not with those lines.  Would I go back, without a line?  Probably not.  If it was in front of me, would I have a small slice?  Of course.  The cheesecake, anyway.  At the end of the day, it's still cheesecake...  Keep the Marigolds far away from me, though.\n\nShould you go?  Depends - do you want to carry the bag around, and tell people that you've been?  Sure.  Do it.  Do you really like bland Japanese cheesecake?  Then you'll love this, I'm sure.\n\nOtherwise, I'd say stay away.  Check back in a few months when the hype is gone.\n\nSeriously: 12 cakes, every 20-25 minutes.  If there are twenty five people in front of you, you're waiting an hour.  Be prepared.
