You know what is one of the best things to do in life, fly by the seat of your pants.  When it was suggested to attend a watch party here for a basketball game at first I balked at the idea.  Let me tell you why, I have no idea what is going on with basketball.  I was reassured that I would have a good time, and that was all I needed to hear.\n\nGetting in here wasn't hard at all.  Literally walked in the door, bought my ticket, went through security and started to have a ball...but not a basketball.  This is a beautiful arena, even while in the midst of a bit of an overhaul.  \n\nWe watched as the game was going on on the overhead screen and we enjoyed the entertainment they provided on the court during downtime.  As it was suggested, I did have a blast.  Made some new friends in the process and would do it again in a heartbeat.\n\nPrices for drink\/food inside were what I expected, so I was floored there, just thought it was a bit unnecessary.
