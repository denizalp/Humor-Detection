Whole Foods is a great place to find anything Allergy Free! \n\nI am allergic to soy and dairy - so I can't eat much of the food found in traditional supermarkets. Thank God for Whole Foods. They have so many options for me. So if you have food allergies, this is the place for you.\n\nThey also have a large selection of Organic Fruits & Veggies - most of the time they are fresh and free of soil and bugs (top quality). Sometimes, they can be better. I have gotten rotten organic carrots & other veggies from them on occasion, and the bell peppers are sometimes too old to seriously consider taking home. Really, love the quality Organic Wine selection.\n\nOn occasion, their meats have not been the freshest, high quality meat that is expected from them - so much so that I have gone back to getting my meats elsewhere.\n\nThey have an incredible food court from sushi to BBQ to Mexican & more, but the facilities (restrooms) are small and often dirty - not what you would expect at all from the look of the food court.\n\nThis is the only place I shop for groceries other than meat.
