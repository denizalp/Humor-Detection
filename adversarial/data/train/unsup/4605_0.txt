Alcoholic Milk shakes! I'm sold! I came here for the milk shakes because what other place then Vegas can you walk around with alcohol in your hand.\n\nThe place is pretty easy to find, it is right next to Monte Carlo. The decor is very chic and vibrant. They have all kinds of jelly beans (very expensive, each bag cost $5) and they had a few tables and a Lord of the Rings pin ball machine!\n\nAs for the ice cream, they pride themselves in alcoholic ice cream. Their flavors range from Horchata up to Cabernet Sauvignon. Freaking crazy! I was deciding between the Irish coffee shake or the adult cookie jar. In the end, I couldn't resist the blend of vanilla bean, oreo crumbles and skyy raspberry cocktail. Unfortunately, they used to give them out in Mason jars and now they put them in plastic cups. Boo. Also, it was solid drink but pretty pricey for $13. For a few dollars more I rather go to Holsteins in Cosmo and have the best shakes there.\n\nOverall, it was a decent experience. For the price, I don't think its worth it minus the novelty of everything. If you are craving for an alcoholic shake, I would rather visit Holsteins.
