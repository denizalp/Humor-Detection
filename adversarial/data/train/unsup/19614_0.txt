So I made reservations for my birthday celebration for Friday 3\/30 for 16 people and they were more than accommodating. I chose Herbs & Rye due to the awesome reviews and their happy hour deals. What I didn't know is that basically you still get robbed on your bill. Technically your bill should be based on what you paid and your taxed on what you paid and you tip on what you paid. Nope not here. Now do-not get me wrong my waiter was fabulous and I am all for paying 20%. But if my bill is $369.25 with tax and tip how the hell you figure you should get $524.18. When I questioned it I was told it based on the price before the discounts. YEA I DONT THINK SO. Very very disappointed with your way of doing business. \n\n5\/16. It's funny how I made this complaint and no one has ever responded. Soo sad.
