Looking for a succulent and perfectly grilled chicken to satisfy your hunger?  Well, look no further!  \n\nPing Gai (Ping = grilled, Gai = chicken in Thai) at the Queen Mother Caf√© was one of the tastiest grilled chicken meals I have had in a long time...in fact that last time was also with the Queen of Toronto and her Wingman but at a roadside stand in Chiang Mai. Coincidence?  It was smoky, crispy and bursting with flavor.  Perfectly marinated with black peppercorns, garlic, and corianders.  So good!\n\nAnother one of my favorites was the Pulled Chicken Crepes.  Two rolled crepes stuffed with spicy chicken were simply fantastic.  Awesome contrast between sweet and savory.  The side salad kept this dish light and fresh!\n\nAnd if ... you are looking for something sweet, the Stuffed French Toast here is fabulous!  The French toast was crispy on the outside and melt in your mouth good on the inside without being soggy.\n\nService was superb!\n\nGood food, homey patio and excellent service.  This is a great place for brunch in my book.
