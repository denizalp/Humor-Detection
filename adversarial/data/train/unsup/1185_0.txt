I came here for a Summerlicious lunch this year, and I have to say that I was pretty disappointed. Both my friend and I ordered the cucumber gazpacho to start, which she aptly described as \"a facial in a bowl\". It had this strange...unique...flavour which wasn't necessarily bad...but it wasn't good, either. The strange gazpacho was followed by a mushroom papardelle which was actually quite good - I would say it was the highlight of my meal, with a creamy, flavourful sauce and fresh ribbons of delicious pasta. For dessert I had the \"BLD bread pudding\", which turned out to be not like authentic bread pudding at all and more like two slices of dry bread sitting on top of a puddle of creme anglaise. \n\nService was quite brusque, and there were obvious dirty fingerprints all over my plates. *Mysteriously* it was only after I whipped out my credit card to pay for lunch that our server suddenly became all amicable. This might be sad to say, but for $20 I would have rather had a burrito and a beer for lunch.
