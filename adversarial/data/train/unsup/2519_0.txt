Thank the lord there is places like Vintner Grill that I can take my Las Vegas guests too instead of the overpriced restaurants on the Strip.  \n\nI went here for the first time several weeks ago, and I was completely taken by surprise.  It really is unexpected to find a restaurant like this in an office park.  The place was busy (in a good kinda way) on a wednesday evening.  It looks like a hangout for the young professionals in Vegas.  \n\nSo the bar\/lounge\/waiting area is separated from the dining area of the restaurant with glass screens that play movies on both sides of them.  It was an old Humphrey Bogart movie called To Have and Have Not... \"You know Steve, you're not very hard to figure, only at times. Sometimes I know exactly what you're going to say. Most of the time. The other times... the other times, you're just a stinker.\"  Anyway... so me, My T., Thao N, and Humphrey B., were seated at a table.  \n\nThe bread man came.  And it was served with butter.  By the way, you must go to this restaurant to see how the butter is served, never seen it done in this way.\n\nSo I had never had wild boar before... so we ordered some with cheese in the beginning.  And we also ordered a wild boar bolognese pasta.  I was a little freaked out at first, but my god, that was delicious.  There are a bunch of small plates, I can tell you what I got, but I would suggest just ordering what fits your needs.  I'm a calamari, beet salad kinda guy.  \n\nHave fun!
