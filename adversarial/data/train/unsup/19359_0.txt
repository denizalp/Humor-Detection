I had small tattoo done here that I was not very pleased with...yay, it's permanent!\n\nThe shop itself is beautiful and looks and smells very clean, however when I described what I wanted to the artist, he kept saying no and changing things around, assuring me that his way would look \"better\".  I really wish I had stuck to my guns and gone for what I originally wanted.  \n\nWhile he was tattooing me, he himself did a meticulous job, I must say, however,his neighbour kept making comments that I found inappropriate.  He was some blonde, glasses, pirate look a like.  He was working on a larger piece on another client and kept turning around and looking at my wrist saying \"why\" and other bizarre things.  It made me very uncomfortable as I had no idea what he was referring to in the first place.  \n\nThe price was hefty, but for a reputable place I didn't mind.  I ended up pleased with the tattoo (even though it wasn't my original idea) but the customer service and atmosphere\/vibe from employees assured that I will never return OR recommend to friends.  It would have helped if the artist was a bit more comfortable with his skills so that he could pull off what I originally wanted.
