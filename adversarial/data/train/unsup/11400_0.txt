This is the most DISHONEST automotive business that my husband & I have ever encountered. \n\nWe brought my newly purchased used automobile to \"Dick's Speed-O-Tach Tempe\" (this IS NOT the same owner NOR does this business have ANY relationship with the \"Original Dick's Speed-O-Tach\" Phoenix, by the way) because my speedometer was not correctly measuring my speed. My vehicle was there less than an hour & I was told by \"Mike,\" the \"manager,\" that \"Russ\" (who I've since learned is the owner) fixed my problem & replaced all stepper motors & all of the lights within the instrument cluster. I paid over $350.00. After driving for 10 miles, the problem still remained with absolutely NO improvement. We called them immediately & said we were coming back. Once we arrived, \"Russ\" put my vehicle on the dynamometer & said \"everything was fine, we replaced everything within the instrument cluster.\" By this time, we knew we weren't going to get anywhere with them so we immediately researched other providers & found \"The Original Dick's Speed-O-Tach\" in Phoenix. Nick, the owner, looked over our receipt to see what was done & nothing was itemized- it only stated \"labor & parts\"labor & parts\" & a price of over $350.00. We left our vehicle in the care of Nick. Nick called us the next day & told us that not one thing-none of the stepper motors or the lights within the instrument panel had been replaced- nor had the instrument cluster been taken apart- & all of the stepper motors & lights were the original OEM parts- nothing had been touched by this supposed specialty \"repair place\" in Tempe! I called & asked to speak to the owner-\"Russ.\" The male identified himself as the owner Russ. I told him I would be coming back to talk to him about the fact that the work was never done...Russ stated \"I don't talk to customers, I leave that to the manager.\" Instead of going back to this completely dishonest shop, I decided to call my Visa card's Dispute Department, which I did, told my assigned investigator the issue & within a week she completed her investigation. Nick, the owner of the very honest \"The Original Dick's Speed-O-Tach\" in Phoenix wrote a professionally objective letter, stating nothing had been replaced within the instrument panel whatsoever, it had not even been taken apart. My Visa card company took back all of my money from the dishonest \"Dick's Speed-O-Tach\" in Tempe because of this discovery- that no work had ever been done by them.\n\nI am very happy to report that my vehiclewas totally fixed by Nick @ \"The Original Dick's Speed-O-Tach\" in Phoenix @ a fraction of the price. Nick also gave us all of the old parts that he had replaced. \n\nDon't EVER patronize \"Dick's Speed-O-Tach\" in Tempe!!!!
