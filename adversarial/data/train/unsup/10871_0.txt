Most disgusting place I have ever eaten at.\n\nCustomers look and act like a bunch of animals, and the place is extremely filthy.\n\nThey make you get your own drinks and silverware.\n\nThe girl taking the orders is very rude.  \n\nI'm ordered a well done sub, and got a luke warm piece of chicken in between 2 cold, uncooked pieces of stale italian bread.\n\nThe wedding soup is probably the most tasteless and watery I have had.\n\nIf you are a disgusting animal, please eat here.   If you are human, go elsewhere.
