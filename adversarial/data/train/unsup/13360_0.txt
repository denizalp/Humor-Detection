This place is the most gorgeous hotel on the strip that I've ever seen! Only Ceasar's Palace can rival this place how amazing the decor is! Of course, there are lots of gorgeous hotels along the strip, but this one happens to be one of my favorites so far. The pitcure of the horse  with the glass celiing is by an artist called Chihuly. Not the horse, but the glasswork was done by him. \n\nAs for the Asian statues and the monkeys by the waterfall and the peach tree, that was done for the Chinese New Years. It's the year of the monkey, so that's why there are a few monkeys in the tree. It's supposed to be a great year for rats and rabbits-:) \n\nWe didn't stay there, but we did have a drink inside the cafe nearby. It was a nice and classy place. There was a huge pool outside that was open that we could see from the cafe's window. It must be heated as a few people were out there swimming despite it being about 60 degrees outside. I hope to stay there one day.
