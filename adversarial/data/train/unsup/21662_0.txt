My husband and I came to this restaurant in hopes of a good torta ahogada. Therefore, replacing the place we visit in Chandler. \n\n At the time of ordering a lady which might of been the owner was in the back of the register grabbing chips and all sorts of things, but that isn't my problem. She went to grab chips no gloves no nothing and just grabbed the chips out with her hand when the tongs were next to the chips. Needless to say we and the people after that were served out of the same tray with the tongs. \n\nI realize this might not be a major crime, but please she looked at me as she did it. If these things are going on with customers watching what might be going on in the back where we cannot see. \n\nWe should of maybe listened to all of the reviews on the tacos and just done the drive to Chandler for a torta ahogada. The torta just tasted like a carnitas (pork meat sandwich) with the red salsa they provide at the bar poured on top. I had a regular quesadilla de asada, which consisted of mainly fat. \n\nThe service was really good the lady taking our order was friendly and the food did come out fast. But friendliness and fast food doesn't bring customers back.
