I think Earl's was erected for the noble man who refuses to go to Hooter's not because he doesn't like the sight of women putting themselves on display but because he likes to tell women that he doesn't go to Hooter's.  \n\nEarl's in other words, is a high class Hooters.  The waitresses dress skimpily, lean over their tables in that oh so right way, and serve above par burgers and wings.  Being of the female orientation I still think Earls is a fun place to go, despite having to grit my teeth when the blond bomb shell grins her Crest whitened teeth at me, shoves her boobs in my face and asks me if I would like the awesome drink special.  \n\nThere are a variety of choices on the menu, but my tip is to stick to the middle of the road food, burgers, sandwiches, apps (the wings and the dry ribs are excellent) etc. don't stray into the ethnic categories leave that to a restaurant that doesn't hire staff based on breast size.
