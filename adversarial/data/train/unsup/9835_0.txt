We had the Tuscan flatbread which was good - but could have been a bit hotter - it was only semi-warm. \nThe staff needs customer service training. They are still not sure what to do, or when to do it. \nThe bartender gave us our menu, we figured out what we wanted, then she said, \"Oh you can't order that - you have the wrong menu\".\nThe atmosphere could be warmer. It is very modern, stiff and sterile. The metal chairs were not comfortable - they looked like prison seating.
