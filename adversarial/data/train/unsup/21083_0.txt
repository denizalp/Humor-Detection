Five reasons I gave d'Vine Wine five stars:\n\n1. Sixto, our waiter. Cute, charming and patient.\n2. Parmesan truffle fries. Yummy.\n3. Beef & Gouda Melt. To die for.\n4. Relaxed, but sophisticated vibe. I felt comfortable and cool.\n5. The wine. Hello. Lots to choose from, and the Sauvignon Blanc I had was fantastic!\n\nOnly downfall? It is waaaaay the heck out there, especially from north central Phoenix. But... if I'm ever in that area again, I'll definitely make a point to stop by. It was certainly d-vine.
