This review is for dim sum only. I came in for morning tea, and the food was below average. With this price per dish, there are places with much higher quality foods. A highlight of the main offenders: the dough of my har gow completely fell apart (but the shrimp was cooked \"al dente\", if you know what I mean); the dumpling in soup had canned mushrooms, foods that were definitely not seafood, and really bad and crusty dough; and lastly, the curry cuttlefish had a pubic hair in it. Will not be back, and I definitely do not recommend coming for tea.
