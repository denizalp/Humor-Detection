Is there such thing as a negative star?  The place was dark and empty.  The banner says $20\/hr. foot massage, but when my hubby and I walked in, they pretended that $20 deal was something they didn't know about.  Then when I mentioned the banner hanging outside, she said, \"oh, but that doesn't include the back rub.\" I thought I made it clear when I said foot massage. Whatever... Both girls then started with the shoulder and head.  Massage was mediocre at best. Because they didn't have anyone taking care of the front, they both left to tend to other customers. After 50 minutes, not an hour, they both said they're done.  I didn't want to leave any tips, but my husband wanted to leave some tips. Okay. I gave $100 bill and asked $50 back. $5 tip each. She wanted to bargain with me, \"How about $10 tip, each?\" Are you kidding?
