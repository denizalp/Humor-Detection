Visited here today on the recommendation of a colleague. The restaurant is clean and modern and the service was good. You order at the counter at the back and then sit down. I like how how they bring your food directly to your table and cleaned up when done.\n\nI arrived just a little before the lunch crowd rush and ordered the Seekh (Beef) Kabob lunch special with rice and salad. The beef was good but a little overcooked which made it a bit dry. The rice was OK, but I much prefer the fluffy type you get at Afghan kabob places. The salad was a bunch of shredded lettuce (very difficult to eat) with a few slices of red onion (nice), tomato and cucumber. For the kabob plate experience I would personally stick with the middle eastern type but I may come back here in future to try some of their other dishes.
