I think it's time for me to leave a review on this auto center.\n\nMy dad, who speaks broken english, has been taking his car to this auto center for 20 years. From the first day I went with him (to translate) the owner has been honest and loyal to my father. \n\nThere's nothing worse than to be taken advantage of because you don't understand the language. My dad now speaks english but 20 years ago, this wasn't the case. The owner always showed respect and great craftsmanship.\n\nUpdate:\nMy dad STILL takes his car to this mechanic, now run by his son, who has the same morals as his father.
