Wish I read the warnings on here until it affected my order.  As someone has mentioned, take caution before ordering from here, their customer service is the worst.  We ordered the fettuccine alfredo and low and behold, it comes in marinara.  Apparently despite the description if you put this in your \"cart\" without any adjustments whatsoever it defaults to marinara sauce.  We have made multiple orders in the past and this was 1 item in an order that totaled over $80.  We called and Angelina's refused to send a replacement.\nEat24 reached out to us, apologized and went ahead and got it taken care of.  It was disappointing that Angelina's wasn't a bit more understanding.  The most hilarious part is when they came with the replacement, the delivery guy actually asked for the incorrect pasta back!!!!!!!  Makes me wonder what they intend to do, give it to another customer?\n\nIn addition, I've never seen a restaurant list something like this.  I checked after the ordeal and Angelina tries to charge an extra dollar more to get alfredo sauce with the fettuccini alfredo...?  Doesn't make sense but glad Eat24 had more customer service sense than them.
