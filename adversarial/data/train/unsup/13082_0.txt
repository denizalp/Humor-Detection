This is a long overdue review of my wife and I (well, more my wife than I....) using this hospital to deliver our son in June 2013.  The whole experience from the initial tour, to the pregnancy\/newborn classes, to registration, to labor, to delivery, to checkout, was top notch.  Every one of the hospital's staff we came in contact with was professional, friendly, courteous, and experienced.  I would recommend this hospital to anyone having a baby.\n\nI do, however, have 2 negative comments:\n\n1 - the room service food is not very good and is ridiculously expensive.  I would give the food like 2 yelp stars.\n\n2 - They seriously need to reconsider the accommodations given husbands (or anybody else staying with a person during labor\/delivery).  I have never been more uncomfortable in my life.  The people here can save lives but can't figure out how to procure a comfortable sleeping apparatus (cot, roll-away, etc.) to put in the rooms.  It is all a blur now and all I can remember was a recliner and some other small chair that somehow turned into an awful \"bed\"\n\nNormally I would take away a star because of #1 and #2 above, but since I have a happy and healthy baby and wife I won't.
