I was excited that they opened Sprouts down in this area.  So, I finally went to Sprouts last night with my sister.  She wanted to go there for a couple of things on our way back from our mom's house.  \n\nThis Sprout is really nice.  It seems a little bigger than the other Sprouts around town. That is fine with me.  That means more grocery's to pay. :)  \n\nI will be definitely shopping here for all of my groceries.  I love there produce selections. They always have a great variety of fruit and vegetables that are organic. \n\nSprouts are a great place to shop for your groceries.  So, if you drive by on and keep something you should definitely stop.  :)
