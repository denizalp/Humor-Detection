Dig it.  3.5 stars.  The chicken parm was decent portion for decent price, but I'm not getting my friend's Italian gramma on the phone or anything.\nThe sauce was the best part, sweet and basily.\nThe daily fresh baked bread (they call a Smiley) was great, but should have been served warm, not fridge cold, in order to appreciate its flavor and texture.  \nI will go back, but I will have to try out some other items, such as the array of hot or cold sammiches, before I can say I'm a fan.\n\nReading the history of the place on the back of the menu was a little dry, until getting to the part about some poor schlepp who got shot in the restaurant in a previous location and then a few years later plummeted his car over a cliff edge.  Weird.
