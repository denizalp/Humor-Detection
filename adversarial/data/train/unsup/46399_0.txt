Whenever I want a cold bottle of my favorite wine, I come to Lee's. There's always some kind of sale going on at Lee's, and luckily that usually includes my preferred wine! Lee's arguably has the best prices for liquor, wine, and beer in Las Vegas. The selection is extensive. If Lee's doesn't have what your looking for, it doesn't exist. Just kidding. To be more precise, if Lee's doesn't have it, they can order it for you! \n\nThe staff are highly knowledgeable and can find what you're looking for. So instead of wandering around like an idiot, just ask for help! I wish they were a bit friendlier though. Hmmm friendly vs. helpful....which one's better? Anyways, Lee's is awesome.
