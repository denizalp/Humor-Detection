This is a great addition to the nail salons in the Valley! Diva's is a step above your typical strip mall nail salon but not as expensive or fancy as a high end one. It's the perfect happy medium!\n\nWalking in, I was welcomed by the scent of different herbs such as lavender and orange blossoms. Calming music played and the staff happily welcomed me in. I was a walk in but they quickly accommodated me for a pedicure and gel manicure. Because it's the grand opening, they are offering 20% off all services until May 26th so I opted for the herbal pedicure along with a gel manicure. The herbal pedicure came with a sea salt scrub and an oil massage with my chosen scent (I chose lavender). As soon as I sat down, they gave me a magazine to read and a free bottle of water. I then relaxed and enjoyed my blissful pedicure that included a 10+ minute leg and foot massage! \n\nThe environment here is calm and they have several pedicure chairs and manicure stations. The pedicure chairs provide a very nice massage and are very comfortable and the manicure stations have the gel lighting set within the table themselves. Everything is extremely clean and the staff is very nice. \n\nThe pricing here is pretty competitive to other mom and pop nail shops. A pedicure starts at $20 for the basic pedicure and can go up to $60, depending on the enhancements you choose. The manicures are comparable and a gel manicure is about $30, but a regular manicure is closer to $15. Don't forget to bring cash to tip the staff because they can't accept tips on the credit card statement. \n\nI am very happy that Diva's opened in the Valley and I will definitely be back many times over again!
