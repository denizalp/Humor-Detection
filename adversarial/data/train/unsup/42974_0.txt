This place is awesome. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but on the inside it is row after row of pinball games both vintage and new. They also have some old school video games too. \nTruly a must go for anyone who likes pinball or video games. Most games are 25c but some of the new pinball games are a couple dollars to play. Best arcade in the city. You can have hours of fun for under $20
