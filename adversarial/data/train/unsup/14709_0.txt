Have you played the game \"Hook or no Hook\" here? \n\nIf not you should. I was here last week and I ended up playing a little BJ. The 2 guys that were already playing and the dealer were all playing this side game. It was real funny. Just about every 5 minutes, some lady would walk in and we all take turns guessing if she is a hook or not. You really have to look at the shoes. Most of the time if she has sensible shoes then she probably is not a hook, but I guess you never know. Many of these \"Hooks\" walked straight from the strip entrance right back to the bathroom, which is past the BJ tables. One of the security guards even heard us playing and took it upon himself to check on one of these \"lady's of the night\" that was in the bathroom for a LONG time. I don't know what ended up happening in that situation but it was just funny thinking about it again. This place is really cool and we have been here many times on other trips to Vegas. All I got to say is Burger King is really good after 10 beers at the BJ table. \nRemember to play \"Hook or no Hook\" if you are in O'Sheas. I guess you could play this game at other hotels, but this hotel gave you more and more chances to play every 5 minutes....Good Times....
