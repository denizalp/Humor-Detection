Let me start by saying I tried to come here the Sunday after they opened to find them closed with a note on the door saying they had run out of product. This was annoying because A) parking is a pain and costs money in this area and B) they didn't post that they would be closed online, which is the first thing I would do as a brand new business. \n\nRegardless, I decided to come back to try the food a couple weeks later. The place was somewhat dead on a Saturday night. I tried the spicy ramen. Though it wasn't as greasy as reported by many reviewers (it was certainly edible), it was a bit greasy. It also had very little flavor. I asked for it to be extra spicy and it was hardly spicy. The meat was mediocre. The noodles were fine. I took half for leftovers, but only the noodles were edible a couple days later... The broth had become far too oily which affected the flavor. As far as ramen goes in the phx area, this was certainly near the bottom. \n\nI also had the fried rice and that was pretty tasty. I would go back for the fried rice, but Not for the ramen. \n\nPs the service was fine and the Italian food in the same building was much better than the ramen.
