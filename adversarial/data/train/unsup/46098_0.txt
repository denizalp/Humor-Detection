Came here for a work dinner and I was quite impressed. Besides the stupor customer service, the food and drinks were great!\n\nShrimp and scallop small dish with cheese grits: my favorite dish out of everything I had. The scallops were so tender and perfect. The shrimp was good too but the scallops man. These were mouth watering. The cheese grits were also top notch. They were so creamy and cheesy! \nSweet and sour calamari: this was a new twist to calamari. The batter was falling off the calamari but these nuggets were still addicting!\nOnion rings: huge onion rings. I only ate one piece because the batter was nothing special. It was accompanied by a chipotle mayo tasting sauce but eh. \nBrussels sprouts: what what. I loved it. Perfect texture. It was exactly like how I like to make my brussel sprouts. Slightly charred\/burnt (what ever you like to call it) so they can be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I think the bacon pieces really gave it the extra kick in flavor. \nAsparagus: loved that these were baked or grilled (has black marks)  \nMac and cheese: so creamy and cheesy! There was also bread crumbs on the top. \nPotato dish: eh. I don't really like potatoes. Not sure what the exact name was either. Layer of thin potato stacked with cheese. \nLobster bisque: so creamy and rich! Ahh. I wish I had more of this. \nShrimp side dish: great texture and taste! \nString beans: very flavorful. \nMiso sea bass: it's a tad more sweet than I expected but still great because the fish was so tender and light.\nLobster tail: man I love lobster. It tasted so fresh and smooth. \nCoffee special: I ordered the drinkable desserts as a drink minus the alochol and was served coffee in a cocktail cup. Neat stuff. \nCreme brulee: better than I expected. The texture was smooth and the layer of crystallized sugar was crisp. \nChocolate lava cake: the chocolate is very rich and the ice cream with wafers and pistachios were a nice addition.
