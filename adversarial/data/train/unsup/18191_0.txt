Let me preface this with, my salesman Isaac was the nicest man ever, he genuinely is, but his cologne was so overbearing and awful that I essentially had an airborne anaphylactic reaction to it. \nIt's been 21 days since I bought my car and I am STILL SUFFERING from his fragrance. \nHeadaches, sinus troubles, asthmatic issues, medications from steroids to antibiotics and now I've tweaked my neck from coughing so hard.\nThis reaction to his cologne has affected every aspect of my life from caring for my 8 month old son, to missing work and school.\nI called the general manager, Scott, yesterday and left a message telling him what happened so he can talk to Isaac about lessening his cologne, and I expected the right thing to do would be for him to contact me and apologize but I haven't heard a damn thing. I left him my phone number TWICE in my voicemail. Typically, that's a CLEAR INDICATION that I am looking for a phone call back.\nI will no longer do business at David Wilson's Toyota. 1) Because I'm afraid to run into Isaac and be physically assaulted by his cologne and 2) Because I find it incredibly unprofessional that Scott the General Manager couldn't take 5 minutes out of his day to return my phone call.\n\nI suggest that you take your business elsewhere too. I certainly will not recommend them to anyone.
