So my new boss and friend invited me out here for an event. I missed the limo ride unfortunately boo, so no red carpet for me. He did a \"Garden of Eden\" photo shoot here and I basically just observed the whole process. It was so SIIIIK they even brought in a snake for some of the pics. It was the coolest thing ever. Bathing suits and hot chiks for a shoot nuff said!!\n\n So I guess there is no cover here?? That's cool since its a pretty small place and from what I heard it wasn't even as packed in as usual. Drinks are the normal Scottsdale price. There are 3 stalls for the bathroom and only 2 of them worked last night. Oh all the Princess' need to learn how to wash their hands.....gross! Cochinas!!\n\nI wouldn't mind doing VIP here again.
