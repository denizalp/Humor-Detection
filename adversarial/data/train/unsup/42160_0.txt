My daughters 93 Lexus SC400 was running hot. New to the area so I checked reviews which where good and called them and they recommend a Tow Company. When the car first ran hot a few days prior I had taken it to a shop that was closer. They quoted me 1150 and said it was the water pump and a freeze plug leaking. I didn't have that much so that's when I took it to SSC. Come to find out Toms Auto Repair on Riggs rd  was trying to rip me off because Adam found that only the thermostat housing and freeze plug was leaking. Only 350$ to fix it!! That includes tax. I will be bringing all my cars there from now on.
