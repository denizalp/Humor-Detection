Famous Dave's changed the Rib Tips. In my opinion the Rib Tips are no where near as tasty as they were before the change. That's why I am knocking down FD from 5 to 3 stars.\n\nThe outer edges of the ribs are cooked too well done which dries out the ribs and makes them stringy and hard to chew plus they put so much fuego on the ribs. If I wanted hot & spicy ribs, I would have spiced it up with one of their BBQ Sauces on the table. I'm guessing Devil's Spit would probably have spiced it up for people who like it hot. The fries and all of the other sides are fabulous as usual.\n\nMy sons enjoyed the pork sammiches. So there is some decent food but I don't see myself returning to Famous Dave's after about a 15 year run eating at Famous Dave's around the country.
