Has almost always been and shall likely forever remain one of my favourite little bars. Totally unpretentious, unique without being self-conscious, a true come-as-you-are and stay-as-long-as-you-like sort of establishment.\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that they removed the exceptional pot-pies from the menu. Criminal. I have not had much that's on the new menu, but everything I've ever eaten here has been piping hot, fast to the table, and warmly delicious. Comfort food, simple, tasty, delcious.\n\nI find another reviewer's assertion that Andrew, the owner, doesn't know anything about scotch absolutely ridiculous. I don't know anyone else (except for the owner of Allen's on the Danforth) who knows more about scotch. The selection is commendable and this is and always will be a scotch and bourbon drinkers bar.\n\nThat being said, the selection of beer is well priced and extensive.\n\nThe staff are tops.
