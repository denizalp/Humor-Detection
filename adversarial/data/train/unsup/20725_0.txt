I have been a customer for the past 4 years and been there about 100 times, brought friends and family. When I ordered a 7up with a splash of beer , the answer was \" NO\" it is against our policy. Since I insisted because I always had the same drink for many years  without a problem, the Manager decide to call security to escort me out of the restaurant. I LMOA and went next door, where I received excellent customer service ( and my drink). Sorry but you just lost my business over a 5 cents splash of Beer and a bad manager decision.\nFYI: The customer is not always right, but he still a customer -:)  GL Bachi Burger.
