Selected Dukes to assist me with diagnosing an HVAC issue based on their strong Yelp reviews and they lived up to their reputation.\n\nI was highly impressed by the thoroughness of the technician, Robert, who took time to conduct a thorough investigation.  He was very knowledgeable, explaining to me each step he was taking and why.\n\nAlso found Dukes to be fairly priced and with no pressure nor upsell tactics.\n\nWould definitely hire them again.
