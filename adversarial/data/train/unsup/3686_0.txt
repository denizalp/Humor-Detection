I'm giving Apollo's four stars because it has a lot of things I look for in a bar. It's clean and well-maintained (including the \"Goddesses\" restroom). It also has friendly staff, a diverse group of patrons, a great outdoor patio (featuring appropriately-themed \"Roman\" columns), and perhaps, most importantly, features karaoke on Thursday - Saturday nights. My husband and I went on a Friday night for karaoke with Stevey P and Kristin S and their SOs and had a great time. \n\nThe singers' talent is definitely better than your average karaoke dive bar, and the song choice was good, but as an avid karaoke singer, I didn't like the fact that there was no separate stage or area carved out for the current singer to stand. We just had to stand by our chairs or between tables and strain our necks to look up at the lyrics. Karaoke also wasn't the central focus of the place, with much *very loud* talking and socializing going on in spite of (or because of?) the singing. I'm not going to penalize Apollo's for this too much, though, because I know only serious karaoke freaks like me want it to be the focus.  \n\nOne other complaint - some of us in the group were also a little disappointed with our weak our drinks were - I don't know if this was just crowd control, but with a final tab of $70 or so, we expected to be feeling a little more loopy than we did for most of the night. Speaking of feeling loopy, we were appreciative of how helpful the bartenders were when we wanted to call a cab, and one came fairly quickly after they called one for us. \n\nApparently, the company that does karaoke here is the same as the one that does it at Kobalt (another gay bar in Midtown's Park Central complex). If you are into a social and dynamic bar scene with a pretty diverse crowd and karaoke as part of the experience, you will really like Apollo. However, if you ever want to go somewhere a little more low-key and really focus on the karaoke part, you might want to check Kobalt out.
