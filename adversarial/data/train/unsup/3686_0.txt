After reading reviews I decided to come here and I was totally disappointed. The only reason this place is 2 stars Vs 1 star is the very polite, make your own, pasta chef. All the food was very bland and the prime rib was dry and tasteless. For the price it is a decent bargain but I would rather spend some more money for better quality of food. The only thing that was tasty was a potsticker I had otherwise there was nothing to even discuss.
