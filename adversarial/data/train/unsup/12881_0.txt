Showed up at 10:00pm, several tables open and seats at the bar; was told it's a 30-45 minute wait. Sorry but you already seem too pretentious, for someone that lives walking distance, maybe I'll see you again during happy hour on a Tuesday - maybe. Don't forget you're a bar in phoenix not NYC. I'm already bored.
