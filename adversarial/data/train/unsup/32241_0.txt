For years we have ordered from this Rosati's. Our favorite has been the pan pizza. We would have company over and order the pizza to treat people to a truly stellar deep dish pizza. My husband and I have been eating out less often for some time, and it had been about a year since we'd ordered Rosati's. Last night we felt like splurging and ordered a large pan pepperoni pizza. WHAT HAPPENED?! The pizza smelled different, and the ingredients are different. The dough was sad, soggy, and limp; not the usual crispy deliciousness. The cheese was not gooey at all, but rather salty and plastic-like. The dough screamed frozen, and we've had better Digiorno. Like our roommate said, \"It's not Digiorno, it's delivery.\" I don't review or comment on things unless my experience was really bad, or really good. In this case, it was BAD. The cost was the same, but the quality has gone way down. We will not order from Rosati's again. Next time, we'll just bake up a Digiorno.
