The service was good, very nice lady! She refill our waters many time! Gave us 10% because one of the plate came very late. The food was just amazing!! I ate the vegetarian korma. First of all I was pleased to see so many vegetarian option and second it was delicious!! My husband was so jealous of my plate that he went back the day after and order it!! Love this place and we will go back!!!!!
