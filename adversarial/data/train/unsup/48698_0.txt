The woman i was set up with was very caring and understanding. They do ask a lot of questions about yourself and your religious views but they are very courteous of your answer. I had an amazing experience here and would recommend to anyone. I'm a teen and no where in desire of a pregnancy but they also provide other woman wellness testing here or they did during my visit. I feel like they went out of their way to make sure that i was doing okay and at the time i needed that.
