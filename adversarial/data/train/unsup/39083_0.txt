This is a review of my first dining experience at Shinto. Our chef wasn't terribly engaging and we didn't have a full table, so the whole thing was lackluster. The guy squirted sake into our mouths and got it all over our faces, necks and clothes, which was annoying.  But I loved the food and we had a pretty good waitress, so I can't give it a bad review. I liked it enough to actively want to go back again sometime. I had salmon which was cooked perfectly, and the meal (soup, salad, and teriyaki salmon with fried rice and mushrooms) was delicious.
