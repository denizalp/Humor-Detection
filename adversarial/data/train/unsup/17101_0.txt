Walking by this store & was immediately sucked in by the Tagline: Stupid Factory - Where Boys Are Made \n\nChuckle-worthy shirts, jammy shorts & bottoms for every age & I definitely overindulged in the absurdity but it's Vegas, so I felt it was the right thing to do \n\nWith Shirts like \"I Would Exercise But My Drink Might Spill\"; \"I Found Jesus - He Was Behind The Couch\"; and \"Boys Are Stupid, Throw Rocks At Them\" \n\nPun Shirts Galore as well - ice cream scoops w\/ the motto \"I've Got The Scoop\"; A ruler & a rock telling each other \"You Rule\" \/ \"You Rock\"; and \"Rock Is Dead - Long Live Paper & Scissors\" \n\nThe list goes on.... \n\n.....it's what every immature adult needs to take us back to our grammar school days \n\nDavid & Goliath, you're a fantastic find!!
