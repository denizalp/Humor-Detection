OK I will say it ....MEH. Little tiny bland food way over priced, atmosphere OK but not stunning, slightly pretentious staff, and hey isn't this supposed to be Greek? I didn't pick up a whole lot of Greek in the cuisine? I heard no one saying OPA? I have had better at 1\/4 the cost in Greek Town. Ya ya I get it, the chef is Greek his cuisine Dr. Oz Mediterranean diet chic. Thankfully I went here for a business dinner & didn't have to pay for the meal.
