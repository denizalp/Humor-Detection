The front desk staff is quite unfriendly but thanks to yelp, you know what you're getting into! Go with low expectation, my friend.\n\nThe phlebotomists are great though. I have small veins and consistently have problems drawing blood - but the woman who took my blood at Quest was mindful, listened to my concerns and even opted to use a pediatric needle. It was painless, quick and most importantly, she put me at ease.\n\nI was also in and out within 20 min with no prior appointment!
