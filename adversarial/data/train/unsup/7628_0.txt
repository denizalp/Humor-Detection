Fleet\/internet department: 4 stars\nFinancing department: 2 stars\n\nI have now purchased 4 new Chevrolets from them in the last 11 years.  When I leased the 98 Malibu the internet part of the fleet department was sort of an afterthought.  The entire department was three people tucked down a hallway and you could not get to them evenings and Sundays.  I was back in 01 to buy the Malibu off of lease and again for an 03 Tracker and then an 04 Silverado.  For all three of those trips the fleet\/internet department had all six cubicles in the hallway.  Yesterday I picked up an HHR and the fleet\/internet department has been doubled in size and is staffed the same hours as the rest of the sales force.  Even though it occupies 1\/2 as much space as the rest of the sales force it accounts for over half of the sales.\n\nJust to make sure I was still getting a decent deal I had two other local dealers quote the same vehicle.  The other two dealers chose to invite me to come in without giving me a quote.  Fail. The price I paid was within $2 of what Edmunds said people in this area were paying for that vehicle.  And I did not have to play any games to get there.\n\nEach time I have dealt with them there have been multiple cars ready for me to drive at the appointment time.  Except for the Silverado which involved a dealer swap the entire process was one trip of three hours or less.  When dealing with the fleet\/internet department there is no haggling, they give you a price and you take it or leave it.  I have so far always found their price to be a fair one.\n\nToo bad you have to go through the finance department to get out of there.  They always have at least a half dozen ups and extras to explain to you.  I don't buy much extra stuff, like only GMPP, but you still have to sit and listen to it or fly in to F-bombs, jimmy kicking mode which raises your blood pressure and really doesn't save you any time.  At least at this dealership no one has ever insulted my intelligence for not purchasing something.  That may be because I know as much or more about what they are doing than they do.  Age and having been in the car business has some benefit.  I have listened in to the normal sales deals going on around me while waiting for people and am glad I no longer play those games.  \n\nI cannot say much about the service department because I only dealt with them once in 98 and that positive experience led to the first purchase.\n\nCar buying sucks but at least their fleet\/internet department has softened the pain quite a bit.
