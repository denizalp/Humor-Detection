I'm going home at 10:35pm instead of sleeping here.  This will be detailed, so if you want a summary:  this is a beautiful property that does not execute a single bit of hospitality. If you are not tattooed with sleeves, or if you can string an entire sentence together without the word \"like\" or \"f*ck\", you are not the target market here. \n\nOn first glance, the room was beautiful the decor was well thought out and we were excited. But as we wnt to sleep, a light randomly turned itself on twice, as did the jacuzzi bathtub. Also, when we turned on the fan in the bathroom the stench of cigarette smoke was nauseating. These are 100% non-smoking rooms...supposedly. \n\nHousekeeping was very nice and changed the air filter in our bathroom, and we unplugged our lamps. \n\nWe had a nice day of pool and dinner (Scarpetta is 5-star).  \n\nOn our second night the stench of cigarettes from the hallway was ridiculous. I call downstairs and security said they were going to send someone up to break up the \"in hallway party\" but nobody ever came. To make matters worse, they had a \"dive in movie\" playing outside and the sound was so loud it was louder than our TV. No sleeping with that. It was a double feature: with the first movie at 730 and the second movie starting at 10 p.m.  I found this information by talking to the operator and when I said it was so loud no one can sleep here his only response was \"the movie ends somewhere around midnight.\"  \n\nI am home now and crafting this review leaving my bed empty at the Cosmo.
