Carnivores beware! But there's more....\n\nBig time hit or miss here, but my last few visits have tipped that scale.\n\nFirst time I got bad meat, I couldn't believe it; it seemed they had \"standards\" compared to the two surrounding nearby grocer markets. That's not saying much, go read up on Albertsons and Vons on Maryland Parkway.\n\nBut I am going on a 80\/20 ratio on rancid putrid meat including poultry, pork, and seafood. That's 80% BAD .... BEWARE OF THE MEAT!\n\nAlso, my girl had her wisdom teeth pulled and needed a frosty diet. No one in the area sold a magic bullet (and Best Buy was out). So I got a blending machine here that seemed like a good buy. First time firing it up, it made a smokey not a smoothie. (The motor blew first try.) -$40\n\nLastly, produce and dairy is outrageously priced here. Leaving you to wonder, why shop here at all? Unless you enjoy being in line for 30 minutes to deal with a cashier \"manager\" who doesn't speak a word of English.\n\nThank you, com again :)
