Called in to inquire about a piercing. I've been here before and have heard great things about your establishment. However the woman who answered the phone, ALEX, was absolutely one of the rudest people I have ever encountered. She gave me the most snide and condescending answer ever. She gave me a quote and when I went to clarify if that was total or for just one piercing, she shot back and was extremely condescending as I already stated. You lost a customer due to this woman's inability to answer a simple question without being disrespectful. Word to the wise, don't visit this location simply because of her.
