I typically tend to stay away from chain restaurants as often as possible.  I do have to say though, that I have been to several Outback restaurants thoughout the years and honestly I will say, I have never had a bad meal at any of them.  The quality of the steaks are pretty good, and it was cooked to a proper rare, so I can't complain about that.  It has a pretty extensive menu, if steak is not your thing, and I would have no problem going back to an Outback Steakhouse in the future.
