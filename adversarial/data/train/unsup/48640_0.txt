If you need a shoe guy in the Yonge\/Eg area, this is your guy. As a girl who wears heels all the time, I've brought many, many shoes to him for new heels, soles, and other fixes. Always a great job, and also very honest: will tell me straight up if the shoe is worth fixing or if I need to throw it away lol. Def reco!
