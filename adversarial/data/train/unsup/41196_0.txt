This restaurant is A-OK. It isn't the best but it is not the worst. I think the price is pretty high for what they give you but then again, it is located inside of the Venetian. It's just your average Chinese food spot, so if you are craving Chinese.. go somewhere off the strip to save yourself a few bucks.
