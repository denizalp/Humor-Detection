We loved this place! We had lunch there and the prices were great and the food was excellent. We had Holy Basil and Colorful Vegetable, both with chicken, and they were outstanding. Both came with soup, salad & a spring roll on the lunch menu. We also decided to try the chicken satay appetizer and the thai iced tea. A perfect meal and we'll definitely be back.
