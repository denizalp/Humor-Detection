Firstly, yes I am aware I'm reviewing wally world and giving them 1 star. This isn't surprising to anyone, I get it.\n\nThe reason for my review is to warn fellow shoppers not to buy too much if you actually want to get it into your car. This store (maybe all of them...I try to stay away from this store as much as humanly possible) has these barriers that don't allow the carts into the parking lot. I mean I get WHY we don't want Toronto's finest taking a cart home with them but I also need to load my crap into my car!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWhat is wrong with you people?\n\nAlso, the shelves were near bare. So there's also that.
