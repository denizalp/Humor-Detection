Two & half measly stars.  \n\nSo the FARC's were prowling around Parliament St. this evening to grab some libations and a nosh at the HOP only to discover that this must have been FPG night in Cabbagetown.  FPF is my acronym for Flub the Pub Grub because that is exactly what happened at the HOP.  \n\nDeanna and I decided to meet up after she put in her sweat equity at a spin class.  Hell the girl musta been down a few pints of water and was badly in need of topping up so it was the HOP for us.  It was packed and for a Monday night that says something about the place.  I hear the taps are great but not being a beer drinker I can't really say.  They are packing them in on Parliament Street but for the life of me I just can't believe it's for the food.\n\nWe ordered Deanna's much beloved Steak & Mushroom pie and the braised Pulled Pork Sandwich topped with a half charred onion and fries.  I bet you we waited almost 40 minutes for our food.  At no time did the server say anything to us and we couldn't seem to get his attention.  When the food finally did show up I must say I was disappointed.  In the car on the way home I told Deanna I thought the pastry of the steak pie was sweaty and actually so was the baguette of my sandwich.  \n\nSo here's my take on what I think happened.  I think someone forgot our order or it either sat and got completely cold and ultimately some lamo assed moron in the kitchen nuked the pie and the sandwich because they were steaming but the fries were cold.   You know how buns get all \"spongy\" when you nuke them and they are chewy, almost impossible to get through, tantamount to eating a cleansing sponge sans the soap.  This is basically what we got.  So much for all the hype about the HOP being a gastro pub.  \n\nIf I were looking for a buzzing place to grab a beer and a basket of sweet potato fries then the HOP would probably be a great spot.  Past that I wouldn't give it much thought as a food destination.
