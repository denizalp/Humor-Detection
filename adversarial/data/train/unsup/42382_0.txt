Dissapointed. I love Salsarita's Mexican Grill don't get me wrong, but I was very disappointed in the presentation and the quality of the food that was served to me. When I got there, there was no line which was great. I decided I wanted some tacos for a late lunch I had with my family. I ordered three hard shells, but before I could even tell the server what cold items I wanted on my tacos, he had already over flown the shells with beans, rice, and meat. Not good. By the time we did get to the cold toppings he had to put very small amounts to make it look like he had made it all fit which he didn't. The tacos did not look very well put together and I hope that with more experience they can become better taco assemblers. And to top it all off I received the bottom of the barrel chips as my side which are not a very good salsa dippers. Oh and the coca cola machine that had the millions of flavors was removed from the store which was something I was excited about using. But, of course the food was delicious as always and I will be returning in he future.
