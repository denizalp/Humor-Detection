Stepping into Petersen's is like a blast from the past. You'd think you were walking into an ice cream parlor in the 50's or 60's. They have 30 different flavors to choose from. They also have sundaes, ice cream sodas, rootbeer floats, and other ice cream yummies. \nI was super happy to find out they have blue moon, my favorite! So, of course I got one scoop of blue moon in a waffle cone. The waffle cone was made right as I ordered it. Yum! \nThe store was clean and bright.\nI can't wait to come here for a treat again when I am in downtown Gilbert!
