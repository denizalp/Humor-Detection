So I call Robco electric to give me a bid for solar panels. I also called two another companies for bids.. Robco blew me off for days before giving me a bid. I should of realized that was a red flag..  Robco Electric had the lowest price with the highest interest rate of 10%.  I told him thanks but I was going to use another company.. they changed their interest rate to 2.9% and matched the other companies . I gave them the job.. now they are giving me excuses about their financing and still have not even contacted me.. they are blowing me off again.. they must not need any new business from the locals.. cheaper is not better.. after all the good reviews that I read on this company now I know they are all BULLSHIT.. I bet it's the employees writing the reviews.. ..
