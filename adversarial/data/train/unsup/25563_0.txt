After reading some of these reviews, I can't even believe anyone would think about giving this place anything but 5 STARS!! The reason I highly recommend this medical spa over any other ones I've gone to is because the doctor is legit. I was receiving Juv√©derm (fillers) which I've gotten before, but was surprised by how different the experience was! Dr. Chen opened up the product in front of me, which most doctors don't do, and thoroughly explained to me exactly what he was doing step by step. He's an informative doctor who is very knowledgeable with what he is doing.  Another thing I really liked about this place was that they lock you in for the price you paid the first time! They honored the groupon price for me and let me know that I can purchase straight from them next time instead, and that they would keep the price the same for my next treatment! Service was amazing, will definitely be visiting again!!
