I started seeing Dr. Adair a couple years ago for a pinched nerve in my back that was causing extreme pain and discomfort. After instant relief the first session and long term relief after a few more he became my go to chiro. Recently I had been having pain in my shoulders and elbows, I've had cortisone shots that stopped working and i really felt like orthopedic surgeon was the next step. Honestly, not everyone has a ton of money to throw out for Dr visit, mri, xrays, surgery and ect especially for both shoulders and both elbows being in extreme pain. I saw Dr Adair and the request was simply, to manage the pain while i saved to get my shoulders\/ elbows looked at and potentially have surgery on my nerves. My first visit for my shoulders\/elbows was exactly 2 weeks ago from today, and im thankful i saw him before walking into a ortho office. Within these 2 weeks with grafting\/scalping\/scraping (dont remember the exact name) my arms feel amazing... They no longer fall asleep, no throbbing\/shooting pain. I work out several times a week and work in a field where i depend on my body to function 100%, and im getting back to 100 quickly. He has really saved me what could have been thousands in medical bills\/ rehab, and months maybe years of recovery. He has a small office and cares about his patients, he has never been one to rush me or ignore a concern. He is also amazing at making time to schedule you in. Personally he's best chiropractor in Phoenix metro, trust me ive been to many in the past.
