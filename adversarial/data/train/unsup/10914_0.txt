My husband brought me here for a waffle but when we asked our waitress for recommendations, she said the fried chicken was delicious.  And then I saw they had hand battered onion rings, so I abandoned the waffle and went for the 1\/4 Chicken White with onion rings and a salad as my side.  This also comes with a delicious home made biscuit.  Oh man... I had to stop myself from eating that biscuit after taking a couple of bites.  I'm glad I did because that fried chicken was one of the best I've ever had.  It was light and crispy and juicy and tender.  I could go on but then those onion rings were absolutely delicious too.  My fried food feast was so absolutely enjoyable.  And my waffle craving still has not been quenched so.. next time.  \n\nService was good and friendly.  Our server never let our cups go beneath half.  She was great!
