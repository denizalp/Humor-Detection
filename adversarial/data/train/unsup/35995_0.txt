I am so sad to update this review negatively but I have to be honest. The food here has gone way downhill over the last 3 months. I tried the food 3 different times before updating this review and determining that I can no longer eat here. I believe they switched chefs because they do not even make the rolls with all of the ingredients that they advertise are in the rolls on the menu. The fish tastes like its frozen bad quality now. Even the rice tastes odd and hard. Everything is sloppily thrown together. When you pick up the rolls with chopsticks they fall apart before it gets to your mouth. This used to be my favorite establishment but honestly you can get better sushi at a mall food court now. I sincerely hope they figure this out soon so that they can stay in business but I will not be returning as a customer to find out.
