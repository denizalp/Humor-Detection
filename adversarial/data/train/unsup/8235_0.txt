Oh I'm sorry I definitely did not like this doctor whatsoever he made me feel very uncomfortable. \nI went in for x-rays\nAnd found out that when it was time to get my x-rays back and tell me the work that I needed to be done he said that \"One tooth needs to be on dog from the filling to get rid of some underlying cavity and then the one next to it may or may not need a root canal but he wouldn't know until he got in so like an idiot, after seeing the x-ray and looking at it since I've had so much work done on my teeth- I didn't think it would be a problem because I knew he wouldn't have to dig it wasn't deep enough. \nSo after he has me in the chair I started to get uncomfortable when he was about to inject me with his needle and he lost his patience rolled his eyes and scuffed \"would you like to do this another time\" in an authoritie manner. \nRight then and there I should've known that would be my last visit and it definitely turned me off that he would be that dismissive and impolite\n\nIt's not every day you get a needle in your gums it's very uncomfortable anyway after he started to do the procedure and started to dig in both of my teeth, of Course!!!! He had to drill inside my second tooth and give me a unnecessary root canal. \nI was absolutely livid but I just kept it to myself because he had already exposed my tooth what was I supposed to do? \nSo I got charge several hundred dollars to pay for the co-pay but I wasn't expecting on\nAnd I'm sorry but I am not a dentist but I am pretty sure I did not need that root canal.\n\nWeeks later the girls in the office actually had the nerve to call my house and see if I would come back and have more work done and I told them \"I will not be returning to this doctor he makes me very uncomfortable he makes me feel like he's one of those doctors that charges people for things that they really don't need and it makes me uncomfortable\"\nIn my opinion I think he completely scammed me and my insurance company for giving me unnecessary work to be completed when I was at my most vulnerable.\nI ended up switching dentists and going across the street I became a patient of modern dentistry near target directly across and so did my son. \nI get this dentists flyers to save money in the mail all of the time.
