Sorry guys, I had high hopes for this place, but here were my experiences..... First time, which was the best of all, produced large portions, and some good jerk chicken. \nSecond time, I wanted to try the jerk pork, considering the chicken seasoning was at par. Aside from having no zing, the pork was chewy, stringy, and flavourless.\nThird, and unfortunately my last time, I picked up some oxtail, and curry goat. The oxtail tasted like nothing but sugared beef. Way too sweet with little Caribbean zest to it. The goat, was a complete flip, at being way too salty....  I was hoping this was gonna be my new \"goto\" for the flavours of Negril.... With little competition in this town for that cuisine, I wished for a better outcome.
