The food here is good, the one star is for the service and the fact that the workers here just don't care.\n\nThis place is never a choice of mine to go to, I end up here because people I am with want to go here.  First off if you ever order food to go make sure you check your order before you leave because they will always screw it up.\n\nEvery time I have been here and got spring rolls to go, every person I have ever asked to please make sure they put some sauce in there, they don't,,,,,WHY????\n\nCan someone please explain WHY they just flat out ignore you???  This is their job and they are not good at it.   \n\nLike I said, the food is good but the service and attention to what the customers want is very very poor.\n\nThe service here has always been poor but unfortunately they get a lot of business and they never read these reviews so they don't care.  It's sad, but fortunately there are other Thai places in close proximity with excellent food and service.  \n\nI don't like giving places one star but this place is just way too consistent at poor service.  I've never been here and had a good service experience.  The food, YES, it's good, the service NO, it's bad.
