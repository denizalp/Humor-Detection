Went here for dinner yesterday after I had been craving Indian food for a while. Was pretty good! First we had chutneys with some type of cracker bread and that was good, we liked the green one the best.\nFor my meal I got garlic naan and dark lentils, I can't remember what exactly it was called. This also came with rice. The naan wasn't the best naan I've had but it was pretty yummy. Lentils and rice were really delicious and flavorful, I'd order it again, but there are a bunch of other things on the menu I'd like to try again! I also tried a few sips of mango lassi, I don't think I like lassi but I am glad I gave it a try haha. \nThe service was not too bad. Slow, but that's just because there was a little party going on there! Otherwise good. I'd come back but probably just for take out.
