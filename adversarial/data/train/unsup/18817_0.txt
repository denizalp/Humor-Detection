I didn't think it was possible for Barroco to get any better, but it did!  They now serve alcoholic beverages and they are super tasty.  Between all of the orders at our table, I was able to sample most of them.  They also have a happy hour from 3 til 6:30 on weekdays.  Most of our cocktails were 5 bucks!  Best of all, the drinks are made with higher-end liquors and fresh juices.  There's nothing worse than ordering a margarita and being served a lime-green concoction that's been sitting in a plastic container all day.  \n\nMy favorite drink that we tried is the Padre Nuestro.  (see picture).  Forgive me for not remembering all of the ingredients, but trust me on this one.  You'll love it.  It's vodka based, and I believe there was a little lemoncello in it as well. I also enjoyed sampling the Paloma (made with 1800 silver and watermelon juice), Red Sangria (with lots of fruit to snack on), and a pina colada.  \n\nTo go with our cocktails, we ordered the Tostadas con Todo for our table.  It is a large platter with many different samplings of their food offerings.  The fried plantains that come with it are the best I've ever had. \n\nIt's rare for me to spend an extended amount of time in any restaurant because I get antsy.  However, we were at Barroco for over 3 hours catching up with old friends, enjoying the atmosphere, and best of all, the cocktails.
