It's more of a novelty coming here especially if you want the Frozen Hot Chocolate. My friend and I split the FHC for $15. There are far better desserts to buy on the strip, even at 5 star restaurants, for that price and less. Something to consider.\n\nTo sum it up, the drink is an iced chocolatey drink. It's pretty decent although if you're really into it, there's an exact knock off of this recipe listed on food network. Google it. You're welcome. \n\nThe whipped cream on top was delicious, almost my favorite part of the drink. It's about a 1:1 ratio iced chocolate drink to cream. Before we dove in, my friend mentioned she should have asked them for no whipped cream. Excuse me? Who are you? \n\nThe chocolate chips that topped off the drink were not good at all. The worst I've ever tried but the rest of the drink made up for it. \n\nAll in all, I tried it and I'm done and I have no interest in ever getting it again.
