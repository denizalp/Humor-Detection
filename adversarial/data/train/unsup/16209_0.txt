Quick tip and only tip: text DMVFLAMINGO to 347-763-6175 the day before to get in early!!  But if you prefer to wait awhile read below:\n\nLet me tell you how to get in and out with the quickness if you decide to come in yourself, pretend you're injured.  Come in with a cast or something and they'll let you through the ada line.  It's awesome.  \n\nAnother thing is the text message feature once you check in, I don't remember where they ask you if it's okay to text you but by all means.  You'll have options after receiving the text message also, the following options if I remember right is L to leave the text, h for help, and the most important S for status.  If I showed you my text log you'll see about S like 50 times sent.\n\nOn that note, once you check in feel free to leave the DMV!  Go get some breakfast, some lunch, go get it on, get something and while you're out and about text back S.  Until about an estimated hour before being called, you'll see where you're at in the queue.  Mine said 207 in front of you, then about an hour left it counted down and finally told you to stand in front of the desk with the number you'll be assigned to.\n\nAnyways I got my gold star DL, anyone traveling should be advised that you'll need either this DL\/ID or your standard DL ANDDD a passport in order to travel out of state come 2020.  Might as well get it out of the way now.
