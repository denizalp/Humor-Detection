I was very impressed with Fix.  I came here with a group of about twenty girls for a bachelorette party.   I'm not sure if we got a prix fixe menu because it was a special bachelorette package (we went to Caramel Lounge after) or because of the size of our party.\n\nThe food was fantastic.  Some of my favorites were:  Bobby Baldwin Burgers, Seabass, Very Adult Fried Mac and Cheese, and the warm donuts.\n\nWe were put in a back room with a bachelor party.  Everyone was so loud and we were having a blast.  The manager was getting really angry because it was getting pretty rowdy...but I didn't think it was that big of a deal because the room was way in the back and the rest of the restaurant was loud too.  Oh well, the food was good and we still had fun.
