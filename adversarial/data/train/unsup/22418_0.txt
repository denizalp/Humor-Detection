Would love to post a review from experience, but since they don't answer their phone when they're open and when they plaster \"We Deliver\" everywhere...I can't.  I've tried calling 4 times today and they don't answer and it says their voicemail is full.  Not a good way to make money.\n\nAlso, allowing employees to post pictures on the restaurant's Facebook page about what they do when they're not busy...with profiles that link to vulgar and obscene pictures is probably not a good way to make money either.\n\nAfter addressing my first issue with the restaurant via Facebook, no apology was made and my post was deleted after this incoherent response from the restaurant: \n\n\"We are all family, and all families have emergencies. We had to attend a funeral, and was actually at the hospital. We were closed only 3 days that we were not supposed to be in the past couple months. And Sunday, we were open. Thanks again.\"\n\nSo according to their response, the day I tried ordering food, they were: \n\n1) At a funeral. \n2) At the hospital. \n3) Open but not answering their phone.
