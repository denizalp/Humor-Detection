Since there isn't one of these close to NYC, like In-N-Out burger it's a must try when I'm out here in Vegas. However, I don't think I'm going to be waiting in line again for another Eggslut. Not that it's not good, it's just not anything that I haven't had  or couldn't have in many of the great breakfast places. \n\nMy party tried the Eggslut, Gaucho and Fairfax. To me Gaucho was the best with quality and perfectly cooked steak,packed with good flavor from the chimichurri sauce. The Fairfax had the right running consistency in a soft scramble that I look for, but other than the chives all the other ingredients just disappeared into the background. Now the signature slut didn't live up to my perhaps overhyped expectations. Once you mix the egg in as they instruct you to do, the richness of the yolk is diluted to the point of being barely noticeable. A bit of a disappointment.\n\nCheck this one off my list. You won't find me online again.
