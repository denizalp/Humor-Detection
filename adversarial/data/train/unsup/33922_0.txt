This is something that you have to do in your life. Even if you don't enjoy plays. It's something you would appreciate! The comedy, the drama, the intensity, practically every emotion stirs in your body after watching this. It may not make sense to you or it does. It is an art form interpreted in ways of dance that has been reach to new levels. It is also the ONLY place you can catch this show at. So if your ever in Vegas. Put down the money, the dice, the drinks. Put on a nice shirt and come on in and enjoy an adventure! Yes! I sound like an infomercial! That's cause it's THAT AWESOME! and NO ! I don't work for them! I just give credit to where it is due.
