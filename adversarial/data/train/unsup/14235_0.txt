Absolutely horrific. I was quoted $60 for two miles. It was late and I was desperate, so I obliged. When I questioned him, he began to drive erratically and reckless, even running a red light. I feared for my life. I paid with a hundred dollar bill. He only gave $25 back.\n\nI have filed a complaint with the company. This driver is a danger to society. Shame on this company.
