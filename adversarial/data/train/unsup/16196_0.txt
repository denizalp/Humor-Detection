The good: The pot stickers tasted good, and I liked their 6 shrimp for $2.50. And the fortune cookies were edible. \nThe bad: Pretty much everything else. \nThe ugly: The fact I paid $22 for food that most of it ended up in a trash bag destined for the Apex landfill outside of town. \n\nThe next time I start thinking that Panda Express is worth visiting to satisfy my cravings for Chinese food in Henderson, I hope the karma gods smack me with a clue stick and wake me up. \n\n2 stars. Why? I haven't got a clue except I don't want to write any 1 star reviews tonight. (It's the best I've got). \n\n(Yelp 100 in 2013 Challenge #20)
