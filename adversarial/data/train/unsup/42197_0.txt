I used to enjoy Everyday Noodles until a recent mortifying experience. I ordered take out - soup dumplings & chicken noodle soup. The dumplings were fine, the soup was inedible (filled with lots of small bugs). Everyday Noodles used to be a go to, but after this I will not be going back. If you eat here, proceed with caution.
