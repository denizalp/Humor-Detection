If you are an actual Latino. Then this is not the place for you. Its a nice place and the way the food is made looks good but there is no taste to it. My girlfriend and I went here because we heard it was good. The chips and salsa are good but the food was disgusting. I ordered chilaquiles and my girlfriend ordered inchiladas. They both looked amazing when they were brought up to the table so I can tell we have a good professional Chef in the kitchen but when we went to eating the food there was no flavor what so ever. The only flavor was the green sauce covering it. \nThe people seemed nice but there was one waiter that was very rude and made a mess as he kept filling our waters. not professional at all. \nAs I said if you are a Latino looking for some real Mexican food then this is the wrong place for you.
