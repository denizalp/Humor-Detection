Love, Love, Love this place...from the ambiance to the food. Wonderful staff...and FINALLY someone bringing some food-love to the foothills (and not another lame sports bar). \n\nBeen there at least 1\/2 dozen times and never dissapointed. Great wine and mixed drinks, great happy hour and love the appetizers...local ingredients, organic and delicious.
