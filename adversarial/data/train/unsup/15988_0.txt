You all know what the PF stands for?  Pure Fake...\nWent here a few weeks ago with some friends knowing beforehand it would be a bad to mediocre experience at best.  I had  been to one in Cali and Buffalo in years past and this location is no exception to the lousy food.\n\nAbout the only thing they got right is the location, far enough away from most Chinese restaurants to pull the wool over predominantly non-Asian cuisine goers. Remember folks, Congee Queen sucks too but is just around the corner and I would eat there before going back to Pure Fake.\n\nNot sure why people are giving this place such high ratings but I feel compelled to draft this review to set the record straight.\n\nEnough bashing... Decor is cheesy and just like the other locations. Service was a little hectic and illogical but I write that off to growing pains as it was the first few days after they opened.\n\nWe ordered chicken lettuce wraps... Not authentic and tasted funny as chicken is no substitute for Peking Duck. The Beef with broccoli was a large portion and was ok. Moo shoo (we opted for Chicken again - not my choice, blame the Gringos with me) and was horribly insipid, messy and soggy.  We ordered other stuff but again not worth mentioning.\n\nYou know what they say, there's a sucker born every minute. With all the Chinese restaurants in Toronto, why would you opt to eat here? It's not cheap by any stretch comparatively given the competition for Asian cuisine in Toronto.
