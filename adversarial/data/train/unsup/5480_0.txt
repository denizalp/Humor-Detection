Easy food made hard.  That's it.  I ordered what I thought was a breakfast sandwich for brunch and I ended up feeling like I was solving a riddle.  I will say that it all seems like there's a lot of thought put into it - too much, maybe.  Fennel sausage, fried chicken leg, orange marmalade, fried egg, sausage gravy, bacon all on a homemade biscuit.  Sounds very good in principle, I guess, but it's an impossible combination in practice.  This was a concoction.\n\nI've only been for brunch; this being a meal coveted by the hungover to ease themselves into the day.  This being something that should be easy, approachable.  You impress guests with the familiar, with comfort, with something they don't have to figure out or think too hard.  If you don't do this service right you won't get me back for dinner.  I could only imagine how abstract a burger looks.\n\nGreat space, however.  Looks very cool, bar has potential, nice layout.  I hope thy work out the kinks and stop trying to be something other than just a damn good restaurant.  It's Cleveland, and we'll love you for just being you.  Enough with the pretension.
