Went there for the first time on a Monday night. Got in right away wasn't very crowded at all. Well my wife decided she was not that hungry so we shared the Fish and Chips out of all things. Caesar salad was good and so was the fish. Came with a ton of curly fries. Thought it was worth the price. I would definitely come back again and at least try for breakfast. The night we went they only accepted cash and our waitress took forever to take our order and then get me the check. She was busy hanging out with friends at another table, very irritating as we needed the check to get to go to a show.
