This is a very large location with a great selection of styles for babies, toddlers and children. If your kids need uniforms, those are also available here\n\nThey have weekly promotions, sometimes up to 50% off entire store.  On average I spend  $150-- $200 on outfitting my 2 and 6 year Olds.  \n\nThe newer items can be full priced. You may spend $29 for a pair of shoes, or $24 for a pair of jeans. On average, though, a graphic tee is about  $7, leggings about the same. There are always discounted items, especially at end of season, and you can get clothing that had already been reduced at an additional 50% off.\n\nWith a children's place rewards card your purchases also accrue to give you reward dollars. When shopping with your children's place credit card, you also receive an additional discount off your purchase.\n\nThe staff is always super friendly and helpful here, but store can look a little disheveled when it is end of season. Stock is low and the new items have not been out on the floor, yet. I think improvements are needed in this area, but otherwise love coming here for my girls.
