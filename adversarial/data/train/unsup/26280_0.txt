We are from Colorado and have some great Mexican restaurants here.  But, the Border Grill was a great food experience.  I did the small plate tasting for $45.  I managed to get through 12 small plates (stuffed but happy).  My particular favorites included the quinoa fritters, caesar salad, the grilled skirt steak (very tender), saut√©ed shrimp and scallops, and the pescado veracruzano.  Service was excellent and the drinks were strong.  My wife had a mojito versus my Mexican mai tai.  Hers was the better choice.  \n\nWe were seated up on the open balcony and had a great time.  I would have loved to do the small plate weekend brunch.  Maybe next time.
