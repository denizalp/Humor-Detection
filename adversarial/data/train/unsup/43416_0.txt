Amazing place!!!!! Great vibe and the food is exceptional!  We had the avocado\/coleslaw salad which was incredible and flavourful.  In addition, we had the loosey and the fried rice.  It was all so good and filling.  The service was friendly and attentive! Prices were great and so reasonable.  We will come back again and recommend to others!!!  Thank you!!!!!
