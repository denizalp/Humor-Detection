I just think it is so funny that Planet Fitness promotes a \"Judgement Free Zone\", meanwhile, it's certainly not a sexual harassment free zone. \n\nThe weird guys hanging out on the benches by the weights made multiple comments towards me in regards to \"eating my sweaty behind\"...if you know what I am saying.\n\nI'm sorry, what? I can't have a normal workout without \"grunting\" or making a noise because I am supposedly intimating all the other people sitting around and TEXTING instead of working out, but someone can make a comment like that to me and I am just supposed to be ok with it? \n\nShould it be okay for men to linger around and stare at women working out? It's freaking weird. \n\nDoes anyone else see something wrong with this situation?\n\nOh, and to top it off..I was tanning the other day and much to my delight, when I stepped out of the tanning bed, my door was WIDE open. I'm scrambling to close it looking all kinds of crazy trying to cover myself up. \n\nWhen I confront the front desk receptionist guy he looked at me like I had seven heads and just said \"what do you mean?\"....\n\nWhat do I mean???? I mean the door that I closed and locked behind myself was wide open when I got out of the tanning bed that I was laying naked in!! \n\nWhat kind of a freak show is this place???
