Delicious Italian cuisine.  I had an 8 cut neapolitan pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni.  I'm a sucker for pizza, but the other four people I was with had other specials that I tried as well and all of the dishes were excellent.  Oh, also, they had delicious complimentary garlic bread that they were very generous with.\n\nReservations are a must; this place has gotten so popular that you can't just walk in anymore.  We saw at least one group of three get turned away at a little after 9pm.  Plan on spending a good deal of time here as the atmosphere is very relaxed, there are only a few waitstaff, and the kitchen is very busy and only has a few chefs.\n\nThis place is BYOB (where B = beer, or bottle) and they do have a cork fee.  It is $5 for a .75 liter, $7 for a 1.5 liter (or larger, I assume) and I can't remember, but I want to say $5 for each six-pack.  They will bring out an ice bucket for you to keep the alcohol cold, but we saw many people who had their own little coolers.  One person I was with said her family brought a cooler on wheels once and the staff was totally fine with it.  It really is very relaxed.\n\nMy only complaints about the place were that it was very dark and the decor was lacking, but this restaurant is definitely no frills, no nonsense, and bare bones in order to keep the overhead to a minimum.  Also, the specials on the menu don't have explanations underneath them, so you'll have to listen to the waiter\/waitress when they describe what they are.  Valet parking is pretty necessary for the area and costs $3.  Overall, highly recommended!
