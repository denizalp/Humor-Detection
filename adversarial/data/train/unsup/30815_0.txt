Christina really took care of us! She was phenomenal and if all their staff work it like her, try this place now! \nWe had chicken, waffles, brussel sprouts, great drinks and we're not disappointed. It dies seem like everyone works hard to make sure you relax and enjoy! \nWe sat next to the counter for the kitchen and you can tell, everyone works together to make it happen!
