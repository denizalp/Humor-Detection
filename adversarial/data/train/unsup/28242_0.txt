We had the smoked wings. Huge. Would have been better if they got the sauce right. We made it a point to say my friend could not do spicy. It was suggested we get the smoky bbq, what came out, after we tried it, was some orange, vinegar and pepper flavored sauce. We both ate one and realized no way is this bbq. We were not offered a new set of wings, we were not comp'd only an insincere sorry and \"it might be the medium or  chipotle?\"the server didn't know which flavor she put it or what came out. \nI have the beauty and beasty, again portion is huge. And it was not bad. Wasn't the best pulled pork I ever had, but you'd have to be bad to mess up pulled pork.\nI finished it off with the bread pudding. Came out hot but also very dry and burnt. I could not eat it and the server seemed offended I did not want to take it with me. \n\nI bought a shirt and some beer in growlers to bring back home. I realized when I got home, I did not receive the 10% discount in the gift shop, the 3 dollar discount on growlers (thought this happens M-W) and I was given the incorrect shirt size. \n\nJust an overall sour taste in my mouth.
