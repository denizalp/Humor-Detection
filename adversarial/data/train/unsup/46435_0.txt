I have been to Cheese and Crackers twice now. The owner has been more then helpful both times. He is so excited about food and so informative if you don't know what you want. He suggested this awesome buffalo milk mozzarella to go with the dry Italian sausage we got an it was awesome. This time I went in for a sandwich. They had run out of their baguettes, but instantly offered me another type of bread for my sandwich. I am also pretty sure he added some extras on the sandwich since he didn't have bread. It was awesome! I want to live there. Forever.
