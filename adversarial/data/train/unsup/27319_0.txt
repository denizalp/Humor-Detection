I am so disappointed in this place as I have been there many MANY times and every single time i need a refill of something as silly as my clyndomyacin pledgets they try and force me to go in. They are greedy and Only look out to line their own pockets. Dr. Tran has seen me enough times to know that I need those pads and can't just give me a regular refill. He wants the insurance money. The receptionist went to ask him again and AGAIN he said no. It's not like I'm asking for drugs over here I'm asking for pledgets (medicated pads) for my face that have worked fabulous for me for a year now.. if I don't have them I get acne..I told them I would make an appointment with them right away at that moment I just needed the pads tonight before bed and again a no.. it's unbelievable the greed and I am so incredibly disappointed and will NEVER go back to this place. My recommendation for someone looking for a dermatologist who cares and isn't greedy? Go somewhere else.
