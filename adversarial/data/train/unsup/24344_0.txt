There are a lot of fancy-schmancy places where you can wait in line for forty five minutes to eat their brunch, but why do that when you can go to the Senator and have all of your favourite foods, unlimited refills on coffee and be served by awesome, funny servers?\n\ni can't say enough good things about it. The Senator is a comfortable diner-style place where you can eat breakfast until 2, sit in booths and have great conversation. Also, they have HP sauce if you want sausages, which you do.
