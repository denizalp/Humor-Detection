So this is my go to nursery for all my plants except larger palm trees :(. When I Landscaped my last 2 homes I didn't hesitate to go Star nursery, the staff is amazing and my favorite is Mary who works outside in the plants  . Let me tell you I can't give her enough kuddos , she will listen to exactly what you want and make recommendations that will benefit you and not the company.  She has always been honest even if I didn't agree with what she recommended and everyone who goes in their looks for her , and that just speaks to her awesomeness!! In the front is my girl Yvonne who is just full of energy and always has a smile on her face\n\nIt's funny that I look forward to coming here as a guy for plants but the team makes me feel at home. The only thing that I wish they would change is I have to go elsewhere for large palm trees which I hate because the other place isn't as good and is twice as expensive. \n\nIn closing star nursery has a great staff, tons of selection, cheaper prices then other nurseries, the best rock selection in the valley and if your in the military you get a discount
