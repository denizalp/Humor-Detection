The Pool Cafe is open Spring through the beginning of Fall.\n\n   Light American fare, serving breakfast and lunch. Good cocktails and food. Try the smoked salmon, the grilled chicken sandwich, and the chicken pie.\n\n   It's much more relax than the Bellagio Cafe in the Garden Conservatory area. Plus you got to see a few hot ladies in bikinis and a few old fat men in Speedo too, quite a view!
