Its been about a little over 3 years since i've been here, so i will only base my rating on the experiences i had here then.\n\nI moved to AZ when I graduated from highschool and made friends with a bunch of other non arizonians and we came here probably 3 times a week for happy hour. I was only 18 and the rest of my \"crew\" were of age. I had never had sushi before so this place was a little intimitating at first, but once i started to try it, i enjoyed it very much so. (Now that i'm more of a sushi expert, i can say their sushi wasn't great, but good for beginners.) I can still say (at least 3 years ago) that they have the best calamari i've ever had. This place, at the time, had a great atmosphere and saki bombs were okay to do here... \n\nIt may have just been the company i was with, but i greatly enjoyed coming to this place and sneaking saki bombs and shots :)\n\nnext time i go back to AZ to visit, this place is a must
