I'm in agreement with Rachel B., this is the \"champagne of dollar stores.\" Other dollar stores are crap. If you feel rage at other dollar stores where nothing is a dollar, this is the place for you. \n\nEverything here is ONE DOLLAR. No exceptions. It's glorious. \n\nI'm not saying everything is quality and will last you a lifetime. Most of the stuff is poorly made garbage (made in China). I recently bought supplies for our kitchen at work and the plastic spoons can barely handle yogurt. The napkins should be referred to as \"essence of napkin\" because they're so thin. LOL all day if you're going to try to eat off just ONE of the paper plates. that should be an Olympic event: carrying food a hundred meters using only one of the paper plates. \n\nBut if you need some cheap ass cooking utensils or a bucket or wrapping paper or holiday decor or who knows what else, this is the place for you. If you go to potlucks and never get your serving spoons back, go buy some plastic serving spoons at Dollar Tree and don't worry about getting them back. I'm sure they're all made of the deadly toxic plastic with cancer causing toxins, but it's a dollar. this place is consumerism at its worst because not much is going to last you very long (except in a landfill where it will last FOREVER). But once in a while you might need to save some $ or just don't care about the quality, etc. \n\nFor a while I was planning events (such as bar crawls, family olympics) and needed various supplies and I got a lot of that stuff at the Dollar Tree. I usually stop in for Christmas to see what I can use for gift wrapping\/decoration. I've bought some horrible\/wonderful door prize type things here. \n\nCheck it out when you're in the area or on the hunt for something inexpensive.
