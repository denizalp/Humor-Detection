Fantastic!!!!!!!!! It was my gf 's birthday and she wanted some fresh homemade pasta. \nI did a little research and found Gaetano's on Yelp. They make their own Fettuchini and ravioli. I believe they may also make some other noodles but I'm not sure.\n  We were seated with one of the best waiters we've had in quite some time.\nHis name is Jake. He was very knowledgable about the menu and helped us to make some selections which enabled us to try a number of different items from the menu without having to order 3-4 dinners. He also was pretty funny and made us laugh.\n  On to the food..... We ordered the grilled portabello mushroom appetizer which had a great smokey grilled taste and just the right amount of cheese. Delicious!!!!\nNext came our caesar salad for 2. The homemade caesar dressing is perfect. The appetizers and salads were also served with a lovely warm bread assortment with olive oil and balsamic vineger to dip into.\nOur main couses arrived a short time later...............Cioppino with homemade fettucini\nnoodles and an order of assorted homemade ravioli. We also got a meatball on the side.\n  Gaetano and his wife both came by our table to be sure all was well and we were enjoying our meals. That's rare and much appreciated when the owners of a restaurant care enough to make contact with their customers. \nThis was a great first visit to Gaetano's and everthing was fantastic.!!!!!!!!!!! \nWe will definitely be returning to Gaetano's again for dinner.
