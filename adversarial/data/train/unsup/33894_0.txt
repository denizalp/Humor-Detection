Only giving one star because of the staff except the cart lady. From the very beginning it was horrible I showed up an hour early the line to pay and get range balls was so log and slow because Bart just doesn't care and is slow. I paid for one range balls one one card I then asked for one more of the same after I paid he didn't hand me my second basket I asked for it and he said \"I didn't charge you for it\" I replied I need my basket he slammed it on the desk and I moved on.  Side note the phone was also ringing he said \"I'm done answering the phone\" I attributed all of this to his older age no problem.  I warmed up when called upon Skip the starter gave me a history of the course yet warned me about handicaps and what tees he needed us to get the play from. I play all over the country I've never been told what trees to play from let alone a $70 course but I respect it. I was playing as a 4 some 3 guys 1 lady. On hole 1 they got on the paging system and told us to hurry up and hit. I have never been so disrespected in my entire life HOLE 1 we kept pace the entire round. On the turn we stopped to get lunch they said they didn't have any ready so we moved on. We ran into that guy named skip and he insisted again we hurry up when we got to the tee boxes on 10 the group in front of Us was less than 200 yards away. We can only play as fast as the people on front of us. They also do not have a liquor license so they sell pre mixed drinks. After Our round we couldn't drive our carts to our cars, we tipped the staff and they cleaned the clubs we pulled the our cars up and had to carry the bags ourself Needless to say the course was nice greens challenging but I will never spend another dollar there I recommend getting all new staff. If the current crew doesn't want to do the job and he courteous find people who do. If I could give it a 0 I would. You lost 4 patrons. I doubt this place will ever change.
