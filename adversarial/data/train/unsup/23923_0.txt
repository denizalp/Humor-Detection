So I asked my wife to open a credit card with azccu. We get home and we can't log in to the account. She went back to the bank and took care of it. Next, she received two credit cards. She went back to the bank and they said one was sent by mistake. She then used the remaining card. Finally, she got her statement. It says she has not used the card. Now we are thinking they sent the statement for the card that was cancelled. DO NOT OPEN A CREDIT CARD WITH THIS BANK!!!!
