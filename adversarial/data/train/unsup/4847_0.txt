I've eaten here a few times.  I can't say if it's the best pho in Vegas - as I've only been to a couple other places around town for pho - but it is delicious.\n\nAs others have stated, the broth is a bit on the salty side.  I don't mind salty, but it tends to overshadow some of the sweet component of the broth that makes pho unique and not just some generic noodle dish.\n\nI ordered #18, dac biet - which includes rare beef, tripe, and tendon.  There was a really large chunk of tendon at the bottom of the bowl and that was my favorite part.  I also ordered a banh mi french baguette for one dollar which helped sop up some of the broth.\n\nThe place is clean, easy parking, and super fast service (pho arrived less than 2 minutes from order).  I'll be back for sure.
