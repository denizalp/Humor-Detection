I used Jeff to find an awesome condo at Summit at Copper Square. Jeff was efficient and made the process pretty easy. I did notice that like most realtors, punctuality was not 100%. Jeff always kept me updated on an ETA and responds  to all communications immediately. I would recommend his services, I'm a happy high rise guy now!
