We've been to this place before and they always gave us the military discount.  This time we asked if they still did the military discount before we even sat down and the lady said yes, so we sat down and ordered.  after our meal she wanted to see my I.d. So I gave it to her and she stood there and stared at it for about a minute and then spoke up and said are you retired and I said yes, then she says alright I do it for you this time but we won't do it again, this made us feel like we were trying to get over on them or something and her persona about it was rude, so I said...So anyone who is retired from the military isn't worthy of a discount in your restaurant.. is that what you are saying, then she looked at me and said oh well let me check on this..she comes back a few minutes later and says..we do it this time..then I said you go ahead and charge me your regular price...10 percent on a19 dollar meal isn't a big deal and I don't want to break your restaurant...I told my wife this is the last time we come back here. I don't mind if a place doesn't give a military discount..it's no big deal...but don't tell someone you give it and then scrutinize there I.d. Like your looking at with a magnifying glass and then discriminate against you because your retired.  I never have had a place discriminate against me because I was retired...it's like saying now that your retired your not worthy anymore.  These people are idiots.
