Love the food! One of the best burgers I have had since moving to Vegas... My husband loves the pizza. However we ordered delivery and while I understand that there is quite the distance from their restaurant to my home it has never taken them longer than 1 hour and 30 minutes.. The last time I ordered I called to make sure everything was ok at 2 hours and 15 minutes. When I asked the manager if the order was on its way the manager immediately became rude! Now I love this place but I was not trying to argue I was only attempting to check on my order! I was told by the manager that I should come in and not order delivery if I wanted faster service! So I am very sad to say that I will not order from here again BUT if you do not want delivery the burgers are really great here!
