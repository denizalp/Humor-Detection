My husband and I have patronized Frost since the day it opened.  We loved it so much we wanted to share the experience with our out of town wedding guests for our daughter's wedding.  I spent over $50 for gift cards for one scoop of gelato as part of their hotel welcome box.   We encouraged our guests to treat themselves and try it out.   Upon purchase of the gift cards, it was never mentioned BEWARE:  THIS IS GOOD FOR ONE SCOOP AND ONE SCOOP ONLY!  Don't even think Frost will apply the credit amount of this card to ANYTHING BUT ONE SCOOP.   Imagine our embarrassment when a few of our guests mentioned their card was not welcome or redeemed at check out because....wait for it..... they had the nerve to order TWO scoops!!!  They were expecting, of course, to pay the difference and explore another flavor.  Our guests pocketed the card and paid for the treat themselves.\n\nHaving worked in customer relations, food service and retail many many years, I called the manager, Doug, and explained our situation. I told him we were frequent patrons (WERE being the operative word here) and could he offer any recourse to this embarrassing situation.   He was less than professional, offered no solution and, quite frankly, could not have cared less.  Because of his arrogant attitude obvious lack of pride in his job, we are saying bye bye  to Frost.  Your unprofessionalism cost you a very large family of patrons -- and Doug, I know you don't care.  There are too many other wonderful gelato places who care about customer satisfaction and their feedback.
