Rick was pleasant, knowledgeable, timely, and his prices were very reasonable.  In fact, when the repairs were finished, Rick was able to cut the cost down from the initial estimate he quoted us for the repair of three blinds\/shades.  We were very pleased with Jeannie's Blind Repair, our shades work better than new, and we highly recommend this company for any shade\/blind repair needs you might have.
