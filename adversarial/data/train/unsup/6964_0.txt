I have been here several times and I am never that impressed with the food. I go here out of convenience more than anything. Today, my friend and I bought 1 large beef shawarma, 1 small falafal and 1 bottled juice. The total was $18. A little on the expensive side, compared to other places. It seems to be fairly busy over lunch and I know they have a new location, so they must be doing ok. The staff are friendly and there are always newspapers around for a quick read.
