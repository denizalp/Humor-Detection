This sculpture at the corner of 1st and Coolidge in the Arts District is the first of what's planned to be a series of public art pieces stretching down 1st Street from the Arts District to Fremont Street called the First Street Art Trail.  Some of the other Art Trail placements are bright green Dero bike racks with sayings on them.\n\nThe cat in the sculpture is called Snowball and the entire sculpture is entitled \"Snowball in Vegas.\"  Snowball is a nine foot tall cat molded from expanded polystyrene.  The cat is painted yellow and has a long pink tongue sticking out.\n\nThis is slowly becoming a place where locals can take tourists for a different photo op in Las Vegas.  It really is an interesting piece of art.\n\nFor those interested in seeing the art work as it was done, you can view a time lapse video at YouTube and enjoy the work Jesse Smigel created.\n\nHere's the link to the video.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/Ad1n6KZVf20
