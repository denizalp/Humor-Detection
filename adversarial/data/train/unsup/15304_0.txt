I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed my meals at Delights! As a matter of fact, I ate both breakfast and dinner here and absolutely loved it! The staff was very friendly and there were no long lines!\n\nHere's what I ordered and now recommend:\n*Fresh squeezed juice ($4)\n*The French Quarter egg sandwich served with fresh fruit ($12)\n*Cajun Chicken Pasta ($12)\n*Custom Pizza with two toppings ($16)\n\nAlthough the prices are a bit steep, the portions are fair, and the food is delicious! I'm definitely willing to try new items on their menu. I highly recommend Delights for breakfast, lunch, or dinner and I'm so looking forward to going back!
