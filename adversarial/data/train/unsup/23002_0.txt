What to do when waiting for a near-by restaurant to complete your breakfast order??  Let's get some caffeine.  Hey, let's check out TTC?!\n\nRoach on the floor aside.  The staff eventually took care of it.  Hey, it's Vegas...\n\nOrdered up some Chai Tea and a spicy Musubi.  Originally I thought this would be just like everywhere else I have been to, but I was wrong.  They prepared the spicy Musubi in house.  Damn, was it good! They prepped and cooked the Musubi with a Sriracha sauce that was allowed to caramelize around a delicious slice of Spam.\n\nEverything was tasty besides the ambiance but that being said, I am willing to find time to give TTC another chance.
