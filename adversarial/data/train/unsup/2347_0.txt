Very friendly staff here. The girls are ways welcoming and fun to be around. Jocelyn cut my hair the other day and did a fantastic job. I keep getting compliments :) Will definitely be coming back.\n\nOh, they offer your tea and coffee when you arrive, which is a nice touch... the only thing I would request is that they offer wine! ;)
