I came here because of the rating, thinking that Yelp would generally steer me in the right direction.  This is one instance in which Yelp got it wrong, for me.  I do not understand how this place could have 4.5 stars!????\n\nThe primary reason I am giving this place a 2 star and not a one star is I hate to give mom and pop type establishments a 1-star review.  I understand the potential ramifications of negative Yelp reviews, thus, I want to be careful with my critique of this restaurant, while being honest about what I experienced.\n\n I sat close to the wall on the right side of the entrance and I could see in the kitchen fairly well. The reason I would never go back is that I saw a woman in the back eating food and then turning and preparing food to be served. That made me stop eating my food and instruct the young person with me to not eat the food that I know was probably handled by hand.  I observed a man walk in from off the street and then pick up my tray of food and then deliver it to me.  Not, so bad, since the food was in containers and on a tray, but he dropped off our food at the table and left.  He never washed his hands.  I also observed other people eating food back there and handling food.  This is how illnesses are spread.  \n\nI ordered the WTF fries, I didn't eat much of this dish.  I also had 6 chicken wings and some sides.  The wings were ok.  The calamari and okra were ok too.  \n\nSadly, I would never go back here. I feel bamboozled by their cute pics online.
