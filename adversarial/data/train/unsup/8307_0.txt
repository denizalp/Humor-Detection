My first time here I came for an elite Yelp event. Never really consider this a restaurant I would patronize. But it's actually good for a corporate restaurant. Has an excellent daily happy hour from 4 to 6:30. Drink specials and half price appetizers. All the food came out fresh and hot and prepared to order. The wait staff is attentive friendly and nice and there to help and assist in any way. We'll be coming back to try other items.
