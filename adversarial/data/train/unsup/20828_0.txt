1st time here and will never ever return. Absolutely worst nail salon experience of my life. I will recommend this place to no one. 'Lady with the short hair' is awful and doesn't seem to care about her customer service abilities according to other reviewers. Cut my fingers 4 times with a nail file. Didn't apologize once. Fingers were bleeding the entire time. Nails are uneven. Had to go buy a nail file to even them out. Go here if you want to have the most painful, unenjoyable nail experience of your life. I'll look to report this salon to BBB and health violations.
