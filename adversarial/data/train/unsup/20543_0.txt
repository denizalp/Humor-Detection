The first time I went to Cheetah's it was in the afternoon on Mother's Day. May I use this review as a public service announcement to all guys who have the bright idea to go to a strip club on Mother's Day. Quite simply don't and do you know why? because the strippers will be mother's and not young ones either. Now don't get me wrong they were lovely, but not exactly what my crew was looking for. It did however make for a hilarious time and it was pretty damn cheap, so who am I to complain?\nRather cautiously we decided to go back on a Saturday night and the place was packed with extremely hot strippers, we thusly went on to have a great night that did not break the bank. Win!
