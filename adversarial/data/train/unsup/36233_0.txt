I visited this place a few times in the summer of 2015 and will not be going back.  Here's why: \n\nI believe there was a fresh fruit snow ice special at the time.  It didn't matter what time you went, they were always sold out of Fresh Mango AND also the Mango Tango. However I would see big piles mango snow ice on other people's tables and it was also being served to people who arrived AFTER us. Maybe we were missing some type of VIP status....\n\nThe last time I visited that summer, was again told that the FRESH mango snow ice was sold out; so I ordered a FRESH strawberry snow ice instead.  It took nearly 50 minutes to arrive and when it came it was the Strawberry Passion (artificial Strawberry flavour).  I told the server and she proceeded to be really rude, telling me I didn't specify and that I just said strawberry? Like after visiting your place so many times and asking for fresh fruit snow ice and being told NO every time, I'm pretty sure I specified. She asked if I wanted her to remake it and I told her there's no point since it would take another hour for snow ice.  \n\nI ate the Strawberry Passion - tasted exactly how I imagined it to be - powdered artificial strawberry flavouring. Obviously I didn't finish it.  They never apologized or offered anything.  I paid full price for something I didn't order and got rude service.  Obviously I left no tip and haven't been back since.
