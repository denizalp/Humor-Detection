Went into shop to look at sectionals found a super cool lamp. Asked to buy it but wanted to see if it worked. Waited around thinking someone was helping us but he wasn't. Wished he would of at least acknowledged for waiting. After waiting around I asked a random lady for help. She found a light and made sure lamp worked.I was alil frustrated but got over it. Then at check out I thought I was being charged 59.48 for this lamp. Once I got home I realized that they charged me 590.48 instead of the 59.48. Called them explained the situation. They recharged me correct amount but I'm yet to see the 590.48 credited back into my account. Overall save yourself the trouble.
