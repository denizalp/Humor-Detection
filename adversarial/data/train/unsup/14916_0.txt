This sandwich does not hold a candle to the best porchetta sandwich I have ever had (see: Roli Roti here: http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/roli-roti-gourmet-rotisserie-san-francisco#hrid:uT1PKxMUU5R2GC0nJG3dQw) and that's unfortunate for Porchetta & Co.  If I hadn't eaten Roli Roti within 15 days of eating here I might have enjoyed myself more*.  I just don't think this is a 5 star sandwich, and Toronto rates it high because it's our only porchetta option. That doesn't make it infallible. This is really a 3 star sandwich but you know what... - 1 for the hype**. \n\nThe good:\n- The Porchetta here is okay, but it isn't as flavourful as other porchetta.  Others have noted the meat was a bit bland and I agree.\n- The sandwich is reasonably priced (but comes with no toppings - they're extra)\n\nThe not-as-good-as-roli-roti-in-detail-and-how-to-improve:\n- The bun here was way too big for the sandwich, and IMO not the correct bun for this type of sandwich (while notably still a delicious bun). There was at least 1.5cm of bun around the ENTIRE sandwich that didn't contain porchetta. I would also use a more hardy bun for this type of sandwich as it deteriorated while I was eating. This bun is best used for cold sandwiches (imagine a turkey BLT on it... omg).\n- At Roli Roti, they use the bun to sop up the meat juice from the cutting board as they slice the cooked porchetta. P&C should take note of this practice.\n- At Roli Roti. the sandwich is more expensive ($8) but it comes with greens and a caramelized onion compote of some sort that brings it to the next level.\n\nThe bad:\n- I just have to say it: I hate how they weigh the meat for the sandwich.\n- It seemed like they were pretty skimpy on the meat (bun size may play into this perception).\n- Hardly any seating\n\nIn summary, I would eat here again if I were serendipitously in the area and looking for a sandwich, but I would never take the street car across town again specifically to eat here again. \n\n------------------------\n*guys, I think my toe is turning either blue or white.\n** Shame on all of you for accepting less than the best.
