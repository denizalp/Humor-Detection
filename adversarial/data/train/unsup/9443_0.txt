DO NOT COME HERE! SAVE YOUR MONEY THEY ARE AHOLES!\nI wish I got the managers name since she thought it was so funny that we were unhappy. \n\nThe check in clerks ( all female) were so rude! \nWe checked out early. Went back 3 minutes later Bc we left a charger in the room and made a federal case out of it for us to get it back. We waited 30 mins and the manager came and she was no help and kind of smirked and laughed under her breath at us Bc she knew we were upset. Really??? I will never in my life come here again. The rooms where very nasty. The halls smelled like sex and drugs, and the service is below zero.
