Came here on a Saturday night just before closing time (7:20pm) saw a lineup with a large family waiting on their order..\n\nI asked if they could make my patties rare and the young cook told me he would try but they are really busy with back orders.\n\nIt was just the two of them covering cash and pumping out burgers on a very busy night!\n\nDid they turn anyone away?\nDid they tell customers that it's closing time and they had to leave? \n\nNo to both. These two guys were working extremely hard on the tail-end  of their shift but kept being kind and providing great service along with excellent burgers.\n\nI will always come back to this place and recommend just based on customer service today!
