I went for taco Tuesday with one of my friends and had an overall pretty good experience! \n\nServer: very sweet girl, very approachable, great service. \n\nAtmosphere: pretty fun, nice\/casual, great place to come grab dinner after work, 20s to 30s crowd really. \n\nSurrounding area: as someone new to AZ, I thought downtown Tempe was really awesome! Lots to do\/see. \n\nFood: $2 tacos...can't beat that! The mahi mahi and carne asada tacos were my favorite. Knocked it down a couple stars because the other tacos I tried weren't as good as I'd expected so I definitely wouldn't want to pay full price for those. I'm from San Diego though so my expectations of tacos are pretty high! \n\nDrinks: my friend ordered their signature margarita and she said it was pretty good but tasted a bit watered down. I stuck with water though. \n\nWould most likely return. Maybe I'll try out the Scottsdale location next.
