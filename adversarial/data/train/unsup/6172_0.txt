I've been having a torrid love affair with Grimaldi's.  \n\nWhere I work, there's a little deli downstairs.  I eat there pretty much everyday.  The food there isn't great, but it's right down stairs and I feel at home there and they have soup and salad and stuff.\n\nMy little office deli has been closed for the holidays.  I am a creature of habit, so I've been having to venture off to fend for myself food-wise.  I felt like pizza--I was hungover, mind you--so I used Yelp to find something.  I typed in my zip code and \"pizza\" and Grimaldi's popped up.\n\nWhen I was ordering, in a groggy voice, with a headache, I think the phone conversation went like this:\n\n\"Grimaldi's, how can I help you?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\"  I said.  \"Do you guys deliver?\"\n\n\"No, we don't.\"\n\n\"Shit.  Um,\"  I googled them and saw they were like a three minute bike ride away.  \"I'd like to put in an order for pick-up then.\"\n\nThey asked me what I wanted on my pizza and I went with the usual sleazy choices.  They told me they didn't have canadian bacon.\n\nI was like, what the fuck?  I asked if I could get bread sticks.  No bread sticks.  I was like, fine.  Just the pizza, then.\n\nWhen I rode my bike there, I realized, \"Oooohhhhh, this is a fancy place.  I had no idea.\"  I'm a dirtbag, so, to me this place is pretty much like my idea of upscale.\n\nI rode my bike back to work with one hand, the other hand on my pizza.  When I got out of the elevator, these people were like, \"Grimaldi's?  Mmmmm!\"\n\nI finally dug in.  It was delicious.  Seriously.  I can't imagine pizza tasting much better.  If pizza were better, my taste buds would react in a confused manner and I think the result would be a negative experience.  This is a delicate balancing act of being delicious without creating a transcendant experience into a foody hell.\n\nI thought the pizza was overpriced until I tried it.\n\nI ate the whole pizza by myself at work.  I ate Grimaldi's and, since it was super slow that day, I watched The God's Must be Crazy.  Easily, one of the best workdays I've ever had.\n\nSince then, I've been there to eat another pizza and a huge, baby-sized calzone.\n\nThis is a great place.  The help is always nice to me, even though everyone's dressed nice and I come in all red-faced and sweaty after locking my bike up to a street sign since I was not able to find a bike rack.
