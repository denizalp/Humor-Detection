We had a family reunion 2 weeks ago and booked 7 rooms. They really took great care of my guests.The accommodations were very nice and clean. Also had a great pool party at the cabanas. All the staff were amazing. The party ended with a fabulous Sunday brunch. Easy access to the strip and airport. Highly recommended.
