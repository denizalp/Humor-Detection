This place has one Board Certified Chiropractor whom I made an appointment with for my low back pain. On Tuesdays they open at 2 p.m.  Hoping to get in, I waited until they opened aND made appointment for same day. Lucky me!  I got there and the receptionist was very nice and accommodating.  However, I sat there about 30-40 minutes PAST my appointment time and was told I would probably be able to see the other doctor sooner than the one I made the appointment for.  Tired of waiting and in pain, I told the receptionist to forget it \"I'm leaving\".\n\nI expect to see a Chiropractor 2-3 times a week for my current issue.  I'm NOT going to wait this long each time.  Go somewhere else unless you have all the time in the world to sit and wait.
