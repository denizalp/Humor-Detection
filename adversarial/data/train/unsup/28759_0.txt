Husband and I came here for dinner before the Crazy Horse show. I love the look of this place. Very sleek and modern looking. \n\nWe started w\/drinks. I had a raspberry cosmo, hubby had a bloody Mary. He said it was the best bloody Mary that he has ever had. \n\nWe shared an appetizer of truffle oil chips w\/blue cheese. WOW!! These are good, and worth the trip alone. I ordered some ravioli dish. It was bland. I was going to go w\/the gnocchi, after reading other reviews, I wish I would have gone w\/my first choice. Hubby had the short ribs. They were amazing. The sides that accompanied theses ribs were equally as amazing.
