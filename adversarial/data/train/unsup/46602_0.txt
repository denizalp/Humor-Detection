Tiny shop located in the same plaza as Cha time.   The server here are quite friendly.   Their tea is really refreshing which reminds me of David's tea; the coffee here is alright.  I like the assortment of the waffle and ice cream.  The idea of dessert being on a hot plate sounds awesome but the draw back was dried crunchy waffle.  If you let the ice cream melt,  the liquid sort of compensate the dry waffle lol it was a nice little tea time experience but I would probably stick to ice cream and waffle without the hot plate.
