Oooook it's been about three years-ish? My impression improved, but I still don't think I'll become a regular or anything. Thank god for my previous review - I was able to not make similar mistakes again. \n\nI ended up ordering the veggie croquettes for the BBQ bowl. My dad ordered the same, but lamb meatballs. We both enjoyed  our choices. Now, the side of \"soup\" that comes with it is good but I honestly don't know if I got the right thing. We both ordered different, but they looked and tasted the same... I don't know enough about Indian cuisine to recognize what's right. The wheat naan was just ok, nothing special. \n\nOverall!! Mediocre. Small portions compared to other fast eateries like Chipotle or Piada. Honestly, I don't know how they have 4.5 stars.
