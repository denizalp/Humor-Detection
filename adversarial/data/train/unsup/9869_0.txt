Wowser's! Finally a fantastic place to eat in Glendale at La Chalet! We had an amazing dinning experience here Sunday.  After reading some of the Yelp reviews, I bookmarked this place as a \"must try\" and I'm so glad I did!\n\nWe walked in and immediately noticed how cute and quaint this restaurant was decorated.   There are two sections on the restaurant, a dining room area for families and the other a \"bar and lounge\" area that has a warm ambiance.  Since this trip was a family adventure we were seated right next to the Ice Cave, where my son could watch the TV's in the bar area, making the crepes, which was very was very cool.  They have very entertaining \"French\" signs and posters on the walls.  They also offer entertainment some nights and have special entertainers scheduled for reservations.\n \nAppetizer: Traditional Flammenkuchen ~ \"Oven roasted tart with sour cream, swiss cheese, bacon and onion\".  It looked like a pizza at first, but don't be fooled! The flavor and texture get you quickly. The crispy \"tart\" and unique flavor of the dough itself is enough to party with the sour cream love affair your mouth is having.  \nMeal: Berg ere crepe (ratatouille with goat cheese melted on top), Roquefort crepe (melted blue cheese topped with caramelized apples and crumbled walnuts), and a Roasted Chicken Salad (roasted chicken on a bed of mixed greens, cheeses and a delightful vinaigrette dressing).  They have a decent wine list, great selection of Swiss imported ails to try and a full bar. \nDesert:  Chocolate Fondue ~ it was fun and entertaining with the kiddo!  It wasn't too hot and they provide a lot of strawberries, apples, pastry puffs and chocolate brownie wedges for you to dip into the chocolaty goodness!  \n\nService:  Was FANTASTIC!  Our server was able to give us just enough suggestions based on our like\/dislikes.  We had the Groupon deal so it made our meal was very inexpensive.  Everything was fresh and fantastic and most of their crepes are gluten free.  We can't wait to go back and try something different.
