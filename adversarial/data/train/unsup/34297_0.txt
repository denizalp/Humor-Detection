Wow, three star only.  Must be some extra picky breakfast diners.  Anyways, I normally get the breakfast original but I noticed the California omelette this morning.  Three eggs, scallions, avacado, pepper jack cheese and fresh pico with potatoes and dry wheat toast.  Great breakfast with multiple coffee refills equals a five star in my book...
