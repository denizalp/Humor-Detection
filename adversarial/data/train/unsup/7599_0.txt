I've been coming here for business for over 15 years. Used to like it and think it was pretty decent for old downtown. Stayed in Rush Tower a couple times even though very expensive and was put on Fremont Street once which was horrible and crazy loud. \n\nI'm back again for another week of business and this time there is a huge crazy tent that has music thumping like mad!! Makes Fremont Street seem quiet!!! WHAT THE HELL?  My Dad called downstairs (we work together) and staff is practically like what's your problem it's a Friday night in Vegas. \n\nBesides the out control noise. The room has huge crack\/whole in tile floor and there is rust all over the bathtub. Gross. I know they tried to upgrade rooms but not so great. Also it smells like cigarettes UGH. Only saving grace is bed is comfortable outside of smelling like smoke :(\n\nI'm pretty sure after 17 years it looks like this will be last time we will stay here. I'd rather get an Airbnb away from all this nonsense!!\n\nThis hotel could care less about you and they don't hide that fact either. They basically gave me ear plugs.
