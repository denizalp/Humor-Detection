Just fabulous.\n\nI came upon Zen for I was following a particular stylist, Erin. She is the best. She's a real pro and she makes me look like a rock star... well, at least my hair ;)\n\nZen is in a really cool space and the vibe is super groovy. They relocated to an old bank building on W 25th. The decor is well thought out, they play good tunes and they will even serve you wine. Not your granny's hair salon!
