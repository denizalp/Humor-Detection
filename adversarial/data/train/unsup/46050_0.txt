When I rate a restaurant or bar I look at the category of that restaurant (fast food, casual, fine dining, etc.) and rate it based on other restaurants in that category. \n\nMy husband and I went to Vacarros with high expectations. I had been there a few years ago and recalled it being a higher end quality Italian restaurant, we were sorely disappointed. \n\nThere were a few small clues that we were not going to have meal and experience we were hoping for when the waiter stopped by our table with another tables salads so he could show them to us and talk us through their preparation. I certainly wouldn't want my waiter taking my food to another table and then presenting it to me. Ok, mistakes happen. \n\nThe waiter told us that the chef was very focused on the specials so my husband opted to go with the risotto special (mushroom\/lobster) with the side salad and I chose the Lasagna al carne from the regular menu. The risotto was undercooked, not creamy, mushrooms were rubbery, and only two small pieces of lobster in an extremely small portion that we thought was an appetizer delivered by mistake. The side salad was $13.00 and the extremely small portion of risotto was $22.00 not worth the $35.00 total for his meal. \n\nThe lasagna was ok but not the quality I expected. The noodles were over cooked, mushy and the meal was warm not hot. The sauce was good and it had a generous amount of meat in it. The overall portion size for the lasagna was large. \n\nWe were extremely disappointed in the overpriced, uninspired, poor quality food. My husband left hungry and we will not be returning to Vacarros.
