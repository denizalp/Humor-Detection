So my boyfriend and I are cheap. \nWe love food (making it, eating it, watching it on T.V.) and we really enjoy going out. We're also in Vegas at least once a month. This is kind of a raw deal when you consider how many amazing (albeit expensive) restaurants there are in Vegas comboed with our reluctance to pay for them. We normally end up splitting something in a food court. \nThe stars aligned during our last trip, however, and we had a \"business dinner\". Prices be damned!\n\nThe location is totally unexpected. You could pass it a thousand times without noticing. It's on the 2nd floor of Harrah's casino and is accessed by its own elevator (located near the piano bar). \nI loved the interior design of the restaurant as much as I liked the food. It was rugged  and classy all at the same time. As if John Wayne and Audrey Hepburn had a baby and that baby grew up to be an interior designer and part time cowboy. Fabulous!\nThe view from our table was amazing. It added such a neat element to the atmosphere.\nI ordered salmon with mashed potatoes, both were ridiculously good. \nThere were some tiny imperfections to the evening (see Stephen T.'s review for details) but otherwise a super awesome evening.
