Crop Rocks takes pains to be a real Rockin' watering hole, outfitted with a humungous wall of vintage vinyl and a bar-top carefully filled with even more of the stuff. It is almost a surprise that the staff aren't dressed in vintage outfits ala Jack Rabbit Slim's, given the place's endless fetishizing of all things swagger-centric and power-chord fueled. The menu is filled with dozens of clever rock puns as well (the best being, probably, 'I Would Do Anything for Loaf'). It's all a little reminiscent of Melt or the Hard Rock Caf√© (R.I.P.), though presented in, one might say, a higher key. The other day, patrons were amazed by the helter skelter manner of the bartenders, one of whom shambled up and asked, \"Yeah? What do you want?\" in a decidedly non-tongue-in-cheek fashion as the other staggered around dazedly in his sunglasses. The food was fairly good pub grub, with the French fries--perfectly crisp and well-seasoned-- serving as one small plate standout, and the vaguely BBQ flavored deviled eggs (sans bacon) as another. It is clear that like most Flats bars, however, CR is built for volume rather than high caliber foodie specialization. As other reviewers have noted, the view of the river is quite good, so patrons would be wise to sit outside, away from the bar. The picnic tables are an ideal place for people watching. On a Saturday night in Cleveland, there is little more one could ask for.
