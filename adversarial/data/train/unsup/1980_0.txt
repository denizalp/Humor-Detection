Burger's good.  I wouldn't claim it's the best in town, but its a quality burger for sure.  To each of their own? I think it had a hint of mustard in it?  Comes with fries.\n\nBurgers are only available in the lounge.  My sis and I had the prefix meal.  She opted for the house salad which was the same side salad that came with the burger.  I had the caesar salad.  \n\nThe dessert would be my most favorite part of the meal.   Chewy soft baked Snickerdoodle Cookies with a creamy Butterscotch Pudding.  My sis loves me and let me finished hers yayy lol\n\nService was attentive.  Don't eat here if you're on a rush.
