I finally got to try this place!!\n\nI love the old dinner feel, I love the paper place mats with the little t's, i love the friendliness of the employees. Nothing but love for this place.\n\nI got the burger and a milkshake. What people have said about the burger is true. It's the best. Really good patty, excellent bread and the cheese is perfectly melted and delicious. They also add a special sauce and it is delightful. \n\nThe milkshake was also really good, a bit more milky than I prefer (I like it when there's more ice cream) but it didn't bother me. \n\nOne of the best places in Montreal!
