We finally tried this diner who was recommended to us and omg! \nWe tried their breakfast i had the pan san: 2 huge pancakes, 2 eggs and your choice of meat.\nMy husband had the classic bacon and eggs.\nThose pancakes were amazing! And so big i could barely finish half. All for only $14! A steal in Vegas. Great atmosphere and friendly stuff! We can't wait to go back to try the lunch options !
