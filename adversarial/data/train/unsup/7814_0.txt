We came here for a birthday celebration, all of our party did the $30 AYCE offered on Sundays from 5-9 pm.\n\nWhat an incredible value to our gluttony. Not only are there sushi (no Nigiri or Sashimi) included with the AYCE, there are salads, miso soup, appetizers (chicken karaage, spicy coconut tofu, ceviche), udon noodle dishes (Pork Belly, Curry, and Veggie Tempura!), and rice bowls (salmon, vegetable, and pork belly!).\n\nIt's an exceptional value considering all the items are ordered two at a time and freshly crafted for you. \n\nThere is a lot of red tape - they are listed on the menu- but our servers were very accommodating and weren't overly draconian about enforcing them.\n\nEven if you are not a 'buffet' person, if you get just two of their rolls, say the Dragon with shrimp tempura, eel, avocado, eel sauce - $16 and Duck with mango, avocado, duck soy reduction - $12, you're already getting your money's worth! The rolls are regular-sized rolls, they didn't skimp on the ingredients. Our entire group must have tried at least one of each rolls on the vast menu, and each one were met with smiles.\n\nWe did make a reservation for our party, but I see the AYCE catching on and garnering a following so I'd suggest you at least call before heading out.
