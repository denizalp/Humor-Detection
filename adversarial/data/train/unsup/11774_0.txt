Handwritten menu on a humungous chalkboard. Handmade decorations with a friendly staff. Parking right at the door. \nNow the food (and the point of this update). Prior visits had a couple of disappointments (such as only offering beef brisket once a week without it being smothered in sauce and the inclusion of a large amount of fat cap on to-go brisket orders). We have made several visits recently with better results. Only a small amount of fat is left on the brisket and they now offer thick sliced brisket without sauce all of the time. If you are getting it to-go it is only $10.95\/pound (far less than many other BBQ places and about the same as buying the lame sliced pressed meats at the grocery deli). \nThe meat has just a slightly smokey, sweet taste and a little goes a long ways (a pound makes 6 meaty sandwiches) and is excellent cold. We haven't ordered any sides recently, but looking at other patron's plates, they look very good. This is now our preferred BBQ place.
