I came to this car wash about a month ago, ( September 30th) it had good reviews on Yelp, so I thought I would check it out. I went through the wash, they cleaned it well and were nice to give dash wipes, however I came out of the wash with a flat tire, the wash had completely ripped off my air pressure valve and sensor. It was a Saturday evening at around 6, so tire shops are closed. The employees seemed to have a \"darn that sucks for you\" attitude. The manager was trying to help but did not offer the Corporate complaint and file until my cop cousin had talked with him on the phone. I was lucky enough to come across someone who was able to fix my tire temporarily. *NOT RELATED TO THE COMPANY* I was told I would be re-paid for the expenses to fix it it correctly, (because this should be covered by their insurance??!) it had costed me $142.00. I have still YET to hear from the corporate office to receive this back payment a MONTH later. I have even called in and was sent to voice mail. If they damage your car...good luck getting your money back.
