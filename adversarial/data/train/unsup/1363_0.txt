Tortilla crusted, hand stuffed cheddar and bacon filled jalapeno shots dipped in a cilantro buttermilk sauce. Enough said. Picture this. Fried jalapenos sitting in a shot glass of buttermilk sauce. You take it out of the shot glass and bite into a fried jalapeno of gooey cheese that's oozing out. Along with the cheese, you taste bacon and southwest flavor. It's so good, you must have another and another and another...until all six have disappeared and you wish you had six more. This was my most recent experience at Spotted Donkey. They are called \"Shooters\" and you can order six or 12. After tasting them, I highly suggest going with the order of 12, that is, if you're hungry for fried happiness! \n\nThis still stands as one of my most favorite restaurants in the Carefree area. I've been visiting since I was a teenager and it still has yet to disappoint. Everything here is delicious, especially the southwestern mac and cheese and the stuffed chile peppers. Really, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
