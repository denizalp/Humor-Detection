Super disappointing. \n\nI wrote a review a few years ago for EB in Miami and I see this location is nothing different.\n\nComing back from Mardi Gras I had a 3 hour layover and needed fuel\/dinner. I decided that a tuna sandwich would be the right move.\n\nWrong, wrong, wrong. The tuna was the blandest tuna I've ever tasted. There was absolutely no flavor at all except for the pepper jack cheese. \n\nAdd a small water and I paid $16 for chewy edible air. \n\nI should've just went with a bag of $4 cheetos and skittles from the overpriced airport store instead! \n\nThe staff was very friendly though.
