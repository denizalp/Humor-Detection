I was pretty excited to try burger 320, because I had read some really great reviews and to be honest... I'm not super picky anyway. \nBut saying that.. The burger I ordered (cheese burger w added bacon) wasn't worth the 22$ I paid w a side of \"parm fries\", also not great. Everything was dry and just not up to standard. The only saving grace this place has is the gelato, which is to die for!
