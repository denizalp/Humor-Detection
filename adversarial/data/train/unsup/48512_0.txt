After reading through all the reviews and reading up on other shops in the area I decided to give 29th street a try.  I went in for an oil change, as well as a coolant leak check (had been running high temps and was expecting the worst). First impression, Andy (shop owner) was a straightforward and knowledgeable. I immediately could tell he was there to help and I felt comfortable that I was in the right shop as he went into detail about several questions I had about my car. I had been neglecting my car for a few months as I hadn't really been driving it.  So I also decided to do a transmission flush that was long overdue. \n\nThe five-star perfect reviews may make you feel skeptical, as no one is \"perfect\" but I can honestly say they are all genuine after experiencing the great service at this shop first hand.  I've had my fair share of experiences with car shops\/mechanics over the years (I've always owned pre-owned vehicles) and know my way around my car pretty well as I've owned it for about 5 years now and is tough to find a genuine honest shop who's transparent and is not just in the business for the profits like most of the large chains do.  \n\nI dropped off my car on a Monday afternoon about 1pm with 2 cars in front of me and he had it done by 6pm that same day. He let me know there was actually no leaks of coolant and the the high temps might of been due to how crappy my oil was (it had been a while) lol.. but great news.\n\nTo summarize this shop is like taking your car to that one family friend\/mechanic you've trusted with all your cars and told all your friends about over the years. Andy is really there to help you keep your car running well, fair priced, and it shows.\n\nI had been taking my car to a shop about 20 mins away from my place that was okay not the best but hadn't found anything else nearby. I'm so glad I came across 29th st Auto, I've already told a few friends about it and will become my go to shop from now on.
