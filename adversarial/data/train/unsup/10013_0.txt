Great atmosphere for a date. \n\nWent here on a Tuesday evening at 8 and the place was busy, but not packed - got a table for 6 immediately (plus, I don't think they take reservations anyways). \n\nI got flight sampler (sample 5 beers of your choice). That was great with getting to try the variety of beers and the staff are quite knowledgable about the different types of beers and figuring out what you would like. I found the beers to be good, but nothing incredible. I wouldn't really come back for the beer. However....\n\nThe food was really really good. I got the mushroom and kale pizza and everything about was perfect. Awesome dough and toppings. Plus, it's a great size for only $15 (I was completely stuffed). \n\nFriends got the fried chicken and burgers. Fried chicken seemed to be a big hit. I got to try some and it was tasty. 3 big pieces of boneless chicken was definitely a plus, especially because I only expected it to be 1 piece. \n\nThe burger I can't speak of - never tried it. Friends seemed to like it, but it didn't seem to be absolutely amazing. \n\nThe food is something that will bring me back, along with the great atmosphere and friendly staff. \n\nSide note: no tvs. I didn't mind, but friends were a bit upset when we couldn't watch the Jays game.
