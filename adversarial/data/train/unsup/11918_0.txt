Its like Panera, but without the focus on healthy choices or flavor. Everything on the menu sounds decent, but nothing has any flavor. As others pointed out, the peppered turkey has no pepper accent whatsoever.\n\nTried the pick two combo- half a sando, half a salad, and a spicy pickle for about $8. GOBBLER sandwich (peppered turkey, feta, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato mayo) had little to no feta nor artichoke hearts, as I could not detect them at all in the sandwich that I consumed. The PARISIAN salad (grilled chicken, bleu cheese, EVOO mayo, avocado, bacon, red onion) sounded tasty, if remarkably unParisian- but it was presented thrown together with minimal toppings, and sided with a huge heap of guacamole, which went with neither dish on the plate? Guess they know their food has no flavor, and that must be their attempt to fix it?\n\nService was polite, plate was delivered to my table after ordering, but I was never checked on to ask about the discrepancies with my dishes. Manager\/owner appeared to be chatting with friends at the front counter for the duration of my visit, wish she had been more involved in the service- maybe the dishes would have come out correctly.\n\nThey do have a Yelp check-in offer for free drink\/chips upgrade with your order.
