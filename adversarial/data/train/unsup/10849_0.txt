I stopped over here to grab some of their Dave and Andy's ice cream which they are noted for. Since it was an exceptional hot day I skipped on the coffee. You can either get a cone or a cup. The lady told me they come in small, medium and large sizes.  She has said to me that the size depends upon the number of scoops that you order. Medium she told me was two scoops.\n\nI sampled a couple of their favorites and ended up buying one scoop of strawberry and a scoop of some mores. I was amazed at the fact that it actually cost me a little more I guess because I mixed the flavors. Nevertheless I took it and sat down. They sell sandwiches, Nicholas blend coffee and breakfast pastries.For some reason I was not able to connect to the WiFi but no biggie. Outdoor seating is available. I did like how the place has a rock theme about with special attention to the Beatles. However, I was able to see a \"Steelers\" guitar hanging there so I like the motif. Even the lamps had music shades on them.\n\nMy ice cream was good but definitely not on my top hit list. Nevertheless the scoops were generous and got to enjoy a sweet treat while checking out some of the shops along Brilliant Ave.
