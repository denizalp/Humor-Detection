I'm a fan of this Australian import. I love the variety of flavors, particularly the pecan pie gelato, apple pie gelato and poached figs in marsala. The gelato itself is great, but the real stars of those flavors and others are the chunks of pie and other ingredients that are mixed in. The weekly specialty flavors give plenty of reasons to come back over and over. The smokiness of the Jack Daniels and Smoke make that flavor unique. Vanilla Spice was an excellent mixture of strawberry glazed doughnuts, raspberry puree and gelato. I love that you can sample as many flavors as you want. The biggest drawback is that there's no official way to line up and order or sample, so during peak hours it can be a clusterfuck as people surround the display cases to wait to be served. As long as you can avoid the crowds, this is one of the best spots to visit for gelato in the valley.
