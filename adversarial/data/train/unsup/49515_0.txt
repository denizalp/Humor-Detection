The one star is for the desserts they had which were pretty good - everything else was terrible. We went right when they were switching from lunch to dinner so they were changing out most of the the trays of food. You'd think, yay, everything is gonna be fresh and hot! But no.. even the fresh food they put out was dry and overcooked. The cold crab legs and lobster claws tasted so freezer burned they were barely edible. And I'm pretty happy with just Panda Express so it's hard to not please me with Chinese food but the asian fare they had was so terrible I took one nibble and pushed my plate away. The italian fare was slightly better but still only TV dinner quality. (Shows how bad the other stuff was)\nThey made Golden Corral feel like a fancy buffet. I thought Vegas was supposed to be famous for its buffets but apparently not so at the MGM Grand. What a waste of money. Seriously, do not go here for dinner.
