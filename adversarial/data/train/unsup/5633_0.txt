I've passed by Creamistry when I was in the OC a few months ago but recently learned they were in Scottsdale and Phoenix.....When I got there I was indecisive on the flavors but I saw Strawberry Ice Cream with Whipped Cream in a Brownie Bowl!  Yes please!  Sign me up!  \n\nJust have a game plan before you get in line.  Look over which Ice Cream Base you want.  As much as I wanted to try the Coconut Milk Base I went with the premium ice cream just cause it's the creamiest.  It didn't disappoint.\n \nThe liquid nitrogen magic happens so fast that.  In less than a minute you've got super dense but not too creamy ice cream.  That brownie was a perfect complement cause I was feenin for chocolate as well.  Flavors I need to try next time are Cookies and Cream and their sorbets.  \n\n10 out of 12 months in essentially \"Ice Cream Weather\" here in AZ so it won't take long for to get to know all their flavors in a short period of time!  5 stars across the board!  Quality ingredients and quality toppings.  The non dairy options is a huge added bonus!  Located near by Urban Outfitters and High Point at the Waterfront.  I parked at the Nordstrom Parking Garage across the street.
