I have visited this bistro several times since Paris hotel and casino is one of my favorite casinos to visit when I am in Vegas.  I was also familiar with the original in Chicago.\n\nThis last visit was not a happy occassion but you can only stand homecooked food for a certain time before you decide to go out when you visit family.\n\nThe meal itself was good, I had steak dijon well done (as requested)and my partner had the skate.  He had the soup of the day vegetarian style (very good) and I had the salade maison. \n\nOverall the whole meal was satisfactory including the drinks.  One note, bistros are normally small in France and in the context of Vegas, nothing is small so this one has a lot of space and its outdoor patio has the view of the dancing fountains of Bellagio.  \n\nThe service itself is exemplary except for the wait.  The salad and the soup came on a reasonable time but the entree was really a long wait.  In any restaurant, this is not excusable especially for a place not really very crowded.  When you finish the appetizer\/soup\/salad, you expect the dinner to come at an appropriate time.  Little quibble but prices should reflect overall service, food, timing and other extras.\n\nOne more thing, great warm bread and always ask for more if you are really enjoying, it will be good for your soup and waiting on the rest of the dinner.\n\nNo dessert to review, only had espresso. Overall recommended but not highly.
