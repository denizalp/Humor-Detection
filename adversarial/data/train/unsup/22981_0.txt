If you want soul food in Vegas, you only have a few options- Angie's fell a bit short of my expectations, but I was spoiled by a childhood in the south. Location is small, mostly takeout, and not in the best of neighborhoods, but service is as sweet as your own grandma.\n\nSMOTHERED PORK CHOPS: Well, the chop was good, but they forgot to smother it. Since this was takeout, I didn't find out til I got home across town. Mac and cabbage sides were both fairly good and clearly homemade, but I'm really bummed about the mistake with the porkchop, as it's my favorite southern dish.\nSPARE RIB DINNER: Ribs were mostly fat but I really liked the sauce used. Sides of black eyed peas and mashed potatoes were both kind of off, peas were very heavily seasoned and potatoes barely had any gravy (maybe they were running out?) and texture was gummy.\nWINGS: They sell full size wings here, and my guy really enjoyed them. They're not sauced, just fried. Boxed to go on top of a bed of super-greasy broken fries, like the bottom of the basket when no one wants to make more. \nBANANA PUDDING: Ordered one and got one free, which was nice of them. Tasted just like my mom used to make it, simple and delicious. \n\nThis place has a lot of promise, but some dishes were significantly better than others. Maybe they should tighten up the menu and drop some things they aren't executing as well. I don't come around this side of town often, but I'll try to keep this spot in mind for another visit for the smothered chops... and I'll check my order before leaving.
