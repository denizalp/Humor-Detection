Holy Tabarnouche or Sacremouille de ratatouille! (My weak attempt at French humour)\n\nDammm there are fast food places that one would consider on the edge of legendary... this is definitely a surprising visit. My first selection was closed so I felt like a sandwich and this showed up. Reviews looked promising so I dove right in. Decor of the restaurant is nothing glamorous but their food is a surprise. I went with the tandoori chicken sandwich and it came with delicious light crispy fries. The sandwich was light, flavorful and a bloody heaping serving. I've never had something so tasty and surprising for fast food in a while! The chicken had a light tandoori flavour but was delicious! \n\nI never knew this place existed and Algerian fast food is smokin good! \n\nThey give you an option of two sauces. I had both. One is a tangy creamy mayo mustard. The other is a spicier mayo. Both are delicious compliments and great for dipping your fries. \n\nFantastic place for lunch, greasy dinner, late night or after bar food to lock down that hangover.  All under $10 with a drink? Seriously? How could one go wrong? \n\nI salivate just thinking of when I can go back!
