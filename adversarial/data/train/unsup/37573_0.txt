Decided to try Ethiopian cuisine recently. So based on a recommendation, hit up the Bloor st location for Lalibela, thankfully they had two rooms, as the first one was packed, so I was able to grab a table in their overflow room, which doubles as a nightclub. \n\nI would rate this place 3.5, but will not give it the lower 3 as the food and experience was overall good.\n\nI ordered the Yeawaze tibs. This was a dish of tender beef chunks cooked in a spicy flavourful sauce, with sauteed onions and jalapeno slices. It was served on a thin pancake type roti, which you pulled apart and ate with your hands. An authentic dining experience. And quite delightful.\n\nBut as it was a Friday evening, this room filled up fast, and this was the downside. One server was allocated to deal with a room of maybe 30 patrons. After finishing dinner, it took extremely long to attempt to settle the bill. Many attempts were made to grab the waitresses attention as she ran back and forth delivering plates. Finally when the bill arrived, she rushed off and it was near 10 more minutes to pay it. All in all, it was probably a 20 minute exit, from wanting the bill to paying it. \n\nI'm sure on a weeknight it may not be as chaotic, but if you are in a rush, allot extra time if they habitually short staff the establishment, you will not get to where you need to go if you are looking for a quick meal. \n\nWill definitely try this place again as it was enjoyable, but hopefully they are staffed accordingly.
