Worst place to go to on the weekend. The staff was not cool at all. My friend and I were 5 mins late for the 3:00pm waiting list cut off and they wouldn't let us in without paying for the cover. Honestly, poor management and I would never come back to see drunk kids in their 30s checking out the waitresses.
