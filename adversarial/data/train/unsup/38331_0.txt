Great live blues \/ jazz music. Service is good as well. But I'm a huge food fanatic and the food is only ok and limited. But I guess you shouldn't expect much from a hotel bar\/restaurant.  Eitherway I had a good overall experience just wasn't impressed with the menu. But if you want to stop in for a quick drink listen to some good music and maybe impress a girl good spot to go.
