From my first visit to this one, it was a definite turn around.  I met a friend here for Friday Happy Hour.  Unfortunately we found out it was their last Friday night with HH but it was certainly memorable.  \n\nWe decided to start off with their Cheese Plate.  This cheese board was one of the best assortments.  Creamy blue cheese, brie, truffled parmesan, aged parmesan, homemade jam, fruit and toast.  Each cheese sang a different melody.  It was simply amazing!\n\nMy Yelp friend and I also opted to share some of their dishes: Caesar Salad, Lump Crab Cakes and Cavatelli & Short Ribs.  The caesar was very large and fresh.  The large salad was plenty to share with leftovers as well.  The fresh parmesan crisp in the center gave it a great flavor.  The 2 crab cakes were a delight with the lemon aioli.  The lemon kicked it up a notch with the real crab.  The cavatelli & short rib had a unique flavor that was my winner of the evening.  It was a wonderful pasta and meat dish that is delicately sprinkled with fresh parmesan.  Everything sitting on our table would be highly recommended for another order.  \n\nService here does not go unnoticed.  Our waitress, Jenna, provided such attentiveness and gratitude.  Her friendly professional attitude completed the wonderful evening.  I hope they bring back the happy hour again soon as I would love to enjoy their delectable dishes!
