I love this spot for sushi. Find the sushi chef personable andbthe wait staff attentive.  We went here on a tuesday evening and it was happy hour.  So we did order off of this menu..edamami. .fried avacodo. .a sushimi dish as well as 3 rolls, everything was very good.  Beer & wine..all for under 40 bucks. Not too shabby!
