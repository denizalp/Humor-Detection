Had to come outta retirement for some ol' fashion TRUTHS.\n\nI've gone to Red Lantern a handful of times and each time, either my time was viciously wasted AND\/OR I've been disrespected with foamy beer head.  Aside from the one lovely beautiful black queen waitress, the service is complete trash.  \n\nOh, and here's a tip, if you're glass is dirty, just deal with it otherwise you're waitress is gonna have an attitude and dash your drink (all head) in some other dirty glass. If you should happen to order online, please know that your food will be placed in sequence...but that sequence will not be checked on until you've waited for over an hour.  When the hanger sets in you'll notice a prickly sensation beneath your dermis.  This sensation is called super duper annoyance.\n\nBasically, you're gonna waste A LOT of time for some unmemorable food.  If you're hungry you should probably grab some makeshift gourmet from that convenience store that looks like a greyhound pit stop.\n\nI don't know who to blame.  It's clear that they're understaffed during peak hours but I shouldn't have to spend an hour waiting for takeout so, TWO STARS.
