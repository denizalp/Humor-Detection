I had such a wonderful experience here! I live in CA and had probably tried on over 50 dresses in CA before going to Bridal Beginning. I'm VERY picky when it comes to clothes\/shoes, etc., and I figured it would take a long time for me to find a dress I loved. With all of the \"fancy\" designer stores we have in CA, I never expected to find \"the dress\" in Pittsburgh, but I wanted to try on some dresses in my hometown so that my mom and sister could be involved in the process. Marisa was so wonderful and really listened to me\/got my style. She helped me find the perfect dress!! I couldn't be happier and can't wait to wear the dress!
