I'm kinda scared to let the secret out, but I guess Yelp deserves to know - The Happy Hour at Lucille's ROCKS. It's in the bar area only, but on Monday when we went the restaurant was full and the bar area was half empty... no clue why. \n\nIt's 4-7 PM M-F, and 9 PM - close daily. We ordered a disgusting amount of food and 2 22 oz drinks, all for $40 with tax and tip. Cocktails start at just $3.25 (I believe our 22 oz backporch strawberry lemonades were $4.25), and food was priced from $2-$6. \n\nHot link ($1.95) \nRiblets ($5.95)\nGumbo ($4.95)\nIrish Fries ($2.95)\nSliders (2 for $3.95)\n\nThe winner for me was the sliders (your choice of pork brisket or chicken!), but the irish fries were a nice surprise - huge platter of yummy skinny fries topped with cheese and sour cream and other goodies. The gumbo was AWFUL (my family is from NOLA so I'm picky!). Overall great food, great drinks, great prices. We can finally afford to eat at Lucille's more often !
