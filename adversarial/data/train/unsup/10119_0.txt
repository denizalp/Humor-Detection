Thanks To Dustin the manager at Five Guys for embarrassing me I was paying with a 100 dollar bill after holding it in the air yelling we have a 100 he then advised me that they didn't take bills that size anymore. So my husband and I left if you don't take large cash bills then you should post it somewhere for the public to see next never embarrass the customer
