My \"new\" husband and I went to Owen's for brunch the day after our wedding. I absolutely loved my bagel and got a few bites of Joe's that were fantastic as well. I love the location, the staff, the funky decorations, and the music they play in the joint. It is definitely worth giving a try... from this point forward I will drive past the major bagel chain on South Blvd. that I've been known to frequent to support this awesomely delicious local restaurant!
