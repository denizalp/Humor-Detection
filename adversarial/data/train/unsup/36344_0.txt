Been ordering pizza from Stumpy's for some time now, and its pretty darn tasty.  I am super picky about pizza and my least favorite part of pizza is the sauce.. yeah, yeah, I know-weird... but anyways..  When I order pizza I always as for easy sauce and very few places actually give me easy sauce.  Stumpy's however, always listens.. which is greatly appreciated.  The pizza is always ready prompt and piping hot and fresh and they very frequently have coupons available which is an added bonus to their already reasonable prices!  Love this mom and pop!
