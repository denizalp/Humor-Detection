I recently ventured into Old Town Cycles looking for nothing in particular. I found a really cool S-Works rigid mountain frameset.  I spent 10-15 minutes checking it out, trying to decide if it was big enough for me. That was on a Thursday; I came back on Saturday, looked at it for another 15 minutes or so, then bought it.\n\nDuring this time, I was able to witness Josh--the owner--interacting with a variety of customers with various needs.  I was really impressed with his customer service and quick repair\/service work that he performed for people while they waited.\n\nThe store is very small, and you won't find any new bikes for sale here.  But if you need a light, lock, or bag...or need a brake adjusted in just a minute or two, this is a great place to come.
