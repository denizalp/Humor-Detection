The last time I was in Vegas, I ate at Spago with my family so we figured we'd keep the tradition going.\n\nOn our last night in Vegas, we couldn't figure out where to eat and when we walked by here we knew we had to eat here. My sister checked out the menu outside before confirming my pick. \n\nWe were seated inside which was good because I had zero desire to sit outside because it was too noisy.\n\nOur server was nice. I didn't catch his name, but it was the Asian guy who was a little short. He was suggesting what we should order so we went with his recommendations.\n\nI got the Caesar salad because that's my favorite.My sister got the Baby Iceberg salad and my other sister got the Prosciutto pizza. We also shared a pasta plate, but I can't remember the name of the dish. Before that, we started off with the calamari for appetizer. It was delicious.\n\nWe still had a bit of room for dessert so we ordered a couple things. First was the Warm Vanilla Beignets which comes with an order of 6. We also got the Chocolate Souffle because we figured why the hell not.I LOVE LOVE LOVE the beignet. I almost died. It has my favorite thing inside..........NUTELLA. They won my heart with that one. The souffle was good, but the shock of the nutella wouldn't escape me.\n\nIt was such a great meal. We went up to our room right after to nurse our food baby. \nI don't remember them, but I'm sure I had great dreams that night.
