I give 1 review because the cashier was totally rude. It looked like she hated her job and when I asked her about a few items behind her counter she seemed so inpatient. When I was paying with my card I was about to slide it through the card machine and said \"wait!\" I waited and held my card out and she kept repeating herself even when I wasn't even doing anything but waiting. She started talking under her breathe and I thought she was just overall rude. Please tell associate: 10344 to smile a little also.
