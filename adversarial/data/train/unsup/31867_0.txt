VALUE. That's what this place is about. Best pizza and wings I ever had? Probably not. No matter. I usually get their special - wings, pizza, and a drink. I can never finish that. Their \"serious slice\" is pretty damn serious. Giant slice off a giant pizza. That should be a meal in itself but I still get the wings anyway. I usually get that for lunch so it becomes lunch AND dinner basically. Can't beat that with a stick or a 2 by 4. That's all I ever had here. I'm not someone who eats lot's of pizza and often but it's good to have a place like this when you need a quick meal in a pinch. Service is usually decent. Lotsa parking since it's in a mall with Chase Bank, Autozone, CVS PHarmacy, and Zipp's.
