They are next to the Scott's Generations Restaurant! We had trouble finding it cause they don't have a big sign out front.  I ordered the Cafe Churro hot and it was excellent!  It is what coffee should be. So incredibly delicious.  My hubby ordered the Tres Chocolate cold non-coffee drink and it was also wonderful.  Perfect for a hot day.  I just wish they had one closer to me in Mesa cause I'd go everyday!  So glad they're in az though!!  :)
