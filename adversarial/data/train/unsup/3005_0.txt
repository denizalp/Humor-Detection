so the night before we had a big ole party and i got pretty trashed. woke up with the worst hangover ever i think, probably had slight alcohol poisoning. but everyone wanted a nice fancy brunch. so we go to Paris buffet. while standing in line i had to run to the cafe across the way a few times to puke in their bathroom. \n\nbut when we get in I'm in a hell like heaven. everything was so good! and believe me, i tried EVERYTHING. and between bits of everything, i would have to dash to the bathroom and throw up. but it was worth it, the food was sooooo good. i literally had a little bit of everything. \n\nsadly, I've yet to make it back while healthy. too many other Vegas buffets to try to start repeating. but one day, it will be mine.
