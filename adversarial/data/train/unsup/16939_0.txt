Geno's deserves 3.5 stars... \n\nI discovered this place when I had to go over to ASU to use their library. It was late (after 10:00 pm) and they were open. Started with the large steak with onions, mushrooms and mayo, hold the American cheese (I figured I'd had enough cholesterol for that day). I added my own salt and pepper. It was great! I've been back several times for a number of different sandwiches.\n\nThe cheesesteaks are excellent. If you want a REAL Philly cheesesteak, they have Cheez Whiz!! The cold cuts sandwiches are average. The quality of the cold cuts is excellent (they use Boar's Head meats). It's just that nothing about these sandwiches stands out. They also have chicken (if you don't eat beef). If you're a vegetarian (Indian word for \"lousy hunter\"), they have salads. I'm partial to the Greek Salad.\n\nService was good. The drinks are Coca-Cola products and they always have a nosh at the register. The last time, they got me with brownies (@ $2 EACH!!). The time before that it was Drake's yodels (again, $2 EACH). I'm starting to see a pattern here... (LOL!!)\n\nThe quality of the cheesesteaks should raise Geno's ranking to 3.5 stars. How about it, Yelp? Will you let me give them another 1\/2 star?
