Unbelievable food and excellent 5 star service. First time trying oysters Rockefeller, delicious! Loved the bib salad, tried the steak tartare but it's not my thing, my companion raved about it. Had the ny strip and lamb for dinner with the brussel sprouts and crispy potatoes, took more than half home for leftovers! Highly recommend the old fashioned cocktail and wine list. Finished the meal with espresso and a slice of the delicious creme brulee cheesecake. Definitely returning soon!
