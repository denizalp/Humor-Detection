This place was great! Didn't really know what to expect going in but the place was really nice, I dug the atmosphere. But the best thing had to be the Phó, I got the seafood Phó with beef broth and it was excellent. Would 100% go back & planning on it. The service wasn't bad at all either. Nice people. Just a weird location though, but it's Vegas what do you expect?
