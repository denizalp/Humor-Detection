My wife and I have had brunch here more than a few times. Normally the food is good and the service if mostly good.  Today however was a different story! First the table was not wiped when we sat down. I normally let stuff like that go so I wiped it off myself. Next the waitress spilled cream all over the table. No biggie, stuff happens. Next, she brought our iced water and coffee, the water mugs were filthy!  I sent them back. Our coffee cups were empty soon and I had to ask for a refill, when she came back mine was somewhere between luke- warm and cold.  The manager and five servers were standing within 20 feet of me, I waved and waved not one came.  I tried again and finally a server came, I asked for the manager.  I told him we were having a lack-luster experience this morning and then told him I can not tolerate cold coffee.  He smirked, did not apologize and said he would send us more coffee.  They did, mine was so hot it scaled my tongue.  I guess they heated it in the microwave. There were flies buzzing around our table and others during all this.  Finally it was time to leave, I put a $25 gift card and a credit card in the folder, when the waitress brought it back, no credit card.  I was looking all around for it and another waitress came up and said excuse me sir, is this yours?  It had been left in the machine. Needless to say we will not be returning to the CKF anytime soon.  Maybe KFC would be better..... For the manger, don't smirk at your customers when they complain in a civilized manner.  Offer your sincere apology and ask if there is anything you can do to make it right.  This may give them pause to think about coming back...
