Sorry, not impressed! During the consultation, was told I needed to come back, six months later to do simple Lopo during breast augmentation ! I knew better!!! Could be done at same time! I found the perfect Dr. to preform this surgery today!!! (Do your research)Plus, his quote was over $2000 more! Not even impressed by his photos!\n\nUpdate, I COMPLETELY STAND by what I said!! This Dr. Is in this for the money!!! If his before and after photos do not want to make you run, his prices will..  Oh, btw, I went to a well known Scottsdale plastic surgeon.\nYou should not have to pay extra for surgi room.. \nSecond, I did have liposuction at same time as implants.. This quack told me I have to come back six months later. WHY, I am  already under anesthesia.
