Really, really good fried chicken.  Mini Koo Koo bites were better than the steak probably because it was all dark meat.  Plus I think there was a bit of curry seasoning on there.  Light and crispy, I'd rather eat these watching a movie than popcorn!  \n\nWe ordered the rice bowl with pork as well and it was super tiny.   Very tasty but very small.  On the other hand the chicken steak was very large!  So sharing between the two was about right.   \n\nNix the strawberry shake....next time we'll do milk tea. \n\nThe rice dish took no time but the fried goodies took about 15-20 mins.  Next time we'll call ahead for takeout.
