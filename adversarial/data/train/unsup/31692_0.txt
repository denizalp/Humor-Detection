I am very happy with the service that Flash Plumbing did for us recently.  Mike, our technician, was on-time, friendly and informative.  He did what he needed to do, kept us updated throughout his visit about what he was doing and why, and recommended maintenance for the future without any hard sales pitch.\n\nOne of the best parts of the visit would have to be Mike explaining why their company was different and how proud he was to work for them, not focusing on commission or over selling, but rather on treating people right knowing that it would come back three fold when they do. Its great to hear someone see themselves as helping people and not just collecting a paycheck.\n\nI will definitely refer family and friends to Flash Plumbing and plan to have them visit routinely going forward thanks to this first visit success and the representative they sent out.  2 thumbs up!!
