Please be advised if your having a surgery there and you have not met your deducible they will request up front 50% of the doctors surgery cost.  They claim it's their policy, however when asked for a copy it has yet to be provided.  I ended up paying 20% of the 1050.00 however still fighting it as there was not any disclosure when making an appointment.  If you get the billing department and speak to an Angela go right to her supervisor Kimberlee or Mary Lou Irwin - she is the head of billing.  The frontline threatened to cancel my surgery until I could pay and didn't want to work with me!  So if you can put up with the billing the surgeon was great!  I will be filing a complaint on how they handled me from a billing perspective and hope my surgery goes well!
