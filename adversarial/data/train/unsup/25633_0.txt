We went there on 03\/04\/2016 around 4:30.  We were greeted by a very friendly young woman; she was the best part of the experience.  The ribs were very dry and the sides were very small. You will not get great value here.  We were the only people in the restaurant and parking was still a problem here.  We only saw two spots total  in their lot, one of which was a handicap spot.  We did find parking on a side street, but not real convenient.  The friendly service is probably not enough to get us back for another visit.
