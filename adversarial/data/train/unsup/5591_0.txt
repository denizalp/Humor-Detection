If you want a generous portion of mahi in a semi-fast food environment for a great price, come check this place out. I was torn between the tacos versus the mahi plate but decided on the blackened mahi and hubs got the macadamia crusted mahi. \n\nI loved my food! Nothing makes me happier than good food and coconut's fish cafe made me happy. \n\nThe coleslaw wasn't your typical coleslaw. I don't know if it was the cabbage but I almost tasted a hint of wasabi. It was delish.\n\nLove the fact it comes with brown rice too. Healthy and tasty. Best of both worlds!\n\nOh, don't forget to try their coconut shrimp. I could eat them by the platter full. So good!
