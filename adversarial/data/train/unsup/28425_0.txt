Fantastic opportunity to star gaze through a huge telescope in a beautiful observatory. Good guide explained facts in an understandable way. Clear night we were able to see Earth's moon, planets and even other moons. The building could use restoration. It is a real treasure and something not to be missed. My college age children also enjoyed. Tour lasted over 2 hours with lots of steps. Absolutely fantastic!
