Battista's Hole In The Wall celebrates the fact that they have been operating at the same location since 1970. In that regard it has established itself as a destination for authentic Italian food for locals and tourists alike. For many it may provide a nostalgic look and feel of old Vegas. However, beyond that their entr√©e's, while not bad, offer in my estimation poor \"value to money\" in regards to price and portion. If you want to visit a restaurant with an old Vegas feel and has good \"value to money\" I would recommend the Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge. And while there are many fine Italian restaurants in Las Vegas, I would recommend Nora's Italian Cuisine for good Italian food.
