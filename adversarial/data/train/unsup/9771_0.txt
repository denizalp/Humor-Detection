This place is solid. First impression was superb! So glad we made that spontaneous u-turn to go to Novita for Italian food tonight!\n\nMy friend and I were on our way to Alice Fazooli's and we noticed this new restaurant what used to be Fire & Ice. Odd location but I think it is a great idea that they set themselves away from all the big chain competitions on Hwy 7 and East Beaver Creek! Did a quick check on Yelp - 4 stars with 5 reviews - Awesome, let's check it out :D\n\nYou can still smell the fresh furnished wood right when you walk in... that's how new this place is lol. The atmosphere is bright, clean and welcoming! I love their open kitchen concept. There are plenty of space, I'm sure it will be great for large groups!\n\nWe shared the following:\n\nPortobello mushrooms - This dish was really appetizing! The orange peppers were sweet, sauce was not overwhelming, and chef gave us a generous amount of goat cheese that paired so well with the mushrooms (you're the best!). I'd order this again!\n\nRisotto with scallop, shrimp, pesto, spinach - It was SO creamy and good. The rice was cooked perfectly. Also, very generous amount of seafood, and they tasted really fresh! I love a good risotto... I anticipate to try the lobster risotto next time!\n\nI'm very happy that such a fine Italian restaurant opened in Markham :D Food is hot and fresh, portions are big, service is attentive, and price is very reasonble :D The only con I had tonight was the bread, it was a bit too soft and plain for my liking. I like the rustic (chewy) or aromatic types of bread... ex. Olive bread! But that's just me :p\n\nHappy hour is from 3-5pm Monday to Friday... discounts on cocktails and appetizers!\n\nI would highly recommend this place. Can't wait to plan my next event here! Keep up the good work :)
