I live in the neighborhood and have been eating here for years. (Both take out and dine in). I don't know if they have new cooks or what, but the quality of the food has slowly gone down hill in the last (6) months to the point I don't think we'll eat there again. The refried beans WERE FROM A CAN. I know homemade versus canned and these are canned. The Cheese Crisp was really lacking and very oily. The shredded beef taco had a lot of fat on the beef. This place used to serve really good Mexican food. Not so anymore. We're going back to Sylvia's La Canasta or Macayo's. Much better food, and not from a can.
