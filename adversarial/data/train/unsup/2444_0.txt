Monta is me and my boyfriends favorite ramen place. We love it so much we couldn't find a better place here, LA, or in San Diego! We love it so much that we actually came here for our first date! I got so excited when I heard that they're opening up a second location. My boyfriend was recording on this side of town so we decided to go in after! It was next to a Denny's so it's pretty easy to find. \n\nThe place is small, just like Monta on Spring Mountain but it is bigger than it at the same time. But you don't feel as crowded in there. I'd say a table or two more. But then again I can't really complain because that's traditional in Japan. Their menu is actually bigger than Monta on Spring Mountain's!!! More ramen choices (but who needs it?) and more appetizers! We decided to get the ramen this time and next time, we're going to try all the new appetizers! I got miso with butter. Their miso is my favorite. It's also only $6.95... I think I spend more on myself at Mcdonalds!!! And the butter makes it creamier. It's my favorite ramen ever! I'll always be a Monta customer. I can't wait to come back for appetizers!!! \n\nI love the items they put on the side as well. They have garlic, ginger, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic powder, and more! You put in as much as you want too so it's not too salty or saltless. \n\nI seriously appreciate the owner for Monta. He owns my favorite ramen place and also my favorite sushi place Goyemon! \n\nTip: I love taking the leftover broth home and putting it in my food (like top ramen or udon.) Sooo good!
