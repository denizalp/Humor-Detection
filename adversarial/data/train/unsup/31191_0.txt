Aside from the map showing a wrong location, everything about this restaurant was right. The pesto they serve with the complimentary bread was to die for. It was so good I slathered it with my flatbread order of Prosciutto Crudo. They serve brunch on weekends (both Saturday & Sunday) until 3pm which is ideal when you don't like time constraints in the weekend mornings (meaning noon or after). The $5 mimosa was in a huge wine glass instead of a slender champagne flute. Service was fast & good even when it seemed crowded.
