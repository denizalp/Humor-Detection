I went to Gotta Yoga for my ever yoga class today, and I'll definitely be back! The beginners class with Emily was really fun, and she talked the class through all of the poses and demonstrated them before we gave it a try, which I thought was very helpful. I was surprised at how easy it was to start to pick up the moves! The studio itself is beautiful and everyone was very welcoming of a first-timer.
