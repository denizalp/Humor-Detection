Men of Steele is the newest male review show to hit the Las Vegas strip and is created by London Steele, the character played by Matthew Mcconaughey in the film Magic Mike.\n\nLet me start off by saying that I am not at all a fan of male strippers, I usually prefer to watch women, so honestly going into this, I had low expectations. I went with a girlfriend and I upgraded our seats to the front row \"grab section\".  This upgrade came with two drinks (YES!).\n\nWalking in the theater was A LOT more intimate than I had imagined. Two tables with four chairs each on two sides of the aisles, VIP booths scattered on the edges and a tiny stage with stairs coming down to the floor.  \n\nThen the show began....\n\nIt started off with some footage of Mr. Steele (the creator) with the infamous Channing Tatum back in the day, appearing to be on a stage about to dance. Then Mr. Steel himself comes out! Turns out he's the host of the show. WHAT?!\n\nThe lights dim, smoke spews out and the dancing starts, which for the most part is pretty good. In my opinion the choreography spacing and execution could be worked on, but hey, this is only their second week open. The guys are ripped, sexy AND there were a variety of them (Thank you Mr. Steele since not everyone has the same taste)! They made eye contact a couple of times, made me feel sexy, and there was A LOT of audience interaction. No, not just ONE girl was brought on stage, at least 4 were! Additionally, the guys came off the stage a few times to get personal. I should also mention that I received a ripped off wife beater mens tank thrown in my face which, yes, I kept. Lol. It was SO MUCH FUN!! \n\nMy one question is, why doesn't anyone know about this show? \n\nOverall, I WILL go back to see this show again, not even necessarily to celebrate anything.
