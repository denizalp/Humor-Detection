Okay, so I've been back since and I've changed my mind. The food is still amazing, and the last time I went there, I got a different server and the service was wonderful... And there's always a ton of people who aren't the servers running around and making sure your happy. I had an endlessly full water cup, which was awesome cause it was seriously hot. Phoenix, man.\n\nAnyway, I had the fish on special and it was peeeerfect. On top of some carrots that could use a little bit more cooking, but I think it had beets in it? As a russian, it's nice to see beets. I like beets. Love them. (God, I really hope it was beets!)\n\nSeriously, they got their game in order. Go Gallo (pronounced Ga-yo). White cock. Hilarious! :)
