This place is close and the ambiance is super chill! We came while someone was playing live music inside and could hear it from the patio. The food here is not especially great and definitely not cheap, but the beer is good! \n\nWe got the fish and chips (which was underwhelming as the fries were not hot enough, and the batter was too thick, but salad was a nice touch) and the chicken wings (which were nice and meaty, though a little over done and definitely needed some kind of seasoning...also only 6 for 14$ seems quite steep, but maybe my \"suburbs\" is showing).\n\nThe best part is the patio and the clientele. I LOVE bars with older couples, and a friendly one that was leaving recommended good beer and offered kind conversation. Also, patio is nicely shaded, and GREAT FOR PEOPLE WATCHING (which is so lovely on a street like Roncesvalles). \n\nWould come back for drinks, but maybe not for food.
