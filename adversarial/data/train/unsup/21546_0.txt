I don't even like buffets, but I can't really see how anyone could complain about a $9.99 taco bar on steroids! Throw in some fresh pico and guac and you've got a deal that puts that Speedy Gonzalez plate to shame!\n\nWe were staying on the strip and in need of a quick lunch. I remembered Jessie B's buffet find of the week, and I had my husband sold at buff... \n\nThe restaurant is big and clean. We were seated promptly, and from there, it was all corn tortillas and smiles. First, I was actually impressed that they still bring out a basket of chips, two salsas and bean dip when you are going for the buffet. I half expected them to withhold these treats from the gluttonous buffet eaters! \n\nThe buffet offers cheese enchiladas ready to snap up, or they will roll you up beef or chicken with either a red or green sauce on top. For the tacos, they have small, corn tortillas that they double up and fill with carne asada, chicken or ground beef, plus cilantro and onions. You can also get a crispy taco shell. Then there is a little fixins bar with pico, guac, lettuce, cheese, jalapenos, and so on. My only complaint is that perhaps the food could have been a tad warmer, but everything tasted great, especially for a $9.99 buffet! I was actually very impressed with the guacamole. You can tell from the partially smashed avocados that it is made fresh. I actually went back just for a plate of it and some pico. I am a lady who loves her vegetables. \n\nEqually impressive was the service. You generally don't expect much service at a buffet, but our water glasses were never less than half empty! That alone is better than most of the magic tricks in Vegas, and they have a table side credit card machine, which is an unexpected, but appreciated convenience. \n\nThis was our first trip, but I am sure it won't be our last! Quick, good value and tasty is a winning trifecta we are unable to resist!
