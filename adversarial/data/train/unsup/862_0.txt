Food was great, very friendly staff (pretty sure it's the owner that is there the last couple of times I went there.  My only issue is that a gal was sweeping up the dining area, and instead of whisking the dirt and debris into a dust pan and throwing it away, she swept everything out the door.  \n\nThis valley is already dirty enough without adding to it, and if this is the way they clean, well just kind of makes me wonder about the kitchen..
