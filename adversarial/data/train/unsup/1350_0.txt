This place has been for many years now. Obviously, many people must love it. I can't say that I love it.  But, I like it.\nA few years ago, I was here for lunch and got some type of creamy item. I got food poisoning .I never wanted to go back.\nHowever, I came here with my friend for lunch because, she wanted to go here.\nSo this time it was a lovely experience. I got the fish tacos ,nothing creamy. They were very good!! Very good. My friend got some combo dish with lots of sauces on top. But, she was totally healthy after eating it. She thought it was divine. The chips and salsa or also very good.\n\nThe service was great. The manager even came over and talk to us. We were sitting in front of the fireplace and he even turned it on for us. With the rain and cold outside it was so nice and comfortable. So I'm going to say, that I do  like Arriba's, And that I  would definitely return.\nThe restaurant is beautifully decorated with lots of colorful paint. As well as cool artwork.\nLots of parking all the way around the building
