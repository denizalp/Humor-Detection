I don't want to like this place.  It looks as if it was decorated by some aging Boomer who still pours over Rolling Stone and can't seem to grasp the fact that his ponytail no longer looks cool since he went bald, gained 50 lbs and aged 40 years.  Think almost unrecognizable, bad portraits of '60s and '70s rock stars and LOUD classic rock.\n\nBut I do like it.  No, scratch that.  I love the place.  Well, not the place, exactly.  The food.  Dave's subs are the best in Cleveland.  There is enough meat, but not too much.  There are plenty of really interesting and well balanced flavors in their signature subs.  The bread and ingredients are very fresh.  The salads are fresh and contain a good amount of healthy, delicious toppings.\n\nAnd Dave's Cosmic Sauce.  Have mercy.  The sauce is an oil based dressing with a mind blowing combination of herbs, spices, and perhaps cheese?  Who cares, it's delicious.\n\nSo I indulge the Boomers their flashback and get take out.
