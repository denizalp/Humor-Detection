I listen to KTAR in the mornings because the AM stations are at \nlower power over night and reception in Casa Grande is very weak,\nor non existent. Now my point. Jim Sharpe is terrible, his two favorite words are \" you know\" .  He constantly uses the very professional \"Ah\",\nand he has this annoying SNIF he does at the end of a sentence, if it's even a sentence at all . He's one of the Worst announcers I've ever heard. He was the same way on KFYI am 550. \n   Suggestion: FIRE him and hire a professional, he's such a turn off, \nI usually TURN OFF your station and just play a music station, even though I prefer news and talk, this Sharpe guy makes me want to Barf !
