Nice clean casino and shops area with great ambiance of Italy !!!  The rooms are elegant and the service upscale at a bit of a price - but so is gambling anywhere, so enjoy it. The open sky look and ambiance of the Shops area and Gondola rides are right out of Disney Pirates ride. Very much has lasting magic !!!
