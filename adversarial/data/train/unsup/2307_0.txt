I recently spent a week trying classes at Redemption, and I'm a fan. It's basically three boutique gyms in one: a spin studio, a boxing gym, and an interval cardio\/strength concept similar to Orange Theory. The facility is clean and everyone from instructors to staff are friendly and have positive attitudes. After taking 6 classes in 7 days, I will be recommending it to others!\n\nCLASSES:\nREP- intervals with the treadmill and floor\/weight work. I especially love that they have dynamic treadmills for different training moves, and the two instructors I had for this class were both great about demonstrating movements I was unfamiliar with.\nRIDE- I am familiar with their lead spin instructor from another gym. The bikes here are a little different than elsewhere and require more adjustments, but I do like the actual studio, with great sound and effective fans. Shoes can be rented, staff are great about helping with setup.\nBOOTY BOXING- this was a surprisingly fun workout, with blocks of bag work and rounds of barre-style band work. Room setup is kind of difficult to see the instructor at times, but she was great about moving around the room and demonstrating moves. Rent or buy wraps ($20) and gloves ($45?), required for all classes.\n\nFACILITY:\nSuper clean. Plenty of lockers (with built in locks!), water bottle refill station, reserved parking around back of building. Again, I can't emphasize how positive and friendly everyone was! Customer service staff are super sweet, and within a couple days they were greeting me by name- always a great touch!\n\nNo matter what workout I took, they were all challenging. I like the online schedule (similar to Cyclebar's platform) and the option to choose between monthly plans or class packages. I already belong to way too many gyms but this is one I hope to return to when my schedule allows.
