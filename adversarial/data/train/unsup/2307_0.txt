Almost a 5. The only flaw. They could have more selection. But all items are carefully curated. When you shop at a place like this.  Think shopping an outfit.  Or looking for that special item that won't be seen on a mannequin in the mall.  \nQuite a few local Canadian designers at reasonable designer prices. \nWonderful accessory pieces also in a variety of areas, jewellery, leather goods, and novelty items. \n\nBoutique service and comfortable store.  Shop local.
