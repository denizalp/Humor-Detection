I am an avid Spartan\/OCR racer and have been looking for a place to practice obstacles. Went with my son for the first time and it was great. They ran us through a fun but challenging obstacle course and then practiced on a few of the obstacles that give me a hard time. The staff were very helpful and the people we were working out with were great. If you are looking for a place to practice for OCR races, I would highly recommend it.
