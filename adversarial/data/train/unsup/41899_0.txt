This place is undeniably fun and great place to meet people in Vegas. The bar is a riot and you can meet a lot of people. The food is fair to possibly good. The service is FUN which is a plus, rude and witty. Beware of the bartender made hats!   This a great place to grab a quick dinner bite and run to the next hotel.
