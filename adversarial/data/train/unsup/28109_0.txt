I called this office on a whim, after another office flaked on me same day. I needed to be seen right away as I have an impacted wisdom tooth that is killing me. Thank God they take my insurance because I was tired of calling around town to find another place to go. Mr. Nyguen is a friendly dentist. He immediately had a member of his staff take an X-ray of my mouth, and then he was in to see me within 10 mins or so. He looks inside, tells me about the tooth, tells me what's causing my pain, and gets me the referral that I need to see an oral surgeon. Unfortunately I have to go elsewhere to get the tooth removed, but that's okay for now. I was there for 30 mins total and he also gave me a prescription for the pain. Thank you for seeing me on such short notice! His staff is friendly as well, and his office was easy to find.
