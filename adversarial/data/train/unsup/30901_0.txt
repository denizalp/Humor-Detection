I have been coming to Cheesecake Factory on occasion for years and, as far as chains go, it's not bad. I appreciate that they've made an effort to use healthier ingredients and offer lower calorie options. The ambiance is quite loud, but it does say factory in the name and the ceilings are high. It is old world style decor and somewhat darker inside. It tends to be clean, but I've gotten sticky menus on occasion which I do not like at all. The menus are books and probably hard to keep up with when they're busy, which they are often. \n\nI typically enjoy my food here. It is consistent. You always know what you're getting. The food and beverage selections are vast. The service is usually good. The portions have shrunk over the years. This probably had to do with having to list calorie counts in the menu. They'd be astronomical otherwise. What I don't understand is why the prices are so dang high. The value is poor. We dine and drink out frequently, but we don't come here often because of the bill at the end. You can get great food elsewhere for much better prices and service overall.
