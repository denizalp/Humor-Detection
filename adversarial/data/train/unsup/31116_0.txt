I really have to say this place and Vanna and Tom are amazing. Really fun place and fun atmosphere. I have to commend the attention to detail.. In that they stop taking appointments at 6 PM. I called at like 5:45.. And live in the area.. (And the other nail salons make too many mistakes).. So Im trying to find a new spot.. So I called and Vanna said she would take me .. And make time for me, just to come down. I showed up a little after 6.. And Vanna already had rose petal filled water waiting for me... And still agreed to make sure I could get my gel nails and French tip toes done...I was so appreciative. She did my toes, and Tom did my nails.. (I loved this because I was in and out within an hour.. Which was great because I hate how long maintenance can take....\nThe entire time the 3 of us had such an enjoyable and entertaining conversation. Vanna was so amazing and sweet.. Really goes above and beyond, something that's rare in most other salons and Tom was very personable and awesome as well. \n\nI couldn't recommend ANY more!!
