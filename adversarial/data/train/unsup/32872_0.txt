I went here mainly because I'm not a fan of the bland, tasteless chicken and disgusting sauce at Raising Cane's, and sure enough PDQ actually had good food.\n\nThe breading on the chicken is nice and crispy and the homemade ranch had a bit of spiciness that I enjoyed. The fries are also quite good. Even though they were really busy service was friendly and incredibly fast.\n\nLooking forward to making this my go to place when I'm in the mood for chicken.
