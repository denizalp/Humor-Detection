Adrin was great and super helpful . Awsome professional only way to describe him. My boy was playing a national tournament and i wanted some one to hit with him before the tournament and get used to the environment.He went out of way to do it for us.  I had just connected with him a day before  and  arranged things for us. If you are travelling for for tournament  and want to hit with he is absolutely the right person..He has a very good network , connect me to other tennis professionals and help restring my sons racket before the tournament   Thank You Adrin
