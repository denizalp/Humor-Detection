I'm a little shy when it comes to going to events where I don't really know anyone. After getting my drink tokens I made a beeline to the bar for a glass of wine and with the help of BINGO I was chatting up a storm with everyone I encountered. Folks sang to me -as a duet no less-, talked like an Australian and told me to sit my butt down and eat some wonderful appetizers with them. By the end of the night I met some great folks (the highlight was finally meeting Rand H.) I loved just relaxing with a glass of wine and girl talk with some amazing ladies I had never met before but can't wait to hear updates on their lives =)\n\nOutback has always had their mushrooms on their \"secret menu\" so we always order them when we come in, they are my favorite, in a close second was the Margarita Flatbread, \n\nI love that Lindsey recognized me when I walked in and mentioned me being there for my second Elite event, she's so sweet!
