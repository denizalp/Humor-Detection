Do you like big checks and hype...then this is the place for you. I have heard tons of great things about this restaurant but at the end of dinner I was really let down. \n\nThings I liked: \nRock Shrimp Tempura with creamy spicy sauce \nMiso Cod \nFresh Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno \n\nThings I didn't like: \nThe waitress was not very friendly. She informed us that our sushi dishes would come out last...guess what?  The sushi came out second...of course, we ate the sushi and our waitress came up to our table and asked if we wanted more food...she had no idea that we didn't even get our warm food. Please dont  tell us our meal must end  with cold sushi and then the food runners can not even get it right. When you are paying this much for dinner, you expect to get treated with some love. \n\nThe sushi rolls were extremely fishy too. My friends told me that it is the seaweed that they use...all I know is that I wanted to gag. \n\nAlso we asked for two orders of the Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno and they put both orders on one plate. That is fine but we received 11 pieces...so does that mean when you get one order you only get 5.5 pieces? The math does not add up. My friends told me that they noticed that they have been shorted before. Wow and my friends still like this place...Oh yeah expense account!!!\n\nSmall Dishes with Big Prices!!!   If you are on an expense account then I recommend...go for it...run up the bill and try everything. If you are paying for it out of your pocket, then I would save my money for my kids college fund!!!
