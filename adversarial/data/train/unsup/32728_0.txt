A tasty pizza place right in the center of Glendale.  Come early since this place is pretty small. During the winter months, the wait can take up to an hour on the weekend. The wait is worth it though.  Try the white ricotta pizza and the meat pizza. Both are delicious and you won't leave hungry. The only reason why I didn't give this review 5 stars is because,  the restaurant is pretty small and tight so, you don't have a lot of wiggle room.
