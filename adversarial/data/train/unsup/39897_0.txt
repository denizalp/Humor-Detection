Had my second visit in a couple of years last week.\n\nSeems like some of the bigger-name games (Galaga, WPT Pinball) have been removed and that there are more machines broken.   I know you can only ask for so much for a place that must be incredibly hard for the upkeep of its goods.\n\nStill, a VERY fun place to go to.  It's heavy on nostalgia, but it really is fun to play these pinball games.  Definitely one of the most inexpensive places to have some fun in Las Vegas.
