This is the only Superstore I go to, therefore it makes reviewing a little hard because there isn't anything to compare it to. Superstore is like any other grocery store, it has food and any other essentials you may be looking for. Of course it is packed on Saturday mornings, which makes paying for food a nice long wait, and yet parking is still convenient enough. If you go in the afternoon during the weekend you likely won't find what you are looking for. \n\nThe added perks of this location: the Joe Fresh section. Other Superstores may have the clothing there as well, but I wouldn't know. I love the selection, the clothes is cute, comfortable, and affordable. The other bonuses to this location is convenience. It's right off Deerfoot making it easy to get to. Since it's in a shopping complex it makes it easy to run over to Costco, IKEA, Best Buy, and a variety of other stores. \n\nThere's plenty of places you can go to get groceries, this place is a pretty good option.
