We managed to sneak in a meal between brunch and dinner. Brunner? Given our tight schedule, this was going to be our only chance to have poutine.  Poutineville ended up being a wise choice.\n\nWe only tried a small \"la poutineville\". Don't let the size fool you though. This is still a very hearty dish that was good enough for the two of us. This poutine, I am guessing, is the original version. It was a pretty simple dish with braised beef, mozzarella cheese and potatoes and red wine sauce. I was floored by how good the flavors and textures were - especially the potatoes which had an amazing crispiness on the outside and softness inside. You could just serve me those potatoes in that beefy flavor and I'd be a happy customer.\n\nPoutineville has a quirky set up and were playing 70s disco the whole time we were there. The waitstaff were much older than what I usually see at restaurants, but they looked like they partied it up in the 70s. It seemed like a place that was stuck in that era, which was kind of funny and charming in its own way.\n\nThey had many different kinds of poutine including a make-your-own option but since it was my first time, I wanted to try the original. Is this the standard for good poutine? I don't know but I sure as hell would be okay if it was.
