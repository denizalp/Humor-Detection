I wish there were more stars for this adoption shelter!\n\nI just adopted a kitten from the adoption shelter. The animals are so well taken care of and loved. We were free to walk around anywhere we wanted, to take the kittens out of the cages, and to take our time in chosing a pet. Out adoption counselor, James was amazing! He was very knowledgable and you could tell he was geninuely excited for us, about the shelter, and a real animal lover.\n\nThey made the adoption so easy and gave us so many free items to support our adoption. We were given free pet care for 30 days, free toys, a free towel, the kitten was microchipped with a lifetime membership in case he was lost, free bag of Science Diet, a picture of us two, and of the adoption fee was extremely reasonable. That day they even had a special of 50% off if you donated items to the troops.\n\nNot to mention, it is a no-kill shelter. My kitten was taken in by them from the Maricopa animal shelter because it was about to be put down. Luckily they saved him and he is so adorable, has no behavior issues, and is a healthy kitten.\n\nI highly recommend this place. You will have a wonderful experience!
