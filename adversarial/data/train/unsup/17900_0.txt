BRILLIANCE. Pure brilliance. Downright pure brilliance. Brilliance so bright that you can't even look your roasted beets and avocado toast in the eye. You know how this joint works. You've heard the rants; you've heard the raves, but you should hear them again. Or maybe you haven't. Four chefs in one building just kinda experimenting and learning how to make food; then in eighteen months they'll leave for their own restaurant and to make way for a new chef. Providing people liked them and they were successful. Chances are, with this kind of buzz and hype flying around about Smallman Galley alone, any chef that enters within it's support will succeed. \n\nFirst off, I ordered some toast from, I'll let you guess, Josephine's Toast. Avocado toast. That alone was worthy of five stars. I would totally go to a brick and mortar House of Toast by Josephine. \n\nProvision lured me in with their Roasted Beets, because I'd never had anything like that before. Slabs of beets sitting in preserved lemon jam, a pile of crisp watercress sprinkled with crunchy quinoa granola, and roasted mushrooms and cashews tossed over the whole mess. This amazing mix was well worth the try even if it was by far not my favorite thing I've eaten. \n\nThe BAD BAD problem here is that an hour and a half drive for a meal is generally not justifiable. Which is what I'll have to do multiple times in order to try several dishes from every single chef that ever walks through these doors.
