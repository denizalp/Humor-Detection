This has been our go to place for Chinese food, mostly because we support family run businesses, and because it's good. The whole family is friendly, and welcoming, and their various dishes have been hits. My favorites have been their Szechuan spicy tofu, Beef Broccoli, and their beef fried rice. They have one of the better tasting Hot and Sour soups in the area, and their steamed dumplings are tasty, filled with a ground pork mixture, and if it's not pork, it's still tasty!\n\nMost of our orders are take out, but they do offer free delivery. Getting into and out of the parking lot can be tricky, but it's worth it.
