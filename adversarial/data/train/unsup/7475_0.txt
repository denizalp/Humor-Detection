My main thought:\nIf you go here, get the french toast.\n\nI run past this restaurant frequently and I always see people eating thick, decadent pieces of french toast, draped sugary toppings and topped with a mountain of whipped cream.  I love whipped cream, if socially acceptable, I would use it as salad dressing.  So, in retrospect, I should have ordered what I knew would come with whipped cream, and therefore, be fantastic.\n\nBut, I was an hour away from attending my daughter's preschool graduation, where I knew there would be cupcakes and cookies and ice cream (and maybe even whipped cream), so I wanted something semi-light and semi-healthy.  \n\nI was pleased to see an eggwhite omelet on the menu (it makes for easy ordering) and it sounded tasty - paired with avocado, tomato and cilantro, three foods that I adore.\n\nWe sat outside on a beautiful day.  As far as environment goes, I give this place 5 stars. It is great for people watching and you can SIT AT A BAR! for breakfast.  We opted for an outside table, right next to a girl who was eating breakfast with a baby pig sitting in her lap.  I must say, I have never ate my bacon while sitting next to a pig before - that scored a point for ambience.\n\nAnyway, my omelette arrived  and it was very mediocre.  There was literally half an avocado embedded in my omelette, and while I do appreciate the fact that they are not stingy with the delightful green fruits, it was barely chopped and I like my avocados in manageable, bit size pieces or slices.\n\nI ended up giving the massive chunk to my husband, who devoured it one bite.\n\nI splurged and got potatoes (instead of fruit or cottage cheese) but they were sub par.  They were not browned and crispy, but rather yellow and soggy.  \n\nDon't get me wrong -- the food was not bad -- I just would not order that omelette again.  But really, shame on me for not ordering what I knew would be awesome: the french toast.
