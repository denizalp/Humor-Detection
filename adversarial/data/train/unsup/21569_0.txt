Yes, I can honestly say that I have actually visited this little dive bar off of Scottsdale Road and Thomas; the same little dive bar that I've probably passed by a thousand times over the last five years. It was Saturday night, we had 40 minutes before the start of the final A's spring training ballgame of the season and we were hungry. Knowing that most restaurants were overtaken with tourists and those out for a night on the town, we started driving and came across The Dirty Drummer...and we went in! \n\nThe Dirty Drummer is exactly what you would expect when looking at it on the outside. However, it has an odd charm and character to it at the same time. When I walked inside, I noticed that the walls were lined with TVs - and nice flat screen ones at that. It's probably the perfect place to watch a game. Pool tables welcome guests for a game and a tables surround the bar that sits in the middle of the room. \n\nThe food itself is decent. It's bar food and exactly what you would expect bar food to be. The homemade potato chips were tasty. The grilled wings with extra sauce were good and so were the burgers. The bar is a dive but it's clean which is a plus. \n\nIt's at times like these that I wish I could add a half point to my review because while I can't give The Dirty Drummer four stars, I think it's a solid three stars (plus a half of one if yelp allowed) and I plan on coming back again in the very near future!
