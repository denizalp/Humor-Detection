DO NOT EVER opt in for their insurance per day or add an extra driver!!\nI rented a car for 7 days, which was a great deal, however, i did add on their daily insurance and added an additional diver.  When i received my cc statement, and saw the extra charge, i called believing i had been double charged.  It was no error. The insurance and additional driver added to more than what i paid for the 7 days of diving their car.  \nDO NOT BE TALKED INTO TAKING ANYTHING ADDITIONAL FROM THEM - NOTHING!!!!!
