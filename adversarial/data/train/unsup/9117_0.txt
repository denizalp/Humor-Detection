I was recently involved in my very first automobile accident while merging onto the I-10 via I-17. While stopped on the on-ramp, this crazy ass woman whom I had been eying in my rear view for at least 5 minutes while making snide comments about her crazy hair to myself, SLAMS INTO ME going at least 40mph. I spin onto the gravel and slap my head against the driver side window obviously shocked and wondering what the fuck just happened. I get out of my car, donned in stilettos and all, and strut through the gravel shaking my finger and explaining to her the rules of driving and how she, clearly, was not obeying them. Thank you for the whiplash and for ruining my day. Luckily, for me, she and her totaled 1999 Chevy Cavalier were fully equipped with Geico Auto Insurance. \n\nNow, I have always thought the gecko commercials were a little silly, but man, these people do no mess around when it comes to accidents. Within ONE HOUR of my collision, I had received a phone call making sure I was alright. Within 4 hours I had already been offered an inconvenience check along with medical bill coverage for up to 2 months.. Since I hit my head pretty hard, I had to decline.. to cover my own ass just in case something is really wrong. Their estimator came to us to give the verdict on the damage.. and cut a check on the spot. Everything, for the most part, was taken care of within the first 24 hours, including my rental car which they are obviously paying for as well. I have received letters in the mail and phone calls everyday and have not been intimidated or disappointed with anyone i've dealt with. \n\nI myself do not have Geico, but rest assured, if the person who slams into you does, god forbid, your life isn't over.. they are extremely helpful and professional, and genuinely do care about you.
