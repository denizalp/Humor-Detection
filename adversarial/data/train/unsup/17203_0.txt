This place is going to take the crowd away from some of the other popular bars in the Scottsdale Entertainment District. \n\nI went here thinking it would be a lowkey night with a sports bar atmosphere but i was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe place quickly filled up and the crowd proceeded to get turnt to the level of bottled blonde or hi-fi. \n\nYou can get bottle service at one of their tables or do the scottsdale 30,000 dollar millionaire thing and settle for their $5 domestic drafts all night.\n\nThis place passes the test for a fun night out with friends. The plethora of tvs they have also make it somewhere for you to watch sports all day long, especially with their $15 bottomless mimosas on saturday and sunday. \n\nVery excited about this place, looking forward to many more good experiences here.
