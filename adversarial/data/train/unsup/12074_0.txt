While I'm not a huge fan of coffee, I am a big fan of coffee shops or cafes.  There is no better place in my mind to do a combination of people watching, surfing the web, sipping on a cup of hot whatever, while doing it quietly and kicking back with some nice reading material.  The infamous Canadian chain Second Cup is like a bad Starbucks, but this particular location had it all.\n\nI came here during another average (read super cold) winter and was relieved by their awesome heater and excellent cup of hot chocolate.  Service was great and very patient with me as I tried to figure out what to order.  Prices were roughly the same as Starbucks and from a sample of my coffee companion's latte, it essentially was the same.\n\nThe place is pretty big for a coffee joint.  There is free wifi and lots of seating everywhere.  Tables were available to those who wanted a communal setting and couches \/ comfy chairs for those who wanted to kick back.  If I lived in Montreal, I could see myself coming here often.  Plus nothing beats escaping the cold with a nice warm beverage.\n\nIf there was anything to knock about this place, it would their cramped bathrooms.  I minus an extra star for the only urinal being out of service, causing a small line in an already small bathroom.
