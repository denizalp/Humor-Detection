This place is OK. Just OK. \n\nWe decided to be cheap and split a room 3 ways on the 7th floor of this joint. The room for the 2 nights was $180 which came with a ridiculous amount of coupons (SUMMER09 is the coupon code) including one for complimentary ribs AND a breakfast buffet for 2, 2 free drinks at Dixie's Dam Bar, and a 2 for 1 lunch. \n\nI give Hooters a hard worn and battered 3 stars because of the spartan decor in the rooms and the pool area. The rooms were adequate and nothing special. The beds were comfy, but I was disappointed by the lack of towels. Around checkout (11am), the housekeeping staff morphed into annoying pricks when they constantly knocked on the door asking us when we were leaving. The fuck? \n\nThe casino area itself was a bit cramped to me.  The slots, blackjack tables, and the bar near the entrance are too close to each other and that eliminated the illusion of space that many Strip hotels strive for.\n\nThe talent was hit and miss.  Some of the Hooter girls were smokin' and the others lacked smoke.  \n\nFYI........sign up for the Owl Rewards card that gives pretty good discounts within the casino and dining places.  One coupon actually grants a 25 percent discount on future stays.  Blackouts apply.
