The Kiwanis group used to hold monthly sales in Carefree where they would collect a bunch of stuff and price it well for a one day sale, people would line up to get in.  Now they have this thrift store which is open odd hours (9 - 1, W - S).  I guess all the older people who run the place can't work more than that.  I used to like their sale so I wanted to check out this store.  Well, the good prices are out the window.  Anything they think is valuable they get on ebay or some other sight and find out exactly what it is worth or 'overworth'.  If I want to pay the same prices as ebay or an antique store - I will go to those places!  Keep in mind, they get all this merchandise for FREE and I thought they were doing this for charity however, I think some of the pricer people are a little bit too aggressive.   Oh, and don't miss the really old people trying to check you out - they will likely break some of the stuff you have picked up or make you want to take a nap before they are finished ringing you up.
