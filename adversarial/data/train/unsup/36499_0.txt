I've been here 4 or 5 times, always for the lunch buffet. The first time was right after it opened, and the food was good, but a little watery. Every time since, it's been a slam dunk, best Indian buffet I've ever been to, better than Charka (RIP), better than India Garden, etc.\n\nWhat makes it so good is that the buffet food is actually spiced like it ought to be, unlike most Indian buffets. I've never tried a meat option there, but ever vegetarian thing I've had there has been great.\n\nThey've had many different options for vegetarians each time I've been. My usual favorite of Palak Paneer is very good. They always have fresh naan available too. \n\nYeah, service is a little weird, but who cares. It's an Indian buffet with awesome food.
