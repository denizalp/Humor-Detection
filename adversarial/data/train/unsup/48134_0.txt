This is a late review, but hey, better late than never! I used Carpet Monkeys twice, for two different carpet cleaning jobs, and both times were excellent. Rick is very nice and professional, and was able to get dreadful black stains out of our beige carpet! I thought it would take a couple of carpet cleaning sessions to accomplish that, but Rick did a deep clean and the stains came right out!  I will definitely use Carpet Monkeys again in the future.
