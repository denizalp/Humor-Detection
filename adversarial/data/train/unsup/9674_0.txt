Yelp Zompie Pub Crawl stop 1 for me(there had been one bar i missed). What a treat this place was! Lots of gleaming wood decor, a cool juke, not too many plasmas, a dashing bartender, and great beer choices. I would not describe this place as divey at all(quit throwing that word around people!). I think i had a Boddingtons for around six bucks. Steepish, but a tall pour. \n\nVery mature vibe(compared to the west end of Lakewood), but not an old man bar. The bartender even joined us outside for a smoke and was a pleasure to talk to. Probably could have stayed there for one more instead of moving on to the Gutter(aaaaaaahhhh...stop 2!)
