Fez, has been here in downtown Phoenix for quite a few years now. It is located right next door to one of my favorite Fed EX stores. \nIt is always busy, and with good reason. It is really a pretty good place to go and spend some time.\nIt is a great location, though if you are coming from the West or North it is a bit tricky to get to the other side of the street with the light rail right there. Once you do then, the tough part is finding parking. Best to go to the far back.\nThe staff here is friendly and the food is pretty good. They have all kinds of specials all the time. Tuesday,(the last time I went ) has great happy hour Martinis.\nI do not really drink Martinis ,but this time I did. $4.00 pretty good I think.\nThey even deliver now, at least around the area.
