I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant.  \n\nThe service was lovely.  Very engaged, observant and attentive without overwhelming which would have made for a pleasant experience in itself.  The food really took it to the next level.\n\nI had a melon, cucumber and feta salad with a champagne mint dressing.  It was so fresh and delicious.  Perfect for a summer evening.  After that, I wasn't sure how my main course could stack up.  \n\nI decided to try their vegetarian option just to do something a little different and because the words \"goat cheese\" lured me in.  I am SO glad I did.  A lot of places do meat and fish and salad well, or even great.  But i can't think of *that* many cooked, non starchy vegetables that have blown me away.  My meal was this amazing tower of perfectly done vegetables layered with just enough soft goat cheese on a bed of couscous with pesto.  WOW.  Just - WOW.  It was so delicious that my mouth is watering now just thinking about it.  I was particularly impressed with the eggplant in the tower.  I find ordering eggplant is touch and go - so often it just isn't right.  The eggplant was insanely delish and the perfect texture.  \n\nThe other 3 people I was with all enjoyed their apps, mains and deserts as well and said their food was excellent - but if there was one resounding theme at the end of the meal from all of us, it was that their attention and ability with vegetables is really what sets the food apart.
