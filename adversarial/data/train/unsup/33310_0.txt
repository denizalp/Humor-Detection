I've been wanting to try their lunch special for years and after trying it has lived up to everything I heard.\n\nMy meal started with the bartender suggesting a white and bringing me out grilled\/toasted bread. The white wine was very nice and light and paired really well with my fish.\n\nFrom their special lunch menu, I ordered the octopus, fish and cake. The best part of the meal, and well worth the $10 supplement, was that amazing octopus dish. My main, the Mediterranean Sea Bass, was really nicely seasoned and a lot of food. I liked the cake but at this point I was super full so only had a few bites of it.\n\nService was amazing and the different courses were nicely spaced out.\n\nI WILL be back on my next vegas trip, if only to have more of that delicious octopus.
