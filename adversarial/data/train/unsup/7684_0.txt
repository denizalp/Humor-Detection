I had a WONDERFUL experience buying my new Dodge!!! Usually, it gets REALLY ugly when I buy a vehicle because the salespeople and managers get ugly during the process and I get uglier right back at them!! My hubby prefers not to be around when I buy a vehicle!!\n\nI worked with Ian as my salesperson and Dimitri as the sales manager. Both were very genuine people who were very patient and I VERY MUCH enjoyed working with them both!!! There were a LOT of other dealerships I worked with prior to finalizing my deal with Tempe Chrysler Dodge!! In fact, I showed another dealership (much closer to me) the advertised online price of Tempe Dodge's vehicle. I was told that it was a bait and switch. I was told they wouldn't honor the listed price. Well, they DID!!! \n\nThe sales manger, DIMITRI, is an asset to the company!!! Never before have I actually liked a sales manager by the end of the buying process!! Dimitri is a very genuine nice guy!! My salesperson, IAN, was very patient and very likeable as well!! Ian was super helpful!!\n\nI highly recommend doing business with Tempe Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram based on my buying experience!!
