I have been coming to Olive & Ivy for almost two years now. I bring family and friends here from out of town. The food is consistently fantastic and you can't beat that free bread with the pesto. I took my mom, brother, grandma, and 2yr old daughter yesterday for lunch. We started with the Tuna Tar Tar Tacos. My mother and brother LOVED them. My daughter ate at least two big pieces of bread and tore up the pesto. How many 2yr olds are eating pesto? really. The general consensus was that they loved the food and wished I would've brought them when they first got into town. \nI ordered my favorite chicken panini w\/fries. It's just too good to get anything else. Don't get me wrong, I still take a taste of everyone else's food so I know what to recommend to my future guests. That panini with the cheese, zucchini, roasted tomatoes, roasted chicken........mmmmmmmmm......so good. They also have great fries, sorry to say but second to Gordon Biersch Brewery's.\n\nOlive & Ivy never lets me down. Great location, great seating whether inside or outside. Can't wait to go back.
