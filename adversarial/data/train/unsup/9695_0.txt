I've passed this place since it opened, assuming it was just the latest crappy franchise wing place to pop up. \n\nThat was dumb. I didn't know it was humanly possible to find wings this good anymore. Perfect crispy outside, perfect moist and tender inside, and your choice of over a dozen sauces ranging from the common to the unexpected. If you're anywhere near ATL Wings, go and get some awesome wings. \n\nTony Bourdain would appreciate their mastery of the fryolated arts. Wings? Awesome. Fried okra? Fantastic. Every other fried thing I've tried? Good to great. The celery served with the wings is pretty sad, but I don't personally buy wings for the vegetables.
