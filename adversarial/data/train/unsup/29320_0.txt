First thing first....this place is expensive, so a special occasion only place for me & mine!!! All the reviews are dead on...the food, the flavors send you into a sensory overload!!! Fabulous!\n\nWe went at 5 on Valentine's Night. We had tried the night before to get reservations for the 14th online, but they were full. We thought we would give another try in person. They barely squeezed us in, but we were in nonetheless!! The service was impeccable and the waiter answered every question we had about our meal and meal ingredients with patience!\n\nNow the good stuff the meal~\nThe bread basket: homemade buttermilk biscuits with chives that were amazing & I am a Southern girl, so I know my biscuits! And then 2 other of something else, that were good, but not that biscuit!\n\nI had:\ngorgonzola blue cheese souffl√©: $9\nroasted pickled beets,\ncitrus + fennel +baby arugula salad,\nblue cheese, honey + white balsamic vinaigrette\n\nThis was insane the gorgonzola cheese paired with the pickled beets almost made me lose my mind...FANTASTIC!\n\nmiso glazed alaskan black cod: $28\nprawn + pork potstickers, hot + sour mushroom broth,\nsesame broccolini, braised diakon, orange + chili glaze,\nsweet soy reduction, micro-cilantro\n\nThis was the first time I had cod, but for me anything with cilantro is a winner. The flavors in this entree were amazing with every bite I was moaning....again PERFECTION!\n\nMy Beau had:\n\"shrimp and grits\": $14\nwhite cheddar + jalapeno polenta\nforest mushrooms, crispy bacon\n\nOkay...this was great and brought with the new Sous Chef Kelsey from North Carolina. If I had not been raised on grits, I would not even have a complaint here, but since I was raised on grits this is my perception of this dish. The flavor of the grits were creamy and wall-balanced, but the texture was not what I am used to the grit its self was too coarse. I prefer my grits as creamy as cream of wheat. The shrimp was fantastic!\n\nKennedy's Farm chicken two ways: $19\nseared breast, stuffed leg + thigh,\nricotta cheese gnocchi, oven roasted tomato,\ngarlic, extra virgin olive oil,\npickled pearl onions, local feta cheese\n\nMy Beau loved his meal. The stuffed chicken was like nothing he had ever tasted. We asked about the mixture: bread crumbs & black Forrest mushrooms. The chicken was perfectly cooked!\n\nWe each had a vodka drink. The total bill $95.00. Wonderful dinner for Valentine's evening!!!
