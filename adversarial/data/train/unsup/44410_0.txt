Five words - pollo a la queso crema!  \n\nIt's a chix chimichanga topped with jalapeno cream cheese and cheddar cheese on top of that.  If you like a little spice in your life, this is the dish for you. The creaminess of the melty cream cheese, along with the crunch of the chimi is to die for. \n\nThe chips and salsa are my fav in AZ, crispy thin chips and a great trick someone taught me was to mix the hot and mild salsas together. \n\nThe family that owns it is always friendly and Veronica, the bartender, mixes up some the best drinks in town, including my fav a michelada (beer, lime juice and I hold the clamato).  This is always a MUST DO when I come home to Scottsdale.  I'm a huge fan of both locations and it's great for groups.  I've also ordered their app platters for parties, which is always a big hit.
