You know how in the first Ghostbusters movie how Sigourney Weaver's apartment building was a conduit for negative and dark forces because of rituals that had transpired that caused the framework to work as an inherently evil gateway to be used by Gozer?\n\nThat's how I kind of feel about this place.  Only, instead of being a gateway for evil, it's more like a gateway for absent-minded people who will stand in your way and\/or walk behind you MUCH TOO CLOSE.  You know the kind of people I'm talking about.  The people who made it why the sneeze-guard had to be invented... people so careless and dumb they'll sneeze on food.\n\nThis place is depressing.  It's true.  I mean, it's as though everyone in town who wants to bitch and moan and ooze out piss and vinegar decided to come to Fuddrucker's.  \n\nThis is a shame because I actually really enjoy the burgers.  I think they're fabulous.  And the fries are really good.  They're those potato wedges with the skins that I enjoy.  They have a make your own burger bar and their to go system is brilliant.  They give you enough cups for everything so that you can make 100% sure that your burger will NOT be soggy.  It never is.  \n\nPlus, and this is a bonus, they have round pickle slices for your burger and they also have like those half pickles, too.  So, you can have a pickle on the side without looking like a pickle-slice collecting weirdo.\n\nI do think the food is great, but I hate, hate, fucking HATE going inside.  It's depressing to me.  It's not dirty or filthy, but the building works as the antijoy.  It saps your joy in the same way that antimatter can make things seize to exist and create gnarly explosions.\n\nIf you can get in and out really quick, you will get a great burger.
