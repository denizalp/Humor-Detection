I had a work dinner there and the ambiance was very nice. The food was delicious. I had the best Cesar kale salad there. They Salomon was tasty and the cheesecake was delightful.  It was restaurant week and you have a set menu including wine for about $45. That was worth the value. Great spot after a day at the convention center.
