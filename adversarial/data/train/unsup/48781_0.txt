I can't say that I am a big fan of Salty's. I have been there a few times for happy hour and I just haven't been impressed. I don't like the margaritas. They are SOOOO sweet! The last time I was there I asked if they had Sangria, the waitress asked me if that was something that you eat or drink? Sigh. I do like the chips and guacamole! :) But sadly that is about it.
