First impressions usually make or break a hotel experience for me. The front desk folks were polite and there were no issues with check-in. \n\nThe room needed work...housekeeping didn't clean the bathroom (eew), so I had to switch rooms before I could settle in after a long day if travel. \n\nI won't be back to this Hilton property.
