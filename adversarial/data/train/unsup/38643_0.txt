My daughter loves vegan and has been for about a year now, me, not so much. I decided to take her out tonight as a treat to this great little restaurant in a super area of Charlotte for a father - daughter night. As a non-vegan, I was really surprised with all of the food offerings and the fresh taste of everything we had. I had the Chimichanga, a huge burrito that was absolutely fantastic and my daughter had the broccoli alfredo which she raved about. Of course desert was just as super as the rest of the meal.\n\nCaitlyn was our server and was very attentive, fun to talk with and had a lot of great suggestions and conversation. \n\nWe will definitely go back for more!
