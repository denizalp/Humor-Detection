This place is extremely sub par for a place that specializes in tacos. I'm pretty sure that they use canned chicken for their tacos & burritos and London broiled low-grade beef (which they try to pass of as carne asada). All in all, I could make their menu at home and have it taste better. The prices are cheap so I guess that you get what you pay for; however, I could get a much better tasting burrito at Chipotle or a local Filiberto's type of restaurant for the same price. I've given this place two chances to change my mind and my feelings have only solidified.
