This is the second location and they added burritos! This is our go to place every time we are craving tacos! Their specialty tortas and sauce is awesome.  If you want it spicy they have a ghost pepper sauce that is pure fire & even my hubby who can handle spicy had to concede that it was too much for him! I had the nachos fries and the portion was huge for the price. We also tried a cucumber mango chia seed drink that was so refreshing. The meat is seasoned and flavorful but still tender. We tried the asada, carnitas and al pastor meat and 5 stars for everything, including friendly and quick service.
