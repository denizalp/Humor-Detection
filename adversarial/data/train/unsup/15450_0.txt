Inventive Flavors and Flavor Combinations!  If I were a Movie Director (BIG IF) and I were scouting a Romantik Snack spot this would be a Colorful Local for a Modern remake of BrokeBack Mountain...I think it is about time!\n\nI would guess the Owner is From France, Belgium or Algeria, but I'm guessing ONLY by her accent and the Music they were playing and I'm guessing my knowledge of everything French is very lacking, so really I'm JUST guessing!\n\nBiggest surprise (0n the afternoon I was here) was the  patrons were 100% Young Males (I would guess 16-18 year olds). At first I thought (oh good young men with good taste) second I thought ( well, this place is very close too SilverFly and it was a great day to shop swimwear) then I came to my concluding assumption that at least one of these young Men knew the Owners Daughter who was about their age!
