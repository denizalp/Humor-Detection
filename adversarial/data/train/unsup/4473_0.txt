It's basically Yard House without the extensive tap selection. If you're checking out this review on-the-go, this sums it up and you can stop reading here. \n\n\/review\n\n\nBut if you have the time for some context, then much obliged! I remember the old Bar Louie well. It's where Calico Jack's in Westgate currently resides. At the time, I'd just turned 21 and thought martinis were the key to adulthood. I have to keep reminding myself that these, and not beers, are Bar Louie's specialty. \n\nWhich would work if there were more than a handful of them. And a few selections are eclectic and high quality, it's just that if you ever get the chance to see a real cocktail bar like Hanny's, you know having a few doesn't cut it.  It might be above-average for a chain, but the target audience still thinks slamming Absolut from fancy glasses makes them cool.\n\nAnyways, I really want to rip on this place about beer. It's late Tuesday night, and no happy hour? That alone I could forgive, but $7 for LOCAL crafts...in 14 oz. glasses? Pints or GTFO. So now that you're losing to surrounding bars on selection AND value, let's talk about the atmosphere. \n\nPick better live music. The description on Yelp says the music is \"background\", but these horrific covers of songs of alternative we're supposed to love were near rock-concert loud in a mostly empty lobby. No one likes having to yell when it's not even poppin'. \n\nIf I go again, I'll try some grub and see if there's something from the spacious ambiance I've overlooked. But in value, selection, and atmosphere Bar Louie left me wanting a little bit more than it should.
