I just love it here.  Their carne asada street tacos are divine, as is the guac, the corn, and I have actually contemplating \"borrowing\" one of the salsa bottles to bring home for the leftovers (but they do actually sell the liquid gold to go).  I wanted to update my review to acknowledge that they have Happy hour here every day from 3-6, ALL day Tuesday (which may be a limited time thing) and from 3pm-6pm on Saturday and Sunday which is my favorite.  I love a weekend happy hour.  The tacos are ridiculous for $1.75, guac is $5 and so are the spiked aguas.  Need I say more?
