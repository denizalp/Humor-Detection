This is good drunk food at its best. Pricey in the Venetian hotel but what do you expect of a place that's open till 3 AM and with decent service? Their beef chow fan is pretty good and greasy and perfect for drunkies. Their beef stew and wonton noodle dish was decent and we ordered the pork and preserved egg congee too. Even though we were four hungry slightly drunk Asian girls, we managed to finish almost all of it but we could have done one dish less.\n\nOverall, nice people, expensive price tag for mediocre Chinese food but redeemed by the fact that they're open late and have the right amount of grease in the food :)
