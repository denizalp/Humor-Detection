Went to Hungry Hollow again a few days ago during the evening. Seating was entirely occupied, literally only 6 tables in the whole joint. Looked at the menu, prices went up 50% !!!!!! Red neck poutine is almost $20 now. Everything went up $$$$$$.\nLooked at other people's orders, portions are reduced.\nLooks like the owner, who's a former insurance fraud snitcher\/ investigator is milking the \"you gotta eat here\" show big time. A real shame his greed has completely altered the dining experience in Hungry Hollow. It'll be hard to roll back the prices, next step - outta businees by 2019 guaranteed. Owner should still be in inusrance, he taketh but does not giveth.
