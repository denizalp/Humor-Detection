Pros:\nDoesn't exactly taste bad. Portions are okay.\nCons:\nThe curry is too thin and too liquefied, if that makes sense. The food is served on paper plates with plastic utensils. \n\nThe food is way too overpriced considering it comes off as a fast food Thai place. Overall, I've had much better Thai food for less.
