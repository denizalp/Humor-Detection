I was referred to this office by my dentist, who I think is great.  Unfortunately, this office is not.  I scheduled a consultation in December, and received a voicemail the morning of my appointment to let me know that the Dr. was running late, and asking if I could come to the office three hours later than scheduled.  Sure, no problem.  Upon arriving at the later time, I waited in the lobby area for nearly 20 minutes and then in the dentist chair for another 20 before actually being seen by the Dr. for less than 10 minutes.  That should have been a red flag...\n\nFast foward to today.  I have a 9:30 appointment.  After waiting in the lobby for nearly 20 minutes (see a theme here?) I am told the Dr. is running behind and would not be able to see me until noon.  NOON!  Really?  You couldn't have called and told me that?  Or told me when I arrived ON TIME for my appointment?  \n\nNo, I did not want to reschedule.  Would you?
