They're an okay place to go, they have some pretty nice omelettes but other than that it's a pretty average place. \n\nThe French toast tastes more burnt than anything, you'll have to drown it in syrup to be edible. The orange juice taste synthetic and watered down. The pricing is cheap compared to other places and it's pretty cute old fashioned inside.
