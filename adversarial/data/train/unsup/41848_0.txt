This is Eva Longoria's restaurant located inside The Crystal's. Very dim, dark, and sexy atmosphere for dining or just cocktails at the bar. The food is okay, nothing extraordinary....but it seemed a bit overpriced for what it was. Although, the staff are top notch and are noticeably trained. Wouldn't necessarily recommend it. Oh, I guess a plus side is that after dining, you get free access to Eva Longoria's nightclub next door, Eve. Basically walked in and out if that gives you any indication of anything. Not hating, just was not impressed at all.
