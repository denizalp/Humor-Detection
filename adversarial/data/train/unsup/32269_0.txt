I loved this store. I came here every week growing up and when I came back to visit Arizona after a year or so, my heart was broken. I believe Gracie's is closed now and they're building condos in the area.\n\nEDIT: Gracie's has moved to the plaza over right next door to Food City. The old location is being built into low-income apartments with Gracie's future location on the first floor.
