It was my second time staying here on the weekend of May 14-16, 2016. The first time I stayed here was the month they had the grand opening. My first stay here was great.  Staff was attentive and service was great. I even got a complimentary bottle of champagne. \n\nThe rooms are nice but it is dark in there. Friend of mine loved the decor especially the vanity mirror. Bed was a bit stiff. Don't expect a restful sleep. You can hear everything going on at Drai's all night long. \n\nCasino is small but I can't complain about it because I seem to win here. \n\nThe second time staying here was going great until the last day. I called the front desk 3  times to have my bags picked up while I check out. All 3 times they hung up on me and they never picked up my bags.\n\nAfter hauling my bags down to the lobby I told the front desk what happened. Their response was, \"That's weird\" and then told me I hope I enjoyed my stay. Unbelievable. An apology would have been a more appropriate  response. I don't think an apology is asking for much. \n\nSeems like the service has gone down since they first opened. I suggest staying somewhere else when visiting Las Vegas.
