This is actually the smallest bar I've ever seen, and they do a nice job of utilizing the space...well, at least for seating. For sports watching, it's tough to get a good angle. I need to go back during prime time...like on a Saturday night. Some patrons boasted about how fun this tiny tavern gets when it's packed. Will investigate.
