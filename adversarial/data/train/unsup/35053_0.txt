This arena is a very new addition to our wonderful city and has been the home of numerous events within its short time here. \nThis night, I was going to see one of my very first concerts ever! \nI was super excited! \nThe entire facility and arena was very clean, easy to navigate within the arena and seating area, perfectly sized for the venue, adequately staffed to handle the amount of ticket holders, and had numerous options for dining and drinking. \nMy only concern was with the horribly slow moving traffic.\nI was dropped off by a friend and took a ride share service home. \nJust to get dropped off near the arena took over 45 minutes. I could just imagine if I was trying to park. \nThen, to leave, they only allow ride shares to pick you up at a designated location that is a 20 minute walk, under the freeway to the other side! \nOther than the logistics of getting in and out, I loved this experience completely!
