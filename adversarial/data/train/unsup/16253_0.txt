I grew up in the suburbs so I love me a good mall.\n\nThis is not a good mall. It's not even a mediocre mall. In fact the single redeeming quality that the Fairview Mall possesses is a Shoppers Drug Mart which stocks my favorite Goody hairhints Ouchless black elastic hair bands (which are strangely difficult to find in New York.)
