I have 4 cats; 2 of them are a good weight & the other two are overweight. I have tried many different kinds of cat foods but found myself \"slipping\" back to basic brands that my cats seemed to like but did not help them lose weight (plus my only girl Nina started to scoot - even after her visit to the vet).  While I have done a lot of research online I decided to just go into a store & see if someone could help me. I googled pet stores in Vegas & saw the good reviews for Healthy Tails on here & decided to call them.  Mike, the co-owner (he & his brother opened Healthy Tails 11 years ago) was SO helpful - just on the phone - he answered my questions as well as offered some grain free cat food options.  When I walked into the store today, I was greeted by a friendly cashier but was on the search for Mike.  I saw a man in the back talking to a customer & I thought that might be Mike & sure enough, when he finished he asked if he could help me & I explained I was the woman on the phone.  I told Mike about how frustrated I felt with how 2 of my cats are not losing weight & that I am tired of the fillers in most cat foods.  Mike offered me some mostly grain free options, Orijen(dry), Natural & Delicious (Dry), Annameat,  go!, Weruva b.f.f. (wet), Rad cat (raw & needs to be refrigerated) & Primal starter pack (raw & needs refrigeration).  He never tried to sell me anything - i actually bought some canned cat food just so I didn't feel so guilty taking all the samples he offered me. I have had generous owners\/managers at pet stores help me before but not like this.  As he was ringing me up he told me \"If any of them don't like the canned food, just bring the rest back.\"  He mentioned he had a facebook page & told me to look for some pictures of cats; some people had actually brought in their cats to the store :-) I thought that was cute!  I really wanted to write this review because Mike's kindness and professionalism really touched me.  My best friend's cat of 16 years is dying & she's really sad.  Which got me sad & made me want to get the healthiest food possible for my fur babies.  I feel confident that I will find the right food at Healthy Tails!!
