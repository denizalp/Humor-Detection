Chipotle is a true treat, I rarely eat here and was telling my boyfriend as we sat and ate why do we not come here more often? Seriously I have not eaten at Chipotle for at least 7 years and that was in los angeles when they first started opening locations. I enjoyed the build my own options, Subway style with creating exactly what I want. I opted for a beef burrito, it was a hard decision as the chicken looked so juicy and good as well. \n\nI was not in the mood for beans so I selected, cilantro rice, tender juicy beef, green peppers and onions, cheese, pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole and lettuce. This burrito was fat even without the beans!\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind after the first bite is FRESH! The food is not greasy, every ingredient taste fresh and of good quality!\n\nI also chose a side of guacamole and chips! Mmmmm yum I love their guacamole and fresh fried corn chips so much!\n\nWe will be back! I have been missing out and will not wait as long as I did to return!\n\nAlso for all of you soda and iced tea lovers it is serve yourself when you dine in for drinks so you can have all you want refills which is a bonus! I really liked their fresh brewed iced tea!\n\n\n\nMmmmmm yummy!
