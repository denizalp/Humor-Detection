I was excited to move into this apartment because of its great location and amenities. However, management ruined the experience for me. I do believe their policies are meant to improve the quality of life of tenants but they are poorly executed and the staff lacks professionalism. Any suggestions for improvement or complaints are met with ridicule and a \"sorry not my problem\" attitude. \n\nExpect to get nickle-and-dimed for everything. See below for a few of my own experiences as a resident:\n\n-They will steal your deposit, charge additional fees and claim damages greater than normal wear and tear (see pictures for reference). The pictures below were taken the day I moved out after living there for more than 2 years. The areas of contrast seen on the carpet are where the furniture was sitting versus those areas that were exposed to foot traffic. There are absolutely no holes\/rips\/stains on that carpet that would constitute for \"damages greater than normal wear and tear\". A cleaning would have sufficed but instead they claim to have to replace the carpet and bill you for part of the cost. I was also assessed an additional cleaning fee because the bathroom was \"EXCESSIVELY\" dirty. I guess their make-ready process consists of nothing more than tightening light bulbs in between rentals. I even requested a move-out inspection but they told me that a 10 minute move-out inspection needed to be requested 1-2 weeks in advance. \n\n-There are not enough visitor parking spaces available. If you want to park inside the garage they require tenants to get daily parking passes, however, they don't offer a way for tenants to get them outside of business hours (as if tenants didn't have jobs of their own). Last minute plans with friends are not allowed at your \"luxury apartment\"! If you do, prepare to have your car towed in the middle of the night and expect to pay $200 to get it back. \n\n-Dog owners routinely leave their pets' feces and urine behind without any punishment, yet if you put your trash bin outside your door before the pick up time you will be charged a fee. \n\n-The apartment is loud. Noise travels far inside the apartment and you can easily hear your neighbor's footsteps in the units above.
