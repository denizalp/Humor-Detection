This hospital really needs to be shut down for malpratice!!! The people that work here lack any real human emotion. Please if u care about your health or the health of your loved ones DO NOT come here. The ER is a cesspool of faith and you'd be lucky to leave here upon any type of treatment with only a staph infection... which can be fatel... aside for the lack of quality care and service I was just shocked, like literally... mouth open at how they have become so desensitized to people. It's like they hate the people they are supposed to be caring for. The energy here was wicked. I would never let anyone in this facility lay a hand on me. In the lobby I saw a nurse roll his eyes why asking an older lady why she fell? Yes!!! He said, why did u fall??!!! I will leave e this review on that note bc I'm still waiting at this cesspool. Have been for do long that my phone is now dying. So upset they sent my friend to this freaks how of subhuman nurses that treat injured and elderly people like s***
