Ho-hum. Why do we always wind up at average chain restaurants. I'm firmly placing blame on someone else, namely my partner. I like to plan, he doesn't, so we wind up at average or less than average chain restaurants. \n\nWe tried to go see a movie late this afternoon but it winds up everything we wanted to see was sold out. So we perused Sport Mart for a while, got a couple deals and then he said: \"I'm really hungry.\" So it was between White Chocolate Grill and McGrath's Fish House. Since we'd been to White Chocolate and McGrath's would give me another opporunity to write a review on yelp we decided on McGrath's. This was not the better of the two choices.\n\nThey seated us in a cavernous dining room that was empty save for two other groups of diners. In addition the room was very warm. I must depart from the review to let you know my partner is HOT, and not just in the way your dirty minds are thinking. So, shortly after being seated we're both very uncomfortable.\n\nThe good news is the service from our waiter Adam was great. The food, well it was just okay. We started with the Calamari Rings which were, you guessed it, just okay. I ordered Wood Fired Salmon and he ordered a King's Platter. The Salmon was far from wood-fired, grilled with some wood flavored seasoning sprinkled on it, I can do that at home. My partner's platter was also just okay. He said there's no reason to come back here. I have to say I must concur. \n\nAnother average chain restaurant. You can do better than this!
