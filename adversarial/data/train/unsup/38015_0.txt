Great music, great crowd, good staff. Living in Vegas there are countless clubs to go to but the is one of my regular spots. Awesome place to just bring friends that come to town, and enjoy some drinks and company. Has a large outdoor area which i like and the inside can get a bit crowded but the vibe in the crowd is what makes it. PARTY ROCK!
