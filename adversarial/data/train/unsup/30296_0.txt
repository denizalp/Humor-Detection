We decided to get a Groupon for The Shore Club because it was obvious that this place is managed by the same people who own City Tavern based on the similar but slightly scaled back menu. This was my first time visiting and it was a good experience. Like City Tavern, the food is good and consistent, but it is not outstanding. The food earns three stars but the amazing service for our table of five earns an extra star. My fish tacos were decent but the highlight of the meal was the hot pimento appetizer. If you want sushi, the sushi chef is not there on Sunday and Monday so keep that in mind.\n\nTo find the place, just had toward Tega Cay (watch out for coyotes), turn left where the big sign says \"RESTAURANT\" and drive down the short road to the parking lot. The restaurant is the big building at the top of the circle with no sign on it.  The outdoor area is nice and has a view where you can see some of uptown Charlotte. It is a decent place if you would like to try something different. I will agree with a previous reviewer that some music is needed. Because of the restaurant's layout, it is very easy to hear everyone's conversation, especially when there are only a few occupied tables.
