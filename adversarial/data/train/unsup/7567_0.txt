I remember when this mall was built it was for the now debunk Aladdin hotel that was an interesting yet disaster of a Casino-hotel experiment that didn't last back in the early 2000's. It just didn't feel right back in the day when it opened.  \n\nFast forward to 2015:\n\nSome of the more reasonable shopping on the strip in this circular mall that is adjacent to Planet Hollywood. The shops in here are your more typical \"mall type\" shops : H&M, Urban Outfitters, Guess, True Religion etc. what makes this mall unique is that unlike your regular suburban mall back home, you can head to Cabo Wabo or Fat. Tuesdays and get one of those corny 3 foot tube drinks filled with slushy alcohol and drink while you shop. Not many places in America where you can legally do that! \n\nThere is a decent food court here and also a massive Earl of Sandwich plus a Hawaii local tourist- ABC store. \n\nThe hourly rainstorm (every thirty min on weekends) is another \"only in Vegas\" phenomenon (other than Rainforest cafe). Who comes to a mall to see a rainstorm? I thought it was the opposite that you come to the mall to get out of a rainstorm? This is Vegas friends! Lol!
