I reserved a King bed room at GVR and hit the road from Los Angeles excited about adding an extra day to the start of my trip.  I got there 5 hours later, after the long drive, ready to shower, relax and have a great time. \n\nThe rude woman at check in said they had no more king beds but they'd give me two queens.   I told her I specifically confirmed a kind bed.   I asked her if they had any Kings on the entire property.  She said I'd have to pay the upgrade fee for a suite.  I asked to speak to a manager and she said, \"I am the manager\".  \n\nI went to find someone else in the hotel because this woman obviously wasn't looking to help me.  I found a floor man on the casino level.  He went off to \"look into it\" and then didn't even have the balls to come back and talk to me face to face.  He called the security guard at the station he left me standing at, and the guard told me the same thing. They couldn't do anything for me.  So they'd rather leave my reservation empty and a king suite empty than comp me a suite due to their mistake.   \n\nI left furious and to top it off they had the audacity to try and charge my card the reservation fee of $178!!  \n\nNEVER stay here, EVER!!   Worst Vegas experience I've had.
