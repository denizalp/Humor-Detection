I've been looking for a local Fish n' Chips place ever since I moved north, and I have FINALLY found it!!\n\nI got the Halibut combo which came with a massive piece of fish (6oz) and SO many fries. The fish was so flavourful and the batter nice and crispy (I did get take out so it was a little soggy when I got home but this is not the fault of the KING). The fries were just standard fish n chip place fries...the kind that are a little soggy and greasy but taste great doused in malt vinegar.\n\nThe inside was clean and the staff was incredibly friendly. While I waited, someone that was dining in finished their meal and remarked that it was one of the best they've had. While I paid for my meal, another person came in and said they were recommended to him as being 'the best'. Hard to believe these weren't paid actors but then once I tried the food...I understood. \nSo happy to have found this place...they even had Judge Judy on the big screen which if that isn't a huge plus, I don't know what is! (haha).
