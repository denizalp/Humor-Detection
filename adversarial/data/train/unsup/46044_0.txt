We come here for karaoke mostly. The bartenders are always amazing. Me and my steady fella have had such a friendly welcome into this neighborhood bar. The karaoke host Saturday nights is especially great. She will look up songs for you and is so nice and efficient. Friday night karaoke is a close second. My only wish is for better drafts on tap! You have my money either way ;-)
