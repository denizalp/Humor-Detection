Great sandwiches! \n\nIn our quest for something good to eat while out of town, I decided on Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill. We headed on down to the MGM and walked around for a while before finding it. \n\nIt was a Friday just before noon, so it was a little early, and we were seated right away. \n\nWe took one look at the menu and both knew exactly what we were having. I started with a Raspberry Lemon Drop martini and he started with a Coors Light. I got a Cuban Sandwich and my dining companion got a Roast Beef Panini. Both came with homemade potato chips. \n\nThe atmosphere was comfortable and casual, yet very appealing and not loud for being in the middle of the casino. \n\nThe food came rather quickly, just as the place was starting to fill up. \n\nThe sandwiches were great! My Cuban had the right amount of everything, including pickles on the side so I could add more. I typically do not care for homemade potato chips - apparently these were the exception. Dining companion really enjoyed his roast beef. The arugula was a nice touch to the sandwich. \n\nOverall a great meal. I would go back without hesitation. In and out in under an hour. \n\nThe food great, the service spot on without being annoying and the price fair at $50 for everything plus tip.
