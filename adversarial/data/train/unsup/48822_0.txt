Their magic milkshake is worth the visit. Although it's a sugar rush in cup and should be illegal because of how good it is! If you're looking for to feed your sweet tooth in this little coffee shop I'd recommend this to anyone! Keep in mind it's a small place so you may have to take your treat to go and it's $10
