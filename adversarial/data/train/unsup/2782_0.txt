I got my trunk in my roof wrapped by these guys. They did a really nice job on wrapping my roof and trunk I also saw that even if I wash my car and scrub around the areas where the wrap ends it still holds on really nice and I've had my wrap for about 8 months now, recommend these guys. They also take care of you if ur wrap does ever peel off or gets damaged
