I went to Barriques for the first time today. I used to live here in Madison, and it opened right around the time I left. While I vaguely remember seeing it once or twice, I never went there until I came up to visit and the friend whose futon I crashed on raved about the sandwiches. I'm a total sammie nut, so of course we went. We got there around 1pm, so it was lunchtime but getting towards the end of it. It took us probably 20 minutes to get a table, which normally would speak to the popularity of a restaurant and I would not take off stars for that. Busy usually means good. This time, however, it spoke to the douchiness of the clientelle.\n\nAfter we'd been there about 5 minutes and decided to go somewhere else once another friend got there, we saw two people get up. It would be a tight fit, but we thought that if we were all willing to be cozy, we could fit 4 people around the table. When one of us went to claim it, though, two girls who had been sitting nearby said that they had already called it. They were going to push the two tables together, because they needed the space of 8 potential people for 2-3 people. There were a whole bunch of people sitting by themselves at tables that could easily fit 4 or more people, and we were forced to sit across the balcony from each other, which kind of defeated the point of going to eat together.\n\nThis kind of sucks for me, as well as the many other people I saw come in and leave when they couldn't find a seat. If Barriques had a sign asking people to share tables, or not take up more room than they needed, I probably would have given them at least 4 stars, probably 5. But as it is, their silence on the matter seems almost like approval of the people sitting at a 4 person table just reading a book. It's rude and inconsiderate, plus if you're encouraged to share tables, you can totally make an awesome new friend. It works at a coffeeshop where I live down Chicago way.
