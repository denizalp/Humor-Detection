Came here for the salad bar and to grab a few items. \n\nTeeny tiny bag of tiny multi colored potatoes. Almost four dollars.\n\nGreat looking produce section except every time I looked at the price my inner dialogue was, \"You've GOT to be effing kidding me!!\"\n\nSkipped buying all produce here because I know Sprouts is cheaper.\n\nLooked for Sriracha. They have a tiny bottle for a fortune. I get it because I don't want to go to another store to find it.\n\nI walk up and down the aisles looking for canned coconut milk. It's not near the Thai food items and I don't see it anywhere else. \n\nMy bad it's on the bottom shelf with the soups. Also over priced.\n\n\nI grab some 365 pump hand soap which I later learn had already been opened and leaked all over the bag. Buh bye five dollar soap!\n\nFinally I go to the salad bar ready to chow down. Probably the least inventive and most ill kept WF salad bar I've ever seen. Dry stuff. Soggy stuff. Plain old chicken that looked like rotisserie chickens pulled apart not the marinated chicken I've had at other WF salad bars. I'm not impressed so I move to the sushi but it's cold in there so I decide to get some hot food.\n\nI get impatient waiting to be waited on at the Burger area and I order some Kung Pao\nchicken from the sushi lady.\n\nIt's a small amount, mind you. And with one flick of her wrist I see that the price tag reads $6.95. For that price, it doesn't include rice. I wonder if it's all organic ingredients but I don't ask. \n\nI pay 75 dollars for my sack full of five things, eat my Kung Pao chicken which is good but will never fill me up because it's just not enough food- and I wonder if I'll bother coming back at all.\n\nTrader Joes is across the lot and Sprouts is up the street. \n\nHmmmmm....
