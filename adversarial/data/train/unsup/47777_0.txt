Okay this pizza ROCKS!  We always have to order 2 pizza's because my husband does not like my creation.  I do a double ricotta, spinach, fresh tomatoes, and it is amazing!  One time I waited a bit for the food, they were very busy and the manager came to deliver it, comped the pizza AND gave me a cert. for a free one.....seriously who does that!  Loyal customer here.  We are getting it tonight.  Sometimes they offer some good coupons in the mail, they can be pricey, but well worth it.  Wed. kids eat free.
