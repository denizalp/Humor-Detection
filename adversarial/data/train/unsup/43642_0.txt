OK.... now the snow is just about gone go the Golden Acre to get a jump start on your gardening fix. Beautiful flowers and plants for indoor and out are available but they were careful to tell me that I should wait a while before I leave plants outside this time of year in Calgary. I bought and planted 4 small pansy plants that I was told would quite frost hardy. I enjoyed an hour there walking around and soliciting advise from the knowledgeable staff. Came home with the yellow pansies, several bags of potting soil on sale and a great feeling of spring because of all the greenery and flowers on display. I'll be back in a couple of weeks to get some herbs and I am sure more. It can be your one stop garden shop.
