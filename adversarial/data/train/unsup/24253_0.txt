This place is amazing. I came to Montréal 4 years ago, but I can't believe that I only started coming here last year. I was on the search for a good barber, and I'VE FINALLY FOUND HIM! \n\nIt's a two-man, nephew-uncle operation, which is awesome. You walk in, and you pick up a number. The wait can be pretty long, but hear me out--it's worth it. On average, I wait anywhere from 10-40 minutes for a cut. \n\nIt's not too expensive (below $19) for a men's cut, and they always have a tasty homemade treat for you afterwards! They are cash only, but there is a dépanneur right around the corner if you need to exchange some. My cuts are always consistent and really solid. \n\nPatrick is the man. Great conversation, and all-around cool guy. \n\nHighly recommend!
