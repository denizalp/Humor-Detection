I was first impressed with the birthday card the restaurant had the hostess give me when we came in. Our Open Table reservation mentioned our celebration, and they shined at making me feel special with that thoughtful gesture.\n\nOur waiter was very informed and enthusiastic about the wine selection. We shared a bottle of a special house wine that was very tasty and went well with our meal.\n\nMy Love and I shared the spinach salad with goat cheese, pancetta, warm bacon-balsamic vinaigrette with bacon on top. It was really good, and a very interesting flavor. Our friends shared the Caesar salad with romaine leaves, white anchovy, and black pepper croutons, and both agreed it was the best Caesar salad they've ever had.\n\nThe four of us did the best style of eating, what I call tag-team eating, where we order two different items and share, so we can try more dishes. Our party ordered two of each of the:\n-17 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye\n-Chilean Sea Bass\n\nThe rib-eye was absolutely delicious. It wasn't just large. It was large, tender, well-seasoned, and well-grilled.\n\nThe sea bass just melted like butter in your mouth. It was so good!\n\nThe sides were good, too. The roasted seasonal vegetables were fresh and seasoned with rosemary. The garlic mashed potatoes were smooth and satisfying.\n\nMy friends shared a dessert, the bittersweet chocolate lava cake with pistachio ice cream and mint sauce (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/Fy4t2XHIRKwMk_ocCZze0Q?select=bzRDV05eD7MojFn3rnRsWQ). They loved it.\n\nService was sporadic, but it seemed intended so that we could enjoy our experience, not just dine and dash.\n\nOverall, we had a great dinner experience, and I'd love to come back another time. The discounted GC from restaurant.com really helped with making this special meal more affordable, and because I love savings, I enjoyed this experience more because of it.
