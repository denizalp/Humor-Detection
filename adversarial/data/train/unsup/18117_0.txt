Fairdale Daybirds. Matching. For this married couple. \n\nWife, Evelyn A, matching bike wife, when asked about the matching bikes, said \"one small step in embarrassing our daughter, one giant leap for the kind of quality of living we'd like.\" \n\nIncredible service. Welcoming and at the ready for all those little questions that could add up to crashes as a first time Toronto city rider. And, add up to be some annoying questions but they never made me feel that way. I like the mix of certified pre owned and new bikes here. I also like the accessories. There's a gold bell that's loud AF I recommend. \n\nSpeaking of recommending, I wouldn't do that for any other bike shop.
