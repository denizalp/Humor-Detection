Absolutely AVOID!\n\nI came in because my steering wheel was rattling whenever I would brake above 50mph. \nEvery single person I spoke to in the store was extremely short with me and just wanted to get my car into the garage and now I know why.\n\nDuring their inspection they \"found\" that I needed my oil replaced, new calipers & pads, more power steering fluid, coolant, it seemed like the list kept going of things they needed to top off. \nI inspected my car that morning, I absolutely did not need all of those things done.\n\nEnded up just replacing the pads myself - was not going to deal with all the upcharges and lies.
