I went to Volvo Cars Gilbert today for some very minor recall service (replacement spark plugs) and this was my fist time at their new location. The whole facility is bright, clean and feels high-end. When I walked in the service area the service team knew who I was (I did have an appointment) and immediately went and got my car, brought it in the bay and got the process started.  There were TVs, drinks, snacks, sofas and work tables at my disposal to help me get some work done while I waited. The best part... in and out in under an hour AND they washed and waxed the red sled too!  Great customer service, super nice facility and a very good experience.
