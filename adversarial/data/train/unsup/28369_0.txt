Love this place. After hearing so many good reviews, I decided to give this place a shot. \n\nThe ambiance and drinks was fantastic! You definitely won't have a bad time when you come here with friends or on a date!\n\nCame here on a weekday with a group of 4 and it was not too busy. We were seated in a spacious booth. I like it when restaurant hostesses doesn't cram your group into a tight table to save the space for other guests. Which happens very often in bar\/restaurants in Toronto.\n\nThe server was super friendly and was really patient to explain the menu and drink options to us. The drinks were amazing. The food was not as good as I expected. Like most reviews, people come here for the drinks.\n\n\nService 10\/10\nFood 6\/10\nDrinks 10\/10
