I've been coming here for a long time. It's $1 (cash) per person for entry and ladies are always free. Make sure and bring your tool bag and whatever else you think you might need to remove the part you want. They have signs as well a map posted letting you know where each make of vehicle is making it easier to navigate through the sea of cars. Everything is pretty well organised. They have a pre-pulled part area worth checking out and everything in that area is ready to buy, no tools required to remove anything. I can't tell you how many times I have been able to get a part from here that would have cost me much more elsewhere and even more if I took to to a shop for repair. Hubby fixes all our vehicles himself and recently was able to get a part for $5 that would have cost $80 at AutoZone. He needed 2 of the same part, so it ended up being a real saver. Another cool thing is that I was able to go online to their website and see what makes and models they had available before I bothered going down. Currently they are open Monday though Friday from 8 am until 4:30 pm.
