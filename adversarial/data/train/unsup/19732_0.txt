Walmart meets pets supplies, Petsmart is the big box store that carries everything you need for your furry, feathered or scaled little one. All neatly organized with prices displayed clearly. Cat food, dog food, cat treats, dog treats, leashes, litter boxes, water fountains, aquariums and aquarium supplies. It's all here.\n\nPetsmart will let you bring your leashed dog into the store with you and they have cleanup supplies in case Fido couldn't hold it until he is outside. If you do decide to bring your dog inside, please don't let him scare the cats that are out for adoption. That's just not right.
