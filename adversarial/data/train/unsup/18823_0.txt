Came here because he had met here for lunch with clients and said he had some tasty barbecue sliders and part of the conversation was that this business was part of a program called \"Bar Rescue\" so I agreed we might as well check it out.\nQuieter than anticipated for a Saturday night.\nLimited menu but the selections are a bit creative for a bar.\nI don't know what it was like here prior to the renovation\/revamp.\nWell lit, nice looking bar area.\nThere were a few high tops and picnic tables with benches instead of your basic dining table.  Added a nice touch.\nCame here for a late dinner and although it was slow to get service our server was very polite, helpful and informative.  My husband ordered a Margarita and I was encouraged to have a taste before I ordered one for myself since they didn't have Grand Marnier necessary to make it a Cadillac.  It was alright but I opted to go with a basic mixed drink since I felt their microbrew selection was limited.\nI had the Chicken Fingers and he had the Thai Chicken Wrap.  \nChicken Fingers were heavily battered and crispy.  They were okay but I was more in the mood for lightly battered tenderloins.  My fault for not inquiring.  \nThai Chicken Wrap looked yummy and sloppy juicy.  Seems he couldn't eat a portion without wearing some of it.\nI would say the service was probably the best part about our visit here.\nFood was okay, drink selection was okay, but neither are going to draw me back anytime soon.
