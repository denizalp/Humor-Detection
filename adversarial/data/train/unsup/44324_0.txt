We settled on this place for some hearty brunch and thanks to the lovely reviews this place had got. Started off our meal with devilled eggs. Creamy and delicious topped trout roe. My husband ordered the fried chicken and waffles with spiced watermelon while I ate the shrimp and grits. The fried chicken was super good and one of the better fried chicken we have had. The shrimp and grits were good but could be more flavourful. The hostess and servers were friendly and attentive. This place is a bit of the pricey side so if you are looking to do a budget meal, you shoulf keep that in mind. Our cocktails were nice but felt like they did not have the alcohol they needed. If i had to pick one thing, I would say come back for the fried chicken n waffles!
