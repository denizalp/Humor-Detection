The place was good. Different from any Mexican restaurant I've ate at. It seems they actually make their own house salsa. I think the refried beans must be house made not the typical retried beans I see\/eat at the other Mexican restaurants that looks like the mush from the can. I also tried enchiladas for the first time. I can't remember they exact name but it was chicken with a cheese sauce. I would order again. I also had a coronarita for the first time, I enjoyed it as well. If I'm every hungry after a day of shopping I now know where to go instead of the food court.
