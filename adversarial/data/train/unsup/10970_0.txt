I'm not all about brunch places because 1. I can barely get myself up before the afternoon and 2. If I am awake in the early morning, I always want dinner food. \n\nI ended up eating here, because I just finished an eye exam across the plaza and refused to drive anywhere else to look for food. \nThis place was just about full of people wanting breakfast and the employees did a nice job attending to all the customers. \nIn a reasonable amount of time, my sister and I got our drinks, our orders taken and a conversation with one of the employees. \nI ordered tea and a server popped out a fancy box of (6?) types of teas that I could choose from. Nice. I dig that haha\nI opted for the green tea.\n\nI got the chicken Chilques- tortilla chips loaded with salsa verde, pico de gallo sour cream, cheese, eggs, and a side of beans and rice. I'm sure I'm missing some other ingredients but going off by memory here. \nI couldn't finish half of it so I got the rest to go. It is a promising dish. \n\nMy sister got the Dougie- a breakfast sandwich with a side of fries. I had a bite as well and it was toasted to perfection. I definitely remember it having a good crunch and the bacon was the best part of the sandwich :-))
