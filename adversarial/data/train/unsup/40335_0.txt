I feel like I'm going to a different grocery store than the one mentioned by the other Yelp reviewers. I'm staying nearby for a month, and I've already been here several times.\n\nIt's packed in the early evening, and there isn't a lot of free space to move around, but other than that I've found this to be a nice and well-stocked place to get most groceries.\n\nSure, the fruit and veg won't be as fresh as some of the dedicated shops nearby, but I've bought apples twice here without issue. Bread, meat and cheese have all similarly been good. My only gripe is the lack of any coupons or deals; if you're not careful you can easily ring up a larger-than-expected bill.\n\nStill, a fine place for most groceries if you live nearby.
