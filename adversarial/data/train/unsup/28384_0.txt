Ordered online at 2:30 pm for pick up at 4:00 pm. Got to the place at 4:05 and my food was still not ready. I don't mind waiting sometimes, but I had to wait til 4:30 just to get my food when they had an hour and a half to prepare it already. No idea if it's good since I just used my entire lunch break waiting and have no time to eat it. What's the point of ordering online if I still have to wait?
