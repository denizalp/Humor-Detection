Old MARY must have croaked!  \n\nMy folks used to bring my sister and me here 30 years ago. A decade later my husband and I would bring our own children. Now that we're empty nesters, we occasionally make the 30 mile drive to pay Mrs. Yoder a visit when we feel like a drive over the river and through the woods to one of our favorite Amish restaurants.  In the last couple of years, we have been witness to a dramatic decline in quality with an equally dramatic surge in prices. It's obvious that they've lost a good deal of their loyal patronage as well. \n\nThe  oven baked chicken has lost its crunch. Don't order it after 12 noon or you'll get a bird that spent a little too long bagging rays under the heat lamp. The broth of the vegetable soup tasted like wild game. The \"homemade\" pie fillings and salad bar, which used to be made from the freshest ingredients in a hundred mile radius, now come out of a can. Slap some pudding out of 50-gallon drum onto a cardboard crust and Woolah!  You have coconut cream pie!  At least that's what they call it. \n\nWe are so sad!  Where did the attention to detail go?  \n\nYep, old MARY must have croaked..or this establishment has been overtaken by a greedy corporate entity. Not even worth driving up again for a free birthday meal. They'd have to pay us to come back.
