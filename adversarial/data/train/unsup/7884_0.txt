Barber is a Rude dude! It was my first time walking in and wasn't immediately greeted. That was a Red Flag already. Then, I just stand there waiting to ask when's the next available appointment would be and he doesn't even acknowledge me. There was only one person that seemed to be waiting for a cut. When I finally got his attention, he just told me he doesn't know When his next available appointment was going to be (After the guy that was getting his haircut from him had to tell him I was standing there waiting for him to answer me) COMPLETE D***. Seems like you have to personally know him to get a cut. Yelp should let us give negative stars.
