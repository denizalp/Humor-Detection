Mmmmmm soooo good, I was sucking my spoon silly!\n\n\n***2011 Entertainment guide, buy one get one coupons***\n\nYummy! My sister and I had a craving for a refreshing root beer float, also had a two for one coupon.\n\nThe service is awesome for a fast food type of chain!\n\nWe got our Yummy RB floats and were so happy just moaning and enjoying every sip and spoonful.\n\nThe combination of the almost buttery tasting golden soft serve along with the A&W root beer is just amazing, the perfect blend!\n\nWe will be back for sure! \n\nI want to experience this sensation again and again and again!!!\n\nIt made me feel so darn good! The taste is out of this world!\n\nMmmmmmmm yummy baby :)\n\nI like it a lot!
