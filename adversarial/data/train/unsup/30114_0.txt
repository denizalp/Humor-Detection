My daughter took me and my friend here for lunch and I must say I had the best bruschetta ever and the onion soup was bursting with rich flavors and of course the Lynn pear and shrimp pasta was full of deliciousness...i will definitely come back here on my next visit to Las Vegas.  The place had the right ambiance and the service was good...Next I come back I must say hello to Chef Rudy and personally tell him how delicious his food was.....see you next visit...
