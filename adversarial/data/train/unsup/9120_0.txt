Our experience with Danny and his team was wonderful! From our first meeting, we knew we could trust Myriad. No cheese or gimmicks or overselling like other realtors. We had a list of homes in mind which Danny quickly looked through (after business hours) and one by one gave us pros and cons of the homes from an experienced perspective. When we started looking at homes, he would listen to our needs and concerns instead of trying to sell us on any of the properties. Once we decided to make an offer, Danny's team (Morgan and Stacey) attended the home inspection while Danny was away on a well-deserved vacation and helped negotiate with the seller to get all but one (unnecessary) repair our home inspector suggested before we closed. I would highly recommend.
