My dad and I paid a visit to Public School 702 last night to check out the new brews that Left Coast Brewing released. My dad is a bit of a beer connoisseur so trying new beers along with some good food is right up his alley. The new beers were being launched at 7 so we got there early enough to enjoy happy hour, or \"recess\" as they call it. \nRight off the bat I noticed they had a nice selection of craft beers and our server Jared was extremely knowledgable when my dad expressed his desire to try a new stout. We ordered so many different beers during happy hour and the left coast tasting that I don't remember what we got but everything was delicious! \nNow for the food: We got the speck and eggs which is a deviled egg with prosciutto on it, the mezze plate which consisted of pita bread with hummus and baba ganoush for dipping, crispy buffalo cauliflower with franks hot sauce and bleu cheese for dipping, and sliders. For me the sliders weren't anything special but I enjoyed everything else that we got. My only gripe about the cauliflower is the dipping sauces. This place markets itself as a gastropub so it would have been nice to see a sauce they create themselves.\nOverall this place gets a thumbs up from this girl and I'll definitely be back!
