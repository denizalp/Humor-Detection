I've heard mixed things about Owl so I decided to come here and give you all the real deal: my review! I came here solo during lunchtime and was seated right away. I got the kimchi stew with pork (you can also get it with tuna). The banchan was: kimchi, pickled radish, pickled cucumber, and bean sprouts. Each side dish was delicious and tasted just a little bit different from its squad.\n\nOnto the star of the show: the kimchi stew. I am a huge fan of kimchi stew and I've had it enough to recognize the do's and don'ts. Do's: put lots of fresh kimchi and pork. Do put in rice cakes. Don't overcook the kimchi until it's mushy. Well my stew had very soft kimchi although most were not yet mushy- they were getting there. Even so without the rice cakes, the portion was pretty good and I would return! Service was solid.\n\nWashrooms are upstairs. They 'don't' have wifi but I see a wifi: OWL NORTH and tip: the wifi password isn't their phone number, Minerva, or 'pls.'
