Went there this morning to meet with Rebecca to try and find my wedding dress. I had an amazing experience at this beautiful dress shop! \n\nFirst off, they were having a trunk show and I was given 10% off the dress I chose! Yay!\n\nSecondly, when I found the dress I loved, Rebecca did my hair up all pretty and added a veil and some beautiful jewelry to finish off my look and made me feel amazing. \n\nWe will recommend this place to anyone we know looking for a dress for their big day!
