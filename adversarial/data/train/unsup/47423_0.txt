I ordered through Grubhub so I cannot say if that's the reason for my experience but I don't think so. I placed my order at 7:02 and my delivery window was 7:35-7:45. After hitting submit the delivery time changed to 8:11-8:22 which admittedly could have been because I was ordering for a family of 6. I watched my order the whole time and the delivery driver was on point, once the order said the food was ready for pickup the driver was there and headed to my house so I can only assume the reason for my experience was the restaurant.  I ordered 3 chicken taco meals and the chicken was in huge chunks, not what I was expecting. The taco \"shells\" were hardly shells when delivered and were so soggy  nothing would even stay in them to take a bite. My kids had to just toss the shells and eat the chunks of chicken by themselves.  We ordered 2 super burrito meals and they were just ok, nothing to write home about. I was pleasantly surprised they gave you bags of chips, salsa and guacamole with every meal but the chips were overcooked and not very good anyways. Overall for the $93 it cost to feed my family we will not be ordering from here again.
