This buffet is not as bad as most people described on Yelp. They have decent selection of food. At least they have some pretty tasty pasta freshly made by the chef at the stand. You can choose any sauce, protein, vegetables, types of pasta you like. \n\nThe rest of the food was okay, nothing special. But they do make noodles in soup for you like Pho. It actually tasted not bad. Sushi was not bad, at least they had some salmon\/tuna nigiri sushi available. \n\nThe desserts were awesome! Loved the creme brulee, NY cheesecake, chocolate-covered strawberries, red valet cupcake. Everything was delicious. Wish I had more room for desserts! \n\nOverall the buffet was okay and service was average.  Plates were not taken away in a timely manner and the staff never came check on refilling our drinks. Hence, I probably won't go back again if this is not part of the Mystere deal.
