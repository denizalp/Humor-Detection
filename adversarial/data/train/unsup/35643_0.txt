Great view - checked, romantic - checked, great food - checked!  My friend CT been telling me about Fishbone by the lake and I finally came here with JC on the weekend!  Since they do not take reservation unless you have 8 or more, so we decided to go a little later hoping we don't need to wait long.\n\nArrived at 2pm and we did not have to wait, was seated at a table close to the lake and started off with two Pomegranate Mojitos. Since we were both starving, we ordered the PEI Mussels, Ahi Tuna Poke for our appetizer and the Pepe's Pizza and Lamb Bologense for our main.\n\nRanking our favourite to the least, our favourite was:\n1) Ahi Tuna Poke - The tuna was great and fresh, mixing it with the refreshing watermelon cubes and avocado made this dish so delicious and refreshing and is perfect for a starter because it opens up your appetite!! I highly recommend this dish.\n\n2) PEI Mussels - Portion was alright, but the mussels are meaty and big! Using Coconut Piri Piri Broth as the base really brought out the freshness of the mussels.  Another great dish!\n\n3) Lamb Bologense - the sauce was amazing, almost felt like i'm eating at a restaurant specializes in pasta.  Great amount of sauce and lamb meat.  Only recommendation I would make is to make the pasta a little more al-dente, I thought it wasn't chewy enough.\n\n4) Pepe's Pizza - The pizza is still good, very thin cruised and lots of fresh toppings that include Sweet Chorizo Sausage, Mushrooms, Red Bell Peppers, Capers and Red Onion, but the pizza just didn't wow us like the other dishes.\n\nOverall great experience!  Love the romantic lakeside view with great food! One star off the rating is due to the fact that there are a lot of bees, wasps and flies flying around which really had an impact to the whole experience.
