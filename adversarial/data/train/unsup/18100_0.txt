Cleveland is so lucky to have Mitchell's. I think we sometimes take it for granted because we are used to seeing it in the grocery store, but truly, whenever I visit this flagship location, I'm reminded how awesome it is. This is a great place to bring an out-of-town guest.\n\nOh, Mitchell's, how do I love thee, let me count the ways...\n+ Fresh ice cream. Keyword: FRESH. Ice cream has a big difference when it's made with fresh ingredients. My absolute favorite is the key lime pie-- it's a crumbly, tart delicious batch of goodness. All the flavors are f-a-n-t-a-s-t-i-c. Salted caramel and chocolate covered pretzel are my other favorites, depending on mood.\n+ Non-dairy and vegan options (I know nothing about this life, but pretty cool that they offer it, right?)\n+ Accessible grab-and-go pints if you feel like pretending something is for your \"boyfriend\" but really you just want more ice cream for yourself for later.\n+ Two floors of handicap accessible seating!! You can take the elevator or stairs to the second floor and enjoy a totally spacious alternative seating area.\n+ You can watch ice cream being made! They have a huge glass wall that can be observed on either the bottom or top floor. It can be very entertaining for little ones to watch the big machines at work through a 2-story viewing glass.\n\nThe staff at Mitchell's is also super helpful and they handle long lines like champions, even when people are being super difficult. I also appreciate that Mitchell's is involved in the community. I see their name attached to community initiatives all the time. For me, I love a business even more when giving back to their community is a core part of their values.
