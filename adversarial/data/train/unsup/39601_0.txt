Years ago we would patron Sammy's when they offered Rotisserie chicken with a delicious herb butter.  They discontinued that, so we stopped going as nothing else on the menu kept our attention.\nWe recently started going back to Sammy's as they have a revamped menu offering a few items we really enjoy.  Our favorite items:   Happy Hour pricing for \"sharable\" Mediterranean and Asian samplers, lettuce wraps, lamb chops, and salted caramel pudding.  The BBQ chicken pizza is one of the best I've tasted as the sauce is more savory than sweet making it taste more like what a pizza should.  Service is consistently very good.  The prices are a tad on the high end for some items we like, but Happy Hour prices does help.
