Nice atmosphere and great patio! A little disappointed in the wedge salad. Could use more bacon and dressing. Plus perhaps a few cherry tomatoes?  \n\nI know it's a steakhouse and I'm being critical of a salad but it's a wedge salad! A popular steakhouse salad and easy to execute. \n\nI would expect more of The Keg!
