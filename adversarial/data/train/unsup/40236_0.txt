I am not a fan of soggy pizza crust. That is what I got. I liked the taste of a fire cooked dough however, it can not be soggy. I had the Margherita with Italian sausage. They were out of pepperoni. The cheese, sauce, pesto, onions and sausage tasted good. The ingredients looked fresh behind the glass from what I saw. There was ample seating and the pics posted show a nice sized area to eat. Dishes to eat off are by the soda machine. I would try it once again, because I love pizza. If you follow them on Instagram you can get the pizza of the day for 50% currently.
