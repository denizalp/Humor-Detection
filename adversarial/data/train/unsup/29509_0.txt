Alida's was highly recommended and we were not steered wrong. From the time we walked in, to the time we left, it was a very enjoyable evening.  The atmosphere and decor is very pleasing to the eye, very comfortable without over doing it. We started out with our usual appetizer, Zucchini which was lightly breaded and very good. I ordered  the Chicken Romano, which I highly recommend. My husband had the Veal Scallopino, which he really enjoyed. We tried a side of the Saffron Risotto, which tasted just like the Northern Italians have been making for over 50 years. We ended the meal with a pecan ball, which completed our dinner nicely. \nMy husband and I eat our every weekend and we are glad we found their gem of a restaurant. A nice addition to the Lawrenceville neighborhood.  We are looking forward to taking friends on our next visit!
