i dunno man. \n\nthis place is practically walking distance from my house, but for some reason i've never made it here.  after reading all the good reviews, i figured i'd drive through for some late snacks. \n\nfirst, the woman working the drive through didn't speak any english, so it took an unnecessarily long time to order.  \n\nnext, i only ordered two things-a california burrito and a horchata. i paid with a card and she's didn't say how much the food was when i gave it to her.  when i got home i looked at the receipt and saw i was charged SIXTEEN DOLLARS for these two items! i didn't look at the cost of the burrito, but i did notice a large horchata was something like $3 on their menu.  no way that burrito could have cost $13, so i must have been charged for two. ugh! \n\nafter reading all the reviews about how ~amazing~ their aqua frescas are, i could not believe how awful the horchata was.  it was extremely watery and obviously made with a powder mix as i could taste the graininess in the drink.  the actual flavor was very weird as well, it didn't taste like any horchata i've ever had (and i've had a lot). \n\nthe california burrito was the saving grace and was actually really delicious.  unfortunately since the rest of the experience was so annoying and i was overcharged, i think i'm going to stick with bertos or vaquero for my late night fat snacks.
