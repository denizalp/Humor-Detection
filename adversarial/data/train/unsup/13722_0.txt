Easily one of the best buffets in Vegas and one of the newest additions. I was waiting and waiting to go try this place and finally had the opportunity to do so, but of course it was done with a hangover.. so I want to try to give this place the best review I can under the circumstances that I was in. I tried a bit of everything even if it meant a few bites of one thing and a whole bowl of pho. Yes, pho.. and it was good too! Probably the best thing there that day, and it cured the hangover but I still didn't eat much of the other stuff. Everything was really high quality though and explains the price of the buffet. I would definitely like to go back and try it when I am \"normal\" again.
