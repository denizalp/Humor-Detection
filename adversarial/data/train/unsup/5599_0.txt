WHAT?? $6.00 for a (maybe) one ounce shot of Vodka?? We wanted Tequila but the bottle was out and we didn't want to wait. We were ready for a shot to start this lunch off as we walked through the door and saw the bar as we entered! Having NEVER been charged $6.00 for such a TINY shot, we were shocked!! Hey, it is a TINY shot glass, at least fill 'er up!!!! This ain't no high end night club where someone hopes to drink up to the point of getting lucky with anyone who looks good after slamming a few! If you are looking to get drunk for that reason, maybe it would be worth it to some at any price!! In other words, there is SIMPLY NO excuse for charging so damn much for a dinky shot that barely gave us a buzz! Trust me, we don't need to get drunk to get laid, it is just an analogy, okay??! We would have done another shot, but we were suffering from sticker shock!! Hell, we can buy a WHOLE 1.75 liter bottle for what two one ounce shots cost!!!\n\nThis place would get five stars, not because we were drunk or even buzzed, but because the food deserves five stars...but he price of a shot blew a star off big time!!! We ordered the special of the day: Garlic chicken with chestnuts, onions etc., in a brown sauce with a super meaty chicken wing, a fried shrimp, a fried wonton, a chicken salad that was quite generous with the chicken AND soup for only $8.25!! DELICIOUS and the portion was beyond filling!!! \n\nOMG, we all agreed their hot and sour soup was outstanding!!!! The egg rolls are the bomb, the size of a small burrito! They are the ONLY Chinese restaurant that packs your to go with soup AND fried wonton chips and sweet and sour sauce!! Oh, and they serve fried wontons and sweet and sour sauce like a Mexican restaurant serves chips and salsa!! What a nice and tasty touch!! \n\nI even ordered some food to go because it was sooooo good!!! The food is a good value, but they need to evaluate the cost of their liquor!!!!
