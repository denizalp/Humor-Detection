It was my first time here. We came in right at the beginning of the lunch rush and I'm quite impressed. We got greeted by everyone we walked by and the service was prompt. The food is amazing, unfortunately I was full from the complimentary chips, dip, and beans, to really enjoy my entr√©e. Oh well, I guess I don't have to worry about dinner later on. I will definitely be back!
