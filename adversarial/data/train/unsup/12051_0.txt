First you lure me in with a restaurant name that contains letters used in pizza. Then you trick me into drinking a tasty Italian beer meant to appeal to my love of pizza again. Peroni beer? Peroooni. Pepperoni? I'll have 10!\n\nThe pizza was tasty, but the chili oil really topped it off. Great addition to the 'pie'. Service was good, location is good. The decor was sleek modern, which doesn't tickle my fancy, but it was clean.
