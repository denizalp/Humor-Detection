More than 8 people, they charge you gratuity. Typical.\n\nFOOD SELECTION:\nA large variety. They did offer a variety of foods. I give them that... but the quality... eh. I've had better buffets for the SAME price. They have a large selection of different types of foods and this was a big place, but I felt like the meat quality was lower than most places. But if you stick with the basics, you're good. \n\nPRICE: $29.99\n\nDESSERT:  Lacking. I'm a dessert buff. \n\nSEATING: Not too crowded - even during lunch.\n\nOVERALL: Eh... I've had better.
