If this place is A Touch of Italy, then it's the creeper kind of touch your mom warned you about.  \n\nThere are two sides to the place, a loud, crowded bar and a restaurant with only a few booths.  The server we had was very professional and friendly, but overall I'd have to agree with Jon H. that it's a dump.  They seemed to be doing a brisk takeout business and I can't vouch for their pizza, but the entrees were atrocious.  The salad was iceberg and boring and the pasta with meat sauce was literally floating in oil.  I wrote a review on another site and got a response back from the owner that was basically making excuses, saying that the bar was where their business was heading, and that's what they were concentrating on, maybe the chef had a bad night, blah blah blah.  To be fair to the chef, I don't think anyone could have made a very tasty dish with the cheap ingredients they were using.  Save your money - just stay home and open a can of Chef Boyardee, and you'll have the level of quality about right.
