I could've sworn this was supposed to be a horror show, not a comedy. I guess the joke is on me.\n\nThere are 3 separate \"attractions\" here: The Crypt, Asylum, and the maze. You can purchase them separately and choose which or all, or you can buy one ticket for all 3. I had purchased our tickets back in September, via Groupon, which included admission to all 3; it saved us 1\/2 off. \n\nThe Crypt was the best of the three, by a LONG shot, but it doesn't say much. Nice props and an A for effort on the set up. Scare factor of 2, on a 1-10 scale. \n\nThe Asylum was alright and had a healthy amount of fake blood throughout. What it lacked was scare factor, and by lack, I mean none. Nada. It was quite the bore, but not the worse. 1 on a 1-10 scale. \n\nThe \"haunted\" maze was THE WORST. Seriously, the sorriest half-you-know-what attempt at a maze that I have ever been duped into. Picture an 8x10 room with plastic checkered drapes hung from the ceilings at random angles through which must push to escape said room. 10 seconds, maybe, and you're out. No props. No scares. Just those annoying plastic drapes. Everyone kept looking around, befuddled as they exited, wondering, \"Is that it?!\" \"It can't be it. Maybe I took a wrong turn?\" No buddy, you were just suckered like the rest of us. Shame on them for that HAM (hot @$$ mess). 0 on a 1-10 scale. \n\nThis thing is located in a shopping mall parking lot. THAT is your biggest clue. If you're taking small children, 5-10 or 11 years old, they may receive a fright or 2. Otherwise, keep looking. With a hard eye-roll, I declare, never again.
