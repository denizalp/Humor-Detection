This place is delicious. All of their seafood options are super fresh and always tasty. The egg plant and shrimp is a go to for lunches while I'm at work, but the chicken pot pie with basil and garlic is also delicious. They do have Boba tea is a very wide selection, and all sorts of really good small appetizers. The pork soup dumplings are top notch, so are any of the fresh vegetable preparations. Squirrel Hill has tons of Asian food options, but this one is definitely hiring kick in terms of quality and consistency. I've really never had a bad experience here. Some of the menu items are definitely more authentic than others, and if you're looking for Food court Chinese food this is not the place to get it. I love authentic Asian style food and Taiwanese bistro 33 certainly has it. During the summertime they have a fantastic little patio deck out front and the service is always extremely prompt and nice.
