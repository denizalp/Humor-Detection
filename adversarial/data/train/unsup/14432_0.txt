This place gives me a hard-on...and when I say hard-on I mean I like it. \n\nOpen 24\/7, it ain't expensive, they got appetizers half price during football season. Food good as a mofo, it's swanky, waitress gals are cutie pies, and they got all kiiiiinds of good shit on that menu. Everyone in here seems to know each other which is good because they talk to each other and not my average ass so I can chill and relax in swanky-ness in piece. Oh and they got cheesecake...hard-on achieved....
