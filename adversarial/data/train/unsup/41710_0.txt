This place was good, but seriously over-hyped. I will say that their ice cream is definitely Instagram worthy (which would probably mean more to me if I had it), but definitely not on the list of top ice cream places in the city.\n\nI ordered the earl grey ice cream. It did taste like earl grey, but wasn't quite as smooth as other ice cream. My friend ordered the thai tea ice cream with the brownie! It was also good, but not all that special. Overall, everything was a little too sweet for me, but maybe I'm old.
