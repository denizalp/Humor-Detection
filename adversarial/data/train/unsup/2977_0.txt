We decided to host our event here with 30+ people during Thanksgiving weekend, and it's unfortunate to say that we didn't end up getting the wow factor that we wanted, considering the amount of $$$$ we put into this place with food, champagne and wine.\n\nReservation was made for 5:30pm, and though people did not show up until 6pm, latest, the server kept pouring $8 a bottle of water and $130 bottle of champagne for two hours until we complained that we waited a bit too long for the food, and for them to stop pouring champagne (glass full to the top) to people who were obviously not drinking.\n\nWhen the food came out, you can tell from each bite that the dishes were sitting in the kitchen for quite some time. That may have worked for their ahi tuna tar tar appetizer and salad, but it definitely didn't work to their favor when it came to their entrees. The meat came out cold, looking lumpy red, and the fish came out tough and dry, even when covered with white sauce. There was also a long delay in between the plates they brought out. They also had lobster pot pie but in all honestly, I only remembered it after going through my pictures. That says a lot about the dish.\n\nBright side though, each cold dish still ended up being quite tasty. Similarly to the one that we frequent in Glendale, the flavors are definitely spot on. \n\nDeserts ended up being the main attraction because everyone commemorated on the root beer float ice cream (really?), with a side of their soft cookie (... really?).\n\nNow question arises whether the overall experience at this place was worth the $250 per person (including drinks), and if you're telling me that the only thing people liked from this place was the DESERT, then my obvious answer is no.\n\nAside from the initial 2-hour delay, our main server (not any of the girls or the guy in a suit) was the only one in the restaurant who was friendly to everyone during the entire time and was also quite attentive to our needs.\n\nIf we had to do it all over again, we would have booked Picasso instead.
