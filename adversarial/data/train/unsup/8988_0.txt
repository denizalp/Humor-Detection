(I have to agree with my fellow Yelper Don C.)\n\nI think I am being a bit gracious on my rating. I would say it's more of a 2 to 2.5 rating. I was impressed by the amount of heavy clientele they have and the initial friendliness of the staff. However, that quickly dissipated when the following was extra SLOW: ordering, waiting, serving and there were a lot of incorrect orders made. Thankfully not to my order. I ordered 3 large boba drinks that cost $16? I thought that was pricey. One was just iced lychee without boba and not milk based. The other two orders were taro milk based with extra boba. All drinks were a size large.  \n\nI tried their froyo, but none where like any froyos I have had. All seemed watery\/runny and not milk based either and lacked in flavor. Music is very ODD, I thought. They were rocking out to Disney animated musicals, like I said ODD. I thought it was super cheesy, but hey just an opinion I guess, but I was anxious to get on out of there!\n\nThey do offer punch cards and a free one at the end of it, but it has restrictions! It is ONLY for the small drink and not any drink. If you want an upgrade in size its an additional $1. I think that's a lame concept if you are buying 8 or so, then come on give a free what ever drink your patron wants as long as it fits in the large cup. Stingy isn't a cool thing.  ;)
