I have gone back to YST&B\nThe chicken was wet with grease. It's fried chicken with no gravy. So, why is it wet? The bread was dry and the drinks did not have enough ice them. The glasses had hard water spots so did the silverware. I was over all unhappy with my food. The service was nice and everyone was kind & respectful. I would not mind going back for drinks but I would take my own cup & ice.
