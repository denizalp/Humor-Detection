This rainbow-themed psychedelic vegan cafe is new to the Duluth neighbourhood, but you won't be able to miss it - there's nothing else like it in the area!\n\nEverything here is not only vegan but also hand-made by the owner every morning, and she was so kind and accommodating and friendly when I visited. \n\nThe decor is a lot - bright pink, clashing colours, old keyboards, disco lights and wallpaper made of a sort of late-90s-internet-style poster wall. It sounds distracting but it's honestly quite pleasant, because it's clearly been put together with purpose!\n\nI ordered the rose & mint tea, which was beautifully perfumed and floral, and the passion fruit meringue, which was fruity without being overly tart, and had lovely, chewy, pillowy meringue on top. I'm not entirely sure how it was vegan! It's amazing!\n\nThe only problem I had with this place was the tables, which were either coffee tables or tall bar tables. I sat at the coffee table and I felt like a giant, having to bend down to eat my meringue!\n\nBut seriously, this place deserves to be busier than it is. It has a lot of personality and love poured into it, and it's certainly unique. I really feel like it represents the personality of Duluth: bizarre and weird and eclectic as hell.
