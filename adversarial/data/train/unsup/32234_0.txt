I work in the building and go there quite often, not because it's great, it's just there and they are generally quick. The food is ok and a bit overpriced. The salads are tossed together with general disregard and the breakfast is anything but \"fresh\" \nI haven't tried the Pimento Cheese...maybe soon, but really I only eat there because I know I can get in and out in less than 10 mins.
