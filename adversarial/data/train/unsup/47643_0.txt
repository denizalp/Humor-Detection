There is a barbecue stand at the south end just before you go into the grandstand called Cardinali that sells deep-fried pineapple crazy delicious,they start with a nice thick fresh pinnapple slice,then batter it up and deep fry. They serve it on a stick like a large lollipop, it will blow your mind how good it is!! Also deep fried pecan pie was heavenly
