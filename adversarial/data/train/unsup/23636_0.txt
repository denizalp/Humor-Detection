This place is hoppin'! I have high hopes that more high volume businesses will head back to Independence Blvd. soon and this new store will lead the way. Super G is big and busy and overwhelming but worth a visit if produce and bulk international items are your thing. \n\nI warn you, when you walk in you will be slapped in the face by the fish odor. It takes a minute to acclimate but then you just get in the fray and get ready to play shopping cart frogger. The aisles are blocked by lots of people but even more randomly placed racks of food and stacks of staples like juice boxes and rice. The rice section is the best I've seen anywhere and is very well priced. I bought a 20# bag of Calrose for $15 when the little 5# bags at my local store cost $6 or $7 bucks. \n\nI love that they have Jamaican, Arab, Mexican, and Indian foods along w\/mass quantities of Asian foods. I love being able to try so many new items, being able to expose my kids to so many different cultures. I don't love dodging crazed shopping carts, trying to navigate the overpacked aisles, the crabs being dismembered by mean little kids (multiple amputees all over that poor crab corral), outdated products on the shelves, and not being able to find a single person on the sales floor to help me locate the one item I specifically came for but can't track down d\/t language barrier.
