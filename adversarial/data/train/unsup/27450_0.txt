Been working out here for a several months now and here's my impression. You get what you pay for and honestly in this case you get a little more....You have access to a variety of workout platforms (weights, treadmills, classes, etc.) all at a low price compared to other gyms! Some of the equipment may not be the top of the line but it is still better than paying three times as much to go to a big fancy gym or than whatever you may have at home. They offer a separate workout area for those women that may feel uncomfortable working out in front of men. They even offer child care at no additional cost (platinum membership needed, only $20 for 2 members or guest pass)), which would be extra anywhere else. I've managed to lose 40lbs here on my own, so there is no excuse! People need to stop being so sensitive and stop complaining over every little thing. Yeah you come across some people who are just there to socialize, not really workout, but you find that at any gym. We all have to be adults and learn how to share and take turns, something I thought we all would've learned in elementary. You have to scan yourself in sometimes....big deal! Your not there to socialize with people, your there to workout right??? You try working somewhere that is short staffed which is what they appear to be, but that's not the current employees fault. I've seen employees try to mop the floors and run the front desk at the same time! I am very pleased with the establishment and the only reason I'm not putting 5 stars is because the repair time on some of the equipment is a little delayed but no big deal! Now that I've lost my weight I began to tone my body and feel better than I ever have, including my high school days! So people stop making excuses and put the work in!!!!
