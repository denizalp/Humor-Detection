I can't speak to the nighclub scene, but I've been to Dakota for lunch twice now... and I've been happy both times.  I've tried two different salads and both fit the descriptions on the menu perfectly.  Portion sizes are generous and prices moderate.  I have a feeling they make their money from the drinks they sell in the evenings.  Both visits I requested a tortilla wrap on the side of my salad and that wasn't an issue.  (I highly recommend the tortilla wrap on the side of a salad by the way!)  Both times I was there, my dining companions had special orders of some sort and they were accommodated without a hassle.  Thanks for that, Dakota!\n\nThe place is large, modern and airy; and a stone's throw from the Galleria Building where my office is, so I was surprised that during both of my visits, there were only a handful of tables with diners.  The booths are large and comfortable.  \n\nEver since having kids, I'm not regularly out in Old Town at night any more, but I'd consider coming here for a post-work drink or two... and I hope to check out the breakfast \/ brunch menu soon as well.  There's definitely something for everyone.
