The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable plus it was extremely clean. The furnishings inside the room were a little dated but clean and well kept. The staff was friendly, professional, and very helpful. The pool area was well-furnished with cute cabanas and the pool was the perfect size. Even though it was off the strip, we would definitely stay here again.
