I relocated to Cleveland and have been trying to get a feel of the restaurants that will deliver to my place. I found this restaurant on GH and from the rating thought it was the lesser of the three evils so to speak. I then saw yelp rating and figured, why not? I had only ordered takeout from another place but disliked their portion to price ratio. This place's ratio did not bother me so I thought I'd try it out. \n\nWell, I must say, big mistake. After struggling to give the clerk\/phone operator my number, she could barely get it down. When she mentioned it would a 40 minute wait, I figured it will probably take 50 mins. It took almost an hour and 15-20 minutes. During that wait, I had to call back just to have the same phone operator try to blame it on my number. Turns out I did give her my number and the driver took too long. Very disappointing. \n\nNow on to the food. I had ordered the sesame chicken dumplings and crab rangoon. The rangoon was just about the only decent part of the meal. The chicken was flavorless, the rice was far from anything to rave about and I approached the dumplings with caution. For the prices they have, I would save my money for a pizza or latin restaurant or walk to another restaurant I might randomly find.\n\nI would only keep their number to place on do not call list. Yikes...
