The best fries in Alberta, hands down!\n\nNot only that, but a warm, inviting room, a multitude of foreign beers on tap, an outstanding wine selection, and food that will get your taste buds hoping. The Brasserie is one of the best, tucked-away pubs in Kensington.\n\nCame here for lunch on a quiet Friday afternoon. Had the club sandwich, which was delicious - and their fries, which were absolutely to die for.\n\nThey have Grolsch on tap, which is pretty awesome, and the servers were terrific, taking time to explain the menu and keep our bevvies topped up. \n\nI will definitely be coming back here on my next visit to Calgary
