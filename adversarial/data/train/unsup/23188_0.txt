Amazing! I have yet to find a Mediterranean grill that can top this spot. I've tried but this place puts any other competition to shame. You can't beat the authenticity of this joint. I've wanted to find a different spot that's closer to my house that remotely compares but every other place is just pure disappointment after I've fallen in love with yannis! \n\nChicken shawarma plate is my absolute favorite. Chicken smells and tastes amazing. Salad is nice and fresh!! Baklava is made by the owners grandma! Super delicious, flakey, and moist! \n\nLegit BEST MEDITERRANEAN FOOD I've EVER had. Even the owners are personable. That remember you personally. Definitely a nice touch.
