Of all the coffee shops downtown Barriques is my favorite, and not just because it the closest one to my house.  I usually just get brewed coffee, but their lattes are good, and they have a big variety of teas.  Their sandwiches and salad are good too(a little pricey); I like the tuna sandwich, and the hummus sandwich.  Their cookies are really good too, especially the Cowboy cookie.  \n\nI also use Barriques as my wine shop.  I can always find something I like, and the staff are usually very helpful with suggestions.  \n\nMy only complaint about Barriques is that it can be hard to find a seat during the day on the weekends and on some evenings.
