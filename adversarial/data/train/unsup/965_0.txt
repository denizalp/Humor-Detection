I stayed at Planet Hollywood once many years ago and it was fine. This time we decided to stay here for 2 nights over the weekend. Everything was horrible. \n\n1. The registration line was super long and service was horrible. It took us 45 minutes just to check in.  \n2. The room and bathroom were small and worn down. Carpet was so dirty. I wouldn't dare walk barefoot on it.  The hotel was supposed to be hip and vibrant, but it didn't feel like that at all. \n3. Party music was blasting throughout the night. We could still hear it at 4 in the morning even when we were on the 33rd floor. \n4. We asked for late checkout but the hotel didn't allow it.  We ended up checking out by noon.  I've never stayed at a hotel that was so inflexible. \n\nThis was totally unacceptable!! I will never return to this hotel!!!!
