At first the customer service seemed good but it was a lie. She we walked in the store the girl said we can get 25% off everything we can stuff in a bag if we bought the bag. After an hour of shopping for stuff we wanted, the line was huge as they were not checking people out fast enough. Then we go to check out and the cashier says that we can't get the discount on the items we bought. Super pissed off now, I told her that's not what the other lady said, she didn't seem to care. So basically I will never shop at this brand again. They need to get it togther.
