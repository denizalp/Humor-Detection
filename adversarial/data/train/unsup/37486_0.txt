Pretty good place for middle eastern food. Growing up Lebanese my grandmother set the standard for tasty food. A few likes and dislikes from my visit here:\n\nPros:\n\n1. Good spinach pies\n2. Awesome shawarmas!\n3. They offer to heat it up as you place your order\n4. Grocery selection is good\n5. The price is very reasonable for the food you get.\n6. Pretty good hummus.\n\nCons:\n\n1. They don't offer ground lamb in their meat pies\n   - they're meat pies aren't great in general.\n2. They tend to be a lot friendlier with middle eastern customers rather than others.\n3. The zaatar bread seemed a bit old.\n\nI would still recommend this place based on how good the shawarma was as well as the price. But if you're looking for lamb pies, go elsewhere.\n\nI will be back to try the other things as well as buy another shawarma.
