The service was fast, but the food was lacking a lot.\n\nIt was very busy, but my food did come out quickly. I had the wings and the famous BBQ sauce tasted like tomato sauce with salt, pepper, and a hint of sugar or honey. \n\nTimothy probably would not make it as a server in a standard restaurant as I had to ask him for my drinks twice and never did bring me napkins.\n\nCindy, on the other hand, assisted without me even asking and was friendly to all servers and patrons alike.\n\nThe guy who seats you barely speaks English and doesn't care to ask you where you want to sit.\n\nI will rethink coming here in the future. I would have given it one star but I did get my food quickly.
