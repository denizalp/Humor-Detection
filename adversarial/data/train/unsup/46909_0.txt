This was my first Turkish pizza experience and I have to say, it was definitely good.  It was a hot summer day when I did take out here and with no \nA\/C, the restaurant can get really hot within the kitchen exposed.\n\nI order the lahmacun which is a Turkish pizza with marinated ground beef.  I thought it was full of flavor and I've heard it's a staple in Turkish culture.  It came with a side of veggies to top off your pizza and it also came with a sauce that was like ranch.  I will admit for those that can't handle spicy foods, it is a little bit spicy so beware.  At 11.49, I found this was great value as it's quite a bit of food and you'll finish with a satisfied stomach.\n\nThe service when ordering and picking up the food was great and the gentleman was very courteous throughout he process.  I will be sure to be back soon and try their other offerings!
