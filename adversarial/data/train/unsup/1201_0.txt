Excellent service from Brian and Dave following a small kitchen flood that leaked into the bedroom. They were the first service I called that could give me a firm time for an appointment, then beat that time. Couldn't have pleased me more because the smell was getting really rank. \n\nAnyway, these are the guys you want. Prompt service, quick call-backs, good equipment, and no upselling to special carpet protectant made from unborn virgin goat eyelids or whatever.
