Chipotle was just what I needed after a long week and a long drive. This place was busy during lunch and I think it was after 12:30pm. The prices on the menu were the same as other locations (as it should be). I ordered a steak burrito ($6.65) and a small soda ($1.60).  I can't say based on my one visit here, but it seems that they stuff the burrito to the max.  \n\nGood place to grab a burrito considering the places around.
