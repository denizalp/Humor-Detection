Good Mexican food and good prices, plenty of indoor and patio seating. You order at the counter and they call your number when your foods ready.\n\nOn today's visit I had the green Chile plate .. pork & green Chile, rice and beans .. the bf had the green Chile chimichanga with rice and beans on the side .. this was a lot of food \n\nMy only issue with this place is the staff is just taking orders .. cashiers are not friendly, they call your number and then leave the food on the counter and go back to the kitchen .. they left off the rice and beans from my bf food and I had to go back Inside to ask for it.. the girl went back got thw rice & beans and just handed them to me and went back to the kitchen .. I don't need extra attention but it's definitely weird ..
