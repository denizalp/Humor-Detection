This spot is 1\/3 health supplement store, 1\/8 tonic bar (has never looked open when I've visited?), and 1\/2 teaching space. The classes seem to be their big draw, as their selection of products is fairly small with only a few items in each category. As the signage indicates, the shop offers natural supplements and remedies to common issues such as aches, pains, sleep and anxiety aids, and the like. They also have a range of plant-based protein powders, a few snacks, and a handful of bottled juices.\n\nI had hoped to find a juice bar inside or a place to grab a quick lunch, like Rainbow's End- unfortunately this is not available at this time. I do not know if they have plans to expand their offerings, but they do have designated tables and chairs for an informal dining area. On-site classes, ranging from meditation, tai chi, qigong, and all sorts of informative meetings about the benefits of a raw food diet. Join their mailing list for store event and class information.
