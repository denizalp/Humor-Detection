Go here now!!! \nThis place is seriously a magical find! \nFirst time going here, we ordered a party pack for 3 people. At a very reasonable price, That came with 30 boneless wings, veggies, a huge box of fries, 3 pieces of buttery Texas toast and we added a large Mac and cheese. With the party pack we could also change the flavors per 10 and even though we only got 2(honey bbq&teriyaki) I have to say they were a fantastic ratio of sauce to meat. The boneless wings are so large no one (3 of 3) could finish their full 10 pieces and that is saying something! We even ended up having leftovers which in this house is unheard of on our movie nights!  Their fries are also very delicious even if I couldn't finish mine, their carrot and celery sticks where very fresh and my husband absolutely loved their Mac &cheese and toast.\nAll and all, I think we are just waiting for the next movie night to show up so we can order from here again!
