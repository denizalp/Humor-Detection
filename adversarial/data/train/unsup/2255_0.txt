Do not come here if you are a strict vegetarian.  All the ramen dishes come with pork, and you can substitute it for veggies, but all the broths are pork based.  One of my co-workers found out the hard way and left to find food elsewhere.  We felt bad, of course, but we have come so far from the office for the ramen.  I just hope he doesn't end up with the group of meth guys we saw panhandling on Dundas.\n\nThe place is small and we shared a table with some other patrons.  The ramen are around $10 and I ordered the most popular item - Tonkotsu ramen with regular noodles.  The other noodle options are thin and thick.\n\nThis is my first time trying the Tonkotsu and it did not disappoint.  The broth was creamy and delicious!  The egg was perfectly cooked and it made me wonder how they did that.  There must be a refined process.  The noodles were good and I enjoyed the entire ramen dish.  The pork was fatty and very tasty.\n\nWe came for lunch after 1pm and got seated right away.  The d√©cor was nice and modern.  The service was fast.
