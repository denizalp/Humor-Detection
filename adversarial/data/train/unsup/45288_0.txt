I purchased some premixed juices at 12 mg nicotine and I knew something was very wrong- I had to continually hit my kit and never felt the nicotine EVER.  Long story short they WERE NOT 12 mg nicotine not even close!!!  When I put some 6mg in my tank leftover from another store and took a couple of hits I finally got the satisfied nic hit that was missing for the Red Star GARBAGE! BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!
