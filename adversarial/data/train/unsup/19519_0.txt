I've come to the realization that there are two types of college students. Ones that spend all their time in the library and ones that spend no time in the library. The former already know most of what I'm about to say, but the latter should pay attention. This library is absolutely fantastic. During the semester it's open 7am-midnight, meaning it's available whenever you need to. Its 5 floors with so many study corners. There's tons of librarians who will help you with references and finding things for when you have that term paper. The design is pretty sick too, like its very open and relaxing. As someone who never used to use the library on campus, I definitely am a proponent of it to all students
