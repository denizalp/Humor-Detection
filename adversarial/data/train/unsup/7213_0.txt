Loathe this store, but it's the only spot on the west side with a good selection of dog foods and treats. Most everything else in the store is overpriced junk you could get on Amazon for 30% less. \n\nStaff, comprised mostly of high school tards, is rubbish; zero knowledge and not friendly at all. Customer service on par with a bad fast food joint.\n\nPrices are about average for high end foods, though how they're handled and stored at the store is questionable. The first bag I bought there was full of bugs (probably because of a small gash from a box knife that I didn't notice until I got home). Pretty nasty to see the food in your dog's bowl moving. They exchanged it, but it's a pain giving a 60 lb. bag of food rides around town. Operating a box knife isn't too difficult.\n\nIt's only saving grace is that it's conveniently located next to AJ's and a few blocks from BevMo. Other than that, find a better place for quality dog foods. I know I am...\n\nI like how the filtered reviews are obviously spam written by the merchant.
