I like good meatballs. Rao's is famous for that. Their New York location is always busy and they say the best way to try Rao's is by going to this location.\n\nWe tried the lasagna and the meatballs. We had a show to go to so we let them know ahead of time that we're a bit pressed on time. The service wasn't all that great and they weren't even busy.\n\nThe lasagna was good but nothing special. The meatballs were huuuuuge and tasty. I won't mind coming back for these balls but I'd probably take them to-go so, I don't have to deal with the service.
