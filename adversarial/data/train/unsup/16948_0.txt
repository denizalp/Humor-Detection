My sister is the Big Lots Queen.  She LOVES Big Lots!  No matter where we are, if she sees one, she has to stop.  This location is fairly close to me and she saw it and before I knew it, we were in the parking lot.  It's her addiction.  This store is fairly well kept.  I have been in other Big Lots that were just a mess.  The shelves are pretty neat here and I did not have to step around things on the floor.  Even the book eisle was neat.\n\nThis store has furniture.  Nice furniture.  Manufacturers like Ashley and other well known brands.  The prices are pretty resonable too.  And it wasn't just a few things, there were lots of sofas and love seats, end tables, lamps, desks and just about anything else you might need to furnish a home.  If I need some furniture, I will come back here and see what I can find.  \n\nMy sister was happy with the things she found and we satisfied her addiction for another day.  :)
