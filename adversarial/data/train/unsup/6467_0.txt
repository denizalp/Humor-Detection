Late to the Frost Bites party, but I'm officially joining the fan club. I decided to make the very long trek  all the down to Boulder Highway to get my fix. All the hype is true, definitely some snow. I am no expert, but I know what I like and this was a treat. \n\nI decided on the green tea and strawberry with condensed milk, strawberries and mochi. The strawberry was fabulous, I'm a sucker for fruity flavors so of the two flavors this was my favorite. The green tea was a lacked a little flavor for me, but was still tasty. The toppings were great too. \n\nThe texture was unlike anything I've had before, it's a little hard to describe but in a good way. The ice doesn't melt quickly, so it I didn't have to worry about eating it at lightening speed before it melted in the Vegas heat. I want to try cocount or mango next time for a change of pace, but I'll definitely be back.
