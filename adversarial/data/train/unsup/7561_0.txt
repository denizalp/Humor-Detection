This was one of the more affordable acrobatics shows at around $100 a ticket, and given the smaller venue, there wasn't a bad seat in the house. It also came highly recommended by our hotel concierge, and clearly Yelpers collectively love it. What I loved about the show were the acts--really impressive and had a risque edge. What I didn't love was some of the comedy, which were a bit cringeworthy in its execution. Raunchy humor can be hilarious if propped up with good delivery, but one dimensional potty humor just didn't do it for me. Thankful that the show wasn't just about the comedy routine.
