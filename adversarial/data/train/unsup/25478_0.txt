A wonderful family owned resturant. The delicious and fresh recipes were exceptional. Last week we ordered the hot and sour soup and was the best we have ever had anywhere. Tonight was another stunning meal. The potstickers, Scechuan beef, and the house specialty chow mein with noodles were expertly prepared with pride and care. The vegetables snapped with freshness and not over cooked like at most places. The owners are very friendly and gave us a warm and sincere greeting. Looking forward to going back and trying more menu items. Look no further if you want a delicious Chinese meal.
