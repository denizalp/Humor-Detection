Little Mediterranean restaurant with good choices on the menu if you're craving falafel \/ doner \/ kebab \/ hummus \/ pita. It's more of a sit-down restaurant rather than fast food, you'll get table service.\n\nThe falafel I ordered was fine - I certainly had tastier ones (overall it was bit dry and I was missing some more yogurt sauce). By reading the reviews here I was surprised that \"friendliness\" was mentioned by almost every Yelper. I didn't get a smile and a rather cold sent-off when I paid my $9.10 falafel with a $10 - not sure if tip was expected!
