Front desk staff went above and beyond to answer questions and meet our needs. After a minor issue with payment, our attendant was very understanding, helped us and was courteous with timing. We had 2 bays, due to card issue 1 was taking longer to reserve, so it was almost taken. When we informed the attendant who was trying to give it away, she was rude to the our attendant and was being condescending which none of us thought was ok to do in front of customers. There were 18 of us who witnessed this. Which is why I am giving a good rating, we had great\/excellent at service until we witnessed this.\nFood was GREAT, we had queso, chips were a little stale tasting, but not bad. I heard from friend the quesadillas were amazing, pretzels were good minus the cheese. I also heard the burger was amazing too. \nMusic could have been better, at random moments it would come blaring through, so more consistent or variety of music would be great!
