I went there this weekend for a cut and as soon as you walk in no personality what's so ever! Just \"sit down don't sign in\". Then I got this what seems to be a new guy at the end saying \"NEXT\".. So I go up basic hair cut start w a 1 at the bottom and tapper\/ fade to a 3 up top. Well the fade was something awful and worst of all he started doing my beard!!!  I was like wtf?!? NOOOOO! And of course he really messed it up and left a huge bear spot!!! I posted a pic of it in the gallery so just look at this crap!!! NEVER EVER GO HERE!!! I'm glad I have real barbers in Tucson!!!
