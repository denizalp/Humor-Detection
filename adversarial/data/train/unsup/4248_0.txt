Dumb dumb DUMB. Shame on me. I went back here again after I swore I wouldn't. Ordered a #4 combo - that's 2 cheeseburgers - plus diet coke, at the drivethru. Get my order and reach in the bag to feel around. I can feel a frickin BOX in there. Lo and behold, they've given me a single filet-o-fish in the bag!! Back home I take a sip of the diet coke, and stop dead. Give it to my wife. She confirms. It's regular coke. IDIOTS! This place should be shut down, it's the absolute worst McDonalds I have EVER experienced. INCREDIBLY annoyed, enough to write in to the head office.
