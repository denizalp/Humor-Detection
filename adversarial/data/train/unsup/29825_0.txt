So good!!! We have dairy, soy, and egg allergies. Blaze has an awesome interactive allergen menu in their website. I used that to make my choices and then ordered online. Pick up was as easy as walking in, grabbing my pies, and heading back out the door. Major points when you have a fussy four month old.\n\nWe got two pizzas, both with vegan cheese - one had applewood smoked bacon and it was YUM!!! Artichokes were also delicious. The best part, though, was the perfectly charred crust. No nasty, cardboard frozen Daiya pizza here!!\n\nWe'll be back - soon!!!
