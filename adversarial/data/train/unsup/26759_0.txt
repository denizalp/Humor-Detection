Oh wow! After seeing multiple Instagram posts of the macaroon ice cream sandwiches I had to try Ninety's out! I came around 9pm on a Friday and the plaza Ninety's is located in was packed! Inside the shop was busy, but surprising most people were ordering the homemade ice cream. They had about 12 different flavors, but my heart was set on the macaroon sandwich. \n\nI looked in the freezer and there had to be 15 different flavors. The ones that popped out the most were pistachio, peanut butter, play dough (cookie dough), birthday cake and strawberry shortcake. My husband and I decided the split the birthday cake macaroon ($5.95). Note they will cut it in half for you and it was easily big enough to split. \n\nOk the sandwich. Wow! The ice cream was cake batter mixed with cake pieces, sprinkles and frosting. And the macaroon was super soft! I thought it would be hard from the freezer, but I was wrong. It was such a perfect mix. Eating the ice cream and macaroon together was so delicious! This was probably one of my favorite ice cream treats Ive ever had. \n\nThere's also a lake near Ninety's where you can sit or walk around, plus they have paddle boats available. It would be a great little date night to enjoy the paddle boats and go for some Ninety's. \n\nI will definitely be back this summer!
