Well it's OK could be better let me share a few thoughts and observations\n\nIf you work the Night shift like I do and stop in there let's say around 2 o'clock in the morning to get something to eat your going to find yourself getting very cold fries or ones that are hard as a brick they probably been laying around for a few hours, and you may find your Burger not hot at all actually try cold \n\nI mean think about it you get off work it's late you stopped there to get something to eat and all you get for your 15 bucks is a cold burger and cold fries and its not like this is a one time thing this happen like seven times in the last three months
