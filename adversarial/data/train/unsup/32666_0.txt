This was our first time here (definitely not our last!) What a wonderful place to eat. From the moment we walked in, it was like we were their favorite customers. Samir, the owner, took our order. We took his recommendations and ordered the lamb shank and the Mediterranean chicken. Both came with soup. The lentil was very good. The tomato soup was the BEST I have ever had!!! So creamy and flavorful. I grew up Catholic and had my share of tomato soup every Friday during Lent, so this is not a soup that I would normally order.  I could have eaten a gallon of it!\nThe lamb shank was SO TENDER! It fell off the bone. And the chicken was delicious! \nAnd then Samir brought us the pudding (on the house). We would never have ordered it (cakes & pies are our \"go to\" desserts) but will order it next time! It's made with rose water...a very creamy and light dessert. \nOf course we couldn't help but order a few Lebanese beers and a shot of Ouzo. \nWe will for sure be going back!\nDerek & Gail
