I enjoy the food here, portions are always huge and usually enough for two to share. I recently tried a limited time menu item, Fire roasted artichoke appetizer $9.99 and found it to be subpar.  I'm typically nervous about getting an appetizer because I worry I'll be too full to eat my meal, but this wasn't the case with the artichoke, I complained to my dinner guest that I couldn't get a single bite off of any of the leaves. Disappointed.  Otherwise, I always like the food here.
