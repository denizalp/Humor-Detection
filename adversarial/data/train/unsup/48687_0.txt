Jim E from Mason Mechanical has come out to my house for regular maintenance calls three times now. He is knowledgeable and explains things in ways I can understand easily. He gives me advice to save money and offers to keep an eye on small things instead of just replacing expensive parts right off the bat. \n\nWhen Jim comes by, I feel like he's a trusted family advisor. I highly recommend Mason Mechanical and Jim Emmons.
