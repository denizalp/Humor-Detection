When you need crickets for your gecko and it's getting late, and the poor thing has to eat, you can jump in here to grab a dozen or so and get on your way with medium speed.\n\nSometimes you gotta wait just a bit for the staff to help you out (it seems that most pet stores these days are a little understaffed if you get more than a couple of customers in there), but that's only a mild inconvenience when you're shopping for your beloved cricketeater.\n\nHaven't used them for anything else than that--but most Petsmarts have the same thing this one does--dog food, cat food, birds, reptiles, and all the stuff you'll need to keep them properly fed, housed, clean, and even dressed.
