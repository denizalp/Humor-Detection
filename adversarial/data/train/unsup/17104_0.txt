Warning:  This review is going to bring out my inner Negative Nancy.  Please forgive me...I must be in a 'mood' today.\n\nLet's start at the beginning, House of Taipei has been one of my most frequented restaurants in Huntersville for the last few years.  I eat there at least once a week and will continue to eat there (even after I write this review).  Overall, they are wonderful.  The food is consistently good with very quick service.  They are very generous with their wine pours (even though I'm a bit skeptical that you get the kind of wine you actually order- I am a wine lover and it always seems that every kind of wine at House of Taipei tastes the same).  \n\nNow, for the negatives...\n-I have a love for spicy food- no matter how many times I ask for \"extra spicy,\" the food is never, ever spicy!  Even when I order dishes (like Black Pepper Chicken) that are supposed to be spicy, it isn't and it makes me sad.  =(\n-I saw a roach.  Ugh, gross, disgusting, etc etc etc!  Now, let's be honest, you'd be hard-pressed to find any kind of establishment that doesn't have at least one creepy-crawly.  Here's the problem- I DON'T WANT TO SEE A ROACH CRAWLING ON THE WALL RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME WHILE I'M STUFFING MY FACE WITH CRISPY SCALLION CHICKEN!!!!  I quickly called the waitress over, she freaked out, called another waiter over, who proceeded to grab a napkin (a cloth one, mind you.... I may never use a napkin there again either), and SMASH the roach on the wall 3 feet in front of my head.  I couldn't finish my dinner and they weren't even embarrassed or apologetic.  Gross Gross Gross!!!\n\n\nAll roaches aside, I really do love House of Taipei and have every intention of going there again (but I need some time to forget about the critter).  \n\nIf you haven't tried it, you should.  Their prices are wonderful and you rarely have to wait for a table.
