Food is as normal but this place is hella dirty! The chairs were covered in tomatoes, sauce, and worst off some dirty person from before had dog hair all over them and left it all over the seats! How gross. There were no workers on the floor cleaning the dirty tables so my friends and I had to clean it up by ourselves which means all the food and crap went onto the ground.\nIt just seems this place has no pride or ownership and especially during the busy lunch hour from 12-3.\nAlso as we stare at the glad to look outside because we want to enjoy the sun since we don't get to at work, the glass is also filthy. Covered in scratch marks and finger prints! There is no way that since the last shift that all that dirtiness can come that quickly. My friends and I know that they are just lazy here. \nFor a 8-9 burrito\/bowl plz chipotle get your shit together!
