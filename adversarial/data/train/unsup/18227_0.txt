Executive summary: Average food with more than above average prices. A disappointing lunch for two was 85 dollars (no alcohol). \n\nDeviled eggs - very nice texture on the white of the egg but the yoke filling was rather bland. The egg itself was of high quality that's for sure. \n\nSmoked brisket sandwich - flavorless. The meat was rather fatty and the bun was somewhat soggy by the time it arrived to the table. \n\nCrunchy Yardbird sandwich - arrived cold and rubber-like texture. I had to send this one back and the replacement at least came out hot but the quality of the chicken just wasn't there. Dark meat with a nearly flavorless breading overly deep fried. \n\nYou should be seeing a pattern by now; flavorless food. \n\nArnold Palmer to drink...supposedly this is the Arnold Palmer of champions, with lemon infused ice cubes. Well, it was a decent Arnold Palmer, if you like tons of sugar added (I don't), but the lemon infused ice cubes were nowhere to be found. \n\nSmoked chocolate coffee cake with coffee ice cream. Unfortunately this was the highlight of the meal, and I had no intention going in to have dessert. The coffee cake came out as a full loaf hot and fresh from the oven but only a very small scoop of ice cream to accompany it. \n\nService was pretty good. Received a visit from two managers and the chef...no doubt because of the send-back of their signature sandwich. \n\nAll in all...a big let down especially when you consider the price paid for substandard food. I dare say (if I actually were to consume fast food) that KFC or a chain BBQ place such as Lucille's offer better taste and value. This is yet another tourist trap.
