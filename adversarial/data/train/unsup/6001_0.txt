We stopped here on our way home from our little trip to Kalahari.  My kids love this place so we figured what the heck.\n     This was just your typical CiCi's with the same ole' pizza choices, pasta and small salad bar.  My kids think the pizza is the best but I think that they know when they are done, we will let them play for awhile in the arcade.  \n     The service was average but they did keep the pizza's fresh and stocked on the buffet table.  They do have a new desert pizza which was dough topped with custard, sweet white icing and chocolate drizzle.  Was actually pretty tasty.\n     This was a great way to end our trip as it made the kids happy and we enjoy watching them be happy.
