It's at the far end of the strip, and it's not completely \"vegasy\". Which I liked. Not a lot of fanfare, no tiger shows, no dolphin habitats, no magicians, no roller coaster, no celebrity shows, no fancy restaurant. \nIt never got too crowded, and taxi's were always available to snag.\n\nAvoid the check out lines and use your t.v. remote to pay your bill.\n\nThe only downside was the pool area. Tiny, crowded, and no waterfalls. :(
