Only five dollars off per pair, but that's fine. However...even though their email sent to me upon registering said 'free shipping, free returns, free exchanges' across the top with absolutely no asterisks indicating any exceptions. \n\nAn exception occurred upon checkout of a $12 charge of shipping per pair of shoes. I was ordering 3 pair so an additional charge of $36 total. First of all at checkout it said that free shipping wasn't available 'for my destination'. I live in a major city, a capitol city. So why for 'my destination'...\n\nAfter several emails with customer service asking why this occurred she FINALLY stated that shoes on sale did not qualify for free shipping even though their email did not indicate this...at all. \n\nAccording to her she claimed the following (in this order) during our email exchanges:\nShipping costs are set by the courier\nShoes on sale do not qualify for free shipping\nThey don't make money off of the shipping charge\n\nI explained to her that it made absolutely NO sense to put shoes on sale if they actually didn't make money off the shipping because they would make more money off the sale of their shoes by NOT putting them on sale and that would save their customers money on shipping costs and therefore would not lose sales. \n\nAfter this exchange she said she would just forward my concerns on to 'management'. I am sure this is because she could not reply with countering my logic because there was no way she would do so without insulting my intelligence further.
