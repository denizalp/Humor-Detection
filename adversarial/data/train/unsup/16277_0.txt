It's about time for sure. I'm fairly certain that Michael Symon opening a place in Strongsville is one of of The Seven Signs, but until our planet bursts into flames I'll be enjoying B Spot. \n\nWe've been fans of Michael and wife Liz since first meeting them at Players so many years ago. Liz ran the front of the house and Michael did his thing in the kitchen. Seeing their success has been truly awesome as two more deserving people we don't know. \n\nLOVE Lola, LOVE Lolita and we love B Spot.  It's done with typical Simon attention to detail, creativity, and value. Is it cheap? No, but it's not outrageous by any stretch. If you want cheaper there's a Five Guys right across the street. Like virtually everything in life you get what you pay for, and B Spot is no different. \n\nWe shared a burger and fries and both were done to perfection.  My wife had a great beer which wasn't hard as their selection is awesome. We sat at the bar and Mike (not THAT Mike) took very good care of us. \n\nWe will absolutely be back and very soon. To think we live 15 minutes from here...wow, never thought I'd see the day! Totally cool.
