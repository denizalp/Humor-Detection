They are fairly new in town, a long with a few other Thai joints all in a few miles of one another. Taste of Thai has risen to the top of that crowd. We have had take out from them several times and have never been disappointed. We haven't had a bad dish yet and the ones we have tried include: garlic lover, pad thai, green curry, and the coconut soup. The soup was the only thing I wasn't blown away by and would likely not order again. The curry was my favorite; hubby really enjoyed the garlic lover. They know how to bring the Thai heat. Have yet to try the bacon fried rice, but it catches my eye every time.
