Pretty good food....hefty servings and awesome flavor, you will leave full and tiredâ€¼ The fried chicken is yum and overall it's worth the $$ you pay to dine. I gave my review 4 stars because the waitress forget our drink order during our second visit (we had lunch at the Yardbird on Friday as well).
