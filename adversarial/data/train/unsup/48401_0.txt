First visit early dinner. Chicken spring rolls, super soup with shrimp and chicken, pad thai chicken, coconut ice cream, malbec wine. Everything delicious and fresh.  We stuck to basic dishes for our first visit.  I will definitely adventure next visit.  The soup had lots of vegetables cabbage,  carrots,  zucchini,  cauliflower,  peas.  The pad thai noodles were tasty  with raw cabbage,  carrots,  green onion,  bean sprouts,  and peanuts on the side.
