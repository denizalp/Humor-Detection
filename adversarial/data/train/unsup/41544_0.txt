The wife and I love Zebra -- sure, it isn't the sort of place you'd go every month given the cost, but we've been very pleased with the experience the three times we've gone. \n\nPart of it is that we have an emotional connection -- when we returned from the vacation where we got engaged, Zebra was where we chose to go to celebrate. \n\nI've only had one dish there - the Lamb Diablo - a dish so good I find myself awaking in the night, licking my lips thinking about it. \n\nZebra will continue to be a favorite -- a once-in-a-while restaurant for when we're feeling in the mood for a special night out.
