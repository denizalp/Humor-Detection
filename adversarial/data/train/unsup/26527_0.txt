Been here one time only but it very much satisfied my ramen drought since when in Sacramento.\nGreat ramen bowl, good flavor and presentation, only one caveat, NOT BIG ENOUGH !(for me- lol)\n\nSo go, you won't be left with bad taste in your buds, just more desire for more times eating this great bowl of noodles.\n\nI got the everything w\/oil, spicy and pork, yumm !\n\n(EDIT about my returning to this RAMEN bowl.)\n\nI've returned, yes I have...\nWonderful, nourishing and flavorful !\nMaybe better flavor now because I know what I'm getting.  Just GOOOOOOOO, you'll be  !
