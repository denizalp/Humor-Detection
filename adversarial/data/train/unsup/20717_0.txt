Chef Vee to the rescue!\n\nI planned a bachelor party for 15 guys in Vegas and we wanted to have someone cook meals at the house we rented during our stay in Vegas. I searched Yelp for a private chef and saw Chef Vee's food pics - they looked BOM! But you know how it is, a picture is one thing, but is the food good?  Chef Vee got back to me quickly, and not only did she agree to cook for TWO days for me and my crew, she planned a perfect menu for 15 hungry dudes!  Everything she made was awesome - fried chicken & waffles, this amazing cinnamon roll-on-a-stick thing, jack daniel's glazed ribeye, shrimp & grits, mac & cheese egg rolls (right?!), and a whole bunch of other stuff. She did all of the shopping & prepared all of the food fresh in our rental home's kitchen. And all of the fellas loved it!  If you're in doubt, questioning if this is the right person for your upscale private event, casual dinner party, or private chef needs, stop it. Call, email, text, just DO IT. She will make sure that your event is fantastic...at least from the food's perspective!
