My wife and I went out for a date night at Zeppelin over their opening weekend and our overall experience was fantastic. The food was delicious, and our server Brittney was friendly and attentive. Our biggest complaint is that they do not accept reservations, but instead use the no wait app. You can't put your name on the list until you're within 5 miles of the restaurant and with a 60 minute wait, you're still waiting quite a while in the restaurant. As for the food, it is tapas style, and it all came out about the same time. The collards and apples salad was delicious! The Granny Smith apples, sweet potatoes, and collards mesh so well together I almost forgot I was eating a salad! The Maine Lobster and Avocado Toast was very flavorful, and presented very nicely. Our \"entree\" was the buttermilk poached kettle fried chicken. The server told us when we ordered that it was spicy, she did not tell a lie. I've never tried Nashville hot chicken, but it has to be of a similar spice level. The habanero vinaigrette really puts a kick in this dish. If you don't like spice, I would pass on the chicken even though it was very good, I think... (my mouth may still be on fire). Overall a great restaurant where you can relax without being rushed and have a delicious meal.
