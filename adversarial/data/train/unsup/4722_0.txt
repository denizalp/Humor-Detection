When asking \"where do you go when you come to Charlotte?\" This place is always mentioned. Followed by \"GET THE SHRIMP AND GRITS!\" So, I did what I was told LOL! \n\nFor parking, there is a small parking lot in the front but you can also park in the rear area. I was told that we went at a good time (Saturday around 4pm) because if we waited longer, we would have had to wait. Everyone also says that this place is POPPIN' right after the club let's out especially since it is 24 hours. It's a great place to people watch.\n\nYou can tell that the waitresses were hustlers. They made sure they claimed their table and also made sure that you were helped. I ordered the Shrimp and grits and yes. YES. YES. .. y - e - s. Everything was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend got a philly cheese steak and he said it was good. He also ordered mac and cheese and also another side of fries. The fries were \"basic\" and not really special, but they were good.\n\nShay, our waitress took great care of us also. She made sure that our glasses were full. \n\nBathrooms were clean and it was appreciated. The floors were also clean around the restaurant. Will def be back when I come back to Charlotte.
