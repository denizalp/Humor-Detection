This is probably my favorite restaurant in Summerlin.  If you're going to splurge this is the place to do it.  From the minute you walk in the door you are greeted by very warm and friendly staff.  Our server, Jeff, was outstanding (as usual)!  He was able to go be us some great suggestions with wine pairings.  The grilled octopus and halibut was very delicious!  Highly recommend Vitner grill!
