When I die and go to food heaven I imagine that it would look just like the Cheese Boutique. I have been a long time customer of this food mecca, from the days up on Bloor Street and now hidden down on Ripley Avenue. In terms of being a one stop for all your epicurean needs the Cheese Boutique is five star. They carry fresh produce, have a small butcher case, prepared foods, a monster selection of olive oils, pastas, food condiments and also have a dessert case. The only thing missing at the CB is a wine & beer license!!!!  I would love to sit down with a house cheese plate and a glass of the grape.  It would be pure manna.  \n\nOne of the really cool features of the store is the cheese humidor in the centre of the building. It is a temperature controlled room where they age cheeses and charcuterie. It was in there I found a very cool cheese called Lemon Fetish. You just so have to love a food with the word fetish in it! It's a small round of semi-soft cow's milk cheese with ground up lemon zest rubbed into it forming the rind. It hails from Prince Edward County which is the up and coming cheese region in the province. The CB also carries a large selection of Quebec artisanal cheeses and those guys behind the counter know there cheese stuff! The store also has an amazing selection of breads which being the carbo junkie I am works for me. \n\nThis is a store with tons of nooks and crannies so be ready to spend some time wandering around. The CB hosts an series of food tastings featuring some of T.O.'s best chefs. It is definitely worth checking it out. Just make sure to hang on to your bank card....this ain't a bargain spot and it doesn't take long to add up the price tag. What you get though is worth every single penny. \n\nThere is parking available which is also very handy. You can have quick access right off the Queensway.
