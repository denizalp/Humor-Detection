First of all, every negative review has been on point. In the last 6 months my AC unit has gone out 4 times - each time the same company, Residential Service Center was dispatched for fixing. This last time, the service technician blamed the issue on a previous employee (yet reassured they're no longer with the company). One day later, the AC stopped working again. I called the emergency telephone number and spoke with an individual that could care less about my concerns. They told me someone would contact me today, however that hasn't happened yet. I now have to put my tenants in a hotel for the weekend. Until this is resolved I will be telling everyone I know to stay far away from this shoddy, questionably-fraudulent company.
