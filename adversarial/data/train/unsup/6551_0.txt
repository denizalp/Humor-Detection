Ok\nI LOVED their lobster dinner wtih mango risotto.  LOVED IT.  Well worth the $36.\n\nReason for 4 stars?  I didn't like their desserts.... which was what I was most excited for.\n\nI got the smores tart, which was to be a graham cracker crust with chocolate ganache and marshmellow.  Sounds amazing, yes?  \nIt was just ok.\nReason for it just being ok, the chocolate ganache filling tasted straight up like pudding.  Puddin'.  Seriously.\nBig let down.\n\nMy hubby got the chocolate creme brulee.... and it... tasted just like..... wait for it.....\nwaittttttttt for it................\n\nPUDDIN'!\n\nWTF?!!?\n\nAghhhhhhhhh!!!\n\nI do, however, REALLY love that this place is BYOB, so I shall return and give them another chance at dessert.
