This is our go to place when we are in the Central Phoenix area.  We usually go for dinner and it's usually crowded.  Today for an early brunch, it was not too busy.  This was great because we always feel stressed out ordering because there are so many options to choose from.  I recommend the two enchiladas, on 50\/50 mix tortilla with a mix of pork and cornbread, or pork and mashed potatoes.... I know, sounds super weird, but it's super good.  I get all the toppings and when I remember, I ask for an over easy egg.  I usually get the super spicy sauces, and they are spicy, but not overpowering.  \n\nThe food is excellent and the service is top notch as well.  \n\nWhy not 5 stars?  Complicated menu that gets easier when you go frequently, and you can hardly hear the employees because of the glass barrier.\n\nExcited to see they have a location on Camelback now. Will have to try it as it's closer to my North Phoenix location.
