What a  complete disaster.  Ceiling tiles all torn off throughout parts of the airport. Dripping water from a leaky roof.  Dull carpeting down the concourse hallways.  If a visitor's first impression of Charlotte is from its airport, I wouldn't blame him or her for not wanting to see the city!   Perhaps this is why Amazon didn't make Charlotte a top city for consideration of a headquarter's city.     If the inside is not bad enough, the outside is also awful.   The white walls outside the baggage claim area are filthy dirty and need painting.   As I travel throughout the country and other parts of the world, I get to see all the artistic things that are done in other airports and I wonder why my city can't make the same thing happen.  It's past time.  Way past time.
