One word: Burgasm.\n\nIf you're searching for a burger joint in Toronto, this is the place to be.\n\nHeard lots of good things about this place from other peeps, and it definitely does not disappoint.\n\nMore of a place to takeout and enjoy elsewhere but if you can find a stool (out of the 5 or so there), I'd say enjoy it while it's hot off the grill.\n\n\"The Priest\" consists of a double-ground-cheeseburger underneath a cheese-stuffed-panko-breaded-deep-fried-portabello-mushroom (comically named \"The Option\" which can be ordered by itself for our vegetarian friends).  I caution you that you should probably work up an appetite for this delicious monster.  The first bite will send the stuffed cheese in \"The Option\" to flow so it gets a bit dicey in your hands.  I honestly have to say that the combination of the meat, the cheese and the mushroom really hit the mark.  The only complaint was that I couldn't really appreciate the meat until I took a bite by itself.  Because of the double-grind, it's a bit looser and retains a lot more juicy meat flavour.\n\nFries were average for me (but this is a guy who doesn't eat McDonalds).  The cut were strikingly similar to McD's (as I remember them), but a tad oversalted.  I'm more of a freshcut fry kinda guy, so the next outing I'll probably just save my calories and cash for the burgers on their own.
