Great fun!  Great show!  What a great way to spend an afternoon.  The show was funny and the magic tricks were very cleaver.  Sometimes they are so fast and suttle you do not realize the tricks are taking place.  Mac King is a great entertainer.  Especially good for the family.\nI took my husband and mother after reading the reviews.  yelpers got this one right.
