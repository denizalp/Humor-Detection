Whoa WTF was I thinking.\n\nI honestly never go to these types of places. I now understand why. \n\nAs soon as I walked in I was confused and dazed. I had no idea where anything was at. \n\nThere was only 3 people in the store including myself. (4 if you include the nitwit behind the register) \n\nAny way I was looking for some meal replacement shakes, that were within my budget. \nI looked and looked but didn't seem to find anything that I understood.(I wanted to know what my best options were)\n\n I literally walked around the store for 10 minutes,  hoping that the rep. would offer some insight. \nHe was too busy conducting personal business with a mechanic. Something about repairs. \n\nI ended up leaving all I bought was one of those shaker cups. \n\nNever again my friend, never!
