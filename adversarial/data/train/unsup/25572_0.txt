this cafe is decorated beautifully and the employees are open and friendly. I got a caramel iced latte and the turkey caprese. the latte was SO good. for some reason it tastes very unique  from the other caramel lattes i get at other uptown coffee shops and i was pleasantly surprised. The caprese was tastey although the turkey itself was on the dry side. Overall i fell in love with this place. They also have kombucha on tap which i thought was really neat.
