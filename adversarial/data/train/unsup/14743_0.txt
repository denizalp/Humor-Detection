Looking through the other Yelps on this place, it seems there's a mixed bag of experiences.  As for me?  Tempted as I am to write a THEthemed THEreview (I know you're groaning inside), I will refrain.\n\n5 stars.  This is especially for the front desk, where I felt very well taken care of, as well as the room and amenities.  I'm a fan of dark stained wood, and there's plenty of it all over this place.  Strip side view from the 34th floor was killer, beds were super comfortable, and I had an LCD television in the bathroom.  I know... TMI, but nice! lol... Kudos to the staff, and well worth it for a memorable weekend.
