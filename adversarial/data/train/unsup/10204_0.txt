I'm not sure why they are only a 2 1\/2 star? We don't have many Hawaiian BBQ places here in AZ, however I'd say Ono's is one of my favorites. I've ordered the Chicken Katsu, Short Ribs, and BBQ beef, and everything is always delicious. I absolutely love their Mac Salad as well. They also have different combos so that you can try a little bit of everything. \n\nTheir customer service isn't great, and if you want super authentic Hawaiian food, well you'll have to go to Hawaii, however for what they have, I'd say it's pretty good.
