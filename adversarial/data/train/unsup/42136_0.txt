This is my new favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. This is a quality restaurant!The restaurant is elegant and clean. There is a bar with a tv screen playing Indian music with dancers. The tables and dinnerware are clean and the chairs are comfortable. The host seated us quickly with no wait time, allowing us to select our own table. There were several other patrons on a Sunday night after seven in the evening. The food is delicious. The menu is has many selections which include chicken, shrimp, fish,  and vegetarian, and I believe vegan dishes, all reasonably priced. I have eaten at a few other Indian restaurants, including one in New York City, and one in Ohio, and another in the Phoenix area, but this one is the best because the food tastes like it is definitely made from scratch, being very fresh, and both appetizers and entrees are generous, delicious portions. My husband ordered a spinach and rice dish, and I ordered chicken curry. All food arrived promptly, very warm and perfectly mildly seasoned as we had ordered it.  We also ordered two appetizers, onion rings with mint sauce and another sauce and boneless chicken, as well as a bowl of tasty, long-grain rice, and  beer and Pelegrino for our beverages. The appetizers were prepared in a light batter of chickpea flour, fried in soy oil. We had generous portions of everything, enough to bring some home for a midnight snack. We were too satisfied to eat dessert, but hope to try those too on our next visit. The service was prompt and friendly. The owner took the time to come over to our table and introduce himself and to make sure that we were happy with the service and the food. We had a friendly conversation with him. This restaurant is one that I would recommend to anyone who wants authentic Indian cuisine with a variety of cuisine. We look forward to eating at the Taj Mahal again very soon!
