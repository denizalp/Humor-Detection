The food was good tonight. But the waiter is another story . I asked him for another glass of root beer and the waiter said ( I have other tables) like I don't know that . You don't telll your customers that at all . I just made a comment he asked if I wanted the check and said yes , unless you are paying for it . He said in a very rude tone NO IM NOT PAYING FOR IT . I was just joking around with him . It took him over 20 minutes to bring 2 togo boxes
