I have what they call \"Asian Boy Hair\" - fine, light, and thin.  Or was that how I like my girls....!? \n\nMaybe it's both!  Anyways I met Cindy through the Ms. Chinese Pageant.  No I wasn't in the pageant, she was!  Just to let you know and there were fine, light, and thin gals there - Wink!\n\nNeedless to say, Cindy's service is number one!  She does is all; hair, makeup and the whole Shebang!  Got a wedding!?  Well I don't, but I'm pretty sure you do.  Cindy also does large events and gatherings.  So in case you need someone reliable, professional, and proud of her work and business; CW is the one to count on!  \n\nI've been here for years and will keep coming back.  Us guys have a small hair fetish and we want consistency and someone that understands our style.  CW understands me, aside that we both speak Cantonese!  She is fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese so no need for a translator for you Chinese speaking peeps.  Cindy is located in the strip mall at a store front called Salon Karizma.  Perfect title for a CW, since someone has to make this Asian Boy look good with confidence and charisma! - Enjoy!
