Got a tattoo here a few months ago by Mario. I'm satisfied with the results of my tattoo, but the overall experience was a little meh. Mostly because I came in with a friend and they treated her quite differently than they treated me. I have red and black hair, and multiple tattoos. I had an idea in my head, and didn't bring a photo with me. My friend is brunette and only has one other tattoo. She brought in a photo of exactly what she wanted. Mario gave her a really hard time about doing it exactly how it is in the photo. I understand as an artist you want to be more original, but if somebody is going to pay you, especially for a simple 20 minute tattoo, then I think you should just do it. My tattoo was drawn up quick and done even quicker, because it was just a simple word in old school font. Hers took probably 3 times the time it should have, and she was so upset with how it was turning out that she wouldn't let him finish and left in tears. Not only was it unfinished, and not at all how she wanted it, but she had to pay to have another artist fix it, and it took FOREVER to heal because he basically jabbed the needle so hard into her ankle that it ended up getting infected. You may prefer to do more original work, but YOU aren't the one with this on your body forever. If you don't like a tattoo, and don't want to do it how the person wants it... then say no, and send them to another artist. It's as simple as that.
