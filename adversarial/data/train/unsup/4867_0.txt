How can you not be a fan of one of the cheapest places to get gas right when you get to Vegas?\n\nJay's always seem to have low prices and if you're driving from California, Jay will surprise you with his less than $4 pricing.\n\nI've yet to go to the actual market so this rating is for the gas station. Seriously, cheap. Yeah, did I mention, cheap! And it's not some cheap gas, it's actual Shell. So yeah, go look for the Shell station on Flamingo and Koval.
