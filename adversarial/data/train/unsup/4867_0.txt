Signs of a BAD Car Rental Company:\n\n1.   4 associates. 2 customers including me waiting to be helped.  20 min wait.  \n\n2.  Running to the car, and one rep to point out an available car.  Super nice guy, but grandpa needs to find another job.  \n\n3.  International an tourist renters flock to this company.  Waited another 15 mins for a family of four to ask a question and change cars.  \n\n4.  Finally got in my car rental.  No fucking keys.  Are u serious?!?!!?!!!??!!!!!\n\n5.  Returned the car on time.  Sir, need your gas receipt.  Huh?   Any car over 10 miles you must show proof of a gas receipt or it's 10 bones a gallon.  The effing gas needle didn't move an inch.   Completely full according to the meter.   \n\nFook u dollar.  Congrats , you won the worst car rental company award in Vegas. \n\nEnterprise you have a customer for life.
