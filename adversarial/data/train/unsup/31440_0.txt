Scott and his crew at Exclusive Tree Service did a fantastic job! I had two mature ficus trees (one in front yard, one in the backyard).  Neither had been trimmed for years, branches from the tree in front were brushing against the roof, and branches from the tree in back were seriously overgrown and completely obscured\/covered a struggling orange tree.\n\nScott responded to my initial inquiry within a few hours, arrived at my house for the estimate exactly on time, and provided a very competitive bid.  He and his crew started work when promised and finished the job a little ahead of time!  They worked hard, left my trees looking terrific, and cleaned up so that you couldn't tell they were even there!\n\nScott's knowledge and experience were key factors in my decision to hire him and I couldn't be happier.  He took out branches that needed to come out while leaving a healthy tree with plenty of branches and an attractive shape.  I highly recommend Scott and Exclusive Tree Service for your tree needs!
