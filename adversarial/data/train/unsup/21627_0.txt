Naked City Pizza is amazing however the bar service needs work starting with management.  Visited on a Friday evening and sat at the bar with my girlfriend.  Chris was the bartender who waited on us and was great.  He spoke about his twin brother and stories which were entertaining.  Once he left the bar was left to Jenny Lyn Johnston who never waited on us once.  She bounced around everywhere else talking and serving others around us.  We wanted to leave but since they had my credit card for the tab we were stuck until Jenny noticed us.  My girlfriend waived held her arm out several times to wave Jenny down but she literally ignored us.  I finally had to yell out can I get our check before Jenny finally noticed us.  Jenny then went on and on about how her dad passed away and she was talking with her friends she hasn't seen and etc.  I told her as apologetic I am about your fathers passing I don't know what that has to do with her serving everyone else and flat out ignoring us to which she tried saying she did Ng see us which was impossible unless she is blind.  I asked her to tell me if she served one drink since we been here for two hours eating and drinking in which she just gave me a blank stare and finally said just don't come back and she was the bar manager.  I told her obviously her manager needs to watch her more because her service was terrible.\n\nJenny should not be working or managing a bar at all.
