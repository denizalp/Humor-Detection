Domino's just recently popped up on my radar within the last year or so. One day I got a Domino's gift card (random) and POOF! I was hooked. According to my husband, Domino's has made a real comeback. I don't know what \"old\" Domino's tasted like, so I can't attest to their so-called new debut. One thing I do know - Domino's pizza is tasty. And cheap. Wait that's two things. Ah well you catch my drift! The crust is flavorful and the cheese tastes REAL. The ingredients used are always super fresh. Yummy for my tummy! \n\nWhen you place an order online, you can track your order's progress in real time. Example: Andrew just put your pizza in the oven at 5:36PM. That's pretty cool. \n\nI've never had an order mix-up or any kind of problem at the Aliante location. Ordering and picking up is as easy as 1-2-3. Whenever I want a cheap pizza night, Domino's is my go-to.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #07
