Biggest slices of pizza I've EVER had. Although thinnest too. I had one slice per meal and it was plenty. At 3$ something including tax, it's an amazing deal. \n\nThey had special topping like pesto, which was very rich, although it was meatless. The pizzas were also kind of dry and were not warm when I bought it. At least they weren't oily. They were also a bit hard on the teeth. The most efficient way to eat it for me was to fold it in half.\n\nWould've been better also if there were places to seat. But bonus points for glass bottled coke and sprite. Overall, still really enjoyed it, but I would rather try all the other good restaurants around next time instead.
