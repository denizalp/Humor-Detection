Delicious! \n\nAfter 6 nights of steak and seafood, we decided we needed a change. I caved in to my husband's wish to try Wing Lei even though I thought I was over Chinese food since I haven't had any that I really liked in years. Lord have mercy, if all Chinese food tasted like this I would have it every day. \n\nBe warned, this is not your local take-out place. It is a fabulous and fancy restaurant with prices to match. Although I am not sure why anyone would expect it to be anything less than expensive being a Wynn restaurant. It was worth every penny and there are no complaints from me. \n\nThe restaurant was lovely. The waiter, his assistants, and the sommelier were amazing and provided stellar service. You probably shouldn't wear your shorts and sandals, but you definitely don't need to be in a jacket. \n\nI had Three Cup Chicken, my husband had Garlic Beef Tenderloin, and we shared an order of Sichuan Green Beans. Although spicy, they were the best green beans I have ever had in my life - without exaggeration. And both of our meals were packed with flavor, to the point we were both making happy noises with our mouths after each bite. (how annoying for those around us!) \n\nI look forward to eating here again next time we are in LV.
