This is a bold statement to make but here it goes: THE BEST PIZZA IN THE CITY.\n\nThere are different types of people and we all got our preferences. Some of us like 'em a little top heavy with masses of... toppings. While others are more fond of the bountiful cushion that's found a bit lower - the crust. Since I'm a girl who admires a bit of wealth on a guy, I tend to go for the dough. And the bread on these pizzas is phenomenal! I'm not usually about that thin-crust life, which is why I love this place. It's so soft and wonderful to bite into when it comes out of their wood ovens.\n\nWhat makes me love this place more is that they're very accommodating. \nWant to remove a topping? You got it! \nWant to add a topping? Done. \nWant to faceplant into your pizza? Go right ahead! \n\nI got their namesake the via mercanti which was good, but I prefer the regular pizzas. The via mercanti is a pizza on top of a pizza. This should be tasty but I found it a bit overwhelming. Personally, I pick a pizza off their menu with toppings I like and\/or sub whatever I don't. I always add mozzarella where appropriate. Portions are quite big so you can definitely share. Add chilli to tailor the spice level if you need it. Service is amazing here and there is always plenty of seating!
