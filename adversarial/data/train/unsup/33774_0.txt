I can not say enough positive things about Scott, Mike, and ABT. Responsive, fast, clean, professional, honest, clear pricing, and on and on. You truly need look no further! \n\nUpdate: Two days before our walk-in closet was updated, we realized what better time to get rid of funky fluorescent lighting! Scott and Mike made it happen Just That Fast! Wonderful, wonderful company!!
