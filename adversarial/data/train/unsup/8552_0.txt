I don't like eggplant, never have. So why did I order the Eggplant Parmigiana Hot Sub my first time at Mamma Mia's? ...I don't know. Weird, huh? Yeah, well, I'm glad I did, it was delicious, and certainly not short on cheese. MMMM... cheese. Actually stopped by here with a friend a few weeks back after seeing the good reviews on Yelp, but I guess we missed the part about there only being one table and a few other seats inside, and we were in the mood for something a little... bigger. But I kept them in mind, and this time I just wanted take-out. I was in and out in just a few minutes, and the staff was very pleasant. They also deliver, which I will definitely be taking advantage of in the future. And love the Yelp sticker on the door.\n\nOh, also got a cannoli. Yum. The last one, too. So if you were that guy behind me in line that missed out, well, tough titties. You snooze, you lose, pal.
