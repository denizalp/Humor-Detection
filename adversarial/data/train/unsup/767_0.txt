Insert Coins is located in the older part of Vegas, and as I discovered is quite the gem. It's essentially a bar, with a DJ spinning near a dance floor, and all the old arcade games you (may have) heard about like Tron, Star Wars, House of the Dead, Pac Man and Michael Jackson's Moonwalk. Regardless of your affinity, or lack of, for video games you will be entertained here. \n\nWhat I found was that, while this place is new, it is very clean and open to welcome large groups. What's not welcoming was the $5 cover charge and a club-like line that gave this place some kind of exclusive feel. I say if you're going to let the grown up nerds in to waste away their change, they're going to buy drinks anyway so forget the cover at all hours. Either way, you'll fun in this part of old downtown Vegas compared to the blinding lights of the strip.
