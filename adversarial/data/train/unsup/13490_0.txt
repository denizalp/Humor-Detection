'Where you don't peso much\" is the self-professed theme on the logo, but it couldn't be further from the truth.  Burritos and entrees are $5-9 and this is a casual, pretty much fast food place.  side of nachos?  extra side taco?  you're easily pushing $12-15.\n\nEvery burrito I've tried, whether bean and cheese or breafkast burrito, is always somehow dry as a bone.  Tortillas are dry and have a cotton like dry chewy texture.\n\nTalk radio and\/or music is always in Spanish and quite loud.  This is good for drowning out the loud baby crying three tables over, but it can get annoying after awhile (especially when it is Spanish talk radio).  \n\nTables were dirty.  They charge you for soft drink refills.  They hoard the napkins behind the counter.  There's limited seating during prime dining hours.
