This was my second year attending this event and I had a much more enjoyable experience although I was more than pleased my first go around.  \n\nThe difference was preparation, strategy, and implementing\/executing during the Grand Tasting Main Event.  I am going to share with you what made my experience more enjoyable. \n\nFirst off, book your tickets in advance and pick up your tickets at Will Call at least a day before to avoid the mad rush.  Second, arrive AT LEAST an hour early day of.  We got there at least an hour before and while we were probably in the 3-400 range in line, it gave us a head start on the 2,500+ attendees.\n\nNext when the doors open, go as far back as you can to hit all the other booths.  Every novice is going to be taken back in amazement by the dazzling display and will park at all of the first booths they see.  This creates a log jam and ineffectively screws up your efficiency and time.  You have 2.5 hours to hit up close to 100 fine dining establishments.  In other words, less than 2 minutes per station.  This gave us a HUGE advantage over everyone else as we navigated with ease.  \n\nGoing in a group is great because you can share samples.  I know this sounds insane but with a star studded lineup of world class fine dining, you gotta save room to sample it all.  Don't eat every slider you come across.  Take a bite - pass it to your partner and toss it.  There will be at least 10 more different sliders\/burgers you'll come across.   \n\nBe strategic with your carb attacks.  I like to do a ratio of 80% Meat, 10% carbs, and 10% liquids.  And by all means.....Hydrate.....i done nearly passed out an hour into it and was having a panic attack that I wouldn't be able to make my full rotation.  Luckily I rose to the occasion.  \n\nLast advice - do not park at Caesars.  I gotta withhold where I park but park anywhere but Caesars to avoid a serious log jam arriving and departing from the event.\n\nDefinitely check out Uncork'd Grand Tasting if you are a food and\/or wine snob.  I highly recommend it!
