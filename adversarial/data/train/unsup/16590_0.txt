Hot diggity dog, I'm kinda in love with this place. \n\nBig hot dogs with about 50 different toppings to choose from. You want fruit loops? They got 'em. I stuck with smoked gouda, oaxacan red chile & chocolate mole, marinated portobello mushrooms, and applewood smoked bacon. Pretty good combo right there and it was damn tasty. \n\nTater tots and french fries with lotsa dipping sauces. It's really sort of heavenly. \n\nBeer list is extensive and sure to make anyone happy. \n\nThe second best part of the Happy Dog offerings would be the live music and dj's. Last night was so much fun with DJ Kishka. I brought a friend of mine who is really into polka and she made me dance with her. I never thought I'd be doing that kind of thing at the freakin' Happy Dog. It was totally fun. I apologize to the nice lady whose foot that I stepped on. I can't polka for shit. \n\nThe surroundings are pretty sweet, too. There's an Elvis lamp. 1,000 cool points for that alone. \n\nI don't understand how anyone could not like this place. If you're one of those people, dude, you're a square.
