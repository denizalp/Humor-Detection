I also really enjoyed my experience here.  It was super nice and loungy - we had a late dinner - 9pm-ish.  A great place to start before a night on the town.  They had a fab outdoor patio, which I'm sure must be a fantastic place to be in the summer!  We had the sushi which was delish.  Their other entrees were also great - my friend had the duck, which was great, i ordered gnocchi (b\/c I love gnocchi), and I think rabbit and sea bass was ordered.  The best value was probably the steak - the plate was full (and I mean full) - a large portion size for this type of restaurant.  Be sure to check it out!
