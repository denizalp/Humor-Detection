I love Pho alot. I even travel far and beyond just to tasted pho's everywhere. This place used to be own by another business. I even remember  it cause the people used to be 5-6 rotating for the shifts, yeah that's how often I used to come here. Then they changed owners and the name of the place. I gave them 2 chances at least to get my fave \"pho\" on the same spot that the former owner had. Unfortunately they did not retained the same flavor. I really tried to give them a fair judgment but when 2 out 2 me and my co-yelper are having the same result, I think it's enough for me to say \" it's way too different, and it's not in a good way\"\n\nAs a reference on the old place, I reviewed them with the same criteria. Basically it goes down to taste, authentic flavor, customer service and of course price. Taste was just not there, as orders said no \"wow\" factor at all. Just plain and simply, there's nothing that this place offer in regards to that department. 2nd the authentic flavor, which I may say when you tasted so much PHO you want to have that \"it's different from this place\" taste- there was none here. Nothing made me want to come back except for the fact that the old place had such a food taste and had authenticity.  To add to that me and other yelpers had bad waiting time- :( . Then lastly with the their price, which should be okay if the first 3 was present, it's a bit too pricey for something this bland.\n\nIn its fairness it's still a beautiful place to eat if your stranded around the area. Atmosphere is pretty nice- nothing changed from the previous owner. I did however found some PHO places nearby, I don't want to tell their name but yeah 1 of them tasted better. \n\nI hope you guys look at this review and expect what I didn't expected. A bit mediocre on my taste but if your new- pretty sure you can find their flavor still pretty nice. Just not quite for me who have spent some time eating Pho's around the valley.
