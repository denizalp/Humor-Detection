I almost cried while I found out KOKO Bakery. Every time I miss home food, I will come here. There are many traditional Taiwanese foods there. I have been known this place for a long time. When I were a college student, I like to order a drink, have a bun or bread and stayed there for studying. The place is wifi-free. They display Chinese popular music which makes me feel I am back in Taiwan. The place is pretty clean and bright. Fresh bread is baked every day. My favorite is turkey sandwich which has egg and turkey folded in the bread. I also like Green onion, dried pork or sweet red bean one. Steamed buns are unbelievable. My recommended one is the big meat bun. It has so many things inside include pork, sausage, Chinese mushroom, egg... The birthday cake is made by the same day I ordered. There are a lot of choices to pick for filling in the birthday cake and it is not that sweet which is perfect to me. Cheesecake is soft and light and my friends love it. Drinks are various there. My favorite one is bubble milk tea. However, I always cut sugar half because I do not drink too sweet. Fruit or coffee smoothies are great. Taiwanese shaved ice is good choice in the summer time. Price is reasonable. The owner is really really friendly and nice. How wonderful it is that Cleveland has a place like KOKO Bakery!
