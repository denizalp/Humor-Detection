This is now my regular vet that I take my dogs to and I love it here! My dog needed emergency surgery on his bum & this vet was suggested for the follow up. The vets are completely professional and the girls at the front desk are sweet as can be. Like most people I'm overprotective of my little chihuahuas but everyone is so good with them here, I'd never consider taking them anywhere else. Even the pricing is reasonable!
