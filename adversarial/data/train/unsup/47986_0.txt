Ana did a great job on the massage (deep tissue) and all the staff I've met were very friendly. \n\nThe first massage I received here was not that great and I think it was a bad style matchup. The therapist was just not strong enough for me. We talked about it and they were able to get me a do-over with Ana the next day. Great customer service!
