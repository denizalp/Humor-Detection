I saw Glaze featured on the Yelp Instagram page and immediately knew I had to try their donuts! Boy, was I right! I went to the shop on a Wednesday afternoon at 2:30pm. Even though they close at 3pm, the employee was happy to help me select my donuts. I really wanted to try the Islander donut, taro frosting with coconut toppings. Although I didn't see any in their display, I asked if the employee (I wish I knew his name because he was so sweet and helpful) could make one up for me, and he was more than happy to! I loved these donuts because they weren't overly sweet, were large in size, and full of flavor! I bought them for dessert for our family dinner that night and we had ourselves a donut buffet, everyone had a piece of each donut and we had not one complaint. I will definitely be coming back to Glaze!
