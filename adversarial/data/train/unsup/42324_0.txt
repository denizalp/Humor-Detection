This place is bustlin'. For very good reasons.\nThe seafood is fresh. The batter is light and crispy. They fry things to perfection.\n\nWe had the following:\n1. Softshell Crab Sandwich - SO GOOD. Why haven't you eaten it yet?\n2. Halibut Fish & Chips - Big portion of lovely halibut and the batter is to die for.\n3. Lobster Roll - Comparable to the ones we got fresh from the fishing boats in Prince Edward Island. High praise yo.\n\nIt's a small place with quirky fresh decor. \n\nThe people are friendly.\n\nThe tables are few.\n\nBut the food... YA. THE FOOD. \n\nGo already.
