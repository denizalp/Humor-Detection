I just called to bring in a hard drive for a simple repair (PCB board replacement). The guy on the phone insisted that it was IMPOSSIBLE. It is very possible, I just don't have the desire to do it myself right now. I guess I'll be doing it myself or taking it to someone with the skills to actually fix something. I won't ever bring an item to a place that is staffed by such dense people.
