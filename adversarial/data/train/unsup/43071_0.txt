My boyfriend and I had such a great time at the Arrogant Butcher on a busy Friday night. We sat at the bar and received excellent service by the bar tenders. My boyfriend had the beef stew and I had the beet salad. The beet salad was light and full of flavor, the perfect meal for a hot summer night. My bf enjoyed his stew. We also order a 1\/2 lbs of crab legs. They were so good and our favorite dish of the night. We will definitely stop by the next time we are in town.
