This company has no accountability. Was told that there may be some lines on the grass, but maybe not. I hired some contractors to install it and sure enough, when I saw the finished product not only are there lines but there is a HUGE partial logo. Of course when I ask AGL about this, the person I originally spoke with is \"no longer with the company.\" Along with this I had 2 other huge pieces of turf I bought from AGL and used their installer. He did an absolutely HORRIBLE job. Didn't even install, just dropped it off. Said he would be back with the right equipment, never returned another call, and AGL gives me a huge runaround telling me to call the LA office to get this fixed, then back to Vegas, never finding the person who will take accountability. Not to mention there is an ABSURD amount of black rubber infill in the grass that they didn't mention. Very dishonest company.
