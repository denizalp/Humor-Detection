I love the Scottsdale library. Solid little used bookstore, serious DVD\/Blu ray selection, awesome coffee shop, great teen center (check out their website for lots of free summer activities), fantastic kiddie section and overall general book nerd paradise.\nThe staff is always pleasant and helpful, I love that I can self checkout (do miss the \"THUNK\" of the old timey due stamp they used to use...) and the views are phenomenal. Covered parking and drive thru return bins are an added bonus. \nMy only gripe is the petition people that seem to be hovering around the front 2nd floor entrance constantly - just a go and different route to avoid them!\n\nMake sure you bring a cute carrying bag when you visit because you'll definitely need one when you leave.
