I won't lie. There is nothing fancy about this place. No coffee bar or any of the perks of a big chain. But, the work is impeccable. Sadly, I should know. A certain family member ran into my new car last year and did major damage to the back of my vehicle. I took it to one of those flashy places. After considerable hassle and time delays, they did a so-so job. Sure they guarantee their work, but it was such a hassle, I didn't want to deal with them again. \n\nAnother family member (lucky genes, I guess) hit the front of the same vehicle 2 weeks ago. So this time I took it to Mike's bc its close to where she's renting a house for an extended visit. To be honest, if she wasn't paying and didn't recommend this place, I never would have even noticed it and would have driven right by. And that would have been a mistake. The work was absolutely perfect and my car was pristine when they were done. They quoted me an amazing price and quick turnaround time. Both, shockingly, were met. As good as the price and service, I cannot say enough about the quality. My husband is...umm let's say 'picky' and even he couldn't find a thing wrong with it. They even fixed a scratch in another area for free. I would absolutely recommend  this place to anyone. I will do my best to keep my family members away from my vehicle from now on, but God forbid someone else hits me, I have no doubt where I will take my car.
