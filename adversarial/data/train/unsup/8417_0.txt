Hole-n-the-wall :) The place is almost run down yet is the coolest brewery I've been so far ... Lots of friendly faces inside .. they even had a DJ playing  music and organizing some kinda lottery ...\nThis place is good for a date, get together with friends or lonely people such as myself :) Some girls where even checking me out while i wasn't looking  and trust me i am ugly as f@ck ...\nThe quality of the brew was a strong B to B+ \nParking is limited but on the side street theres plenty of room ... drug dealers are roaming around tho on bicycles :)\nDo not park your car in the parking lot for the store ... \nWill return for sure ...
