3.5 stars.\nEverything tasted pretty good, variety was average with a few items not available on most Jap AYCE menus such as escargot.. But nothing really stood out and menu has no dessert section. For $29, you would expect to have desserts!\n\nThe dishes worth mentioning are\nSkewers - really flavorful and juicy\nPenne - yes they have pasta dishes and this one was yum\nHandrolls\nEscargot\nTatakis
