Stopped on a Saturday night without reservations and was able to grab a table without incident.\n\nThe table\/booth..In the shape of a W, was whacky.  GF on one side and me on the other.  It was hardly conducive to snuggling what so ever.  I tried to make adjustments by contorting my body, only to think about visiting a chiropractor at the beginning of the week.\n\nThe vibe was unlike any steak house I have previously visiting.  I guess I am not hip (never really ever was) anymore.  Music was thumping making it hard to hear the GF, waiter or anyone else for that matter.\n\nI ordered up the Surf and Turf.  Turf was an 8 oz. fillet placed on mashed potatoes.  Surf was placed on top of the meat served with a red sauce.  I did enjoy this very much.\n\nIn the for me personally, I have discovered that \"mad beats\" absolutely impedes my digestion of animal flesh.  I just want to chill when dining on steak and not feel like I have to bob my head when I am eating.
