I replaced both front struts and steering gear on our '01 Escape. I was careful to get everything back together as close as possible. Took it A Arrow for a front end alignment after my work. They came and said it didn't need an alignment. I had gotten it right. They put it on the rack to double check what their test drive showed. \n\nThey just charged me for the rack time and didn't overcharge me for a whole alignment that I didn't need. It's refreshing to find guys that take care of their customers with complete honesty. That can be rare in the Valley if you know what I mean.\n\nI won't take my cars anywhere else for an alignment. Can't recommend these guys enough.
