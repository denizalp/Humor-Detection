I am Taiwanese and I LOVE Taiwanese style fried chicken.  I went there after reading the reviews here.  I was not disappointed.  Let's just say my expectation was quite low when I arrived because the decor is VERY cheap and old.  Their sign doesn't show \"Taiwanese Fried Chicken\" in either Mandarin or English.  Nobody knows what \"Koo Koo\" means.  If I didn't read the review here, I would not have gone in just by passing by the store.   \n\nOk.  That's the BAD part.  \n\nThe GOOD part.  I like the menu.  I've always wanted a Taiwanese version of KFC.  Their fried chicken fillet is very good.  Juicy and pretty big portion if you get Combo 1.  I LOVE the drink selection.  It's not the typical pop drinks or the simple green\/black tea.  They have \"Frog Egg\" drink which sounds gross but it's not.  It's some kind of jelly.  It reminds me of Taiwan!  \n\nMy brother ordered their Steamed Chicken rice which is surprisingly tender but a bit under cooked.  lol   \n\nI would definitely go back again if it's closer to me.  I live in Toronto.  Next time I want to try their Chicken Bites\/Ball rice.  Honestly, if this place spends more time on decor and improves their bubble tea menu, they can easily attract more teenagers to hang out there.\n\nPS:  Another place to get good Taiwanese style Fried Chicken Ball is Zen Q on Yonge street.  Another great cheap place to eat and you get a bubble tea drink too for $9.95.
