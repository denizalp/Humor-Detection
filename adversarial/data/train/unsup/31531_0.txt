Nice laundry place in the heart of Kensington! Lots of machines at your disposal and it was quite busy when I went on a Sunday. \n\nWashing machines: prices per load reflects whether the machine is old\/new and its size. Goes from $2.50 to $5.50 (triple load machine). \n\nDryers: industrial grade, 25 cents gets you 4 minutes \n\nThey have carts to wheel your clothes around as well as a clean area for folding. Detergent available for sale and you can easily break your bills\/coins into quarters with the owner.\n\nAnother service they offer is that they can fold your dried clothes, but not sure how much this is.
