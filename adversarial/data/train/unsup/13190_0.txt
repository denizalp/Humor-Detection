I'm sorry I have to give this place any stars at all. It's horrible. The jokes may have been nonsexual and sans profanity but they were racist, homophobic, and not funny. You can tell a comedian lacks talent when they start in on the asian pidgin talk or effeminate man for 90% of the jokes. I felt like I paid to see the final project for a comedy class. I'd rather have multiple paper cuts to my eyes than return to Jesterz.
