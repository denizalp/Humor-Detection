Over the past several years, my wife and I have come to rely on Steve and Leslie for our complicated tax filing needs at both their Chandler and now Queen Creek locations.\n\nI must say that over time, we've come to totally trust them with our tax issues and have enjoyed their genuine friendship.\n\nWe've NEVER felt rushed each time we've met with them throughout the year in preparation for our tax filing. They've always been on the lookout for ways they can reduce our tax burden by informing us of tax breaks we were eligible for and did not know about. We're most appreciative of this. \n\nOur deepest and continued gratitude to our true professionals and friends,  Steve & Leslie Vogt.
