Cafe Bloom is my favorite lunch place to eat when I come to Montreal for work. everything is so tasty and fresh! Today they had a chicken sandwich with avocado on beet (!!) bread. The salad of the day was warm corn and onions and cabbage. I was so satisfied. BUT WAIT! They had a delicious deep chocolate brownie with fleur de sel. So good!
