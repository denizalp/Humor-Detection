Looking to plan that obligatory Strip club visit for your boy's bachelor party? Debating between Spearmint Rhino and this place? Well, friends look no further than hitting up Sapphire. \n\nFor $15 you get picked up anywhere on the strip and admission to the club. However, with certain large parties you can negotiate this for getting in for free. \n\n*Girls: They are alright. Old. Young. Asian. Black. White. Latino. Middle Eastern. \n\n*Bring cash please. Their ATM's have crazy fee's. Also, tables are free you just have get a drink...... \n\n*See you there bruh. Also, when you get in.... Ask any of the strippers for a \"Tour of the club\" \n\nYou're welcome. \n\nJY
