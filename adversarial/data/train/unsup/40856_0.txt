My husband and I were really excited to hang out, have a little food, and enjoy some beer at Portside.  We had looked at the menu before, decided on some beer samples, etc... We were looking forward to a good time.\n\nWhen we walked in we noticed there is no sign that says to seat yourself or wait for the hostess or anything.  So we awkwardly stood there for a minute until my husband poked his head in to the kitchen, which is right by the entrance.  There was a woman right there putting together sandwiches so he asked her if we could just find a place.  She responded with no friendliness that yes we could seat ourselves.\n\nIt was pretty crowded, no room at the bar or any tables in the main room, but if you keep walking back there is whole other room with about 10 tables.  We passed the bar and maybe 3 employees on our way back there, with no greetings or acknowledgement.\n\nWe were the only ones back there but we picked a table right by the doorway so the employees could still see us. One particular waitress was helping a table within a few feet of us, she very clearly saw us.  We proceeded to sit for about 15 minutes with nobody saying a word to us. Needless to say we grumpily left.\n\nWill never return and will definitely not recommend to anyone.
