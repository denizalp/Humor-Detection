I'm not fancy and haven't traveled the world to try other egg tarts. So excuse me for my lack of experience in the egg tart world. But as a normal person who likes desserts, I can say these little tarts are f@cking delicious! \n\nThis stand is located at the Premium Outlets North right in front of Coach. They also have another location in the food court. Kudos to the employees standing outside in the Vegas heat to provide us with these delicious treats. They are 5 for $10. Just a tiny bit pricey but they are so worth it. \n\nThe custard in the tart is smooth and not lumpy. It's sweet but not overwhelming. The pastry itself is buttery and flakey. They are still delicious the next day with some coffee for breakfast. My bf is not a dessert person, but he devours these when I bring them home. And of course my toddler son can eat a whole one by himself. \n\nI'm just sad I don't work at the outlets anymore and won't have easy access to these tarts whenever I want. It's ok, it just gives me an excuse to make the trek across town.
