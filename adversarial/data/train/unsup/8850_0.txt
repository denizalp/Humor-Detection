This place used to be a hit. I feel bad for giving the least amount stars here, but hey I've got a reason. Like Bijan, I used to attend the school across the street from here every lunch I'd most likely eat instant noodles. That was until I found out about Tastee's patties. They were absolutely fresh, hot, filling and delicious, not to mention CHEAP! It used to be only $1.00-1.25 and with cocobread it'd be an extra $0.50-0.75. \n\nThat was then. I recently went there about 2 months ago and tried a vegetarian patty. I was very dissapointed, because there was HARDLY any filling! Mostly eating the flaky pastry and my friend who ordered a beef patty didn't get as much filling as we used to. In addition, the prices rose! So, let's see what we've got here. \n\nPrices go up = Patty filling goes DOWN?!  That doesn't seem right to me..\n\nOverall: Please, consider what you're doing and inject MORE (not less) beef filling into those golden flaky patty shells of yours!
