Hell Hole.\n\nAn utterly crappy night at LAX at the Luxor.  We went at 10:00, waited an hour, only to be packed in, hermetically sealed, on a dance floor.  I understand that club owners would want a packed club, but this was ridiculous.  I could not move, let alone dance.  It should not be legal to fit that many people on one dance floor. \n\nPlus, for a Vegas club that's all the rage, I was expecting more extravagance.   But the interior was rather dull and just dark.  Since the dance floor is surrounded by an upper level balcony, a throng of revelers is looking down on you.  Which could be cool if you're feeling sexy, I guess.  But to me, it was creepy.\n\nAnd, horrors beyound horrors, they played country music. I can appreciate a good country tune, but seriously, how am I supposed to dance to country?  Line-dance?\n\nOne star for being named after LA's airport.
