Do you know what they call the doctor who finishes in last place in medical school? They call him doctor! Such is the case of the psychiatrist at \"Open Arms Counseling\" in Henderson NV. I take Klonipin which is a controlled medication. It means it's addicting. I take it for anxiety. AND, I have taken it for more than half my life. I also had a serious migraine condition when I was much younger and it helped dramatically. \n\nI'm not proud that I need to take Klonipin everyday. I am not even happy about it. I am however grateful that I live in a time where a medication such as this exists and has given me a chance to have a life.\n\nI don't just pop a pill and everything is fine. I have fought hard for my life. From not being able to function at all to doing everything I have ever wanted...(with new goals all the time). This \"doctor\" called me a drug addict. What an ass. Yes. I'm addicted I've been taking it for years but I haven't ever abused it or sold it or given it to friends. I have given the eulogy at both my parents funeral's and I didn't ever take an extra pill. Not even when  a friend of mine was killed on 9\/11. \n\nHe said \"Why, look at you. You've become so addicted it no longer affects you.\" Like I was some rare case study in his medical school mid-term. My family has a history of epilepsy and when I told him I had a grand mal seizure last year he said, \"It was probably caused by the Klonipin\" OOOOMMMMGGG What a buffoon. When he left the room, I pulled up the New England Journal of medicine and a huge article of how Klonipin was created to reduce seizures or the severity of them at least. It is the most non invasive drug there is. Unless you are allergic to it, or have been on it for a long time and stop abruptly it is the last thing that will cause a seizure. When I showed him the article he said, \"That doesn't make it right.\" (WTF?) He looked up my history and said \"You recently had a prescription.\" \"Yeah from a neurologist who said I needed to get it from you. I don't need it today but I don't want to be that person who stops it abruptly.\" This inexperienced, uninformed, man who probably got his degree from the back of a box of Captain Crunch, should not be working with people. Shoes? Sure. Tin cans? Fine. People, animals, absolutely not. \n\nThis doctor at Open Arms has a closed mind and no heart to speak of whatsoever. All he knows is what he could memorize from a text book. His last words to me were, I don't treat drug addicts. He may be able to call me and millions like me an addict but if he likes being called \"doctor\" he may wanna chill out with the adjectives.
