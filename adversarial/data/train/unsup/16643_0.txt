Was in Vegas for a buddy's bachelor party and after a long night of drinking\/strip club hopping ;-) and gambling,  we found ourselves at Planet Hollywood.  It was close to 5am and there was still a long ass line but was glad to see it move along quickly.  Since it was my first visit, I ended up splitting two sandwiches with a friend (original and the hawaiian bbq?   iirc).  Waited for a few mins (seemed like 1\/2 hr prolly cuz I was still drunk) before they paged us to pick up the sandwiches (glad there was plenty of eye candy dining in the area!!).  Thought the sandwiches were sooo good that we ended up going back for lunch which was less than 6 hours later.  Wasn't a big fan of the Hawaiian though but it's most likely due to the fact that there was pineapples in the sandwich (it was the one that my buddy ordered).
