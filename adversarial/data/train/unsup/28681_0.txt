My first time using Petco grooming... honestly, I'm hooked! The ladies were very friendly and happy to answer all of my questions. It was so nice talking with a groomer who didn't act like they were high and mighty, or bothered by your presence. Delena and Carrie both did awesome jobs on my huskies' nails. Delena was very careful and gentle with my older girl's arthritic hips. That's very important to me. Not once did she treat my dog like she was just some ol' dog that moves too slow... she showed nothing but respect and care. Carrie was happy to take care of my young boy, and she did a fantastic job! The entire time the staff made me feel truly welcome and that my business was wanted, not like the other big box retailer's grooming shops. And another big bonus-- Petco's price on nail grinding is OVER HALF of what my vet charges!! SCORE!! Thanks again, ladies! You have my loyal business :)
