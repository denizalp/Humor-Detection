Foie Gras. Alba White Truffles. Alsatian Riesling.\n[takes bite]\n\"Are you kidding me?\" \n[looks at fellow diners, bewildered]\n\"good lord.\"\n[sniffs robust slices of white truffles]\n\"this isn't happening.\"\n[sniffs again]\n\"ok, maybe it is.\"\n\nno joke, this is how every course of the degustation menu went down. I also got really sauced without intending to. It was the champagne, I tell you!\n\nif you're going to do it up big time here, please make sure you only have one drink before you come in. Don't do what I did and, ahem, overdo it.\n\nAlas, the meal was a revelation. This is something few will experience in their lives. Incredible. I had to almost be forklifted out. I would detail everything I had, but it's not necessary. Be surprised when you go. Be enchanted. \n\nHarley, the wine director, was a class act, even when I accidentally called him Harvey. \n\nThe only beef I had was with the decor. Think \"mid-90s Disney movie set in Renaissance-era France,\" and don't be surprised if the chairs and candelabras start dancing and serving you food. Or maybe that was just the fact that I was past the point of no liver return.
