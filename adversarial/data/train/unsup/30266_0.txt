Whether it is for Brunch, Lunch or Dinner this place has been consistent!  I have enjoyed visiting Topgolf every time I have gone.  The place has just recently opened but it seems their kinks are getting worked out better and better with each visit.  I would suggest 6 people per bay because of space and time to play.  Food and drinks are awesome and well prepared!  \n\nWord to the wise if your planning on visiting for your first time.. Go online to topgolf.com and register for a membership.  It costs $5 which is the same for in store purchase however, it will SAVE you A LOT of time.  If you register online you can walk in and they will print the membership card right away.  Just be sure to have you RE # from the confirmation email! \n\nThis is a great place to visit for all ages.  I just recently was there with my twin brother and sister ages 4 and my 83 year old grandmother.  Everyone hit balls and had a great time!  Weekends are certainly the busiest so plan ahead.  Even in this 100 degree weather they have all the bays chilled with fans and misters.
