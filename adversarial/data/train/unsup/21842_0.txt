This WAS our go-to indoor spot. We usually go to Pro Gun Club but it was a rainy Sunday so we had to skip the outdoor range and visit our what used to be our favorite indoor range. \n\nIm usually not off Sundays and I usually use their range on the weekdays. I had a habit of knowing they were open til 7pm. Me , my friend, my brother and his wife decided to go shooting Sunday. \n\nDoor was wide open when we arrived, got there around 400pm. Lanes were not full , lady at the counter told us there was a wait. No problem. We waited patiently around 10mins browsed the store a bit, then got called in . As soon as we finished unloading our gear inside the range , RSO told us we have 15 mins to shoot at the range. \"?????\" This is when we realized that they closed at 500pm and their range shuts down at 430pm. We walk out grab our IDs back and paid the range fee for shooting one magazine and unloading and loading back our gear at their range. \n\nSo I love how the lady upfront, makes us wait 10mins when we arrived at 400pm and not even bother telling us that the range will be closing soon. To add insult to injury, make us pay full price for the range fee. Am I losing sleep over $40? no, but I find it disgusting for a person to have such lack of inconsideration. \n\nI wish they would've told us that they were closing soon and that , our time at the range by the time the lane was open would be limited . We would've then left and came back another day. Instead , they would rather take advantage of us. \n\nI have nothing against people making mistakes at their job, but it seems like the lady up front didn't feel bad or even at least said sorry that she failed to mention that they were closing soon.
