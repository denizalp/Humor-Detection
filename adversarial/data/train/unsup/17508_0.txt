I came with the ladies to sit around and relax until a few others were ready to join us for the next leg of our epic day.\n\nI ordered the pistachio latte as a blended drink as it was a rather hot day. It was decent, tasted like having a decent pistachio ice cream. The size was about a 16oz cup and since I got almond milk it was almost $6 for a beverage and I'm not sure if it was good enough to warrant that. \n\nI wanted some sort of sweet but the selection was sparse to honey toast, one kind of cake in the display and a few french macarons so I passed. \n\nThe place is pretty cute though and it's open late in a area where there isn't many late night spots. I'll probably try other items off the menu and re evaluate how I feel about this place. First impressions was just A-OK.
