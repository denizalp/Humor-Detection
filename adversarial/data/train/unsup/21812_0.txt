Never tried their food. Might be really good but read along for the 1star review.\n\nCame here after a long walk on the strip. We called in and asked what time they close. Also checked yelp for good measure. Then when we walked in, the employees were literally closing the place. Few food was still outside but they were scrubbing soap and cleaners on the counter.\n\nAs soon as I said \"hi\". The other lady said \"just take out now\". And I was shocked, we still have 45 minutes to eat right? Wrong. And other of the employees said \" you can eat outside if you want\". WHAT? They want us to eat outside when it's literally 40 degrees outside. There are snows in the mountain tops of the nearest mountains in vegas!! And lastly just to put the experience over the top. The other lady jokingly said \" unless you will pay us overtime sir?\"... yeap. That just happened.\n\nFor a Filipino place that caters for our culture they have negative way of trying to make you \"feel at home\". This place might have good food. But they get zero manners. Not a way to represent the Filipino culture. \n\nHope no one ever experience the same thing. And I hope the owner checks the attitude of his workers. If If I own a business, I won't kick people out that way. I will make sure never to come back to this place, and make sure the people I know don't check this out either.
