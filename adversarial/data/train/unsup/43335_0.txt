This GoodLife location is one of the few in the city with a pool. They run both aqua fitness which attracts a lot of seniors, and the rest of the time leave it open for swimming laps. The pool is a little hot and short for serious swimmers but for those that never swam competitively, it's a good enough option. \n\nThe gym itself is quite small. There is very little room to do abs, the treadmills are literally right up against a wall (making that run extremely uninteresting) and it gets really really busy at peak hours. The one saving grace this gym has for me is there fitness classes don't get quite as full as the Park Rd. location.\n\nThe staff don't really put on the same friendly face on that you typically see at other GoodLife Fitness Clubs but it's a pretty negligible factor for me.\n\nFor me, this is the most convenient location so I come here frequently enough and just make sure I show up just before peak hours start so that I can have my pick of machines, or stick to classes.
