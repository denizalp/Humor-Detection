Left my wallet here, came back 15m later. Table cleared and our waitress was gone no where to be found. Asked the front and waited for her for 20m he said her shift is over and she isn't here. I really liked this place too. Will speak with manager on Monday. Waitress was kind of annoyed with sudden rush hour, but wouldn't think she would take my wallet.
