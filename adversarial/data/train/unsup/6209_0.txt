This was purely accidental.  We had every intention to gorge ourselves with the greasiest chinese food that money (and severely hung over adults) could buy.  However, we only had 45 minutes to spare before our massage\/facial, which led us here.\n\nWhy I'd come back:\n- The Berry Tea they served was enough to bring back my hungover friend to earth, which meant I wasn't left without a spa buddy.\n- It's very rare that a restaurant (esp. in Vegas) dedicate its menu entirely to healthy dishes.  \n- I seriously left this restaurant with a different perspective, enough that I want to incorporate organic food in at least 1\/3 of my meals, if not more.  I felt full, yet clean.  Yes, I paid $11.00 for a small portion, but really...you should eat to live or just barely enough to get you full,... not to have 3 days of leftovers.  I felt more energized.  One might say it's due to some sort of placebo effect, but I've made feeble attempts at supposed \"healthy eating\", and you could certainly feel the difference here.\n\nWith that in mind, all of the dishes, albeit small portions, were delicious.  Yes, delicious and healthy, which explains my ratings below =)\n\nWe ordered:\nMOJAVE TURKEY WRAP: 4 STARS\n$11.  365 calories\n\nWHOLE WHEAT BERRY PANCAKES- 4 STARS\n$11.  314 calories
