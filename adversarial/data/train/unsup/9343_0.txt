I am still in love their buckwheat crepes but after celebrating my birthday here with a few friends my love for the restaurant has declined.  I was very surprised and a little PO'd that they did not offer me a dessert for my birthday!  Practically every restaurant in the valley offers a birthday treat no matter how small it is. The service at Le Chalet has been on a steady decline in the past few months and I hope they can turn it around.  \n\nMy advice: Celebrate your birthday at Pappadeux instead they have AWESOME birthday desserts!
