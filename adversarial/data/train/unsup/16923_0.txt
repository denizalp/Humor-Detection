Awesome as it may be that you can grab lunch in a mall food court that isn't greasy chinese, Chick-Fil-A, or crappizza, and that Blynk uses mostly organic veggies, bread, and ingredients...someone really needs to spice this menu up. The vegetarian options are the same (tinyish) sammich 3 ways, with a replaced ingredient. Roasted peppers and sundried tomatoes abound. Or you can get a salad, add tofu, and drop 8 bucks on a somewhat tiny plate of veggies. Dressings are uber-run-of-the-mill.\n\nLemonade. Bad. No kick, no sweet. \n\nEmployees, smiley, quick. \n\nPlus, who wants to spend lunch hour in this food court? Yeesh.\n\nIt's like it's 1995 and vegetarianism isn't cool yet.\n\nLuckily it was 1\/2 price sammich day, or this would be a crankier review.
