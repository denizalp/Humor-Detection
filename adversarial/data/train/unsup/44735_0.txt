WOW CARPET MONKEYS OF LAS VEGAS ROCK!!!!!\n\nWe never had our carpets cleaned since we moved into our house four years ago. After reading all the great reviews I figured to give them a try and I'm so happy I called to make an appointment. Rick the owner was amazing! So friendly and the price he quotes you at over the phone is what you'll pay at the end. There are no hidden cost\/fees. Extremely honest man! We needed the enzyme treatment for dog urine issue. It is a two visit process, because there's a 48 hr treatment in between time for the enzymes to do their job. He came two different days and did not charge us for two day process. Our carpets were so bad between having three young kids and a Husky Dog that is not completely potty trained. Our carpets were a wreck!!!!! Our Carpets had Dog Urine throughout the entire house. You could smell the Dog Urine as soon as you came into our house. Rick not only removed all the visible stains but the smell is completely gone! We can now invite over company without being embrassed by the smell of Dog Urine! We were so happy with his work that we have made an appointment for him to come back to clean our Kitchen Tile Floors & Front Entrance. Thank you so much Rick of Carpet Monkeys of Las Vegas Your The BEST!!!!!!!
