OK, here's the thing, I'm not a BBQ snob or anything, I just LOOOOOOOVE really good 'Que, and I despise it with a passion when its not up to par. SO, I guess a better adjective would be \"passionate\". Yea, that's it, I have a strong passion for barbecue.  Like that girl that you love with every fiber of your being when things were going good, but loath with a passion when things are on the slide.  You only loath and despise her because you CARE.  \n\nWith all that being said, I despise Sticky Fingers Smokehouse and everything it stands for.  There's no debate in my mind - they served the absolutely WORSE RIBS I'VE EVER HAD.  Now I will say, I went there late, on a slow weekday evening looking to try something different.  But that doesn't mean the food should be garbage just because its not peak dining hours.  If you can't serve good, quality food during the hours you are open - then CLOSE!! \n\nThe sides were just OK.  Well, to be honest, they may have been better than \"OK\" but all that was overshadowed by the fact that I literally had to pull with all my strength to separate the meat from the bones.  The meat was as tough as bricks.  I mean, they're ribs people, the meat should \"FALL-off-the-bone\" not stay stuck to the bone because the ribs have been sitting out and around all day long!  \n\nI feel like my heart has been broken by yet another underwhelming BBQ experience by a place that claims they have \"Fall-off-the-Bone\" ribs.  STOP IT ALREADY!  The only thing that \"falls\" are my hopes and dreams of having a tasty well prepared meal - falls down the drain that is.
