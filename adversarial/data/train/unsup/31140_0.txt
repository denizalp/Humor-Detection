Reading other reviews, it looks like we may have went at a bad time. We, and another    \ntable were the only ones there for a while, and yet the service was slow.\n\nOur Greek salads came, and it is safe to say that this was the worst salad I have ever had. I mean, how can you go wrong with a salad? There was SO MUCH dressing on it, it made the feta cheese all soupy and looked very unappetizing. Also, there was a lettuce head root in my salad which is just very unprofessional in any industrial setting. I got the Greek style spaghetti with cheese, which was just so bland, They did not even bother to put some pepper on it! The bass was drenched in oil! it was like soup. The rice was crunchy and under-cooked, there version of fries suck too. They were simply soft cold round potatoes. The halibut was very oily and the veggies were overcooked and had a weird taste.\n\nMoreover, there are many Greek alternatives in the area, that are amazing.
