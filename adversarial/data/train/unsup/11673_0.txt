This ayce sushi place definitely satisfies my sushi craving when I go. My friend and I went for lunch around 12:30PM and it wasn't too busy actually. We were seated right away and our waitress got our drink orders quite promptly.\n\nMy friend and I got a good variety of sushi and different rolls as well as the kalbi short ribs. The short ribs were somewhat on the fattier side but still pretty good. The rolls had a thin layer of rice and a good amount of filling. They were able to get us everything we ordered which was great.\n\nThe service was great and very attentive which I quite liked. I'll definitely be coming back here if I am in the mood for sushi and in the area.
