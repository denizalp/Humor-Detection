Thanks to our great friend, we were able to stay here for a really affordable price for 3 nights.\n\nThe first night (thurs) we were upgraded to a resort-like suite; it was two stories - personally, I was really excited for this because I've never stayed in a hotel room with STAIRS. If we ever get this again, I'd love to bring one of those two story-long beer bongs that starts from the second floor so u can chug from the first. Yeah buddy.\nSecond and third nights we stayed in the diamond room, two large beds and we were able to ask for 2 more rolling beds. \n\nI'll just jot down some quick Cliff Notes:\n1) Not super glamorous like the Wynn\/encore\/ph\/cosmo, but definitely not shabby\/rundown. Just simple and clean-cut, which I'm more than happy with.\n2) Great location - pretty much middle of the strip.\n3) Right across the street (flamingo) there's a liquor store. So if you run out of your pre-gaming equipment like we did, you can just walk on over and buy a few bottles\/chasers at affordable prices, no problemo. \n4) About a 5 minute walk from Ellis Island - an offshore dated casino that has awesome $4.99 steak & eggs and amazing beers (read my review on Ellis Island).\n5) Only negative I can think of: the TV's were very, very outdated. But uh, who watches TV in Vegas?
