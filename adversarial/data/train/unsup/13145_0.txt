Have I mentioned that I love Hobby Lobby? Well, I do, the love is TRUE!\n\nI typically go to the Cactus location but when near Indian Bend, you better believe i'm stopping in here! I've also been known to go to both locations in one day. (Don't tell my husband!)\n\nPro Tip: Before stepping foot in a Hobby Lobby, download their app! Not only is there a 40% off of one full price item coupon but it will also tell you which items are 50% off for the week. You guys, they literally have half of the store 50% off each week and it rotates every other. It is INSANE. \n\nSo when we bought our house and I needed decor, I pretty much bought 90% of 'cute' things from here. They have GREAT art, candles, knick knacks, bowls, pillows, frames, lamps, mirrors, baskets, vases, etc. They even have some furniture. I made sure to check their app before I went so that the items I was looking for were 50% off each time. I literally got a GORGEOUS lamp and rustic wood mirror for 50% off. And when they're having their annual clearance, it is even better! Their decor always seems to be on trend as well, therefore, making me want to redecorate my home every time I step in! \n\nAnother time Hobby Lobby was my best friend was when we were getting married and I was collecting decor for the wedding. We were doing a candy bar and I bought all of the glass dishes to put the candy in there for 50% off, I bought cute signs to scatter around the wedding, frames that matched our 'black and white stripe' theme, candles, and other fun things. \n\nAnd the NEXT time I know that Hobby Lobby and I will be best friends is when i'm decorating a baby's room! (No, there is no bun in the oven, i'm just saying)! I've been eyeing their cute children's decor before I even had a boyfriend. ;) haha! \n\nI'll see you soon, Hobby Lobby! Thank you for making all of my home decor and creative dreams come true.
