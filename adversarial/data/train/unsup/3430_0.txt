I've been jonesing for some authentic German food for ages. So I checked out Yelp and found this restaurant with multiple favorable reviews. \n\nMy wife and I arrived at 7:30pm this past Saturday and scored the last empty table in the restaurant. The smell of the food was making me drool. I felt like I was already in Germany, more specifically in Hamburg as this was where the original owners had operated the first Zur Kate. There was a coo coo clock, antlers and other German artifacts covering the walls. There was even an accordion player playing at the right sound level. It was as if you were transported to a family restaurant in Germany.\n\nOur server had the German accent and took our drink orders with the promise of bread. Yes, Germans love their bread. We ate some hearty rye bread and ordered our entrees when our server returned.\n\nMy wife had the Kassler Rippchen and I had the Zwiebel Rippchen (sauteed onions added) with Bratkartoffein and Red Cabbage. The Rippchen is a pork chop that is smoked then grilled. The Bratkartoffein is German Home Fries which are German fried potatoes cut into cubes with onions and some bits of bacon.\n\nAll of the food was excellent. The Red Cabbage had a slight sweet flavor and possibly the best Red Cabbage I had ever had. The Bratkartoffein was good as well. The Pork Chops were perfectly cooked and made my tummy want more. I will defintely become a regular at Zur Kate.
