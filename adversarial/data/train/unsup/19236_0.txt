Komex is a Korean\/Mexican infused restaurant. Hence KO-MEX. \n\nI love Mexican food but as for Korean I'm still debating if I'm a fan. But together they make some pretty good dishes. \n\nMy usual order is the Bulgogi fusion fries. Bulgogi is beef that had been marinated Korean style. It kind of has a sweat taste to it. You can also get the fries with any other meat that they have like: carne asada, chicken, etc.\n\nThey also have spam masubi w\/ fried egg which I think is pretty cleaver. Because we all eat spam and eggs together anyways so why not in a masubi! \n\nAlso when you order a soda they bring out a bottle soda & not a can or from a fountain.\n\nLast visit took a while for our orders to be taken and for water to arrive. But, other times I been here service has been steady.
