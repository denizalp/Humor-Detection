I have been inundated with Whataburger TV commercials, radio and print ads etc.  I noticed that they were advertising a Green Chile Double.  It sounded delicious so I stopped on the way home from work tonight.  I ordered one and it came out to almost $6.00.  A little steep but I really wanted to try it.  \n\nWhataburger cooks everything fresh plus they have pretty large sized burgers.  The Green Chile Double is pretty simple.....2 beef patties, 2 slices of cheese (Monterey Jack and American) and some roasted chiles.  No condiments or anything like that.  They do butter their buns which is nice.  Overall, it was a tad dry but still tasted great.  I only wish they would have topped it with more chiles though.  Overall, I was satisfied.  If this thing was $4.00 and had more chiles, it would be perfect.  For almost $6.00 just for the burger plus the skimpness of chiles, it gets just an A-OK.
