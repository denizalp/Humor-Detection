On the first night of our 2 year wedding anniversary get away, my wife and I strolled around Toronto looking for a late night dinner when we stumbled upon the BeerBistro. We ordered a plain cheese pizza to split. It was delicious and perfect portions for two people. The sauce and the crust were amazing. \n\nFor dessert we got the flourless chocolate stout cake and cookies n' cream ice cream. The cake was off the charts good and so was the ice cream. They went together so beautifully. \n\nOur waitress was very kind and put up with all my weird questions about the nightlife and Toronto as well as answering my questions about the beers and ciders. \n\nWe would definitely return to BeerBistro!
