I went here today for the first time in many years, and I was just reminded of all the reasons I avoid it. \n\n1. The price range. The stores in here are barely even accessible, with the accessible stores feeling incredibly out of place among such haughty boutiques with hilarious names such as SHOOZ. \n2. The place is laid out like a labyrinth. It's incredibly easy to get lost. It can be quite creepy as well because it seems like whoever designed the place INTENTIONALLY wanted to lead lost patrons through dimly lit, deserted feeling corridors. Rumor has it Venice is one of the creepiest cities in the world, so I guess I should give them props for staying really close to the theme. \n3. The perfume. OH GOD THE GODAWFUL SCENT OF THE VENETIAN.\n\nThere are some things that I like though. Since the sky is painted on the ceiling you can pretend that you're actually in Venice, which is cool because I don't have money to visit Italy right now.
