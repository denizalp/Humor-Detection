DO NOT GO HERE. All these 5 star reviews blow me away. I work for the state and have decent insurance,  Brought my daughter in on a weekend. The receptionist refused to tell me how much they charged for a Dr. visit, only saying \"It depends on what you're insurance pays.\"  After paying the $15 copay, we were seen by a Dr. for less then 2 minutes. We were told she had a throat infection. We went home and received a bill a week later for $400.  It would have been cheaper to take her to UMC Emergency. DO NOT COME HERE! TOTAL SCAM!
