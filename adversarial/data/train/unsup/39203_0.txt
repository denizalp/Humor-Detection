Since we have found Tokyo Lobby we have stopped going anywhere else.  Our favorites are Monkey Brains and the Playboy Roll.  The Playboy Roll is one of those rolls that you can't stop thinking about until you get it again.  It is really that good.\nThe restaurant is small but we have never had to wait to get in.  \nThe owner is usually there and very attentive.\nI highly recommend this place!!
