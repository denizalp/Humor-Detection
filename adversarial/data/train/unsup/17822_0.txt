I feel like I have come full circle.  I started at this location 8 years ago.  Then Alisa was assigned to the Scottsdale location and of course, I had to follow her. Now she is back to the original spot, it is farther for me, but I will drive to bfe for her.  I cannot tell you how many times I get stopped at malls or on the street an inquired about my hair color.  Just yesterday I had a lady asking me if it was a single process hair color.  I told her it was not.  It requires the expertise of Alisa to make it look this natural.  When Alisa was on maternity leave the first time, I was impatient and I went somewhere else, and they left me brassy.  The second time Alisa went on maternity leave I wore a hat for a while.
