My delivery order took 1 hour and 30 min. I felt bad for the driver. The person that took my order put down Riverview Avenue , when it should've been Drive. I was very specific that it was White Oak Farms Apartments. It wasn't the driver side since it was written on the slip incorrectly. The food was okay but I had to heat it up.
