I used to love this place when I had a place just down the street a few years ago.\nRecently called to order a medium Sicilian (twenty five dollars by the way).\nBoth the toppings & the extra cheese we paid for were light to unrecognizable on the pie & the pizza was not as good as I remember (couldn't say exactly why, just disappointed).  But the biggest turn off was the 'new' help.  The gal on the phone when ordering seemed impatient & confused (high?), this was at 3pm on a weekday by the way.  When entering I was immediately disgusted by what I assume was the same lady -resembling something from a nightmare before christmas or a kiss concert.= scary.  And her bad attitude when I presented my -god forbid- American Express Card was unwarranted, but not surprising at that point.  Needless to say, no gratuity was given.  I do not believe that we will be going back.
