Great causal place to go to satisfy your sushi craving! I ordered from the regular all you can eat menu, which was well priced - $24 per person before tip (I was surprised that tip wasn't already calculated in like most ALYE). I was craving sashimi and it was amazing here. Very fresh and perfectly proportioned. I particularly loved salmon and the clam. The specialty roll that's made of cucumber shell, without rice was also really addicted. Be sure to order the chicken skewers, butter mushroom and short ribs for hot dishes. However, stay away from the rice dishes, it was really oily and salty. Lastly, dessert was the best part of my meal! I highly recommend the mango yogurt, red bean pudding, the panna cotta and pretty much any of the ice creams. I had to have ordered desserts 3x. Also, there was great service! Staff was friendly, food was brought out quickly and hot! I really enjoyed my experience here and would highly recommend it.
