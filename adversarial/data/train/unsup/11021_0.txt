This place needs some serious work! Honestly blehh!\n\nBeing on \"top of the world\" isn't enough to get me to go back!\n\nFirst of all, Yes, you are very high up and the view is pretty cool as well as the fact that the floor revolves.... BUT....\n\nIt is veryy expensive! Their cheapest entrees were in the 20s, their Caesar Salad was $12 ... for a salad!?! For some people that may not be a lot, but for ME it is! Just because you are up really high in the sky means you have to pay out the ass for food? Me thinks not! ... Personally when I saw my friends meals I was glad I didn't order anything - It didnt look worth the money and my friend ended up not feeling well afterwards.\n\nMy friend said \"all you're paying for is the experience\" .. Well I've been to restaurants at the same price with better service, food and had a better \"experience!\" If it means not having a view then so be it! Why does the restaurant think the view makes up for all of that?\n\nAnywayss.. The interior is very drab, looks like it's from the 80s, dark colors, they tried brightening the place up with white tablecloths, but that doesn't help when the lighting is so low you can barely see your plate - I feel like theyre trying to hide something. Also, they weren't playing any music, it was kind of awkward so I put a Jazz Pandora station on my phone so we didn't feel so awkward.. At one poing a live band started playing upstairs somewhere, but it was just in one spot  (they dont revolve) so the sound was quiet then loud when you got closer.. just weird.\n\nOverall I was very dissappointed with the \"restaurant\" when I walked in, it really needs to be renovated! If you want the \"experience\" go for it, but I honestly don't think it's worth your time or money :(
