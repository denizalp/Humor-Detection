My wife and LOVE the food here, it's why we've been back several times, despite sub-par service. Our experience on 12\/23 was different, and when we asked for the manager's contact info we were told there were too many managers and they didn't have business cards. Here are the notes I took that night:\n-Wing flavors came out wrong from the kitchen\n-No celery or carrots with the second order\n-Blue cheese packets were expired by two weeks with an expiration date of 12\/9\/16, after we brought it to their attention they served a 2nd cup with the same expiration date\n-Manager never came to check on us after the order was wrong the first time\n-Employees congregated and ate at the bar right next to us and they left unaccompanied food for nearly an hour\n-Roll of Garbage bags being stored in the silverware trays\n-Cup o'noodles stored next to the coffee maker\n-Employees bad mouthing a third employee who was not present about calling another employee because she needed to go home sick\n-Employee beverages stored next to the refill ice tea and water pitchers\n-Employee discussing a messed up take-out delivery order in front of customers\n-I ordered PBR to drink and my bartender served $3, 16 oz cans rather than the posted $2 PBR pints \"all day every day\".\n-Server scratched her head with her bare hand right before serving food to guests with that same hand
