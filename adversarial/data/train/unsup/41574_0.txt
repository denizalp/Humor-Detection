I love Dr. Leepard as a doctor, but she is never on time. If you do not get the first available appointment in the morning you can plan to wait at least two hours before you are seeing. And the scheduling department is even worse. I scheduled an appointment for one day and when I came in I was told that the appointment date has been moved to another date without my knowledge. So inconsiderate for peoples time. I will be finding a new doctor.
