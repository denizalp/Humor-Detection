Tried this place last night based on the reviews.  People spicy does not mean good! We started with Tom Khar soup.  It was awful.  I don't think they had any prepared and threw it together because the ingredients were under cooked. We ordered Basil Sauce stir fry with shrimp, Pad Si Ew and Pad Thai. The Pad Si Ew was the best dish, well flavored.  The vegetables in the stir fry were not great and neither was the shrimp, green beans were tough and under cooked.  The Pad Thai tasted like they used sweet and sour sauce over noodles and the noodles were over cooked.  Pretty disappointing.  I will go back to Archi's for Thai.
