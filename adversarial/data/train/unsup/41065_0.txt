I bought a small travel purse from Travel Outfitters some time ago. I use it when I travel, so it is used 4 - 5 weeks a year. I was using it this past week when the strap broke. I took it into the store to see if they had a resource to repair it and they switched it out for a brand new one! Now that's great customer service!
