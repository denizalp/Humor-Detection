I (used to) love Bobby Flay and because I like to eat just plants, I frequently modify his recipes to suit a plant-based diet.  I was very excited to try Mesa Grill during a business trip to Vegas.  Sadly, it was a terrible experience due to Mr. Flay's arrogance.\n\nI asked our waitress if she could recommend a menu item that could be easily modified for a vegan diet and she said .... in the kindest way possible that \"Mr. Flay does not modify his food for any special diet - he says you must eat it as it comes.\"  Excuse me, but I'm not at the French Laundry, and Bobby Flay is not Thomas Keller, so if I want a damn meal of plants I should be able to get it.\n\nFortunately there was a salad easily modified to leave off the cheese and it was quite delicious.  My coworkers enjoyed their steaks and scallops and the margaritas were decent.  It was just such an off-putting experience to feel like I wasn't welcomed at this restaurant - we won't be back.
