This was our 3rd time eating here and our last.  1rst time was a decent experience, 2nd time awful experience and 3rd time a repeat of the 2nd.  \n\nThe last 2 times have been very consistent though.  Slow and indifferent wait staff, undercooked food, and frigid  ambient air.  Make sure to bring a Parka as management likes to keep the temp to the point that you can see your breath.  In addition, if you are so lucky to be placed at the tables with the uncomfortable aluminum chairs, you get that extra chill literally to the seat of your pants.  \n\nService has been very slow last 2 visits, even when they aren't busy and my impression is that this restaurant already has outgrew it's \"new coolness\", but for some reason continued to feel that they are special and thus not open to suggestions, My impression is upper management likely feel customers will continue to return no matter the experience and this feels to me very reminiscent of the restaurants of the 80s who felt big and bad, refused to change, and thus are nothing but a memory on the internet search pages under \"top ten 80's chain restaurants that failed in the 80s\" Nothing has changed between our 2nd and 3rd visits (spaced about 4 months apart) and that usually means nothing will.  \n\nI unfortunately will not recommend The Public House to anyone who lives in or is visiting Vegas, as there are many better options with staff that care about you and do not act like they are the \"in thing\", and that you are lucky to be sitting there, as well as food that taste better with a better price.  The menu tries to be original in choices but comes off being bland and flavorless.  \n\nI always give a place 3 chances and this one unfortunately will not get a 4th.  I estimate this place will not last beyond another 1-2 years.
