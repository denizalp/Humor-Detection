A very needed place in the growing Fort Mill area. Great soups and sandwiches at reasonable prices. A wide variety of options. Service is a little slow, especially given the already made soups and simple sandwiches - which is something they should work on. Not open on Sunday's which is unfortunate as this would be a great place to visit for lunch with friends or family.
