This place is great!  I took one of their weekend 2-hour intro workshops last weekend, and had a blast.  The workshop started with a warmup, then almost an hour of trapeze and hoop (aerial). Then we did a second warmup for acro, then practiced all kinds of fun stuff, like handstands, somersaults, and cartwheels. No, I couldn't do everything well (let alone perfectly, hah!) but that wasn't the point - the point was to try and to have fun. Which it was!\n\nSafety was not an issue at all: the floors are cushy for doing acro, there are tons of very thick mats to fall onto if needed when doing trapeze\/hoops, and the class had 5 people in it (and they only allow a max of 6), meaning you get tons of time with the instructor.  \n\nHeather (one of the owners) also is great about answering questions by email.  \n\nI'm really looking forward to signing up for one of their classes in the fall.  My only problem is choosing which one - acro or aerial!
