Your typical greasy spoon. For a man with a hangover that could have killed a large elephant this past Sunday, this random tiny diner hit the spot. I'm of the mind that you can't fault a place for not being anything it doesn't pretend to be. Want hot coffee? Want tasty breakfast grub? Don't want to drive far (if friends live in the area and you didn't want to get a DUI the previous evening and slept on their ancient couch)? Then eat here. There's a Dollar Store right next door, so you can even make an extremely inexpensive date out of it...you know, if she's that kind of girl.
