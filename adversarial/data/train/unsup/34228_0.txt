It is very much just okay. We got the Sweet Potato Ice Cream and it tasted exactly like biting into a sweet potato mash. I wasn't mind blown by anything only the fact that it tasted exactly like a fresh sweet potato and nothing artificial. I thought it was pricey for the amount of ice cream and the concept but I'm open to coming back and trying their shaved ice next time.
