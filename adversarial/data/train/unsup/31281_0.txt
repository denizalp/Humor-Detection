Finally!!  After a lot of effort I finally reached the owner, Raul, who took the time to listen to my concerns.  He apologized for all the problems and even had a salt cell system put in at no charge to help with an ongoing Pebble Sheen fading issue.  Very nice guy.  I wish that I had been able to speak to him a year ago.  It would have made things a whole lot  easier.
