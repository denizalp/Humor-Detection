I am writing this review on my phone from the bathroom here (which is freezing cold by the way). I am wearing a pink J Crew oxford shirt (sleeves rolled partly up my forearms), rubber duck boots, and leggings as pants. \n\nI came here with my BFF (best friend forever) and we're both on krokodil so this review might not make a huge amount of sense, apologies in advance. They have a good selection of beers on tap and on the black board, nothing noteworthy or really daring. I ordered the perogies, which I think are still frozen or maybe they're stale (do perogies go stale?) because I can pick them up and dip them in the FOR SURE frozen sour cream. So maybe don't order those. I don't know about the other food but I'm not too interested in checking it out. \n\nOur waitress was pretty nice and friendly although I think she dislikes me because of all my casual references to \"my car\" and \"my driver\" and \"my clean clothes.\" She could sense that my friend was cooler than me. \n\nUltimately it's a nice place and I like the darkness and the vibe but make sure you sit away from the door in the winter because whenever it opens you'll get a cold draft. Unless you're on a bad acid trip and need to cool down (who still does that???). \n\nGod bless.
