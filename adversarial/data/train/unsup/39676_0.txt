I found their quote more flexible (in a good way) than other plumbers.   A lot of plumbers charge a flat $250 to snake a drain, but these guys will charge lower.   If the job turns into something bigger, you'll pay more, but that's life.\n\nThe technician I got was a fellow named Anthony and he snaked the pipe with a powerful auger and fixed the problem quickly.   My bill came in lower than expected.
