This is a inexpensive but good restaurant. You never have a wait and the delivery is fast. They also will never win any awards due to placement of the location or being in Plum. The egg rolls put to shame everywhere in Pittsburgh. The Tso chicken is crispy and very flavorful. I've tried the sushi before there and it wasn't the best ever but was better then a lot of places around here. I've tried numerous Chinese places around here including the one that always wins awards in Pittsburgh for being the best and this is better. You just pay more there because of the decor. Def try here if you are looking for quality American Chinese food.
