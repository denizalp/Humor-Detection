So, it seems I have a bit of a souvlaki obsession. The latest victim of my insatiable appetite is The Greek Grill, located on the (Greek) Danforth, whose menu really meant it when they called my plate a \"large\". \n\nThe salad, a little basic with its oil and vinegar (reminding my sister and I both of something we would and have eaten at home), was good and obviously old-school, but we both have a thing for fast-food Greek salads and their more manufactured dressings. But this is our problem, not theirs.\n\nThe (large) portion of chicken was very satisfying, both in its volume and its juicy tastiness. The potatoes were thoroughly soaked in flavor and perfectly moist, falling apart delightfully. The tzaziki was some of the most potent I've ever had, requiring about 5 mints to (almost) fade into the past (which of course, is both a good and bad thing at different times).\n\nThere was an attractive but comfy interior, friendly waiters, and I believe the owner came up to us a couple of times, offering kind seasons greetings and an opportunity for input in that way only restaurant owners can. Oh! and they cooked something (I'm pretty sure it was the special of the day- fish) in FIRE, right next to us. Now, all I need to do is get over my fear of the unknown (or the un-souvlaki) and try something new-- and more excitingly prepared.
