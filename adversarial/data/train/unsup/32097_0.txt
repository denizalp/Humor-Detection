I am so happy I found this eye care location. I say eye care because it was more than just an optometrist office to get new glasses. Dr Ha found a major issue with my eyes that was not treated by other optometrists and very detrimental to my eyesight. He is treating it aggressively and actually decided not to waste my time with doing an eyeglass exam that would have been worthless unlike the others until this issue is handled. I applaud him for that!!  \n\nThe staff is courteous and knowledgeable and made me feel at ease from the moment I walked in.  The office is clean and inviting. I have already recommended this location to my family to make the change from their current eye doctors to this group. \n\nDo yourselves a favor and give them a try!
