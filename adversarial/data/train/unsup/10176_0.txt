Excellent service and the hotel is great.  Staying at the governor's club is what made this experience even better.  \nThe only bad thing about it is the shuttle management if you are staying here for Epic.  There were many people going to Epic during my stay and there was only two shuttles available, leaving several people behind on the first trip to and from Epic.
