Delicious pizza!!! I'm a huge fan of the truffle oil one! I wish we had ordered two of these instead of the margherita. Service was super fast and efficient for a busy Friday evening - I was impressed. I also loved the ambiance of the restaurant. We were seated outdoors by the entrance and it was surrounded by trees but it didn't feel too woodsy.\n\nAlways save room for dessert too. The banana nutella crepe was amazing!
