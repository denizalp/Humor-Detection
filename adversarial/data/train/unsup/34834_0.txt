So we ordered the Gotham pizza, a cannoli and two tubs of ice cream. I'll say that the best thing we had was the ice cream. The pizza was good but not the greatest and the cannoli was actually really disappointing. I would go back just for the ice cream. I got the banana ice cream and the chocolate with coconut. They were both good!
