Hands down the BEST wine bar in Phoenix! Let's talk about this. The menu has enough variety to satisfy everyone, food is always fresh, and I love the rotating beer and wine menu. I always try a taste of Brent's latest pick of vino. If you haven't heard about the famous $20 special on Monday and Tuesday nights, you must come down and try it for yourself. These folks really know their wine and bruschetta. What about dessert? You haven't really had an affogato before until you've had a Postino affogato. And the chocolate bouchon? AH-MA-ZING! Have you popped in for brunch lately? I go nuts for the Farm Scramble; they know just how to roast Yukon Gold potatoes and it's always just the right blend of gruyere and white cheddar. Yum! Treat yourself to the triple cream brie and walnut toast; you'll be pleased with the berry preserve that tastes oh-so-truly housemade. The servers here know their wine and treat you with platinum service. Seriously. I feel like I am being waited on hand and foot when I come here. I see my water glass refilled before I can even ask, my wine bottle never stops pouring and they beat me to it whenever I feel like I need a second helping of well..anything. No wonder this is such a spot for first dates - if you want to make a good impression or really just make sure your guests have a good time, this is the place where you'll surely be taken care of.
