So I'm sitting at RnR on a Tuesday night when Salty Senorita turns their music up so loud that I can't hear myself think on the RnR patio. I call Salty Senorita. No answer. I call again and someone answers. I tell them I'm a guest across the street and it's unbearably loud. They respond, \"What?!\" and hang up. What a joke.
