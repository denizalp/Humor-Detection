If you want to splurge, this place has the most comfortable and classiest undergarments for women.\n\nSure, it's expensive, but if you catch their clearance sale, it's a darn good deal! \n\nPicture yourself laying on the bed with only the silkiest, softest lingerie with lacy fringes.  Now, if you're a guy reading this, picture your favorite lady as you lay beside her feeling the lingerie next to your skin.  You'd probably be thinking about wanting to wear one too.  Not judging.  \n\nMonique H. is right about the pH.
