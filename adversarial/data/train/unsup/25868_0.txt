This is a great place for breakfast or brunch, and really, every single dish on the menu has eggs. If you love eggs there is no other place better than this. There is a large list of pancakes, eggs benedict (several different ways), omelettes and just about anything else you can think of. The food was very good, though the service was a little slow. I got the large breakfast which included two eggs, ham, bacon etc. The reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is that the toilets were gross. I know that they're busy, but just no excuse for dirty toilets. If you enjoy juices, they have a decent juice bar.
