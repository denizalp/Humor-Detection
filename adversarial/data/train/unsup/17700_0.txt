It's about time that people be a lot more honest in their reviews of Matt's Big Breakfast.\nThis place is over hyped in every sense, and mainly - still - because of its faux-trendy\/hip atmosphere...  that was cute five or so years back.\nThough, what matters is the food and maybe the surroundings of a place, right?\n\nWell, the servings are hearty (pack an extra artery), and the home fried potatoes are tasty.\n\nThat's about it.\nEnd of review.\n\nNo... got to be a little more honest here.\n\nThe rest of the menu is mediocre at best, and hardly worth an hours' wait in line and\/or just to be seated, nor enough to chew on or pay for.  The first or second time might be cool, you may enjoy it.  But the third time there you'll be honest to admit that there's far better elsewhere.\nAs surroundings go, the place is like a muggy gym locker room but smaller in size, and so poorly ventilated that you'll think that the proprietor's must think nothing of sitting in the humidity upon a toilet of a rest stop in Austin, TX with their plate of food on their knees.\nMe thinks that anyone with a few simple squares of aluminum foil and heat could cook any of Matt's menu items within their own kitchen and very likely do better within 20 minutes flat, easy.\n\nI don't mean to sound harsh or scathing, but after hearing so many sheep over hyping this place time after time you realize it's all fake kissy-kiss talk.  \"Phooey!\", I say.\n\nThe most important thing you must know and take from this - regardless of whether anything I'm saying here is something you agree with or not - is to beware of the... ehm... \"coffee\".  Sincerely.  I've heard many others state that you must be an incredibly gracious customer to take a sip.  Merely a whiff of its bouquet brings to mind a vinaigrette of acrid rags and dank wool socks.  Most folks count on having a great cup of coffee with their breakfast; a great cup of coffee is obviously required in conjunction with breakfast.  Like the necessary combinations of two things: Sun & Moon, peanut butter & honey, soap & water, doesn't everyone have a knowing that if you're going to serve coffee during breakfast it needs to taste like coffee?  Even if it's the most watered down brew it needs to taste something LIKE coffee.  Apparently Matt's will hear none of that; they don't seem to be aware nor have heard the talk that some folks don't return just because their coffee resembles what Grandpappy brewed up in a drop-pan a week ago ON TOP OF the coffee grounds that he brewed a month ago, then filtered through newspaper taken from the doghouse outside and used a second time to line the bottom of a bird cage.  (Shwew!)  In fact, I can count two separate occasions when I had actually overheard a server apologize to customers who'd commented on their putrid brew.  Utterly disgusting.\n\nThe servers and cooks are nice, friendly and personable (I'm talking - genuinely enjoy what they do) and that, admittedly, counts for a whole lot.\nNonetheless, give Matt's a try at least once.\nAt least.\nBut, pass on the coffee... or, \"Don't go into the light!\" as they say of near death experiences.
