I FINALLY tried Joyride Taco House last Taco Tuesday! For such a cute & trendy place I was expecting decent tacos... What did I get? Ah-mazing tacos! The wait was long, but it did go by pretty fast. Probably because the service was speedy and how long could it take to whip up a few tacos?! I appreciated this, along with their awesome staff. \n\nI ordered 3 tacos off of the Taco Tuesday menu. Each delicious in their own way, but my fav had to be the \"Chicken Tinga\" taco. The \"Standard\" and \"Carne Asada\" were both good too! But that white magic they put on the Chicken Tinga was as good as they made it sound. Can't wait to come back soon for another Taco Tuesday, or Happy Hour!
