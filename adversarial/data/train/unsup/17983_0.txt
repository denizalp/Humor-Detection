I like hakka Chinese. it is interesting because the whole story about in India and other regions with significant Indian populations, the locally known \"Hakka cuisine\" is actually an Indian adaptation of original Hakka dishes. This variation of Hakka cuisine is in reality, mostly Indian Taiwanese cuisine. It is called \"Hakka cuisine\" because in India many owners of restaurants that serve this cuisine are of Hakka origin. Typical dishes include 'chilli chicken' and 'Dong bei chow mein' (an Indianised version of real Dongbei cuisine), and these restaurants also serve traditional Indian dishes such as pakora. \n\nI like it because it is Indian flavours in Chinese food. This place was pretty decent, I had the manchuria balls, and hakka noodles, i enjoyed eating it a lot, and might go here over Lucky Chinese which is farther and greasier.
