Our family has been going to Dr Bennett for years and she is great but the PA Jim and the other PA Deb are completely useless. The problem is that you have to schedule out a ridiculously long time to actually see Dr. Bennett. If you go see either of the PA's be ready for them to jump to conclusions on what is wrong with you before they even look at the problem. \n\nAlso prepare to wait an extremely long time for lab results to be given to you. This last time we had to call SimonMed and have the results resent to the office a week after they sent the originals. When you are in pain and don't know what's wrong that week becomes very stressful. But then when the results show up negative and they don't continue to look for an explanation for the pain their only answer was pain injections.\n\nThe last tip is if you are overweight be prepared for their never ending pushing for them to get you on their apple weight loss plan. Because the fact that you are overweight is the explanation for every medical thing that is wrong with you even if your blood test show that you are healthy in every other way. Your arm hurts and we can't figure out why well it must be because you are fat. Your period is not regular and you want birth control to help well you know if you lost some weight it would regulate itself.
