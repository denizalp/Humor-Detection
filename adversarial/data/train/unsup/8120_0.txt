I've never had a bad shish taouk in Montreal, I feel like giving Basha only four stars because they give all of us Canucks plastics plates and automatically serve Middle Eastern terrorists with fancy china. But I haven't found a good shish taouk or shawarma in the USA since I relocated 7 yrs ago ( still looking ), so it gets a 5*.
