I am a native of Phoenix. I am so sad that so many restaurants that I have loved for decades are failing their customers. Why, oh why, does it have to be so?? We used to eat at this Macayo's location weekly. But, because the quality had been suffering, we haven't eaten at Macayo's for several years. \n\nWe tried it today in hopes of rekindling our love of Macayo's. After all, the doors are still opened (to our surprise) so we thought maybe they changed it back up. Well....not so. We ordered our meal and the first thing my hubby and I tasted was the rice. It looked fantastic!! Visually, the texture was good and there were chunks of stewed tomatoes, just the way we like it!! BUT, the rice tasted like they had put cleaning product in the pan and forgot to rinse it!!! I mean it was DISGUSTING and RANK!!! I took a picture of the rice in case my husband and I ended up in the hospital or dead. I wanted to document the cause.\n\nWe advised the server. She was very awesome!!! She sent over the manager whose attitude was basically \"whatever\". She offered us beans. My husband said yes and I said no. \n\nWe got our bill and we were overcharged. I pointed it out the the manager who \"corrected\" the bill. We put cash out (the cash amount was obvious) and the manager asked us if we needed change:  Based on the amount of our bill, she was asking us if we were willing to leave almost a 100% tip. NOPE!! Add insult to injury (the rice tasted like it was poison, we were overcharged and now we are being asked to leave an almost 100% tip), in the end, even though the manager \"fixed\" the overcharge, we were STILL OVERCHARGED!!!! \n\nNEVER, EVER, EVER will we give Macayo's another opportunity to earn our business!! There are way too many other options!! Come on, Macayo's!!
