One of the best pubs I've ever visited! Not only is the staff amazing, but the drink menu is amazing and I've had the very best gin and tonic here....and I've had plenty. I realize it's a basic drink, but they have a local Quebec Gin and different flavors of tonic. But I have to say my favorite part was the music.  You can sit outside upstairs and that is definitely the preference when it is warm, but I prefer the downstairs. A bit of a cave feel, but very cozy.  And you can here the music much better. Plus it is the staffs area and you get to interact with them more. I have not eaten here, but I've seen just about every dish go out and they look and smell delectable! Definitely worth the venture off the beaten path!
