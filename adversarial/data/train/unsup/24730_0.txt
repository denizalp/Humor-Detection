Red Star Lounge [RSL]. (3.5 stars).\n\n\"99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.\" - Anonymous\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye was the RSL sign. It reminds me oddly enough of the Heineken logo...\n\nNote: While I'm not a huge fan of Heineken, I do remember singing \"99 bottles of beer\" with my fellow college classmates as they literally tried to drink \"99 bottles of beer\"... Idiots! LOL.\n\nMy curiosity got the best of me and I decided to stop here on my way over to NE.\n\nThe employees are very friendly & made my layover quite pleasant.\n\nRSL is located @ CLT (Charlotte Douglas International Airport) between Gates B10 and B12.\n\nRSL is a no frills, grab & go bar that has some advantages.\n\nOn the plus side, u can have a drink in an open air environment vice a pub or bar.\n\nOn the down side, u have to deal with the varying decibels of noise when Gates B10 &\/or B12 are boarding.\n\nRSL has the typical flair of beer offerings & a decent selection of liquors.\n\nThe price point is comparable to most other establishments that serve adult beverages @ CLT.\n\nI didn't see a menu for food but in all honesty, since the bar area is quite small, I couldn't imagine trying to eat anything here.\n\nIf I ever return to CLT & have a flight heading out of the B Concourse, I'll definitely come back for a quick pit stop.\n\n---\n\nAll in all, once I got over the noise level, sitting at the bar was quite pleasant.\n\nRSL has a TV which is nice. Especially during the NFL season! #GoPats!!!\n\nThe friendly service is what would draw me back to RSL as every other establishment offers cirtuallythe same beverages.
