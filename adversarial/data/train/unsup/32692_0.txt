I ordered from here, thinking it would be your typical Thai food, given the name of this place, who wouldn't think otherwise? I only ordered two items from here via EAT24, and the food was delivered. I am very impressed with the quality of the food, it is flat out delicious! I ordered the Pad See Ew and the Green Curry. Both of them were fantastic. The Pad See Ew was the best I ever had in Vegas. This place cares about food, and they show it. I would like to give the Chef's a shout out - excellent job. The name of this place could be deceiving, but the quality of the food will make you come back.
