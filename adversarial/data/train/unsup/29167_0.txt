The bagels are good, however, they're not the best I've ever had. My sister's order came out missing two of the ingredients, the cheese and the avocado. The staff here is honestly the best though, which is a big reason for the four stars. Friendly, helpful, and genuine people who care about their customers!! I walked in and immediately felt welcomed with their hearty greetings and smiles. Great vibes and decor!
