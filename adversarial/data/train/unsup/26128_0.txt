Went here for a friend's bachelorette party. We didn't know what to expect since it was our first time in a place like this, but overall we had a lot of fun. For only $25pp, we were piked up in an SUV, given tickets for 2 free drinks, and had access to both the male and female strip areas. The bartenders were great, the place was packed and the shows were quite entertaining. Definitely a must go place for a bridal party if you don't want to spend tons on going to the shows like Chippendales and Thunder From Down Under.
