Just had my wallpaper  installation completed by Tim - owner and wallpaper installer. He did an outstanding job.  I had another quote from another company and chose Tim as he was easy to deal with, friendly and professional - it was clear he knew his stuff. \nHe arrived 10 minutes early  ( always a good sign ) and came with all his tools including a special wallpaper table that he set up -he was very organized. \nHe worked methodically and quietly in our very small guest bathroom and performed the work with a keen eye for detail. The end result  was beautiful, and done to a very high standard. \nTim himself was a very nice guy, and I am pleased to know that I have now found my go-to wallpaper guy in the city.  Highly recommend.
