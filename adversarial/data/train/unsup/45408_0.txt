Stinkweeds is the best record store in town for indie\/alternative music releases. They have a great vinyl selection, both new and used. Their staff is friendly and knowledgeable, really top notch! If you need concert tickets, they are the best way to go. The convenience charge is only a buck, which is much cheaper than online, just bring cash for the tickets. (They take most major credit cards for other purchases.) They take pride in their local first attitude. Enjoy.
