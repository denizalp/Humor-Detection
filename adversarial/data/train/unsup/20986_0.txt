It's cool that they serve fresh vegan desserts. I had a slice of their vegan vanilla peach cake ($3.50). It was the worst cake I've ever had on par with those giant sheet cakes served at kids' ice skating\/inflatables\/laser tag birthday parties. This was my first time trying vegan cake, so perhaps what I'm about to write is a feature of all vegan cakes: the cake tasted stale, like a weird brick-- dense and fudgy instead of cakey. It tasted nothing like peach. The icing was overly sweet and tasted like the kind you'd get on a Walmart cake. You know what I mean-- that weird, powdered sugar taste... and smell... *shudder*. I felt nauseated after eating it.\n\nOne HUGE gripe: the description specifically said that the cake was frosted. This is incorrect. The cake was iced. I hate icing. Which was why I was so excited to have some frosted cake. Icing is the nastiest thing that man has ever invented. Never trust a baker that can't tell the difference between the two!\n\nI've also bought groceries here and at the old Strawberry Fields. Still unbelievably overpriced. It felt like I was coming upon a new joke at each aisle. A pint of ice cream costs $7.29 without tax. A frozen pizza is about $14. A small bag of dried peas (with enough peas to fill a sandwich Ziploc bag) was about $5 as well. Peas are supposed to be cheap, yo. A package of cookies: $9. A small box of vegan chicken nuggets or a tiny bag of vegan meat tips: ~$15. One can of Amy's soup is $5. I've never seen Amy's products priced like this at anywhere but Strawberry Fields. The prices are marked up like hell. You can get some of these things cheaper at County Market.\n\nI only came here to get some meat alternatives (I got two packs of vegan hot dogs for about $15), but I could never justify shopping here again for groceries or desserts. Vegan food can be cheap. But not at Strawberry Fields. Bumping one star though for carrying a good selection of vegan meats\/cheeses.
