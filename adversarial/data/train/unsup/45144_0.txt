Super disappointing experience. Came here on a sunny morning a few weeks ago with some friends, and was excited to see that the patio was open. That was pretty much the last good sentiment of the visit. Ordered a drink from a very brusque waitress, and it never came. When I asked her about it over 20 minutes later, she claimed that I'd never spoken to her at all. No apology. My friend ordered the waffles and it was very obvious they'd been pulled out of a freezer and maybe even microwaved? They looked like eggos. Cool whip and meager portion of fruit on top. My other friend ordered Eggs Benny, waited ages for them, had them arrive with the wrong meat on top, sent them back, and then waited so long for them to fix the issue that she ended up cancelling her order entirely. We were served by multiple different waitresses and I assumed the confusion was a result of them being busy and understaffed or something, but when I went inside to use the bathroom there was almost no one there. The staff was rude and dismissive about the whole situation. I didn't end up getting charged for my drink, but I'm pretty sure that was just an oversight, not an apology. I'm not usually a picky diner by any means, but this was memorably bad.
