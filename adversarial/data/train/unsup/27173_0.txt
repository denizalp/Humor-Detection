I have had wide range of Japanese food before, from authentic to Americanized. You will have a more authentic experience at Nagasaki Grill. It is owned by a Japanese couple who are reserved and speaks Japanese to themselves. I read the reviews before I went there, so I was prepared to face less than ideal interaction from the owner\/server which was fine with me. Now, food-wise, it was great. We had salmon sashimi for appetizer. They were THICK pieces of salmon and fresh. For main course I ordered don katsu (fried pork and rice) and salmon covered rice. Katsu was ok. A little thin and dry. Salmon covered rice was great. I thought it was going to be cooked salmon but I loved it nontheless. My favorite part was STRAWBERRY BOBA TEA! It had real ground strawberries and boba balls. I would definitely go back!
