This is my favorite Centurion Lounge out of all of the ones I've visited. I've always received friendly, exceptional service (I hope this review doesn't jinx it for me). \nThere are plenty of places to sit. They have comfy semi-private seating that's great for couples. There is also plenty of table space for laptops if you need to get some work done. Although the lounge itself is usually pretty busy (never packed, but still a decent amount of people), I still find it to always be quiet and relaxing. Children are welcome here! There's a a separate little kid's room with some toys and books and seating for parents as well. \nThe complimentary bar is outstanding! The bartenders are always super friendly and accommodating. Bring some cash to tip them as they work really hard! They have a great selection of premium wine, beer and liquor. For lunch they usually have a nice salad bar and a few different soups. There is usually a small hot entree selection as well. The staff come by and are fairly quick to bus empty plates and clean empty tables. \nWith great service, food, drinks, and clean restrooms what more could you want before your flight?
