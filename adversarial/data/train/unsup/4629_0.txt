There's that one girl.  I think you'll remember her:  just a bit heavy on the makeup, hair and clothes a good decade off being current, but boy.  Ready.  Always, always ready.  Some call her \"a go-er.\"  Just say where and when.\n\nOriginal Pancake House.  \"A sure thing.\"  Hate the setting, Mid-west Strip Mall Contemporary.  Hate the section of Chagrin Boulevard, where it transitions from two lanes, to one lane turn only, to no lanes that ever move because Eton shoppers are texting their Whole Foods organic mung bean recipes while \"driving.\"  Hate a bunch of things.\n\nBut the food?  Ah, there's only love for the food.  Great service, too, almost old-fashioned and familiar.  First time ever at this place and had three people talk with me like they actually wanted me there and were willing to make sure I would return.  Busy times will always have a line, because good food and service will out.  I surveyed three other tables and could only find full satisfaction.  How very refreshing.\n\nA sure thing.  A \"go-er.\"  (And if you see her, let me know.  I kinda miss old mattress-back.)
