Fantastic! Great family restaurant, nice portions and there service is also very quick and friendly also. The decor is nice, gives it an old Greek feel. We were 4 people and we each took a different dish m, I took the chicken gyro it was fantastic! But my favourite part of the meal was there salad with special creamy dressing.... Listen if your not a big salad fan this dressing will change EVERYTHING! \n\nWe also took calamari, the batter was nice and light and the portion is huge! We also took a Greek cheese pie, I found it a little on the salty side. I'm heading there this weekend again! I'll make sure to take a lot of pictures.
