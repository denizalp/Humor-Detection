There aren't a lot of deep dish pizza options in the GTA, or at least I dont know of any so its only fair to give 5 stars.\n\nso many reasons to like this place:\n- great tasting pizza and they dont skimp on the ingredients.\n- excellent staff. took the time to explain what the options were and how the menu works\n- 18$ for a large that can feed 3 people\n- didn't think i'd enjoy a pizza with bbq sauce but it was the more memorable one\n- around 15 flavors too choose from and I really do want to try each one.\n\nneeds improvement:\n- really just a take-out place. dining space probably seats a mximum of 5 people\n- 45 mins for a pizza but i guess this is the price you pay for fresh and done from scratch food. Next time, call in in advance and itll be done by the time you get there.
