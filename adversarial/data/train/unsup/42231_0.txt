This place is awesome! Charles made me even prettier. I didn't think that was possible, LOL.\nSeriously, as a guy, I was reluctant at first.  However, I went with my wife, talked to Charles and he explained everything in detail.  We discussed a few minor things that would keep me looking healthy.   \nHis staff is awesome and best of all, I didn't feel like I was walking in to a \"girlie\" salon.  \nThanks for being a first rate professional. Highly recommended.
