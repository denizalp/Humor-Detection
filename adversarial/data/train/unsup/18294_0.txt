Solid-ish sportsbook, if you're not drinking or eating. Lots of screens, seating isn't exactly comfortable but there are two or three different types of chair styles to pick from as well as booth-style seating along the back wall.\nNothing different from any other 'book for placing your bets. Sometimes you'll luck into a free drink coupon with your bet though, which is a plus.\n\nBut the bartenders in that particular area are surly and rude- coming up to get a drink to two guys standing together, one rolled his eyes at me and gestured to the other bartender when I tried to place my order. Not sure if he was the bar back and not the bartender proper, or if he was off the clock, or just didn't want to deal with me, but an eye roll is not the way to handle that.\n\nAnd $9 for a bottle of Corona is bullshit. Expected, but still bullshit.
