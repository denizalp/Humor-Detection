Couldn't be happy from the start. My husband went to make a reservation and they use some kind of email form so you have to wait to hear back if your reservation is accepted. Kind of reminds me of the 1980's. So he sent the note stating we would go else ware as we could not wait and suggested they look at real time reservations online. Here was the response from the GM... Then my recommendation would be that you call. We have no need for open table as we are a local business. NOT a chain. It works out anyway because I'm full at the time slot you requested. I hope you try us out another time. Have a wonderful day. \n\nWe are so insulted that his response was so distant from what diners do this day with technology. So needless to say we will not be ever going here ever. To all who read this, you have sen warned!
