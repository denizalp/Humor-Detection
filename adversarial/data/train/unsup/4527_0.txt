I was happy with my old Gym in Pointe Saint-Charles but we moved to the west and it became too far. So... we embraced in a quest for our next gym. Among those that we visited, I decided to get a membership at this one. My reasons were:\n\n-Location: Convenient, on my way between my house and places where I work and go out and shop. Near a train station, so easy to go when not in car.\n\n-Hours: It's open 24 hours! Always open, so whenever I want to exercise, there is no excuses!\n\n-Services: It's a big gym with lots of different machines, clean showers, a women-only section. Among the places I did consider, it was one of the most complete. The one thing missing is a pool but there are other options for that.\n\n-Price: It was pretty much in line with the prices at the Y and other gyms. True, a place like Monster gym was cheaper if you are two but since it was a bit far, I would have been the only one going so it lost its edge there. There was one in Ile Perot that was cheaper but it felt old and not at all on par as services goes so not comparable really.\n\nBonus: It's on boulevard Saint-Charles so I am not too much disoriented from Pointe Saint-Charles ;-)\n\nIt's also part of a small mall with a supermarket and an SAQ so it's convenient when you need a few things at the same time.
