It's about time these guys made their way to Vegas! I've been anticipating their arrival for months now, so you bet I begged Hubby to take me to The Halal Guys Grand Opening.\n\nWe've both tried their food at different locations, but this was our first time together (Aww!). I decided on the small platter with beef gyro. Although I prefer chicken, I felt obligated to order the gyro since it's a staple of Mediterranean cuisine. I'm glad I did too since it was sooo tasty! Hubby's chicken platter was equally delicious.\n\nI made the previous mistake of overdoing it with the hot sauce. My poor tongue didn't stand a chance. :( This time around, I made sure to only put a couple drops of that sucker. Paired with their famous white sauce, Kalamata olives, bell peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, rice, pita, and beef gyro, it was absolute perfection!\n\nWhile others seem rather critical, I can say I loved it. Sure their AC is temporarily broken and their prices are a little steep, but you're getting a substantial amount of oh so satisfying food. The generous Halal Guys even provided free water bottles and complimentary white & red sauce for their Grand Opening. That's all the extra sauce you could dream of, minus the extra .99 cost!\n\nFor the best of both worlds, it's a good idea to order the popular Combo Platter with both chicken and beef gyro. The crowds are insane, so it's also probably a good idea to wait for the hype to die down to make another visit. I just don't know if my Halal cravings will allow me to do so. ;-)
