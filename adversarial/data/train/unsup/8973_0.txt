I've been here so many times and yet I keep forgetting to tell you yelpers how much I like this place! \n\nOnly thing I'm not a fan of are the hours. 7am - 6pm. I work a 9am-5am job, and I would LOVE to hang out here after work and have a cup of their magnificent Cr√®me Brule! It's always my go to drink. Delicious and savory. That with a piece of their Madeleine. So yummy! \n\nI've also tried both of their quiche, and you wont be disappointed! It looks a little bit burnt on top, but there's no burnt taste or anything. Promise! I get them a lot. Also, try out their sandwiches! \n\nMy two favorites: \n\nQuest, which is duck with their home made onion jam and butter. Scrumptious! So much flavor and so their breads are always soft! FRIKKIN YUM, MAN! \n\nNord, the smoked salmon sandwich goodness! Very delectable and you can never go wrong when it comes to salmon! Their home made jam must be it too! I about cried when I took a bite of this. \n\nWith those sandwiches, they do drown it with a generous amount of salad. All that color in one plates make it look so beautiful! \n\nI have also had their desserts. Macaroons, Opera, tiramisu, and parfait. All were amazing. I know I sound vague, but I'm usually not a fan or all of those and  I gobbled it all up when I did have them.\n\nGive this place a chance! I'm a happy camper every time!
