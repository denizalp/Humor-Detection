THIS IS A MESSAGE FOR JESUS ALMAREZ WELLS FARGO  \nSo I had some issues with PayPal I called to make a payment on items I purchased, I wanted to use a credit it card not my wells Fargo bank acct. They told me that I could not change the payment method because it was pay after delivery, so I told them I don't have the money in the bank to cover the items and need to pay with other card, they said I had to let the payments go through Wells Fargo and that they would send a letter to have the over draft fees removed for me and that is exactly what they did. So I took the letter to the bank and the manager Jesus Almarez would not except the letter. He pretty much called me a liar and didn't believe the letter was from Pay pal. He wanted me to tell them to send a letter head I said Ok so after wasting my time and gas I had to drive home call Pay pal ask them to send me a letter head and they said they don't send letter heads its not one of the procedures they use, Jesus wanted you to mail it to me no email he said.  Isn't that funny who does he think he is, pay pal said the letter they sent me is the only form they provide, and they do this often and never had this type of issue with any bank. So I call Jesus and had pay pal on the phone at same time the women at Pay pal said that she could only email it to Jesus directly or to me Jesus said no I don't have email Pay pal said there is no other way Jesus still wouldn't except letter. I told Jesus Almarez that if he wasn't going to help me that I was going to file a complaint and that's what I am doing this bank has  class action lawsuits do to them switching around payments processing in your account they make sure the small ones go through first so you get over draft fees look it up. Then I went into the wells Fargo complaint website and its called hissing kitty what does that me that they think that you complaining about them ripping you off is a joke to them. Well what I think is that Wells Fargo is a joke and that they think they  can do what they want, there is no set rules from branch to branch. Maybe if people stopped putting there hard earned money into this bank that they would not have jobs since we the customers are the ones who you owe your job to. So what I decided is to go with a credit union and am loving it.\nSO WELLS FARGO HOPE TO SEE PEOPLE STAND UP AND PUT YOU OUT AND JESUS ALMAREZ IT COULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO HAVE HELPED A CUSTOMER IN NEED I HAD DOCUMENTS PRESENTED TO YOU AND I QUESS YOU ARE THE WELLS FARGO GOD, NO LONGER DO YOU HAVE MY BUSINESS AND HOPFULLY AFTER I COMPLAIN ABOUT YOU TO COORPERATE YOU WANT HAVE A JOB.
