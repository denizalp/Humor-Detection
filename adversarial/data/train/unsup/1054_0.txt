It's a little shop set up in an otherwise over looked area. However, the cuisine is not your typical Chinese fast food. In fact I would say it's one of the more diverse menus in the East Valley. With so many options it proved to be a daunting tasking on choosing what to eat, in a good way of course! We settled for their Xiaolong bao and the beef pie. The soup dumplings were delicious, and packed full of flavor. Tied in with the crisp bite of the vinaigrette made an amazing pair. The beef pie was also very juicy and the breading encasing the patties on the inside was nice and toasty on the outside while the inside absorbed the juices. Making for delectable treat.
