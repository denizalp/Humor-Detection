The customer service is mediocre. For instance, I asked if they had a certain product, the lady working the counter just pointed at the case and looked at me funny. As if I'm going searching around all the cases for a single product. The prices are waaay higher than most shops.  I purchased my vaporizer here, they gave me the wrong batteries for it; the 40 minute drive not worth even returning them. You couldn't pay me to go back. \n\nThe only redeeming factor and why I'm giving it two stars is their inventory is solid and have quite a few things most shops don't.
