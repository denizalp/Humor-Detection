I have been going to Sacred Serenity Skincare for almost 2 years now & I LOVE IT! \n\nIlona is the most knowledgeable, thorough & professional aesthetician I have ever met. She always remembers how my skin looked the time before and the treatments we used. She knows what is best for my skin at each individual appointment and which products will be beneficial afterwards. \n\nShe makes the entire process quick, relaxing and extremely valuable for my skin. I would highly recommend Ilona!
