For Laura P:\n\nYou have the right to your opinion but before you file a lawsuit against anything FYI I shop here and from what I know  Linda is actually Cambodian and that my dear makes you very ignorant and discriminating againist Hispanics and classified yourself as a typical white girl..\n\nAs for the store I personally love the clothes and the styles that have are way cheaper than ANGL and the boutique stores around them which is for me personally more affordable. Some stuff looks the same and is a good $25 less. The store is all broken up in different colors and I enjoy it more because I can find things easier. I live in Henderson so I normally shop there but when I come down here I stop by because they do have different clothes that the Henderson one doesnt have. Customer service is always great Linda is always helpful and everyone talks to me. But if you are someone who doesnt like to be talked to than I dont recommend it. They always acknowledge me when I walk in and check on me. So I recommend to you if you are sociable and dont mind interaction also if you want to save a little to get the exact style in a different store.
