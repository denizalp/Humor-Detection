This place worth coming for the lake view! I came here to meet my friend and enjoy the lakeside in this warm season. I didn't expect much from the restaurant, however, ended up with a positive impression about food and service. \nWe ordered a couple of drinks and nachos for snacks. The portion was big with a few sauces on a side for comparatively small price. The waiter was very friendly and offered to refill my coffee every time I got it finished (I drink a lot of it btw). Staff here is so used to the fact that people come here for a nice view that they do not pressurize you to take a bill and leave as soon as possible. \nWill be back here again to try some more food.
