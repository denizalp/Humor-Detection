Dropped by for Lunch today at 2:15 pm.  Place was largely empty with  plenty of staff around. It took 20 mins  for my food and  later nearly 20 mins to receive check after my meal!. I asked to see dessert  menu,which was ignored twice by server.So no flan today !  Bottom line:Food was marginally OK ,Service was bad and this surprisingly  from an iconic  restaurant with 45 years in this  business . Emphasis evidently  is on bar offerings \"Casa Margarita'  they call it.Try El Bravo  or Las Glorias or Los Compadres if you are after good Mexican fare in  North Central Phoenix.   FYI :I've lived in this neighborhood for 46 years so I believe  i know  my Mexican food.  I voiced my dissatisfaction to the Manager.No plans to return.
