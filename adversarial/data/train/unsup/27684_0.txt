I absolutely love the mole with a side of Guac. I have been eating low-carb the last couple of months and instead of the rice and beans, I get a side salad and that salad dressing is so addicting and is made with fresh lemons. When I am feeling like I want to splurge, the Pambazo is the best choice with a side of their hand cut fries.
