Horrribleeeeee\n\nHorrribleeeeeeeeeee\n\nI must say that I am high disappointed in the establishment. Allow me to start off by saying I contacted Stroke in hopes of having an engagement celebration dinner. I called the number on Yelp and the number on good (same number) and never got any answers. I called a total of 11 times between last Thursday and Friday night and got no answers. I left them a total of 3 voicemails where NO ONE bothered to return my call. I managed to get transferred to the hotel attendant on one of my calls where he confirmed that they were open. Long story short is I'm high disappointed in the companies ability to miss 11 calls and not return 3 voicemails... who does that? Apparently Stroke does!!! And to think I was bribing 21 paying guess with me. Their lost not mines...
