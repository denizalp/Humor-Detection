The service was good and so was the beer. I had the Gorgonzola Ribeye and asked for it medium rare. It was leaned heavily toward the well done side, which is why I am just rating this at a 3. The fries and calamari on the other hand were delicious. Stephanie our server was also on top of things. Great job to her!
