I've eaten at many a sushi places, and umiya is just not one of my favorites. For me, it just wasn't good and it wasn't appetizing whatsoever! \n\nAmbiance: 3 - nice looking place with a fun atmosphere and giant tables to fill with sushi. So basically umiya is really nice for group dinners and sushi dates, etc. \n\nService: 2 - They were really great people with nice personalities, but our service was pretty terrible. They had a big group walk in on them and they couldn't really handle the rest of the restaurant. Food came really slow, and we were still pretty hungry afterwards. \n\nFood: 1 - If you would like to dine here, I suggest the garlic tuna nigiri and the soft shell crab appetizer. Those were the only 2 things out of the menu that I liked. \n\nFood took a long time to come to our table, so dishes that were supposed to be warm were cold and cold dishes were warm. But even then it didn't really taste great for me, so I still stick by to my 2 recommendations above. Have a good time dining, but I probably won't come back!
