This bar has everything it needs to be a huge hit: a great rooftop bar with a pool, view of the city, a city vibe, delicious cocktails, trendy furniture, friendly staff and did I mention delicious drinks!? \n\nLet's start with first things first. Lustre Bar is situated on the second floor of the Kimpton in Downtown Phoenix. Since the Kimpton is already on the second level to begin with, the Lustre Bar is well above the street level and therefore welcomes great views of Downtown and especially views of the Sun's arena and Chase Field. \n\nSeating is plenty and where most rooftop bars like this would require the purchase of a table in order to sit in one of the trendy seats, Lustre does not. While you sit outside under the stars, the luminous lights provide a lounge atmosphere and the music keeps you entertained. \n\nThis is definitely a great bar to visit after a long workday, after a sporting event, concert, show or simply if you want to go out in Downtown Phoenix and have a good time. Plus if you want some delicious food, eat at the Blue Hound downstairs first and then head upstairs after dinner for post-dinner cocktails at Lustre. \n\nBefore I go, I should mention the delicious cocktails. These are mixology masterpieces with fresh fruit, cool flavors and appeals to every type of palate. I go for the fruity ones and really loved the Floradora with beefeater gin, lime, raspberry syrup, ginger and soda.
