On the top of my daily Yelp email was \"Hot Diggity Dog\".  As A hot dog lover I had to take a peak.\n\nWalked down to corner of Trade and Fourth (right in front of Chima) and was surprised at the long line however good things come to those who wait.\n\nCoolest thing is all toppings are included in the very reasonable price so whatever you want its good.  Great guy to chat with and just an overall great spot.  Thanks for the email Yelp!\n\nTip - Get the melted cheese (it comes on some of the specialty dogs and he will be glad to put it on anything if you ask).
