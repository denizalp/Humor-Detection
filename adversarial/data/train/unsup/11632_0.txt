Came in around 9 pm on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy but there were a couple of people ordering. Idk if anyone else thinks this but I can usually tell how my visit will be based on how they welcome me in, especially if they're closing within the hour. I felt the staff was more annoyed that we came rather than excited. \n\nTook a look at their menu & I didn't really like any of their signature bowls besides the salmon poke. You can make your bowl with white rice, brown rice, or mixed greens. I opted for the brown rice. The bowl came with 2 different sauces. \n\nThere are so so many poke places opening in the vegas valley. The competition is pretty high & though yoshi burrito isn't bad, i didn't think it stood out. The fish was alright, it wasn't crazy fresh. If I'm in the neighborhood, I'll probably come back. Otherwise, it's not something I'd make the trip for.
