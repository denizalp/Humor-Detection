Everything I try here has always been tasty and filling.\n\nReal modern, spacious, and clean restaurant that never fails to cheer me up with their hospitality. You will always get your moneys worth no matter what meal you choose from. I'm always around during breakfast time but occasionally they have live Mariachi playing during the night if you want to join in on some karaoke.\nAll food is freshly prepped, coming out steaming hot. The Machaca con Huevo is great if you're into loading up tortillas, but there's some type of seasoning they put in their Breakfast Burrito that makes this simple dish taste so damn good! Desserts are a must if you have the room for it, first timers for Deep Fried Ice Cream are more than welcome... actually I think I'll go get some right after I hit up LVAC this weekend. (Talk about sugar synthesis)\n\nIf i had to be picky on what i didn't like, it would be the salsa that is served for their fluffy chips.. to much onions can be pretty overwhelming Lol. Other than that, solid 4.5 stars:)
