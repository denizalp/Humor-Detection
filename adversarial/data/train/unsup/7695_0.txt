Solid 3 stars, one renovation away from 4 stars. \n\nThis place is not a shithole at all but like others has been saying, you can still see traces of the former hotel that use to be here. But other then that I enjoyed my stay at the P.H, great location on the center strip. One quick elevator ride\/quick walk to the miracle mile shops.\n\nRooms were clean, nice bathroom with huge tub for two people ;) My only minor complaint is that the housekeeping people come really early in the morning, like 8am ready to clean up while I'm washing up my balls in the shower. \n\nI can't say too much about the casino since I don't gamble like that, but they have pretty much everything you'd wanna play and penny machines for the high rollers like myself. Overall I would stay here again but it would have to be for a great deal like I got in the first place.
