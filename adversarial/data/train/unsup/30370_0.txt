This Sam's club carries a few things that I enjoy but not enough in the food department. Lots of beverages to choose from although I only get water. 40 bottles of 16.9 fl oz for $4. Can't beat that right?\n\ni use to shop here for my dog food but I wanted something healthier for them to eat. I noticed recently they have a brand of Purina that has no wheat or soy and that chicken is the main ingredient. It's a lot cheaper than what I am buying now so I think I will switch to that. \n\nThe food section is large but most of it isn't organic so I have to carefully look through to find certain items that I like. They have organic coconut oil for only $8 and it's a big tub too. They sell meat by the bulk which leads me to believe at what hourly rate these animals are being killed to produce this much meat for hungry consumers. Not to mention how much meat people waste on a daily basis. I usually grab the salads that are organic and the cage free egg bundle. The clothes are a little pricey to me unless they are out of season. The same shorts they sold for $17 in the summer are now $9.99. I tried to find some in my hubbys' size but they were all gone.\n\nThis store is great for Restaurant owners and Large families. I like to buy certain things in bulk that don't expire and last a long time like toilet paper, paper towels, garbage bags and even dishwasher powder. It literally takes me a year to go through all the garbage bags that I own. haha. I wish the lines weren't so long here. They did add a few self check out lines but they are 10 items or less and don't accept cash. \n\nThe small cafe they have at the end is pretty nice. The italian sausage they have with peppers and onions is really good and full of flavor. The pizza is decent too but sometimes it's not cooked through all the way and the crust is extremely doughy. They could use a few more items like gaming consoles and shoes but i guess we will see what conspires!!
