I moved out of Cleveland Heights because of the CHPD.  If you go 1 mph over, you will get a ticket. If you do not come to a 3 second stop, you will get an expensive ticket. I'm white, so it isn't even a DWB thing.  I drive around Cleveland Heights rather than go through it and no longer patronize CH businesses.
