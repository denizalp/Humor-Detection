I had a serious craving for mozzarella sticks this past weekend. I was going to my parents house and this place popped up with 4 stars and a mile away. I called in an order of sticks, and added a slice of pepperoni. My total was like $12.\n\nI like that they sell pizza by the slice. However the slice I got was cold and barely reheated. The cheese wasn't even melted. I had already brought the food home otherwise I would have said something. Even after I warmed up the pizza, I didn't think it was very good. The mozzarella sticks were pretty good, and came 12 to an order. The sticks came with marinara and ranch. I gotta say my favorite thing was the ranch. It was thick and garlicky, and you can tell its house made. I definitely wanna come back and try their wings because they have like 10 different flavors, but I dont think I would come back for pizza.
