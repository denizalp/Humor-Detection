This place smells. Like literally smells. You can smell this awful stench wafting out of it before you even walk in the door. My guess is we were about 10 feet away from the front entrance and got this rank stench that infiltrated our nostrils.It made us gag and cough it's no bueno kids, no bueno.\n\nI have no idea what the rooms are like, but based on that smell I don't want to find out. EVER.  \n\nThe location is amazing and the views are amazing, which is why I thought it might be ...you guessed it...amazing.  But it reminds me of a retirement home and smells like one to boot!\n\npass
