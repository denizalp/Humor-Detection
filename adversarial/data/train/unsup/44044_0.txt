My 2017 Camry got a check engine light and my car had a strong odor of gasoline after service closed, I asked the receptionist if there was anyway they could get me a rental and she said they were closed so she recommended me to come in bright and early at 7am on Monday so they could look at my car so I told her I left for work at 6am cause I work in north Scottsdale so I told her I didn't not want to drive my car to Scottsdale and back because I was afraid my car would blow up or something from the strong odor of gasoline and she put me on hold to talk to a manager. When she came back on the phone she said her manager was going to get a hold of the rental manager to see if someone could come in tomorrow(today now) to get me a rental and I left my name and number and no one has reached out to me. It's great to know they don't care if their customers car blows up on the freeway cause it's not a sale! THANKS AVONDALE TOYOTA YOU GUYS ROCK!!!! The dealership I work at teaches their receptionist to hand out rentals cause they know stuff like this happens, you guys might want to look into that!
