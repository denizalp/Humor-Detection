This Wendy's used to be so good.  Wendy's in general used to be good.  Dave is probably rolling in his grave right now.  Wendy is nothing more than a pimped out fast food prostitute, the life torn from her, all over the dollar.\n\nNot only is the food not good anymore at pretty much any Wendy's, but the quality of service is severely lacking at this one and most in general.  Like most fast food places to me now (which I rarely eat at because of the decline in quality) it's better to go within the few hours of opening.  The foods fresh(er) and the staff doesn't hate the world just yet.  This location isn't even worth visiting just because it's on the main drag.  They need to inject some quality control into the management, employees and food or Wendy's will be the new Rally's.
