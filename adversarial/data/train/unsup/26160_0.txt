I really want to like this place. I have always wanted to try Big Tuna ever since I first saw it. Today we finally got a chance to do so. Things were... not exactly how I wanted it to be, but it was not horrible. Please do better Big Tuna!!!\n\nLocation: The place was well hidden, if you are not from the area you are most likely to miss it. The inside was dark and poorly lit, not something a restaurant wants to be, better lightning attracts customers. Minimum decor, although nice but doesn't stand out or leave an impression. \n\nMenu: Quite simple with 4 signature dishes (or rather, bowls), and the option to customize your own. The menu isn't not over complicated and easy to navigate. \n\nFood: I tried the Tuna signature bowl (Hakata if my memory serves me right). Taste was alright but the tuna was not fresh, the after taste was a little fishy. I'm guessing because the display fridge or bar was not cold enough. My gf tried the salmon one which was okay. Rice is a bit dry disappointing. \n\nService: It was okay, nothing fancy, our guy was nice to us and attentive. thumps up!\n\nPlease pay attention to your fish and rice, they are your main characters.
