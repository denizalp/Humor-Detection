Martin Kaye.\n\nMartin Kaye motherfuckers! \n\nThis show is about the music. \n\nQuestion #1: Do you like live music? No?\n\nIf the answer is no, why are you still reading? Why even contemplate attendance to this show? Get outta here. Go play some slots or something. \n\nThis brand of tomfuckery reminds me of the far-fringe, socially conservative assholes that go to Absinthe and are indigent with the crass-style comedy. Absinthe has vulgar comedy, Million Dollar Quartet has live music performed on stage; get over it or leave.\n\nI have heard this performed from as close as the second row and as far back as the booths. I have sat at a table (Note: lines-of-sight become terrible when one is seated at a table with two others in front, and so will your neck). I have yet to sit on the floor, but I would for this show. \n\nThat is all. - E
