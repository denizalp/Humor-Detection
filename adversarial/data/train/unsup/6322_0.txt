After a long few weeks of not having any form of liquids except water - I finally got elsewise!\n\nOrdered the Matcha Green Tea drink, it was about 6$ for a small - which was the size of a regular Starbucks cup size.\n\nWhipped cream was optional, which I added - and made the whole drink so much more delicious!\n\nThe matcha green tea tasted EXACTLY what a liquified form of green tea kit kats would. I was taken aback at first, but got used to it.\n\nNot too sweet, not too bitter - but excellent.\n\nAlthough waiting to place an order and for the drink to be made took quite awhile!\n\nBut then again, there was a lone one-man-worker.
