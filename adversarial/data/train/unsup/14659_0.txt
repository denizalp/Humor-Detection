This is a cute little atmosphere. Good selection of drinks and ICE CREAMS.  I got the apple, ginger, beet, carrot juice. It was just spicy enough and very refreshing. The owner is not a fan of take out service so I brought my own container.  You can get coffee to go, but that seems like it.    The owner is clearly passionate about what he's doing.  You should stop by, just not when you're in a hurry.
