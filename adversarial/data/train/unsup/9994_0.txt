I've lived in the Valley for a little over 27 dog years, and I've yet to find a better dog park than this. \n\nWhy is that?\n\nYou've got a giant swimming pond, a diving peer, obstacles, plenty of running room, and a whole lot of other dogs. \n\nMy pooch has been enjoying this spot nearly our whole time as residents in the state of Arizona, and when I say, \"Cosmo?\" he perks his ears up and immediately looks toward where his leash hangs on the wall. He knows what's up, and if you have a dog in the East Valley, so should you. \n\nWhile I'd love to give this place a 5-star rating, I just can't. That's not because of anything Cosmo does or doesn't do as a dog park specifically. Rather, it's because sometimes you'll run into dog owners who have no idea how or desire to learn how to maintain their dogs. It can be canine chaos at times due to the sheer number of pups, grizzled vets, and human children running amok. Occasionally you'll find someone who wants to sit on the sidelines and let their dogs run roughshod, leaving the yeoman's work of wrangling and corralling up to the other owners, without so much as even a hand from the actual owner or handler of the offending dogs. \n\nThat being said, this is a minor quibble, and the situation arises infrequently, while it's something you'd probably expect at any other dog park.  \n\nI have friends who live closer to downtown Phoenix where there are plenty of dog parks to enjoy, yet they still want to meet me out here in the suburb of Gilbert with their pooches to enjoy some Cosmo time.\n\nThat should tell you all you need to know.
