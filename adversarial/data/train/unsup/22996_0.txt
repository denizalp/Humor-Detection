Excellent, excellent food. Got salad, chicken parm, spaghetti carbonara, kalua cake and rum cake.  I'll warn you that the cakes look plain but also promise you the flavor is like the 4th of July in every bite.  Don't judge it before you try it!! OMG for everything...\n\nChef came to the table but it was nice, not weird. Easy to get to from the strip.  If you are visiting Vegas, forget the tourist stuff and get yourself something truly memorable.
