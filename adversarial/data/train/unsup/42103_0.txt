The taste of the food from my memory in the states (last time was 3 years go) was way better than this. \n\nWe had: \n- jambalaya pasta: has not much flavour other than a bit spicy \n- steak Diane: only dish that slightly above mediocre\n- carb cake bites: pretty mediocre \n- strawberry cheese cake: we asked for the least sweet option and it's still way too sweet in my opinion. I felt like I was eating sugar \n\nOverall the portions are big but the taste is the food is well below mediocre. And the price is not very cheap either. I think there are a lot other better options. \n\nThe wait was long (we asked for a table for 2 at 5pm on Saturday, and got the table at 7:30). But it does not impact the review because it's in a mall and there are lots to do during the wait time.
