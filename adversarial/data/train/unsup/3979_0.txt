Wow today my wife called financial aide to see what was going on. In their conversation they told my wife she would have a much easier time wi ty h financial aide if she would divorce me because if income. How shitty is that. We do not even file taxes together so my income should not count towards her schooling. It just pisses me off that they would suggest divorce so her financial aide is better.
