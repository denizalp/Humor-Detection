I've been to Agave several times, but my visit on August 17th will certainly be my last.  We sat outside and waited a ridiculously long time to be served water, menus - anything really.  We went in and asked the staff to send a server outside - still no show.  The lighting outside wasn't switched on, so the food was served in the dark - zero ambiance.  \n\nI asked for the Manager who made no attempt whatsoever to make things right.  He just made excuses.  No thanks - I'll take my $$ elsewhere.  There are plenty of other great restaurants in the area.
