Went back for the first time since my last experience and the changes were noticeable from the second I sat down. A new friendly bartender was ready to take my order even though the bar had a good amount of people in it. Service was great and the food was quality. Simple, easy, awesome! Thanks Wahoo's, I look forward to the same great experience next time!!\n\n3stars for now..
