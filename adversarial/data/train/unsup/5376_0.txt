Listen people I know you've heard of Lulu Lemon and I know if you don't wear the clothes the line is probably as nauseating to you as the Juicy, velour tracksuit.  But unlike the said Juicy product which is capable of making any ass that isn't Mary Kate Olsen's in the height of anorexia look like a bowl of 2% cottage cheese, Lulu Lemon pants are flattering, remarkably, durable, comfortable, functional and bloody hot!\n\nIf you are a woman and into any form of exercise, Lulu Lemon is the place to acquire sportswear, if you are a guy however, the clothes haven't quite made the leap into the metrosexual category yet, so beware.
