Went here tonight for the first time since we were craving burgers! Found it by all the high yelp reviews and seemed like a newer place to try. \n\nFirst impression. The atmosphere was great and super modern. I love all the rustic decor and was big with tons of tables and nice patio. Customer service was also great and everyone was very friendly. Food came up pretty quick and was hot. We took it to go. \n\nThe food would of definitely been better eaten there and super fresh but it was still good eaten at home about 15min later. I got a BBQ cheddar bacon burger and it was very good. Good size and tasted great. The bun was a little soggy and hard around the edge but that could of just been from taking it home. We also got the garlic and cheese fries that has shredded Parmesan cheese on top and they were amazing!!\n\nI would recommend this place to others but to eat it there while it is fresh. Food is decent price for quality food but could get pricey depending on the topping you add. It was about $20 for my fianc√© and I to get 2 burgers, a fry and a drink to split.\nThank you (:
