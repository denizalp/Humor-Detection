Sam Fox is normally renowned for such great restaurants.  That's why this one was such a surprise.  We made reservations for a party of seven and asked for a specific table.  When we arrived, the table we asked for was not available.  I've been in the restaurant business for many years now and I understand that restaurants cannot always guarantee specific tables.  That's fine.  However, they crammed us like sardines into a booth.  The place is incredibly noisy so, even though we were incredibly close, we couldn't really hear each other.\nNow, I like to study and peruse the menu, so, as a courtesy to my fellow diners, I do it ahead of time on the restaurant's website.  We were eating at 1pm on a Saturday so, stupidly, I decided to check out the lunch menu.  When we arrived, we were only allowed to order off the breakfast menu.  At one o'clock.  On a Saturday!  Now, every restaurant I've worked at, from low end to high end has been able to accommodate any menu request at any time.  It's just basic customer service.\nSo, disgusted, we began to peruse the breakfast menu.  About 25 minutes into our meal, we FINALLY received glasses of water on the table.  And little did we know that we should have cherished the water as it was the last we'd see.\nThe food was decent - not great but not bad.  However, the whole meal was horribly marred by the substandard customer service.  There are so many great restaurants in this area that I find no reason to ever return to this one.
