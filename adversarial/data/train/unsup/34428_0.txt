So, I was here for a business team dinner. There were 13 of us and it almost seemed like we were the only people in the restaurant on a Sunday at like 730pm. That seemed a bit weird to me. Okay, I may be exaggerating a bit about being the only table there but it definitely seemed empty.\n\nLarge bread roll that was the size of small watermelon - it was warm on the inside but not as crunchy on the outside as I like. Minus 1\/2 star. I didn't want to fill up since I was eating at a steakhouse so I didn't eat much of it. \n\nAppetizers ordered: bacon-wrapped scallops, seafood dish with lobster and crab pieces, and shrimp cocktail. Nothing too exceptional here. Minus 1\/2 star. The scallops were large and I did have another since it was sitting there with no one eye-balling it. \n\nDrinks: 1 magnum of red wine (can't remember the name but it was good), 2 bottles of cham-painnnnn. \n\nI ordered the double porterhouse with my colleague. It was cooked medium rare and it was good but not outstanding. It was large and in charge but I didn't taste any flavor that would make me crave it again. Minus 1 star.\n\nDesserts ordered at the table: souffle (no WOW factor), sundae (enough for 2-3 people to share), choc lava cake (i've seen larger). Minus 1\/4 star.\n\nI can't complain too much since it was free on the company but I wouldn't come back here on my own dime. I think I would give this a 2.75 so rounding up would be a 3.
