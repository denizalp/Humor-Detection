Good God, this place is horrible. \n\nI visited this \"establishment\" (and I use that term loosely) last night for a friend's birthday. The desperation in the air was so thick that it choked out the oxygen. If you want to see a bunch of insecure, badly dressed college girls with no rhythm shaking their asses, this is the place for you. \n\nMaybe I am unfairly biased, having had bad experiences at the Flagstaff location, but I really tried to go into this one with an open mind. Our server acted like we were inconveniencing her and I don't think she smiled once the whole night. $4.50 for a Tecate and a $9 martini (well vodka, people! Not even the good stuff!) later, I left there rather annoyed, but at least I could breathe again.\n\nBottom line- skip San Felipes. It isn't worth your time or money.
