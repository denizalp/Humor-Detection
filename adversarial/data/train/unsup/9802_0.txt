$45 for a shellac manicure?!? Everywhere else in town is $30-$35, what a rip off. Plus, the uv dryer was covered in filth on the inside, not sanitary at all. I used to love Polished, and I guess it would be fine if you're doing the basic mani\/pedi, but don't come here for the shellac\/gellish\/axxium manicure. I won't be back.\n\nUpdate: The owner sent me a nasty email right after I posted this, saying my bad experience must be bad karma (?? for always tipping a lot ??), and that saying his filthy uv dryer was filthy (sorry, it was actually sticky, gross) was unethical.  Add poor customer service as another reason not to come back here.
