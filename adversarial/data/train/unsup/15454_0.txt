Abstract: Worst service within a twenty kilometer radius. Quite possibly the worst service -- dollar for dollar -- in the whole fucking town! \n\nAs a rule I start disliking chains before I even step foot in them. Just a rule I maintain; maybe I am a hipster. \n\nAnyway, I have always felt that CJ sucked (probably because they do). And this particular location takes the cake. \n\nBe prepared for the slowest, most uninspired\/lackadaisical 'service' known to humankind. This is almost so bad that one starts imagining that it is a hidden camera-'reality tv' show that one is an unknown party to. I am waiting to sign a fucking waiver at the end of my meal over here.\n\nOne starts to ask oneself: \"Is this going to be on TruTV or something? Hidden Camera-Secret Diner-Bad Bar-Restaurant Rescue-Storage crossover?\" \n\nI mean: for fucks sake. Get your shit together!\n\nWe have all been to hole-in-the-walls where you know you ain't getting crumbs brushed off the fucking table service. But this place ... this Claim Jumper is worse than any hole-in-the-wall I have ever been to. And I have been to Mejico (real Mejico, not Cancun or whatever the fuck). I said Mejico!\n\nFood sucks; service sucks; and I feel I am surrounded by so-called Yuppies on every occasion I go there. (Could be more of a Town Square problem.)\n\nMaybe I am a hipster.
