This place is the BEST! I've seen a lot of Lush stores back in California but have never walked into one until after I moved to Cleveland. I was browsing for some new skincare products, and Cici answered a ton of my questions and recommended products suitable for me. When she saw that I was interested in the tea tree toner, she offered me 10-day free samples of lotions and face wash that pair nicely with the toner! Cici and the rest of the Lush crew are super helpful and friendly! I definitely recommend checking them out if you're looking for some new skincare products!!
