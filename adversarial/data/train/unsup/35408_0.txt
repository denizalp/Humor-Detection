Only 3 stars for this, my first visit. I called 10 days ago on a Sunday to see if they could reassemble my bike. It was disassembled for a flight. They get points for being open and taking it. They told me that there were 3 or so jobs ahead of me and that it wouldn't be ready until at least Wed or Thurs. No problem. Thursday goes by, then Friday. No call. I went out of town and got home the next day, Saturday. No call. I called them on Sunday and asked if it was done. They placed me on hold for what seemed like a long while. The gentleman told me that my bike was on the rack at that point. This seemed hopeful, so I told him that I would wait for the call when it was ready. I got the call TODAY. Wednesday. 10. Days. Later. Not an issue if you are backed up. Just pick up the phone and leave me a message that it will take longer. I didn't get the call. I had to call. Then I had to wait another 3 1\/2 business days for my bike that was supposedly on the rack when I called. It doesn't take more than a couple of hours to reassemble, tune up and reinflate two tires. \n\nI may try them again when I need someone. I understand that things get busy. Good for them. But please. Inform your customers. Good communication can carry you a long way. Especially since this was my first impression.
