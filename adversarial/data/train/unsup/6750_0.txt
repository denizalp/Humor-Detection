As I followed the hostess to the dining room, all while admiring the interior of yet another great steakhouse, my evening was shattered by a piercing cry.  \"What that a...baby?\" I asked in disbelief.  To my utter dismay, she replied sheepishly: \"Yes.\"\n\nAnd all of a sudden,I felt like...Samantha from Sex & the City.\n\nSo began my solo dining experience at Jacobs.  And it got worse.  As I sat down, I realized that sitting directly across from me was this table of Chinese tourists - LOUD and obnoxious and so utterly annoying that I hated myself for forgetting my earphones at the hotel.  For a few minutes, I couldn't decide which was worse - the crying baby, or the loud conversation taking place across from me.  \n\nAnd after suppressing the thought of getting up and fleeing the scene, I ordered a shot of Scotch, neat, to numb myself from the utter chaos all around.  It couldn't work quickly enough!\n\nAll in all, Jacobs is getting 3 stars because the food was good but not spectacular, and here's why:\n\n- They need a better selection of reds by the glass.  What they do have now taste way too young and don't pair with steaks all that well, ironically.\n\n- They could also add a few better appetizers.  Not enough greens, and the portion size is huge...so it prevents you from getting a variety.\n\nThe wait staff was very professional and attentive.  But then again, at this price point, I wouldn't expect anything less.\n\nOverall, the food and the service were alright, not exceptional, for the prices they command.  My disappointment was that at these prices (Macallan 25 for $150 and Macallan 30 for $200, plus a 6 oz tenderloin cut of wagyu at $87), I'd expect an old-school, QUIET, classy setting.  They had none of that.  My experience was marred by noise.  Perhaps they should consider banning babies from the premise.  And parents - c'mon, if you can afford a fancy steak dinner, you can afford a sitter for a few hours.
