Tacos are $2.29, but has the amount of filling in your average dollar street taco. The lengua in the taco was quite good, but not worth the price.\n\nI asked the cashier if I should order a carnitas or al pastor torta, the cashier recommended carne asada. So I mistakenly went with the carne asada, the flavor was okay but was really dry. Dry carne asada takes a whole star away, there is no excuse. \n\nWe grabbed a kids meal as well with a chicken quesadilla. The quesadilla was pretty good, the fries are below average.\n\nMy son and girlfriend tried the churros and they seemed to be good\n\nThis place is your average taco stand, but jerky like asada is why they get 2 stars. Also the drive thru took more time then it should to get the food out, but they are new and I will give them the benefit of the doubt. I will probably try Fun Tacos again to try the carnitas and al pastor, that way I feel my review would be more complete.
