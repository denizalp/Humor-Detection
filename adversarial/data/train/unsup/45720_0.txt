I feel a bit bad about this 3 stars thing, because it's a really nice place, it's cozy, the service was nice and welcoming, it's super clean, and the menu looks good.\n\nBUT the beers, well, as the 3stars review says, were ok. Just ok. \nSo I haven't tried all of them, but I'll be back and maybe the other ones will get another star to the place, because I actually want to like it. \n\nI went there at 5, they were opening, so it was quiet and a good place to relax with a good beer, no idea how it gets at night and during the weekends.
