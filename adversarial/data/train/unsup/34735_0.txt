I recently had Dodge Electric install a brand new wire conduit to power my pool pump.  Preston (owner) actually came out himself to survey the job and provide info for the quote which was provided by his friendly office staff.  The quote was fair and the job was promptly scheduled.  Rodger and Francisco came out on time for the job.  First they tested the existing conduit line to see if it could be reused to save me some money for the job.  It was determined that the old conduit could not be reused, but I'm glad Rodger and Francisco took the time to check for me.  They did a great job in putting the new conduit in, completing the job in the time they said they would.  Highly recommend Dodge Electric!
