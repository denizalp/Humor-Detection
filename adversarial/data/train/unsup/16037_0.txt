I don't put five stars down for anybody. \n\nHowever, the Rokerij is number one in my book. \n\nI love their apps!! I love it when you can find a place and you KNOW you love their food. Some have boring, conservative menus, like....well, I shouldn't say, but there's one on the SE corner of Camelback and 32nd. \n\nBut the Rokerij has blue crab mini tostadas that surprise your mouth with their freshness, cold lettuce (it hasn't wilted on the way downstairs to the basement from the kitchen) and it's a snack, not a meal. So, you can taste four appetizers and enjoy tasting your favorites or finding new ones and not spend lots of money just getting full on one thing.\n\nThey say the Rokerij basement is a cell-free zone. That's because as you descend each slate\/rock step downwards, right off the wood front deck, the signal mostly won't go through! So, you can get in your uninterrupted girl talk or romantic moments with someone you want to be one-on-one with. I love the wood beams, the hammered copper bar, the leather furniture, the stone walls and the intimate fireplace. It's dark. And it feels good.\n\nI usually get those blue crab tostadas, shrimp and bacon wrapped scallops and the ceviche. But then, wouldn't you know, someone told me about a new favorite, steak tacos! Huh? I don't eat beef. Sort of. Bye bye ceviche!\n\nAnd the insider's secret that I will hate you for if you take my place at the bar (the offer is good at both the upstairs and downstairs bars...I just called to make sure the details were right), is that if you are sitting at the bar and order certain apps BEFORE THEIR clock strikes 6 pm, (4-5:59 pm on THEIR clock, very important), \n\nTHEY ARE $5 EACH! \n\nSome don't get discounted. But my favs do! \n\nTell them Roseann sent ya. They just learned I can have fun. I've been goin since they opened. I guess I just don't drink enough alcohol for them to see the fun side. Oh well. What can I say? Hangovers just don't cut it anymore. Although, the more car bombs you have, the more you can forget that. I learned. Again. Two weeks ago.
