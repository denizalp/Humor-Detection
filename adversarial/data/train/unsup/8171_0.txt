I've lived in Phoenix for almost a year now. I moved here from LA and became addicted to King Taco. For those of you who aren't familiar with LA and King Taco, it has THE BEST tacos and THE BEST salsas (omg so spicy!) and THE BEST horchata. I was so obsessed with this place that my coworkers eventually started calling me the Queen Taco. I used to come here frequently when I first moved into the area.\n\nTaco Mich isn't nearly as good but it's still pretty freaking good. I don't have much of an opinion on their salsas because they're OK but their carne asada tacos are fantastic! Especially on Taco Wednesdays when they're only $0.75. Seriously can't be beat.\n\nIf you're looking for some affordable, delicious tacos in DTPHX, I recommend checking this place out.\n\nThere's parking in the back, but the lot is a little small.
