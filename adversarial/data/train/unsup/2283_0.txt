We went with a group of 8 people.  We ordered many different dishes to try.  Not one of us had anything good to say about any of the food.  One of the noodle dishes was absolutely tasteless.  We go to a lot of nice restaurants with this group and this is the first time we unanimously disliked everything we ate.  If by some miracle I end up back at Mr. Chow, there isn't an item I would consider eating again.  Service was ok.  Design was really nice but no Asian influence.
