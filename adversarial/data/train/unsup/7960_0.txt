DON'T BOTHER ~ YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND IT ANYWAY WITH THEIR SIGN REVERSED AND UNREADABLE!   \nI don't who wrote these other reviews, but I think they were written by insiders or employees. \nWent on a Friday night at 7:30 & there was hardly anyone there...  A table of 4 & a table of 6 were quickly seated after we got there. \nThe decor is nice but has a strange room at the far end of the restaurant that is a half glass wall with a bunch of TV's & seating. \nAfter a while it occurred to me as to why this room looked so strange... It was just like what you'd see in an upscale hotel, especially for a wedding party, banquet, meeting administrators, etc...  \nThat's when everything else made sense...  such as:  getting the menu. \nIt was printed on a cheap piece of paper & the menu items were very limited but PRICEY!! \nSalads were $13 not including $6 for chicken (if you want it added). \nSandwiches were all starting at $13 and the entrees were starting at $18. \nAll the meals come by itself & the \"sides\" are all extra, starting at $8.00! \nAfter we sat there for 10 min. finally this guy cautiously approached us & stood about 10 feet from our table & after an awkward pause he asked us if we were being helped?  \nReally weird! \nWe asked what draft beer he recommended... ALL OF THEM, he says... again, really strange.  \nWe ordered the kale citrus salad ($8.00) & enchiladas ($20) w\/ an extra plate as we were going to share. \nAgain, we asked the waiter what dish was most popular & he responds with  EVERYTHING is GOOD!! ... okay you're really helpful. \nAfter about 20 more minutes we flagged down the waiter & asked if our salad was coming out anytime soon? He said (I kid you not), I was going to bring it out with the entree!! \nThankfully our salad came out but then the \"shock\" set in. The waiter brought out a huge plate with this 4 inch diameter bowl w\/ about 3 oz of salad in this tiny bowl. \nI was so shocked I immediately asked him if this was our salad? he replies, Oh Yes!   \nI then asked him if this was the $8.00 salad and he just stares at me... (another awkward pause)... then he asks me if I want to talk to the manager?  \nI just gave up & said no. Obviously this was not a mistake and there was no reason for me to go on and complain about it ... \nWe each picked up our fork and ate (maybe) 3 small bites each of salad & it was gone. \nJust then the enchiladas were brought out on another large platter\/plate. \nAgain shock set in. \nThey were the smallest enchiladas I've ever seen and there were 3 of them on this huge plate. \nThe tortilla shells were a little bigger than a street taco size but not quite big enough for a larger taco traditionally found in mexican restaurants. \nThey were extremely hard & very difficult to cut through with a knife. My initial bite was lukewarm with the shell being extremely hard & the inside meat being almost cold. \nIt was supposed to be tri-tip but it was not!! (we know steak meat) ... plus there was hardly any meat in the enchilada. \nThere was sauce on top which was absolutely disgusting. \nIt was obvious this was some kind of wine sauce but the wine had not been reduced correctly so the sauce was absolutely bitter & inedible. \nMy husband & I were so shocked by the total experience that we weren't paying attention to what was going on around us. \nThe table of 6 had just left after a bit of a commotion. My husband observed that the man at the head of the table asked to speak to the manager & then the whole table got up & left, leaving 6 meals almost untouched. \nWe don't know if they paid or had a family emergency or what, but it seemed very strange. \nRight about then, I happened to notice the 4 people sitting near us & all of their food that had come out at the same time as our enchiladas were all in doggy bags! \nNow they were leaving. \nAfter our experience with the ridiculously small portions and poor taste, I would venture to say we weren't the only ones EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in this pretty expensive meal.\nNow everything made sense... the owners must be ex-hotel restaurant owners where you have captured customers that will pay a high price for under-sized portions. \nNeedless to say I will NOT be back nor will I be recommending this place to anyone.
