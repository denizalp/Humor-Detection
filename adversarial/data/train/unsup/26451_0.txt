I sampled their Earl Grey and Thai Tea soft serves and was blown away.  \n\nThe Earl Grey soft serve starts out with a soft ice-milk taste, then melts on your tongue into a very subtle (but distinct) earl grey flavour.  \n\nThe Thai Tea was like a very mild chocolate, but the more I tasted it the more the tea flavour started to come through.  It's fairly similar to milk tea but better, I think!  Now I've got to try Thai tea!  \n\nBoth ice creams were light on the tongue, not overly sweet.  The flavouring is perfect, it's just enough to make you really taste the tea but not overwhelm you and make you sick of it.\n\nMy friend ordered the Bangkok Brownie (Thai Tea soft serve layered with soft, gooshy brownie pieces and topped with two chocolate stick things).  The serving size was pretty big, which almost-but-not-quite made up for the $7+ price.  We thought it would benefit from some crunchy oreo bits, like in ice cream cakes.
