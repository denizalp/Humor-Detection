This place is quite a drive away from the strip but I was so determined to try it out! Yes, the cute penguin logo is what really lured me in;)\n\nThis place serves thrifty ice cream so don't expect any special house-made ice cream. The Captain Crunch flavor is probably my favorite flavor. They have simple toppings like sprinkles, gummy bears, oh and SPRINKLE DONUTS CEREAL!\n\nThey also sell shaved snow (aka snow fluff) with many flavors ranging from honey dew to vegan lychee with a few options for toppings such as mochi balls and popping pearls. \n\nLastly, the donut ice cream sandwich is like heaven melting in your mouth. You can chose one of the thrifty flavored ice creams and add toppings of your choice. The warm donut is what makes it so delicious! \n\nHowever, there wasn't really anything special about this place...at least there wasn't anything that will get me to drive that far again.
