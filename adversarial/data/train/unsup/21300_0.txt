Service: the girls who helped me were well put together, helpful and efficient\nAesthetics: the cakes and confectionary look really good and appetizing\nPrices: too high, the quantity and quality do not justify it but they think they can get away with it because of the attractive cakes and sweets\nTaste: very disappointing. Everything looks so yummy and inviting but when you put it in your mouth... NOTHING\nParking\/plaza: no place to park, a small plaza with no parking is annoying especially when the jewish dry cleaner next door has all the reserved spots with NO CARS and NO CUSTOMERS
