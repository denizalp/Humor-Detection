Hey, Red Lobster Marketing Staff:  I've got an idea.\n\nI'd like to propose trying a popular---okay, maybe trendy, but a proven successful concept---that will likely increase your sales ten-fold, maybe more.  Wait...wait !   Don't be so smug and prideful.  You \"sea food differently\", right?  So see diners differently, too.  Step out of the confines of that corporate take-out box for ideas---you're not the only ones with them.  Before scrolling to the next review, read me out.  Thanks.  You can start by testing just a few cities, say, like---Chi Town, the Big Easy, the Big Apple, San Francisco, and---of course---last but not least---Cleveland.   The city I'd like to call the Big Friendly---a city and its burbs, who have a number of restaurants serving up maybe some of the greatest food in the nation.  Heck, just use US.  With our mostly discriminating palates, you'll quickly learn if this idea is a go.  Still with me, execs?   Ready for minimal investment, with maximium return?\n   \n                               FOOD TRUCKS\n\nNo!  Wait!  Hold on!---don't stop reading!  Before thinking crazy thoughts about tooling up and down city streets with splashing tanks of sloshing, water-immersed live lobsters, hear me out.  It's simple.  Offer just one item.\n\n    Those scrumptious 5 Star CHEDDAR BISCUITS\n\nYUM--EEE.  Winners, Winners, forget serving dinners.\n\n~ ~ ~ \n\nOkay...back to reality.  Too extreme.  Likelihood of it happening?  Zero.  When we want those golden pods of goodness (they DO look like little spiny oysters, aptly fitting for a seafood restie), crispy on the outside, slightly oily-salty, moist & cheesy on the inside---we'll just have to drive to one of their establishments to pick up these legendary treasures for take-out.  Done.\n\nUntil maybe10 years ago, this was our place for CAESAR SALADS, CHEDDAR BISCUITS, and LOBSTER.  And I couldn't visit without re-acquainting myself each time with their irresistible Golden Cadillac.  (An old-fashioned ice-creamy alcoholic libation\/dessert combo that was a bit risky to drink while perched on a bar stool rather than sitting safely in a booth.)   Those were the days.  Don't know what happened.  After a visit about 5 years ago---then again, yesterday---Red Lobster is just not the same anymore.  Not even remotely close---EXCEPT for the fresh, cool, seasoned-and-dressed-just-right Caesar Salad, and those beckoning, can't-eat-just-one, biscuits.  (Tried the cole slaw for the first time.  Actually, pretty decent.)  Didn't order a drink this visit---wanted to focus solely on the food.\n\nOther than those three menu items---and our friendly, likeable, efficient, well-tipped server, Pam---nothing was particularly good.  From an okay 3 stars---\"Lobster-Topped Maine Lobster\"---served with mediocre, not creamy-rich, but chicken-brothy-tasting mashed potatoes and no-flavor-at-all green beans (never had absolutely tasteless veggies until these), w\/cole slaw for 25.99, to a 1\/2 Star\n---\"Create your own\"---Lightly Breaded Clam Strips and Crunch-Fried Fish, w\/fries & salad for 10.29.  Nearly flavorless clams had reached the firm, snappy, industrial-strength rubber-band stage, and the two pieces of disguised-with-thick-breading, bland and almost no-taste fish were insulting.  Minus coating, only 1\/4\" thick !---yes, I measured the one I took home for poochy... even McD's is 10X tastier and heftier.  In fish total, probably smaller than a deck of cards.  Copious breading on the fish?---possibly close to two decks.   \n\nWith almost everything being so...uhh...blah and skimpy, how does one approach a manager?  And who wants MORE of something not that good?  Instinctively, too, I knew that whatever would be replaced would be exactly the same.  It's not like anything was especially bad-tasting, or spoiled, or that necessary ingredients had been forgotten.  Based on our disappointing visit 5 years ago---and now this one---I believe the seafood results are what's being typically served.  Customers must like it, though.  Every time I happen to drive by, their parking lot is full or close to it.   Jumping ship and heading to another restaurant \n...aulgh... was not on my agenda.  After nearly 4 hours of yardwork and gardening, then a refreshing zesty lemon-scented shower, I arrived hungry and ready to relax.  I didn't feel like moving anything but my arms, hands, and mouth, so I resolutely relished every single bite of my salad and biscuits, but ate very little else.   \n\nExcluding tip and a glass of 8.99 Chardonnay, the total for two luncheon meals was about $36.  When I think of what I could have purchased raw for even $25 at 7 Seas Seafood---okay, not that much...maybe a small bag's worth---I can't help feeling a bit miffed.          \n\n~ \n\nIf we ever return it would be only for the 5 Star Caesar Salad and their 5 Star Cheddar Biscuits.  We've taken our last SEAFOOD cruise on the S.S. Red Lobster---it was neither a Bon Voyage nor a Bon Value.    \n.
