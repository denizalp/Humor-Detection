Really great place.  I think they opened recently and are still getting their sea legs, but I see success.  The prices seem high, but the food is worth it.  There is SKILL in the menu.  The service is friendly and genuine.   The only thing I would encourage is 1 or 2 things for kids....but I'll be back.  Several times.  Probably tomorrow.
