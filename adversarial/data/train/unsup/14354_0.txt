Decided to have dinner here the cafe is very welcoming with large chairs to lounge in and enjoy a wonderful meal. I was seated across and was able to look out there large windows and opening to the restaurant and watch people. It is very quiet here and peaceful, I was glad for this since I need to rest and get up to date on some things. I was able to do it here in there wonderful surroundings. \n\nI ordered the Spinach and Greens Salad with Tomato Bisque soup. It was a great pairing. The spinach in the salad was fresh and had an abundant amount of feta and fresh strawberries. As I ate the spinach and the strawberry together the cheese made it so flavorful. It could be close to a dessert or maybe in France. The tomato bisque soup was also good it had great consistency unlike most tomato soups that I have ordered, it was not at all watered down either. For dessert since diner was so good I decided to try the carrot cake and I'm glad I did. Again the flavors that they include in the baking are very good and fresh. If you need a place to caught a great hot meal or a light one try here with such beautiful surroundings too!
