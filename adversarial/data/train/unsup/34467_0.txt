I went in there being referred by a friend who went there and was pleasantly surprised I had a delight full hairdresser named Nina who did a wonderful job on my hair she cut it exactly the way I wanted it and fixed it real nice and I will definitely be going back and spreading the word, The ladies in there have a good sense of humor and are really fun ladies I enjoyed the experience.  I would recommend this salon to anyone who wants a good haircut and the price is very reasonable.
