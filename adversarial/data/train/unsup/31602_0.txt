A Brazilian-Peruvian-Japanese fusion restaurant that made me think that the whole \"fusion\" thing had gotten out of hand. But it was a great meal. The vibe is a little loud, but this is Vegas, so in context, it's not a serious issue. Our waiter seems like a really nice guy but a little slow. It was pretty full.\n\nThe wagyu beef was served with mushrooms and a ponzu sauce that was a tad strong. We had the more traditional of the ceviches on the menu and it was truly extraordinary. Sashimi was awesome and the dragon roll was good too. Dessert was the banana chocolate cake which is one step removed from heaven. \n\nOverall commendable, even at the steep LV strip price.
