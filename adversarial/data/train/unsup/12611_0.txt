I do love to rip Sam Fox places, because I think his approach to restauranting is \"MAKE DA MONEY, WHO CARES BOUT DA FOOD!\"...usually. But I have to say, Zinburger at the Biltmore is deserving of its 4-star Yelp rating; which is to say it's a pretty solid place for a quick bite or maybe even a good meal. Been here a few times and the first visit was less-than-stellar, with an unprofessional waitress, cold fries and in-general blah feeling about my time and $40 for two lunch.\n\nHowever, as of late, it seems the Zin is looking to Win. Had a very nice dinner with a friend here recently and the service was pretty good, the water-refill-girls were on-point, and the food was actually good.......and tasted fresh. Had a salad and I kid you not, the ingredients had the texture and taste of farmer's market quality.\n\nHad their burgers in the past, and pretty decent. On-par with Delux down the street I would say. Fries...meh, not Zinburger's strong suit. But DAMN, hoss, it's an S Fox joint so you KNOW the wine\/liquor list be KICKIN! Booze. It's how this chain makes its $$$.\n\nIf you've been to the Biltmore you know parking is a breeze. The grounds are clean, and the location is central. It's almost comical how bad restaurants can exist in such a class environment. But Blanco next store is gra-oss; and the \"Asian Fusion\" place that **used to be** in the Blanco space was hideous. Whatevs, anyway Ziburger is a solid corner lunch and dinner spot. Tables are adequately spaced apart and the noise level, while healthy, is not obnoxious...impressive considering there is a sizable bar in the center of the space.\n\nZinburger. Pretty OK. For a Fox spot, that's a victory.
