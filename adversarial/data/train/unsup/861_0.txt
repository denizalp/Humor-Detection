I was hoping for a gourmet buffet experience. I decided I wouldn't look at every rating and read reviews of everything prior to my trip to Vegas recently. Unfortunately the overall rating here is right on. \n\nHave you ever been to Golden Corral buffet? Well, GC is better than this buffet. BY FAR. Not only was the price for what you get, totally shit, it lacked amounts of offerings. Three dinky rows during dinner? Not worth it. They offer the buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We tried it for dinner on the first night and said nope, not coming here again. The prices on their website also are incorrect. It is $33 for the dinner buffet, and extra for any drink at all. I assume they fluctuate their pricing based on busy times.\n\nThe best part was the dessert offerings. Save your $$ for gambling and just eat elsewhere.
