For my dirty 30, we decided to have a mini staycation here and the one word that describes this place is SEXY! \n\nPros:\n1. Very modern decor.\n2. Dim lighting throughout the whole suite. \n3. The opaque glass that separates the bathroom from the rest of the room. \n4. Full kitchen and living room.\n5. Awesome view of Las Vegas.\n6. Comfortable bed and soft sheets. \n7. Friendly front desk and housekeeping employees. \n8. Cheap rates on the weekdays. \n9. There are 3 TVs in the suite.\n10. Cafe 6 is located on level 6 if you get hungry. \n11. Very thick walls :) \n\nCons: \n1. If you're a local, there's a $250\/night no party fee that gets charged to your card and gets reimbursed at checkout.\n2. Don't forget about the $32 per night resort fee.\n3. It would be awkward staying here with your family due to the sexy bathroom layout. \n4. Parking can be a pain. \n\nWould we stay here again? Yes!
