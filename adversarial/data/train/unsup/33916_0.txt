Our family LOVES Noble Beast!  We've been shopping here for a couple of years and look forward to every trip.  This is a great neighborhood local spot with unbeatable service... the staff is ALWAYS very friendly and they only seem to sell products they would use for their own pets.  This store has a great family feel and you can feel confident they only carry great products for your fur babies.  I love this store and will continue to shop here for years to come!
