What started off as a boutique specializing in 20th-century Modern furniture and collectibles, quickly morphed into a boutique\/café that still specializes in 20th-century Modern furniture and collectibles.  And while Brooklyn's taste in furnishings is often impeccable, and the selection rotates rapidly, it's their intriguing and often tantalizing selection of breakfasts, lunches, and snacks that have made them a local hangout--all the more so since they added a lovely and secluded terrasse out back.  Don't judge the boutique\/café by its name (I can hear you sneering through my screen, you self-proclaimed hipster-hunter you)--the name is actually a reference to the owner's longstanding sobriquet.  Instead, judge it on its friendly ambiance, its creative sandwiches (smoked trout and labneh with herbs, cukes, and greens, anyone?), and its definitive coffee cake, which is baked by the owner's auntie each and every day (!).
