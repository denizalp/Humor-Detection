Bertha's Cafe is full of tasty treats at very reasonable prices.  The Cafe has an airy, welcoming vibe to it that makes you feel that you are among friends, even when you are there just grabbing a quick sandwich between appointments (like I was).   My favorites at Bertha's are the Asparagus & Havarti Panini, the Curried Chicken Salad Salad, and the coconut bars.\n\nI also like that Bertha's roasts their meats in house and that they try to use local ingredients and vendors whenever possible.
