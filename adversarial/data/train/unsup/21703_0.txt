I'm not sure why there are such negative reviews for this hotel as it certainly was not my experience. Maybe because my floor had been newly renovated, I avoided some of the difficulties others complained about. The hotel is located 4 to 5 blocks from the heart of downtown and perfectly situated within 2 blocks of the Orange or Green Metro line making metro travel quite easy. In door parking for the hotel is conveniently located right off the main lobby and for 48hrs was only $40.56, a real bargain when compared to NYC, Boston or other major cities in the USA. Check-in was a breeze, the front desk personnel are fluent in English, Spanish and French and I found them to be very cordial and helpful. The room was clean, large with a very nice new flat screen tv, the bathroom was also very tidy. The one issue in the bathroom is when the one piece plastic shower area was replaced the tub could have used better support underneath as there was some flex in the tub bottom not a big problem. All in all the Espresso Hotel is very reasonable at $106\/night incl all taxes and beautifully situated for those folks who are visiting Montreal for the first time.
