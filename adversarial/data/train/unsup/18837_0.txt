Yes, I was a very big Britney Spears fan. Back from 97 with the baby one more time album to her femme fatalle. I love her music, specially the glee versions of her songs.\n\nShe was definitely a great performer back in her days. When you watched britney on stage, you didn't come for her to sing, but you came to see her perform and dance. This show is not about her range of tones. This is to watch her performance and dance and be entertained.\n\nThe show was just OK just to be fair. She seemed a bit disconnected from her audience. I felt the sense of her just pretty much going through the motions. I get it, concerts are different from Vegas shows, but I would just like a little more effort please. It was like watching a bad cheer dance exhibition. Britney please stop trying to stay young. Reinvent yourself and just be.\n\nTo be fair, the songs I still hold dear to my heart, and that I why we came to see her. I had fun singing along to her songs and that gives her show a fair three stars.\n\nThank you for reading my review.
