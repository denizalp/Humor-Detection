This is a great place to find plumbing knowledge\/experience and to source specialty parts for your project. This is not the spot to get basic plumbing hardware found at big box retailers. Although the knowledge was abundant, the stock wasn't, and I left relatively empty handed. Based on looking at their showroom, their focus has shifted from retailing plumbing supplies to the public and repair, to providing plumbing repair services, almost exclusively. If their plumbers are anything like, Steve in the showroom, they will be a knowledge powerhouse!
