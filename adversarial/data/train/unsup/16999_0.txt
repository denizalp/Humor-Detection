We were disappointed in TC's. I had bought a Groupon for a To Go order, we were finished running errands and decided to use the Groupon and check out this place.\nSo we can say customer service was great but the food was below average. We got a 2 meat combo to share with Baby Back Ribs and 1\/4 Dark Meat Chicken with sides of Mac and Cheese, Potato Salad, and Corn Bread. I had them throw in a slice of Coconut Cake, all of their deserts were sitting there staring at me, I couldn't resist.\nPortion size was fine but I could've made better food on our backyard grill and stove. BBQ sauce was on the vinegary side but had an almost bad meat taste to it. Chicken was just ok, nothing special, cooked to stay moist but flavor overall was lacking. Ribs were over charred and dry. Mac and cheese was mushy and bland, not enough cheese flavor. Corn bread was dry and tasteless. Potato salad was about the best thing we got and that's not saying much. The Coconut Cake tasted like it was cooked with suntan lotion, tasted artificial, I couldn't get past the first bite. \nSo in short, sadly, we won't be back.
