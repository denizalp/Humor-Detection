Honestly I don't expect much from fast food burger joints but this was great. My friend had the classic smash dressed up according to Rob the manager's recommendation. He devoured it within minutes - I had the buffalo blue cheese with smash tots and it was awesome. For sure will be back to check out the rest of the menu. Make sure you ask for Rob and ask him for what he recommends.
