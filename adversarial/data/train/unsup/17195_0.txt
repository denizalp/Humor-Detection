I've been here only once but my first impression of this place - I love it already. One of my top favorite breakfast places in town now. I've been wanting to try this place out for like six years and FINALLY just got to try it today. I wish I tried it sooner ! There was no wait when we came in this morning too.\n\nThey have an extensive menu and everything sounded so good for breakfast but I finally settled with their crunchy cinnamon french toast. They have the BEST french toast in town ! And I'm not just saying that because I came in starving lol. I really enjoyed their variation of french toast. It wasn't too sweet either. It's a must try. I also ordered my french toast w\/ egg whites and turkey sausage and my friend shared some of his hash browns. Loved every single part of my meal. One of their other highlights is their pot of bread. Presentation is cute , it comes in a small mug. It's like a cinnamon roll and you dip it into their cream cheese icing (or whatever the deliciousness is). It's also served w\/ butter on the side but it's that good on it's own so it doesn't need it. \n\nLove the theme they got going on too - they have twirling flower umbrellas on the ceiling and all the servers wore PJs. I would love to come back here again if it wasn't so far from my house. If they could open another location in Henderson that would be perfect :)
