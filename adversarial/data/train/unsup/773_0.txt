Wow, Jinya makes some tasty ramen! On the salty side though. My revisit was long overdue. If I want ramen I'm usually at Sora or Fukumimi depending on which part of town I am in. \n\nI remember the one with black garlic was good. I love that they have chicken ramen and vegetarian ramen. I recently tried the creamy, vegetarian ramen with egg and it was so bomb! \n\nThey also have a nice selection of appetizers and side dishes. The sweet potatoes were cool, but a bit too starchy for my taste. \n\nWhat sets Jinya apart from other ramen places is that they have happy hour and reverse happy hour! Would love to come back and try a bunch of apps and sides. \n\nService here has always been prompt and friendly!
