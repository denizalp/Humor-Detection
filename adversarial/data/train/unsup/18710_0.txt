I like Caesars a lot. The place is huge, and has tons to do. There are bars, lounges, and clubs galore. The Palace is pretty clean, except the sports betting area. We went and lounged around and caught some of the Texas game, there are people sleeping, or passed out drunk, papers everywhere, looks like someone went mad with the college sports betting and it ended up looking like a trade floor on Wall St. \n\nThey also have the Forum Shops, which are amazing! This place is its very own adult playground, if I stayed here I may never leave.\n\nWe were given free passes to Pure, but didn't even go because of the ridiculously long line, and ended up going elsewhere. Caesars is pretty damn rad, I would love to stay here some time.
