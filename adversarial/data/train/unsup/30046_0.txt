I seriously can't believe people have given this less than 5 stars. I'd give it 10 if I could! We asked a shop owner for a great mexican restaurant and he recommended this one, and we're so glad we did. The salsa was BY FAR the freshest I've ever had. You could smell the ripe tomatoes. The carafes didn't bother me - I thought it was a great idea, so you didn't have to worry about double dipping with friends; they provide you with a plate to scoop up your own serving. \n\nI had the steak Tacos Al Carbon - the meat was so tender and tasted like it had just come off a charcoal grill. The rice was the most flavorful I've ever tasted. My friends had a veggie enchilada which looked great, even though I'm not a vegetarian, and a combo platter which I was a little jealous of - looked like a perfect selection! I went back a second time before leaving Arizona, and got the green corn tamale, which was incredible!\n\nThe service was Superman fast! Usually you get bored with chips and salsa before they bring your entree but here, I had barely dug into the chips before I got my entree!\n\nI honestly can't think of a bad thing about this place!
