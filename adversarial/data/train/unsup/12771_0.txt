Came here at 11:20 am thinking this place would be empty since it was early before lunch time. Was I wrong!! Completely packed. Maybe because it was Friday. Customer ratio was 90% Chinese and 10% Non-Chinese customers. I saw a couple of groups had to share tables with strangers. This place is a gold mine! They should make seating area bigger or expand the store.\nCame here for Ma po tofu, but I had to also order toothpick lamb from reading all the reviews on here!! Thank god I did, because ma po tofu was not edible.\n\nToothpick Lamb... Delicious with strong cumin flavor!! Only a couple of pieces of fatty part. You have to order this when you are here! Tell them to go low on sodium (salt) if you have high blood pressure. It was tasty but very salty.\n\nMa po tofu... I think they made a mistake and dumped a pound of salt in my Ma po. Since it was overly packed, I didn't say anything but I couldn't eat it. It was way too salty. Also, they put too much Sichuan pepper (花椒). I love Sichuan peppers very much but this was too much...\n\nI'm definitely coming back but not on weekends... Next time, I'll tell them to make mine with less sodium.
