This place is massive with lots of selection. Service is hit or miss. Thankfully I usually know what I want. Little fumbling on a sub woofer install having to be rescheduled. Checkout lines are annoying, listening to 'next cashier is ready' over and over. I'm sure I'll be back but dread needing anything important or expensive.
