Highly reccomend! This boutique is a hidden gem off 215 and Sahara 1 mile off the strip. It's a low key hotel with valet only options. Valet is complementary, no fee at all (which is a refreshing stance to find in local hotels now after most have switched to pay valet). \n\nInside is a artistic spooky dim lit theme with a water feature in the lobby. In the lounge you have an in house small reteraunt and open air lounge with spacious seating and large bar.\n\nStaff is very pleasant and helpful, always accommodating to special requests or dietary restrictions (i.e.: vegan cocktails)\n\nThe hidden best part of the artisan bar is thw outdoor patio seating! Thru a hidden walk way you will find a quiet atmosphere with a lot of seating and booth options outside.
