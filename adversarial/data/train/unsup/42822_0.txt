We had a great experience with Nick Walker and his professional team! We are re modeling our house in uptown and have been dealing with many subcontractors who have made promises of deadlines that were never met. This is not the case with Walker Painting Specialist. They were on time, professional, and met our every  need. Nick showed up before our scheduled meeting time to put samples on the house so they were dried and ready for us. Even when we questioned the color Nick did not hesitate to get more samples on the house to ensure that we made the right choice! You can tell the pride in the quality of work they provide as they framed out a window for us to make sure it looked like a finished product! They even went above and beyond to come back and paint our shutters that were delayed in the mail! We love the finished product and all of our neighbors have commented how beautiful our home looks! We will use this company in the future and will be recommending Nick and his team to our friends and family!
