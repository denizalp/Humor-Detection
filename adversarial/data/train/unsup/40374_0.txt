Tip: Buy the yelp deal, you can get in for just $25 a person.  All you need to do is show up at the door 10 minutes before the show starts and show the doorman the coupon you have.  I don't think the seats ever really fill up, but do call ahead, because there may be days where he is not performing.  The theater is inside the Harrah's hotel.  \n\nA very laid back comedy magic show.  Totally worth it,  esp for just $25. \nSmaller venue compared to the cirque du soleil shows, but just as a good of an experience.
