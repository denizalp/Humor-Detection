Do you like beer? Yes! So Grant L brought us to NoDa Brewing for my first stop in Charlotte. This craft brewery's \"tasting room\" is actually a nice sized space with lots of tables and chairs. it has a casually hip vibe, laid back and very on trend.\n\nNoDa has probably about 8 regular and seasonal beers on tap. Order a flight of four if you aren't sure what you want. Cute names and descriptions are on a chalkboard. Since I'm not an IPA-lover, my flight included the Coco Loco (porter with organic coconut), Ramble on Red (American amber ale), Jam Session (pale ale) and Gordeous (seasonal pumpkin). I really liked them all, but Gordeous was my favorite with a good pumpkin and spice flavor! Too bad it's seasonal. \n\nThe Hop Drop 'n Roll probably would've been my fifth choice just to taste their west coast-style IPA at 7.2% ABV.\n\nThe bartenders are friendly and helpful. A food truck was parked outside. Definitely make this a stop if you're visiting Charlotte and like craft brews. It was pretty full on a Tuesday evening, so weekends are probably packed.
