When I was picking up lunch at Teppan Bento one day, I was surprised to discover that Island Pacific has made their way down to Silverado Ranch. With it comes their food service area known as PhilHouse.\n\nI've tried the PhilHouse at the Trop\/Durango location and this one seems to be a mirror image. The food was about the same quality, which is to say that it's good -- about as good as you'd expect from a \"turo turo\" (literally means point point). It will usually depend on how long the food has been sitting there.\n\nAt lunch today, I ordered a 1-item combo for $5.95 with tax. I appreciated the lady giving me way too much rice and pancit for being just one item. I had plenty left to take home. I chose bopis as my one dish because it had just come out and tasted as good as it looked.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy to have another lunch option somewhat close to work.
