This place is fantastic and I'm so happy they recently opened in Cleveland. I've been here a couple times so far and had a great time. They have an awesome and friendly staff! I like the extensive drink menu and enjoyed their shrubbery punch. They also make a mean Moscow mule!\n\nThey offer a lot of fun activities and the place is huge! I highly recommend the karaoke rooms. They are $35 an hour which is not bad at all especially if you split it with friends. Bowling and ping pong is really fun too. Can't say a bad thing about it. Check it out for yourself :)
