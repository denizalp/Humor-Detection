Stayed here on Feb 10\/11\/12 was over all good experience.\nWas judging horse show, so, hours a bit strange.  Desk staff very polite & helpful.  Due to injury, used small suite w\/disabled capacity  $10 more.  Very comfortable, good bed\/pillows\/amenities.  Clock radio wouldn't allow wake up.  Lots of TV channels.  Following afternoon, was shy coffee, shampoo, soap, etc., went to desk & resolved(housekeeping problem).\nBreakfast was OK on first day-not really different than most good hotels.  Second day, Biscuits & gravy good.  Lady taking care of breakfast room OUTSTANDING.  \nIf this hotel wants to host horse show folks, they might consider animals, and taking a security deposit.  As a judge, I do not bring animals.  In normal travel I do.\nWould certainly come here again.
