Nothing special. You see props from the movies. Very little interaction. If you're a die-hard Marvel fan, go see it. Its not too expensive, not crowded, and not terrible either.\n\nYou need to use your smartphone and download an app to answer questions and take pictures. Not happy that the app needs access to my contacts. Why is that a requirement?!?! \n\nIt's self-guided and very small. The battle w Ultron at the end was lame. If just I stood there, I would've beaten him. Then at the end, i found my phone's battery was half drained from having the app open the entire time. I have an iPhone 6Plus too.\n\nSee it if you LOVE Marvel or if you need to kill time w kids. I'm fairly sure you won't go for a 2nd visit tho.
