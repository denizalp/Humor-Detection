We came here per a recommendation from our friends who are locals. Great concept but we have had better in San Diego. \n\nBulgogi Tacos - The meat is very well marinated but other than that, the taco was stuffed with more veggies than meat. \n\nBulgogi Chicken Tacos - This was just okay. There were pieces that were chewy and pretty sure I had a bone. \n\nBulgogi Burrito - Same as the taco but filled with rice. This was huge! But nothing spectacular. The rice was mushy. \n\nOne thing I noticed about this place was their tortillas didn't have that tortilla texture. It is more mealy. Not a fan of that. \n\nBest thing about this restaurant would be the two slices of watermelon at the end and the fortune cookies.
