The staff is extremely friendly and professional. Dr. Chawla is a first class dentist; he manages a highly professional and state of the art practice.  You get text reminders on your appointments.  Services needed are explained with quoted reasonable prices upfront. There are no up sells or hard pitches for cosmetic services. This is just a classic old school family dentist with modern ambiance.  It's taken me 8 years in Las Vegas to find this gem. I found him through one of his wonderful hygienists- Katie.
