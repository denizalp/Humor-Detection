Sumi dojo is one of the worst izakaya restaurant in Montreal.\n\nFood - Did not taste like authentic japanese izakaya food. Instead, the food was chinese style fusion. This restaurant shouldn't even be called a japanese izakaya. Example fried chicken ball with sweet and sour sauce, that's not Japanese food!\n\nService - The service was fine. They seem to be a bit over staffed which is a good thing for busy restaurants (not very busy for a fri night). \n\nDecor and atmosphere - this was a take over which was an Italian resto I believe. They did some major renovations in the dining area but not the washrooms. Nice decor and open and spacious design with seats that open up to store jackets and coats. The music they played throughout the  restaurant was CHINESE music! I did not understand the concept they were trying to achieve. \n\nRumour has it that their head chef is from Imadake. That's why the menu is quite similar. I do not recommend this place for anyone who wants to eat authentic Japanese tapas. The concept to izakayas are small pub style eateries with alcohol and loud music. This place did not meet that criteria at all.
