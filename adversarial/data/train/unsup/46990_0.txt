After passing by this place for the past few months while the 95N connector has been closed, I finally stopped in. This is a very basic fast food style Mexican restaurant. Nothing bad about that, I come to expect that places like this are better than fancy schmancy, upscale. \nBut, I wasn't all that bowled over. The pastor was dry and had little flavor which surprised me especially having the el pastor in their name. One would think it would be one of the best ever had. What a disappointment. But their lengua helped me get over the el pastor. Tasty, tender and yummy. The best thing about my meager meal.\nThe last part of my meal was a Taco el dorado. Sounded extra yummy.  A deep fried taco with potato and pork cracklings. Sounded like something really yummy. I was saddened by what I got. An orange-y textured sauce adorned the 3 tacos, the sauce was very bland to say the least. I bit into the taco and found mashed potatoes and very little, to nothing else. A  fried, mashed potato empanada, is more the description of this dish. What an utter disappointment.
