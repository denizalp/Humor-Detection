After avoiding this Vegas show for two decades, I finally succumbed to the demands of my kids.  My expectations were very low, and I was pleasantly surprised.  This show isn't half bad!  And if you do your homework and score the half-price tickets in advance, this show is a downright steal considering how expensive everything is on the Strip these days.\n\nAvoid the front row.  View from the back rows are just as good.  Horses kick up dirt and if you are in the front row, dirt may come close to your dinner plate.\n\nDinner consists of a wonderful selection of chicken or chicken.  Turns out the chicken is more like cornish hen, but you do get the whole hen.  Mine was surprisingly tasty.  I thought it would be dry but the hen was nice and juicy.\n\nWe saw in the Dragon section, which is supposed to be the most raucous, but it was a tame crowd that night.  I suppose not enough beer was consumed....  Russia is a good section to sit in too.  It is fun to cheer for the bad guys.
