Charming 1840's historic house turned into elegant restaurant!  Relaxing atmosphere, cordial service, lots of dark wood paneling.  The New American menu comprised of a nice selection of fresh seafoods and grilled meats.  We shared some appetizers of Rhode Island calamari, lightly dusted with rice powder and fried, with a sweet chili dipping sauce; and an excellent grilled bacon-wrapped shrimp with a curry and cumin flavoring.  I followed with a grilled romaine wedge salad with mild bleu cheese dressing and crunchy croutons - very nice smoky aroma and flavors.  For my main course, I had to have their local walleye fillet, pretzel coated and hot, which were accompanied by terrific charred brussel sprouts and sweet potato wedges.   I finished with an only okay cheesecake with strawberry sauce.   All in all, a very convivial and cheery meal!
