Stack of plates: top clean, 2 beneath COVERED in someone else's food = gross. Delivered pizza to table and it slid off plate onto table. Normally I'd be fine because I'm not neurotic but having been given plates encrusted in dirty food I was grossed out so asked for a new pizza. The response from server: \"it's going to be a while since you requested a new one.\"\n\nI assure you I'm neither demanding nor rude. If I wanted to eat unsanitary food off of unclean plates I would eat on the streets. \n\nSad experience. Spare your efforts.  The pizza rock downtown at least embraces quality service and standards.
