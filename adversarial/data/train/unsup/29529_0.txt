This juice bar was amazing! I stopped in after going to the pool nearby and I was so pleasantly surprised. Having worked at a juice bar and juicing at home leaves me being very picky when I go out to buy juice or bowls. My juice (The Greenie) was fresh, clean, and made with the simple ingredients and tasted so refreshing and delicious! The staff was also extremely helpful with any questions I had, and were so sweet and personable as well. I had just landed in the area and it was my first time coming in, but by the end of my (maybe 5 minute) experience there, I felt that I had been going there for years! Definitely will be coming back during my visit!! Thank you!
