What more do you need from a storage facility?\n\nThe place itself is huge with units ranging from all shapes and sizes. Packing up valuable belongings? Safety first! The majority of the facility requires a code to get in. They have it on lock, for real. \n\nGot a big truck or RV you need to store? All Storage has got you. Need an air conditioned unit? All Storage has got you. Need boxes? All Storage sells them. \n\nIt's a bit out of the way, but gives me an excuse to explore another part of town when I make the trek. \n\nI also secretly hope that an episode of Storage Wars will be being filmed here every time I pull in. Is that show even on anymore? But alas, no dice just yet.
