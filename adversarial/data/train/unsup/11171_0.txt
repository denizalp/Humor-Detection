I do love Phoenix coffee. From the laid back vibe to the drip coffee, I'm all about heading to Phoenix for my afternoon caffeine fix. \n\nThe baristas are really nice... Probably the nicest I've seen in Cle. \n\nCoffee is excellent. When I'm feeling like I need to indulge, I get the mocha. Heaven in a cup, I tell you! \n\nExtra indulgence is the selection of pastries provided by Bon Bon Cleveland. *yes please!*
