I have to admit, the food here is good. What I don't like is me calling to make a reservation, having to wait till 10 pm, only to get there & see that it is half empty. Most reviews have stated this also. \n\nYes the prices are ridiculously expensive. $9 for miso soup, $9 for one thin slice of salmon sashimi, but hey it's \"fancy\" hotel food so I'm not even gonna complain.
