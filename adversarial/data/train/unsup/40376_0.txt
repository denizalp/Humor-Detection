Its God awful when a business refuses to slap paint on the walls after YEARS.  Look around and this is a straight-up dive, catering to alcoholics unconcerned about WHERE they get pissed. I believe the windows haven't been cleaned in MANY years. They are basically opaque for crying out loud. \n\nThis place is terrible to look at, forget to actually be inside, and a body has to wonder, mightily. If ownership won't spend $ .13 to maintain the dump what other expenses are being pissed on? The food suddenly LOOKS like fido the stray dog, redone.\n\nI was spanked, severely, for simply ASKING where I might plug in my laptop. That is HIGHLY verboten apparently. Pffft. Not that it mattered that much, the ONLY internet came from the McDonalds next door.\n\nDo yourself a favour and avoid this dive ... it's 100% pure gross and all it takes is one step inside the doorway to establish that beyond question. If you're blind one sniff should be enough Also. $ 31 for 4 beer is open theft.
