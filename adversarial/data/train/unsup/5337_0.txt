I love this place to pieces. Conveniently located in between Anise Tapas & Grill and Farmers Insurance on Durango Dr. This has been my to go spot for a wondrous facial. As soon as I walk in, Cheri, the sweet, kind receptionist with a smile on her face greets me by my name and makes me feel like home. She informs Jules, my esthetician\/skin therapist that I've arrived and there are fresh cookies as well as coffee or tea to help myself to while I'm waiting. \n\nJules is personable, enthusiastic, and informative in letting you know about her new skincare finds, tips, and advice. Her passion in helping you achieve whatever it is you want out of your facial is consistently shown every single time I've gone to see her. And she never fails to amaze me of her will to go above and beyond in making my skin glow and look its best. Not only does she take her time in getting everything out from my stubborn skin that loves to clog up blackheads from stress and sweat, she massages my feet with lotion, wraps them in plastic, and puts warm booties on them. Also gives me a upper body massage while my mask is purifying my skin. It's the best ever. The first in all my facial experience, where an esthetician\/skin therapist pampers you like no other AND even lets you know where you can buy products online without having the whole pressure of purchasing products from her. Actually she never even hustled me or pushed me to get anything from her. She even offers to text me websites on what great articles she read for certain skincare needs like sulfur-enriched foods for monthly breakouts to showing me step by step how to do it yourself chemical peels at home. It's like a best friend wanting to share something with you that can benefit you without wanting anything from you. I couldn't be more pleasantly shocked and thankful for all that she has done for my skin and her care of wanting to help me with my problem areas of having adult acneic skin. \n\nJules always tells me if I ever have any trouble on using anything I've bought online or if I'm bothered by my breakouts in between services to stop by and see her. And she'll be more than welcome to show me or help me with my skin questions or concerns. I even text her for her opinion on a particular laser treatment and chemical peel percentage. And she gets back to me promptly with great advice. I'm telling you she's definitely not like any other esthetician\/skin therapist. Her deals are 100x better than any spa I've gone to. I bought a package deal and it's $55 each facial, but you seriously get so much more for what you've paid for. I couldn't be happier or more satisfied with my results and it makes me look forward to coming back each time. \n\nI saved her review to be my 100th review for Yelp, because that's the kind of recognition she deserves. I even bought my Mother, a facial\/back scrub gift certificate, because I know she'll do a remarkable job in making her feel amazing and completely pampered for Mother's Day. Usually, the facial takes about 90 mins., so come prepared to relax and enjoy your spa day without ever the feeling of being rushed. She's one of the Greatest and I'm fortunate to find her. Thank you so much Jules for EVERYTHING.
