Wow! I moved from a city that had food carts everywhere with cheap tacos. After moving to Vegas it was hard finding a good quality taco shop that reminded me of home. I seen this place available on door dash and decided to try. \n\nI was amazed how delicious this actually was. I had the enchilada plate and ordered some tacos for a friend. It came with a complimentary salad and everything was fresh. The tacos were great and I ate there twice that week. Will be back again.
