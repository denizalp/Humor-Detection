Conveniently located, well-kept hotel\/casino. Double room was big enough for our party of three. Blow-Dryers and lighted magnifying mirror with magnification on one side which is always a plus for me. . Steam iron worked well. Housekeeping was friendly and did a great job. Good band playing in the casino area. Nice pool and spa. Big and gorgeous statue of a wild horse in the lobby along with a showcase of the guitars of bands\/artists who have played there. Great place. Happy with our choice. The bath towels were smaller than you'll normally find....but on one day, they weren't. ‚Äç  ****Wi-Fi was realllly weak****. Was trying to get work done, but it was painfully slow. Had to go to Starbucks to get work done. Friendly staff. Free parking. Fast room service. I'd stay there again if I didn't have a lot of work.
