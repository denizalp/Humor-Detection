Went for the toffee banofi but ended up making my own mix......Triple play coconut sorbet, peaberry espresso sorbet, coconut cashew curry ice cream with homemade brittle and caramel sauce.\n\nWOW WEEEEEEEE WOW!!!!! is all I can say. For once I can say there is something that rivals gelato. I will definitely be back!
