This has to be one of the smallest Whole Foods that I've been to. But you know what?  It's also one of the easiest ones to get in and out. I just recently discovered the food bars at Whole Foods on my quest to clean eating.  At this Whole Foods, I was unaware that they even served food because the selection is obviously smaller.  No big deal for me because my reason to ever come here to to pick up a few necessities from time to time.  \n\nMy reasons for coming here;\n-Flavored Rice Cakes\n-UDO's 3-6-9 Oil Blend\n-Ezekiel English Muffins\n-Bob's Red Mill Rolled Oats\n\nBy the way, their prices for everything may be higher than most, but their bottled is cheap, cheap, cheap.  \n\nBecause Whole Foods tends to be on the pricier side, I do the rest of the grocery shopping elsewhere. But I won't discredit Whole Foods. I encourage you to come check them out, especially this one.  Looking for a place for healthier eating with a quick in and out, then this Whole Foods has to be on the top of your list. \n\nPS:  Like all other Whole Foods in the Valley, some of the best employees. I put that on!!\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (401\/500)
