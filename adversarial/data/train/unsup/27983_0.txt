Zzzzz. I had dined here and at Flamingo several times in the past, but my most recent visit was noticeably different. \n\nTheir breakfasts are dull and bland. The menu is extensive, but their kitchen lacks the talent to create any interesting or satisfying meals. Why no hash browns at breakfast? Why the need to season and garnish everything with paprika? The house potatoes tasted processed and are diced like a chiclet. \n\nThe service is usually pleasant and efficient, but that becomes as unmemorable when the food is flavorless. \n\nSave your money and keep looking.
