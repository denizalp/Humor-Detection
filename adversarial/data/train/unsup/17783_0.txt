This is a little quaint cafe\/bar spot that has a lot to offer.  Unfortunately, my review is specifically going to cover only the atmosphere and alcohol.  I havent had a chance to eat here just yet but I have only heard good things.  All local foods and farms used here and my buddy lives and dies by their salads. \n\nThe wine menu is rather extensive but I personally think that the beer seclection is excellent.  Tons of local crafts and all of the other usual domestics and imports.  Can't go wrong.  The atmosphere is what I dig most.  The outdoor patio\/balcony seating is the prime spot. Beautiful views of the park and mint museum... Perfect for catching a breeze and people watching!  Best time for arriving.. Right after work because lunch can get a little busy.  But, it's perfect for an after work drink or two or five.  Give it a shot.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Ian M.
