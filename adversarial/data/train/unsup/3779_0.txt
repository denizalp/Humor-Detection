Totally awesome customer service!\nI bought my neighbor's bike last week and wanted to accessorize it.  You know, bling it out.  Bedazzle it.  First, though, I needed tubes.\nSun was definitely the place to go.  Everyone was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.  \nThey have a huge selection of bikes.  It doesn't look like it from the outside, but there have got to be a gazillion bikes up in here.\nI brought Dexter, of course.  He was a hit, I tell ya.\nAbout a week later, it was time to get a basket.  I wanted one that The Dex could fit into, so I brought him with me, again.  I like places where I can take him with me.  It makes the world feel like a better place.\nAnyway, found a big basket that I can fit Dexter into, or my laptop, whichever activity I'm about to do.  The manager, Joe, told me to bring my bike in to have the basket installed.  \nThese guys are great and I'm so glad I can ride my bike around the corner to the store.  I'll be a frequent shopper!
