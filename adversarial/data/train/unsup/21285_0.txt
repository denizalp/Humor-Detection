This review is almost a year overdue. \n\nI received an invitation in the mail to come and stay at the Wynn for two consecutive nights and receive two complimentary buffets and two tickets to the show \"La Reve.\" It was a great offer that I could not pass it up. My mom and I decided to go for Thanksgiving weekend last year.\n\nThe hotel is beautiful and lavish. It is a gaming casino, but there are sections of the resort that do not feel that way. We got a room at the Encore with a queen bed. We pulled into the valet area where we were quickly attended to. Given the fact that it was a holiday weekend, checking in wasn't as quickly as one would anticipate. This is completely understandable.\n\n\nOur room was clean and beautiful. You really feel luxurious when walking into it. The bathroom was one of my favorite things about it. The separate soaking tub and dual sinks is a great touch. Plus, there is a TV in there so you can watch while taking a bath or doing your makeup. \n\nThe separate sitting area with the revolving plasma TV is also very convenient. No complaints about the room whatsoever.\n\nThe show was also amazing. We watched in awe as these performers catapulted themselves into someone else's arms over a pool of water. All the stunts were incredible and above all, the show was free which made it even better.\n\nI received another invitation from the Wynn to stay during their winter season, but this one does not include tickets to the show. I will definitely be coming back here when in Vegas.
