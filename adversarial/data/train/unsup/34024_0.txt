My 5& 6 y\/o kids love the rides here. For the most part it is a great place for kiddos to play indoors. The reason I give the facility 3 stars is due to how long in takes to get any food from the concession stand. If you order a pizza, coffee or soft pretzel you will be waiting at least 30 minutes. The chairs in the food area are broken. Also, the majority of the video games are not working consistently so you have to find an employee to give you a token because you didn't get to play or ask for tickets because they don't get paid out... \n\nIt is VERY loud in there and the music is blasted on top of all the noise the rides make. As I said my kids do have fun. However make sure you give yourself ample time to order food... Go back to the counter to check on it as you won't be able to hear the cashier call your number and they will not go find you.\n\nThe current management seems off... A lot has changed at this place. The best way to summarize it is that it looks abandoned. The cleanliness, empty bins for ticket prizes, malfunctioning OLD games, more than half empty \"claw\" game broken chairs and terrible food service screams closing down soon to me.
