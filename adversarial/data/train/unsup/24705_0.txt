Worst Hawaiian food i have ever had....ate it hours ago and my stomach is aching .the macaroni was flavorless,bbq beef was so fatty ,kalbi ribs nohing but fat,even the chicken was low quality meat.growing up in southern California I expected more....best Hawaiian food i have had in Arizona is aloha kitchen in mesa only 5-7 mins from this nasty place and way better quality,taste,and portions. Dont waste your money here!!!!!
