I am not a frequent YELP user.  Enterprise had sent me an email asking for a review, I usually use Trip Advisor.  Booked a reservation and arrived when I planned.  The vehicle was ready, but it smelled like someone had smoked in it.  I was upgraded because it was the only other vehicle available.  Nice.  Thanks.
