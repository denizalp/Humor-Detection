My best friends and I booked tickets to GaGa months ago. My friend, who is in a wheelchair due to chronic pain, selected the seats we wanted and laid 200 dollars a piece for them. Fast forward. We show up hours before the show started and were informed that our seats were not, in fact, the seats we selected and paid for. We were helped by a nice man named Damien who tried very hard to fix the situation. Eventually we asked to speak to a manager, since we were getting nowhere. The box office manager, Lauren, blamed us for the mistake and then told us that there was nothing she could do and we should, \"try to enjoy the concert.\" All of this would have been fine had it not been for my friend who is balling, since she literally lives for GaGa and can't even live a normal day to day life due to pain. Eventually, Damien rectified the situation but everyone else's role did nothing but hurt us and prolong the difficult situation. Needless to say, the Garden Arena at MGM has far better customer service.
