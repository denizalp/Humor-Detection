I had not been for a massage and about a year, as my regular massage therapist moved away. I was wary of getting a massage for a Groupon offer, but I was really in need of a massage. I'm here to tell you that I am so pleased that took the leap and ordered the Groupon! Megg at Woman of the Woods far exceeded my expectations. Not only was she super nice, Megg listened to my needs and that attentiveness shined through during my massage! She hit all the problem areas and even included a hot stone massage. Ahhhh...exactly what I needed. While I found Megg through a discount offer, I will definitely be back.
