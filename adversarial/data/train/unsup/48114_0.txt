Excellent service. Very attentive and accommodating. Nice decor, but unfortunately you can be subjected to listening to conversations of others, who don't comprehend the theory of \"inside voice\" because of the seating arrangements.\nNot an expansive wine list, but adequate choices...\nWould loved to have tried a dessert, but after the delicious dinner there was just no way...I was \"stuffed\".\nThe lobster bisque is a must have; even more tasty with a glass of champagne.\nCheck out their dining club.
