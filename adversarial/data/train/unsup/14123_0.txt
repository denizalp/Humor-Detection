Two & a half stars.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something here because most of the previous reviewers had so many great things to say about this place.  There isn't an iota of a wow factor in this resto whatsoever.  Frankly I found it to be kinda grungy.  My arms kept sliding on the clear plastic covers tacked on to the tables.  This spot looks like a cheap restaurant makeover place.  Even the glassware is kinda grungy.  You know how glasses get to look after they been through the industrial dishwashers one too many times.  This is totally Five Doors North which made me wish I should have gone a few doors further north and hit up Zucca instead.  \n\nHooked up with my sista meatatarian, the groovy Shari M. and we were hunkering down for a celebrataory birthday evening and thought this place would hit the spot, especially after reading the glowing reviews.  We ordered some plates to share.  Grilled sardines.  Pizzetta.  Sausages.  Some rolled up prosciutto thing that they brought literally seconds after ordering.  They must make them in advance and keep them in the fridge.  This meant the prosciutto was really well chilled which ultimately means you just can't taste it and it raised the chewy factor even more so.  \n\nShari ordered a Cosmo and her reaction was to tell me not to order my usual Cosmo cocktail because she could tell by the taste they were using really cheap booze.  Cocktails and wine by the glass is on par with restos such as the Hoof, Splendido, Enoteca....yet were miles apart in terms of quality, quantity and stemware.  I notice these things and even more so when all I keep thinking is about my arms sliding around the greasy plastic table covers.  \n\nFive Doors North.  Two & a Half Doors for me.
