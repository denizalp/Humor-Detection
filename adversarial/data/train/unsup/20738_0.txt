God bless you, Lee.  The man certainly knew how to collect.  You can't buy good taste, but you can have one hell of a time trying.  Housed in two buildings are the greatest collection of rhinestoned cars, pianos, costumes and other ephemera.  There isn't anyone left like Liberace anymore.  Could you picture the people of the future flocking to the Museum of Eddie Vedder?  I can't.\n\nTake the cab ride to \"God's country,\" as one too many cab drivers put it and check this place out.  Then have a great lunch at Carluccio's.  Or, do what I did.  See Liberace and then take the shuttle back to Excalibur and see Tourament of Kings!
