This is a GREAT spot! It's tucked away within a little bar called \"Hardhat Lounge\". Fast, friendly service...and the bar is remodeled and clean. \n\nCody bbq's daily starting at 11am, and his methods are the bomb! I went later in the day...and due to First Friday and the popularity of his sides, we missed out on getting a hold of some of the typical favorites. \n\nCan't wait to come back and try more...
