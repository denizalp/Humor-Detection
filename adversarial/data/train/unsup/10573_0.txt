I came for my birthday and loved it. I love that whole Goodfellas vibe. I felt it walking in. I felt history and class. And I loved the simplicity. The way it's supposed to be.\n\nWe were seated in the Marilyn Monroe booth which I was delighted to be in since she's my girl! Btw they have an amazing shrimp cocktail here. So fresh and beautiful. I love having my horseradish raw where I can see it.\n\nThe Ribeye was good. It was juicy. Not one of my tops, but very good. I really liked their chicken parm which is weird Bc I went in wanting meat and then I got the parm and was able to have both! Their Caesar Salad is seriously the best I've ever had. EVER. OMG. \n\nThe service was wonderful and the staff is so accommodating and amazing. I would definitely come back!
