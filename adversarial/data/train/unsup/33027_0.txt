Nice mall. \nIt's what feels like about an hour and a half trip from the NE side of Akron, where we are, so we rarely get out to that side of town. But at least you don't need an automatic weapon or a platoon of bodyguards to walk the place after 3 pm on a Saturday. And you can't argue they're not miles ahead of Chapel Hill these days. As others have said, let's hope the slimy underbelly doesn't devour this place like the other mall casualties of 21st century Akron Ohio.
