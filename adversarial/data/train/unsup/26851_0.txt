I had an AC problem this summer and called Arizona Dukes of Air. They answered the phone, were professional and clear about rates and schedule. A tech was able to make it to my house in the same day, was knowledgable and professional. He had diagnosed the problem in about 5 mins but took the time to check other components to ensure they were in good working order. The problem was fixed in a short time ( luckily he had the part on his truck) and paid him promptly. The fix has worked and I couldn't be happier that I called. Anytime I have an AC problem or check ups, I'll be calling Arizona Dukes of Air. \n\nThis is one case where you can believe the hype!
