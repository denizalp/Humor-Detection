I love Jamba Juice!! I hadn't been since I lived in NYC for a year in college. I would pass it every day as I headed home, it was awesome. When I discovered it at CLT I was excited since I frequent CLT about once a month to visit the bf. Usually if I am leaving CLT it means I am leaving him so, I tend to drown my sorrows in a Caribbean Passion smoothie (well, and a Cinnabon but, that's besides the point).  \n\nI'll be honest, I haven't strayed much from the Caribbean Passion; I use to try other flavors but none of them tasted as good to me! The staff is friendly at this location and gets you your smoothie as quick as they can.
