We almost went to Dennys or IHOP this morning, but I decided we should come here for breakfast around 9:30am.\n\nGot my 2 egg white omelettes with no bacon.   Tip the hilarious chef that cooks the omelettes, he's got jokes.  Makes it entertaining for us waiting in line.\n\nThey also have white rice, Portuguese sausages, Chorizo Breakfast burritos, and watered down Miso Soup.  \n\nThe breakfast potatoes were cold today....so I didn't finished the rest of it.  They should tossed out the cold potatoes, that's just me. \n\nNot too shabby for breakfast.
