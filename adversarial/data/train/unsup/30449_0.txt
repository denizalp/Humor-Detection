OMG! I'm so sad at how many low reviews Kelly-o's has! :(\n\nI visited here back in June 2009 so it was quite a long time ago but I can remember the service being great. Their coffee being one of the best coffees I've had in a long time. And the food being great too! We decided to visit after they were featured on TV and we definitely don't regret going! It was great!
