We visited this Harkins a few weeks back to see Non-Stop (opening weekend).\nPretty standard for a Harkins, It seemed to be a very big one.\n\nI wish I would remember the name, the young man that helped me at the concessions was very nice and friendly. He packed my popcorn well, layered the butter, and filled the bag all the way to the top as it should be done : )\n\nThe only con is that I have been trying to stay away from soda and on occassion I have my Harkins courtesy cup filled with water. Well, the water at other locations has been good, but this one tasted bad.
