Dr. Pace did an amazing job, I was scared and heard horror stories about root canals but that was not the case. Office was so nice, everyone that worked there was so nice and welcoming. They had tv's in the ceilings and he made me feel so comfortable. My tooth was a little sore after the numbing wore off but next day didn't even hurt or feel like I had work done on it. I would highly recommend this office if you need any root canals done. Amazing job and thanks again!
