***BEST BAR ALERT***\n\n\nPizza? Check.\nLocal bands, dj sets, dance parties? Check.\nCraft drafts, cheap cans, fresh and thoughtful cocktails? Check.\n \nIf you like any of the following, Spirit is the bar for you:  having fun, drank, bingo, trivia, cookouts, party bus, video games, gallery shows, non-profit  and community fundraisers, dancing, ample parking, sexy bartenders, BRUNCH BUFFETS, hipsters, punks, parents, squares, really old people?, bad boys, prank kweens, dirty birds, mozzarella, more fun.\n\nIn the short time that Spirit has been open, they've managed to do more innovative, fun, creative, and community driven events than any other bar or venue in recent memory. You can find me there a few times a week, whether it's for a dance party that has me taking my shoes off and shaking it *so good*, a happy hour catch-up cocktail with an old friend, a pizza party, or a lingering lazy hungover brunch. \n\nSometimes I will be on my way to a new event at Spirit and I'll have a moment of pause, thinking to myself, \"is this the night that Spirit has jumped the shark?\" But by the end, you realize that Spirit has just jumped onto the back of the shark, and is surfing along with it, pizza in one hand, party in the other
