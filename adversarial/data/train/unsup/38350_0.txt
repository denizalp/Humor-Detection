Ordered delivery and these treats came in the most gorgeous packaging. The donuts, cake, cupcakes and Nanaimo bars are visually beautiful and made with heart. The downside is that everything was incredibly sweet. Almost too sweet. Like, you can only take a bite or two sweet. If you have a REALLY big sweet tooth, Sorelle is perfect for you and you should try it out. We're glad we tried them, but probably will try their savoury items next time instead.
