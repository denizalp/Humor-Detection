Was here this past weekend for a 4 day conference for work....I liked this place a lot.  The rooms are spacious and the service is great.  The pools are great...swim at night when the weather is a bit cooler, and if you need to swim some laps do it then...no one swims at night to get a workout but me!!\n\nIf you need to get to anywhere within a 3 mile radius, the hotel service car will take you at no charge....they will drop you off and when you are ready to be picked up just give them a ring.  The mall is located within walking distance, and so are the restaurants.\n\nTaggia, the italian restaurant located inside the main lobby, is a big YEEEEUUMMMM!  The Saulmi and Cheese platter is to die for.\n\nOverall....what a great experience..and I 'd come back again!!\n\nTo my fellow yelpers, happy travels!!!
