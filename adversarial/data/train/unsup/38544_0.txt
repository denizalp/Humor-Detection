I think I visited on an off night.  They were quite busy and only had one server on the floor but several \"hosts\" that seemed to not be doing anything.  The server was new and didn't know anything about the menu and our order came out wrong and then a host approached us and made us feel like we were wrong.  We had to ask them to make it right - they seemed content to let us eat what was served not what we actually ordered.  It was a little odd.  It's a nice room but not sure I would go back.\n\nAlso, this is just a personal bug of mine but we were drinking (quite a bit as we were waiting for food and then waiting for correct food) and I asked for a glass of soda water on the side and was charged $2.50 and not offered a re-fill, the glass was just whisked away when I was finished.\n\nMeh. I've expected better sums this up perfectly.
