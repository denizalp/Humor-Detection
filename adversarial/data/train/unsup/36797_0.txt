Shoe heaven! Stopped by to see if I could find a nice pair of pumps for a wedding i'm attending early next year. I was able to find an amazing silver pump with crystal embellishments. So happy to hear they had it in my size!! I usually always have issues finding things in my size. The staff was so helpful in my search for the right shoe. I knew I wanted silver so they were nice enough to show me all they had. Kind of wanted them all. They were really patient as I tried them over and over again trying to decide. Will be back for another pair!
