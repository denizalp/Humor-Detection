The guys at Artistic Tattoo are awesome! I have been tattooed by Levi, Weeze, Brent, and their apprentice Candice. All of them are very professional and are incredibly talented. Weeze's color and shading is well beyond satisfactory and Levi's art work is one of a kind! Everyone is friendly and there is a great atmosphere about the shop! I highly recommend anyone to go there!
