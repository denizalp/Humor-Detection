This place is awesome! I had never been but stopped by after needing scrubs for school. The girl working was very helpful and offered to clear my hands and start me a fitting room right away. They have great prices and everything was easy to find. Was also very excited when she told me $14.99 and $9.99 items were 50% off that day! I bought 4 scrub tops and two bottoms for only $40! \nI asked for business cards and received a calendar that let's me know what deals they have on each day. \nI would definitely recommend them and already have to my classmates.
