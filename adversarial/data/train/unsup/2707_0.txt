This place was OFF THE HOOK!  I came here for my birthday one Saturday night after we saw how incredibly long and ridiculous the line for Light was.  I had to make a quick decision, and my cousin's girlfriend suggested Foundation Room.  cover is free for girls and $10 for guys.\n\nIt was dark here with candles and low lighting - what I would consider perfect ambiance.  It was similar to the ambiance of a speakeasy but bigger and with louder music and more people.  It was a very intimate setting for a bar and the music was at the perfect volume - loud enough to dance but soft enough to hear conversation and talk.  The outside provided a spectacular view of the Strip, where we ended up doing what seemed like a 1 hour photo shoot.  \n\nThe night was quite a blur, but EVERYONE in my group of 21 people enjoyed themselves and couldn't stop talking about what a great venue and bar Foundation Room was.  They did kick my brother and cousin out around 1:30 AM, so behave yourselves here.  This was a really cool bar, and I would definitely come here again.  Hopefully I'll remember more next time!
