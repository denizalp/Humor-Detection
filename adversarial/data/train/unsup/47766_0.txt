The Yolk is truly the best breakfast spot in the area. The place is small and tight, always busy but a sign of the quality of the meal. The cheese grits are the best I've ever had (and I've had a lot growing up in the south)! I chose a special, purple sweet potato pancakes with candied pecans, marscapone cheese and apricots and mint honey syrup. Beyond delicious! My husband had the 2 If By Sea with Tennessee fries, which are amazingly flavored. We sat at the community table which is open seating. Made for a little shorter wait.  I'd definitely recommend trying the Yolk.
