We ordered wings here through uberEATS. Onion rings were burnt. We ordered 1\/2 pound of sweet and spicy Thai wings and 1\/2 pound of Forty Creek Whiskey wings. They were terrible. Scrawny wings with barely any meat that were completely burnt. Barely any sauce. Immensely disappointing. \n\nWhen we tried calling the location they took no accountability saying they were unable to help as we ordered through uberEATS. Like they had no clue how to find the order. Even though we could provide them with the time the order was placed, the order number and the ITEMS ordered. I've lodged a complaint with uberEATS as well, but the terrible quality comes from this location. We will never order wings from here again. Don't waste your money here.
