There were things I loved about this place and things I hated. Settled on 2 stars because if I'm spending $1300 on dinner for 2, it should have been the best meal of my life. \nPros: The restaurant is beautiful and the staff are pleasant and always at your service. \nThe bread cart and the dessert cart had over 15 variations of each and they were all delicious. By far the best part of the meal.\n\nCons: We got the 15 course tasting menu and a bottle of wine. We are both good eaters and like almost anything and there were some things I just ate because I couldn't fathom leaving on my plate because of how much money I was spending. \n\nI guess I went in with high expectations given the price tag and was disappointed!
