Wandered into here from the TJ Maxx next door and this is basically a TJ Maxx for you guessed it...home goods. Pretty solid selection of name brand silverware, furniture, art work and home decor. And there are ton's of bargains and clearance items to be had. If you don't notice the mass of 40 to 50 year old women running around screaming, \"OMG RALPH LAUREN DISHWARE!!\" or \"BABY, BABY look, VERA WANG!\" or blah blah blah, you won't be too bothered. This place is super busy, but there are tons of associates around to help. For as crazy as the patrons of Home Goods are, the aisles and products are very organized, clearly priced, and all with a clean layout. If you wanna decorate your housing with name brand decor, but without having to get a second job on the streets - give this place a chance!
