This spot gets the job done. It's cheap, good, greasy Mexican food. This is the closest you'll get to a taqueria. I always enjoy their food and don't ever get sick so I'm sold. I wish they sold agua frescas though, that would be awesome and it would save me a pricey trip to Los Tacos and having to pay over 3 bucks for a taco.
