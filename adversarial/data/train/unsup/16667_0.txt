Hard to believe that I have never been to this location, but it was a first time here.\nI was pleasantly surprised. It was very nice!\nA huge layout, patio seating ,bar area ,and a huge Dining room.\nWe came for Happy hour. Our server was wonderful . I am sorry to say I have forgotten her name right now though.\nThey have several happy hour cocktails on special which both my friends tired and really liked. I went for the wine at $2.00 off for HH.\nThey have a great Happy Hour menu as well. All sorts of Sushi and other items very reasonable as well.\nI tired the crab sushi,fresh and delicious. We also got artichoke dip which came with chips. A Chicken flat bread, and the chicken and shrimp Lettuce wraps. Which are better than P.F. Chang's by far.\nGreat tables, nice and big with room for everything. An absolutely beautiful fish tank, that had some amazing fish inside of it. Just a really nice place ,with a nice atmosphere.\nOne star down because, while the Ladies room was clean there was no Toilet paper in 2 stalls as well as no seat covers. We did let someone know about it and they were very apologetic.Other than that it was a great experience.
