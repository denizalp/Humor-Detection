Outstanding collection.  They have lovely Picassos and Monets.  And, I was thrilled they had a cast of one of my favorite pieces, Rodin's \"The Thinker.\" \n\nThe CHAGALL exhibit (through June 11, 2017) was exceptional.  In additional to the many paintings, drawings and sculptures, I was in awe of the extensive Chagall collection of costumes from ballets and operas as well as some original filmed footage of a ballet from 1942!  I recommend joining a tour if there is one available, or rent a headset, it is well worth it for the commentary
