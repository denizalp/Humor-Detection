I ordered an iced mocha. \nIt tasted like sour, uncooked green peas. \nI went back in to exchange the drink and he did but not without an attitude.\nHe said he was on 3 hours without a break. \nOkay... well the heat index is over 100Â°f and I've been out in it all day working plus I don't have A\/C in my vehicle.\nThe mocha was $4 and I tipped $1. \nHe didn't even offer to refund the difference when I traded for the iced tea... a small difference but it's the lack of thought that counts.\nI guess working in a tiny air conditioned coffee shop for 3 hours without a break is too much.\n\nI'll try to enjoy this $5 iced tea I have but I goddamn sure won't be back.
