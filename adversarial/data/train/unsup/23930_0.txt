Great little Japanese grocery and goods store tucked in between La Taquiera Guadalajara and Asian Sweet Bakery that carries fresh, authentic products and produce.\n\nDon't let the size fool you,  they are jam packed with hundreds of hard to find items and your traditional produce found in typical Japanese grocery stores, just as if you were in Japan. \n\nOn this particular day, I found shabu shabu grade meat and other ingredients to make Sukiyaki.\n\nThey also have famous Hippo House bakery items delivered fresh and fresh, sushi grade fish shipped in weekly. \n\nThe proprietor is always nice and helpful. \n\nParking in the back! \n\nCash only.
