This restaurant close at 12 midnight. Nice place to grab a late night snack. You can do dine-in or just buy a slice from the counter. \n\nNice bar area watching sports. \n\nThe Service: The server is friendly. Pizza do take a while to be served. That is okay but it is freshly made to order. \n\nThe Food: Pizza has thin crust but not those crispy crust type. Can taste a little bit wood burning at the end crust. \n\nGotham - a little bit way too salty for me. Lots of meat.\n\nMargarita - not too saucy, fresh basil leaves on the top of the pizza.\n\nTheir cocktail drinks almost $15.
