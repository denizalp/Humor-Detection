My favorite Vietnamese restaurant on my side of town! At some point this place changed business owners and there were some inconsistencies such as a noticeable change in their pho broth, hence the lower rating. \n\n- Spring Rolls: Love their version! They add a crunchy element in the middle and it is yummy! Add sriracha to the peanut sauce for an extra kick.\n\n- Pho: I used to really like their pho broth.  It is not as flavorful anymore.  The pho tai (rare beef), seafood, and vegetarian pho are all good. \n\n- Vermicelli bowls:  Flavor bomb and great noodles. Their noodles are thin and soft, while other places have hard, thicker noodles.  My go to is the charbroiled pork with egg rolls.  I highly recommend the beef lemongrass vermicelli bowl if you're not afraid of flavor!  The sweet, vinegar, fish sauce that comes with the bowls is yummy...pour it all in the bowl and mix everything up. I love the freshness of the veggies and all the different textures going on.\n\n- Beef crispy egg noodles: I really like this dish, but they are a bit stingy with the \"gravy.\"  I like the center to be slightly softened by the brown sauce, with outer edges still crunchy.  They tend to serve this dish with not enough sauce, with a center that is still very crunchy.\n\nService isn't the best, but food usually comes out in a timely manner.  Pay for your meal at the counter after you're done eating.
