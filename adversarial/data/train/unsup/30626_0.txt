This place is always packed! You have to get there early because there's usually a line up, especially on weekends. \n\nThe food is pretty good, but it's a little pricey for what you're getting. \n\nI recommend the more \"desserty\" sounding dishes, if you're going for a real breakfast kind of diner, go somewhere else.
