I unapologetically love Tasty Chinese. Aside from the slightly higher bar of quality that their food provides, I've found comfort in never ordering a dish I didn't like. The friendly staff, clean tables, and stellar turnaround time on orders has made Tasty my go-to in terms of East End Chinese orders for pick-up.\n\nMy usual order for three people includes crab rangoon or egg rolls, hot and sour soup, General Tso's chicken, fried rice, and lo mein. I encourage you to order whatever you want, though, because it's all pretty...pretty...pretty Tasty.
