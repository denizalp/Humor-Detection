Went in for the first time about a week ago and their air conditioner was not working. It was actually cooler outside in the 110 degree Vegas sun. It was horrible and i cant believe they actually stayed open and subjected their customers to that heat. I got a dozen manapua which cost me about $35. Nothing special and you could tell it was the frozen kine.
