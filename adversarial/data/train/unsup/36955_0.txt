So good that I forgot to take photos of the food! \n\nMy boyfriend and I each ordered the $17 brunch where you picked 3 items from the menu. Between the two of us we ordered: yogurt & granola, dollar pancakes w\/Apple compote & coconut whip, cranberry pumpkin muffin, junior scramble, biscuits & gravy and the Benedict Florentine. We shared, servings are good sized and fairly priced, even took a little home. \n\nEverything was top notch, just might be the best vegan food in Cleveland! Our favs were the Benedict (how can you pass up hollandaise?!) and the biscuits and gravy.\n\nWe will be back often. Hoping they end up opening for dinner ;)
