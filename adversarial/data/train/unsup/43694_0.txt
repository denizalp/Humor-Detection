Wish you could give no stars\n\n10 month old $200+ tires with less than 10k miles and they are totally shot. \n\nI could understand if it was over a year and over the mileage, but telling me that I have to buy new tires out of my pocket, have the distributor they partnered with and who has confirmed the issue send the tires back, and then they will look at them and see if I should get replacements. This process takes 3 months!\n\nWhy would I buy another set of tires from a company that won't back the first?? Had they said there must have been a defect since they should last longer than 10k miles, I could see giving them another try. But all they do is keep sending you the warranty info that you already have and never respond to the actual issue. \n\nThis one is easy - just stay away from this company.
