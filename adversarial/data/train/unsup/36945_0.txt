Great place to stay. Super friendly staff, very comfortable beds with pillow top? & super comfy down pillows and comforters. Love love loved the beds. Great pool area, very beautiful. The only complaint there was that the pool area was considered off season (85+ degrees out during our Oct. visit) so there were no cushions or bar\/food available outside and no outdoor bathroom. You have to go in the casino dripping wet or take the time to dry off so don't hold it til it's too late lol. \nFood was delicious at both the Seasons Buffet and Mi Casa Mexican grill. The $2 street tacos were the best I've ever had especially the chicken tacos. Large for street tacos which is great! Great wait staff at both locations. Friendly and on top of it. The only thing I found strange was there is NO breakfast buffet. Kind of a bummer. \nOther than that my only other wish was for a coffee machine in my room. \nBreakfast buffet, coffee machine and cushions please!!
