Its a great option for a snack or breakfast at the Paris.  Like everything in Vegas, it is overpriced for what it is but for me it was worth it.\n\n The crepes are very good, both the savory and the sweet ones.  They are well made and the ingredients are very fresh.  The creperie does not have its own seating area but shares one with a couple of other places in the Paris and the options for hot drinks was pretty limited.
