Cheap, cheap, cheap. While some of the shoes may be cute, they look cheap on closer inspection. The sales people seem more interested in texting or chatting on their cell phones or gossiping with one another. They are not friendly and don't offer to help (at least on the 4 separate occasions when I have been there). Go visit for the cheap footwear but not for the customer service.
