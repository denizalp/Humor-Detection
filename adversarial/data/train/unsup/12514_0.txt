I'd dropped in here several times to look for guns....their selection is pretty low and their prices are average.  There's a \"spy shop\" attached to it where you can buy gadgets and other gizmos related to that kind of stuff.  The staff is nice enough, but I probably won't make this place a regular stop unless they get more guns in stock.\n\nReturn Factor - 30%
