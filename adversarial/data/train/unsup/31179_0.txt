I bought a Groupon for a few group classes and a private lesson to get ready for our wedding first dance. My fiance was not thrilled about being forced to take the classes and I was a little nervous that it would be awkward since we didn't know what we were doing! We took the group lesson, which was laid back, fun, and helped get us ready for our private lesson afterwards since my fiance has two left feet :) Maybelline was our instructor for the private lesson and she is AMAZING! She gave us a little routine to do and practiced the steps with us using our song. We were both so happy with how well it went that we ended up booking two more private lessons with her to add a little more flair to our dance now that we have the basics! I would definitely recommend trying it out if you are getting ready for an event!
