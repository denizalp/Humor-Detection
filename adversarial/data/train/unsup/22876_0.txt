Is it just me or is this place way overpriced for poor quality items? They lure you in with their \"sales\" and tempt you with earning their Kohl's cash. But really they just hike the prices way up so the sale price is on par with what it should be. They are charging as if they are higher quality items from something similar to a Macy's but giving quality more like a Walmart. No disrespect to Walmart. I have been there many times but you get what you pay for and I'm okay with that for certain items. I will say Kohl's has a fun kitchen section though. Still overpriced but fun to look through all the fun gadgets and containers. But you can have way better luck finding quality kitchen items at a better price at either Ross, Home Goods or even Target.
