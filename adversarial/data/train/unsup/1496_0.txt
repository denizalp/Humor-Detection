I'd give the lady a 0 if I could. Absolutely horrible. I gave the hairstylist the benefit of the doubt as my friend (asian male) wanted a trim and the only negative review was from a girl. Turns out I didn't realize that horrible customer service doesn't differentiate among genders. \n\nWhile we entered an empty salon, the woman's patience (I feel as though calling her a hairstylist is an insult to the profession so I shall not) grew weary as customers started walking in. The disconnect between her broken english and our inability to speak Korean spoke volumes as she proceeded to give my friend a \"regulah cut.\" We came prepared with a photo and an apt description. Did she deliver? Absolutely not. She didn't even wash his hair. She sprayed it lightly with water and just did what she had to do in 5-10 minutes. Voicing our concerns became even more useless as she just wanted to finish the cut and move onto the next client. \n\nWay to earn a quick buck. While her haircuts might be cheap, they're def not of quality. Don't waste your money here. You're better cutting your hair yourself.
