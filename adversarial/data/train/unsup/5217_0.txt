There's just not a better hot dog. We're so lucky to have a Ted's here in AZ. I get two regular dogs, fries and rings, and a loganberry soda. I get one dog with mustard, hot sauce and onions. The other, chili, cheese and onions.\n\nI've been going to Ted's since 1987, when I started school at UB (Buffalo). What a treasure.
