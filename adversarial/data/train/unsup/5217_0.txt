Been here several times and it's always been a great experience until today. I usually go with the Italian usuals such as lasagna, spaghetti or the pizza here. \n\nToday I decided to try the salmon with the seafood ravioli...Ooops.  The salmon was small and dry and the ravioli didn't have much flavor.  \n\nLuckily Fred was very cool and made our evening pleasent with a desert if Tiramisu and that was great. \n\nWe enjoyed our time and will be back in the near future.
