Ugh, too small, too tight, too crowded, and WAY over hyped and over rated. \n\nAnd the people there the night I went were rude! \n\nThe decor wasn't even that amazing. So many HK logos everywhere it was almost douche-y. \n\nAlso, the bathroom was hard to find!\n\nLets just say, I don't plan on coming back to Hakkasan in my future Vegas trips\n\nBut, I did have a good night overall because its the people you're with that matter =)
