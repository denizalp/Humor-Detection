Talk about an extreme makeover... they did an amazing job renovating the spot formerly occupied by Nagoya. What once was dark and dingy is now open, airy, and elegant. \n\nThe food was hit or miss. The light and fluffy crispy gnocchi had great flavor and a nice variety of textures. Unfortunately, that was the highlight of the meal. The tuna tartare was dominated by an acidic and fruity flavor. The meatballs stuffed with dates and bacon were ok but the sauce lacked depth. Then there was the octopus... I like eating octopus when it's slices or chunks of large tentacles. The version here is presented as 3 tiny, whole octopi. I can't say I was a fan. Too chewy even for normal octopus standards.\n\nThey do have a kid's menu, so that's a plus for anyone with a family. Service was great, but then again there was only one other party there.
