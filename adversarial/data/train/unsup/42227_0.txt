I'm new to the area and I was wanting something super specific. After stopping by shop after shop and having them tell me to look through portfolios and pick someone I liked, Love & Hate was the first and only shop to recommend an artist that would be best for the piece I wanted. Kye did an incredible job with my gangster otter and my experience there was one of the best. Clean facility, great environment, everything about this place is perfect!
