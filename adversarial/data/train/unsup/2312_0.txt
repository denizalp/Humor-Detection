This is another place I've walked by countless times but never actually bought anything. The BOGO sale caught my eye ($9.03 for 2 boxes of sushi M-F after 4:30pm). Purchased 2 boxes of jumbo roll (shrimp tempura + avocado + spicy crab), 1 box of crunch spicy salmon roll (spicy salmon + avocado), 1 box of blackbird (crunchy spicy salmon + shrimp tempura + avocado). \n\nSome things to note: \n- You can tell they don't have a ton of ingredients (avocado, tempura, crab, etc.)... and that's okay!\n- they have nigiri\n- personally don't think each piece is thin (it's a good size) \n- it's a bit saucy so hold off on soy sauce\n- will never pay regular price ($8) a box \n\nI was going to give this place 3 stars for being no frills and having decent sushi. But I can't burn the image of chewing on my final piece and pulling a STRAND OF HAIR OUT OF MY MOUTH. \nIt's short and I'm sure it belongs to the gentleman that rolls the sushi. \n\nI think I'll try other places in the path...
