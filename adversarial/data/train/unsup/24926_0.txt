Went in today with a group of friends who love eating poke bowls just as much as I do.  Wanted to give this a try since its closer than the other poke bowl places.  The exterior and interior is nice and clean.  Just like the other poke bowl places, the concept is the same.  Order your base, your proteins and add-ons.  I'll agree with some of the previous reviews about the rice.  Its not your typical sushi rice.  The rice was steaming hot and countered the coldness of my fish and add-ons which I did not find appetizing.  The fish got warm.  I had 2 scoops of Hawaiian tuna and 1 scoop of salmon.  The salmon seemed fresh, but some of the Hawaiian tuna was mushy.  I had them put on the shoyu sauce which didn't really give it any taste.  Being from hawaii, when I think of shoyu, I think \"aloha\" brand shoyu...not soy sauce like kikkoman.  I don't usually go for a lot of add-ons.  I stick with seaweed and crab.  Those were ok.  The price, as already noted is a bit higher than the other poke places ($2 higher for my medium).  I'm ok with the plastic bowls the food is in.  I just don't get the metal trays though...really not needed.  I'll probably stick to poke bar and ahi poke bowl for now until I can find something more authentic like I'm used to in hawaii.
