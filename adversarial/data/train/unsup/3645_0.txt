This is my favorite Boba place in Vegas hands down! I should've wrote a review about this place when I first came here in March, but everytime I'm there im too busy chillin' with friends or distracted playing games to do it! LOL\nCan't count how many times I've bumped into a friend there, just shows how popular it is!\n\nITS OPEN TIL \"2am\" too! \n\nJust a quick note, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE \"Dragonmilk tea\" and \"Bulgogi Fries\" \n\nAnyways, the location is honestly perfect to me. A pretty chill pad outside with multiple tables, even a swing set! Inside you got multiple board games, Jenga, etc, even a PS4 hahahah!\n\nAll the employees are friendly, even the owner says hi to me everytime I'm there!\n\nThey got free wifi, a HUGE parking lot, and it's super lit outside, feels like I'm home. \n\nI'm at Tea of Joy almost once a week, and I counted once.. I went 6 nights in row HAHA.\n\nWill be returning.. very soon!!!!
