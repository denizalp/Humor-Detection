So I decided on a whim that I would try this place out for lunch after reviewing previous Yelpers reviews. After all...my palate, I trust!  So I drove to the Howard Johnsons and navigated the extremely narrow driveway to park in the rear.  I then sauntered into the restaurant where I was promptly and warmly greeted by a man I shall refer to as \"Julio.\"  \n\nJulio promptly seated me and then asked me the cursory restaurant questions and I asked that he tell me what was good for lunch.  Julio said \"everything.\"  He then asked me about an appetizer and in typical Cuban fashion he spoke so friggin fast that all I caught was fried...potato...and beef!  So I said, \"sure.\"\n\nHe brought the appetizer out so fast I thought he may have pulled it off another table.  It was surprisingly very good and tasty.  I'd love to tell you the proper name but again, all I heard was \"fried...potato...and beef!\"\n\nThe waitress came and I ordered a chicken breast marinated in citrus and garlic covered with grilled onions.  She also spoke very fast and with an accent so thick that apparently I ordered an avocado salad as well.\n\nThe food came out rather quickly and the avocado salad turned out to be a fully sliced and pitted avocado and a very small plate of greens.  The marinated chicken breast was covered with grilled onions and served with white rice and black beans.  Needless to say, the food, although not what I had expected, was actually quite delicious.\n\nThe decor was very Caribbean themed as was the music.  In a nutshell, I'd promptly go back there again just to try something else off the menu.
