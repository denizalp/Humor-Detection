I have filed a complaint with the parent company that contracts with Nissan for repossessions. They entered a fenced area, broke into an attached garage and took my mother's vehicle that was inside. They didn't remove the personal items that were in the vehicle including garage door openers and medicine. She has been hospitalized for 6 months.  They also left the garage door open and allowed anyone to enter the house.  \nI called and spoke to manager Bill, but he told me it would be $450 to come down and get the personal items out. If I brought them the keys, he'd cut it in half to $225.  The vehicle has been in their custody for approximately 2 weeks.  I asked to speak to his manager, he hung up on me twice. The last time I called, he said that \"I'm the person he doesn't need to talk to\", and hung up the phone. \n\nI wish I could give no stars.  Complaints are being filed with BBB and local news agencies.  \n\nPlease call and share this post.  I want to let them know they can't do business like this.
