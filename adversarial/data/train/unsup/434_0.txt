I like this Costco gasoline station-- not all gasoline stations are equipped with pumps that can accomodate both sides of a car.  I learned this lesson a long time ago, but decided to add it on here, since it is a rare thing.  $1.999 per gallon for unleaded is the lowest I've seen (or was it $1.799?).  Not as low as what my sister has seen in a non-Costco station in Texas, though.
