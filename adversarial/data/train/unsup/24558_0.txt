Ive come to Phillys quite a few times and tonight was the worst. Jay---- the manager, was here tonight and a total douche. I bet he doesn't even know i know his name. \n\nAt any rate, how can you as a business owner, tell a person on the phone...\" We close in 45 minutes or so...\" Not to mention, it being 9:48p at the time of this call. Okay soooooo, do you not want patronage and revenue at your business for the next 45 min? We went anyway just to make a point.\n\nSir, Jay... You should not storm like a bull towards my table. You have to be a work, make the best of it. I don't have to be at work, so i really feel you! Next time, ask me for my ID. Don't say, \"you guys don't have your IDs do ya?\" Of course we do you fool, we came to a bar. Bottom line, if you didn't want to be here until close of \"10:45\" tonight, you should have staffed appropriately.
