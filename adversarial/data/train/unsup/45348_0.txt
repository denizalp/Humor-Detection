I love Dr. Widay. I had gone through seven vets before she actually told me what was wrong with my Susie. She was willing to listen and work with a specialist I found. She gave me eleven and a half years with Suse that she would not have had. Now she takes most excellent care of our Maggie for twelve years. Give her a hug for me and tell her Maggie and Susie sent you.\n\nMy Maggie just had her second knee replacement there. Dr. Haase is wonderful and the staff is always great.
