Came for Pokitrition's grand opening and braved the 2-hour wait to try their rendition of the famous poke bowl. I had eaten poke before in small bites but never as a full meal. As I will be visiting Kauai soon, I wanted to get a full serving of this thing everyone goes crazy about. I was absolutely blown away with the quality and taste at this new business!\n\nI ordered a poke bowl with marinated tuna, cabbage, seaweed salad, and sesame seeds drenched in sriracha aioli. In a word: heavenly! My wife ordered the same but with spicy tuna and I got to have a bite--equally as good as the marinated mix. For a beverage we bought a bottle of watermelon water, which is exactly as awesome as it sounds (water taken straight from ripe watermelons--none added!). My wife loved the experience so much that she bought an \"I (heart) poke\" tank from them for $10. Someone's a little excited for Hawaii next month hehe.\n\nThe staff was extremely friendly and welcoming during the duration of our wait and meal. It really put the cherry on top and made it a certainty that I'll be back for many more poke bowls (and wraps) to come!
