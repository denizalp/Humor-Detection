For many the concept of a sushi burrito is still new, but if you're curious definitely try it at this place. Compared to jaburrito I prefer this place if I'm in the mood for a sushirito. I like their menu options as they have better tasting options (in my opinion) and the portions seem to be bigger. If you're not in the mood for fish or don't eat raw stuff you can get your GAINZ on and get steak! Like other places you can build your own sushi burrito! Price range is usually $8-$11 per order! You can also get a poke bowl! Like the sushi burrito, they have premade options or you can build your own bowl. Prices for bowls are cheaper as they range from $6.50-$8. The only reason why I didn't rate it a 5 is that the bowls tasted kinda bland to me and lacked a little more flavor. It's not bad if you're looking for something simple. Besides that everything else was good! It's a bit small inside, but it's usually clean and the employees are friendly! They take the time to explain their options.
