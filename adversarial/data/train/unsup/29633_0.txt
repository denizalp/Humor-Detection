Josefa was fabulous to work with and we hit it off right away because of her great personality.  She was so easy to work with for the Akashic Records.  The whole experience was eye opening and solidified gut feelings I had had for years.  She has a graceful gift and she is very supportive in her coaching.  It was so easy to tell others of my experience and that they needed to work with Josefa.  She will always be someone I refer friends and clients to as she is able to put a person at ease so quickly!   If you are looking for validation and coach to hold your hand, I would always pick Josefa and her many talents!
