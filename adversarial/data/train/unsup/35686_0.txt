I really liked it.  Everything was flavorful, fresh, and thoughtful.\n\nWe had a variant of shrimp taco that was their daily special.  The tortilla was very corny, as it should have been.\n\nWe also had 2 quedilles, 1 crab, and one shrimp.  The buns were soft, light, buttery, and toasted nicely, and the fillings each had a lot of flavor.  The peas in the crab quedille were a nice and very welcomed touch.\n\nWe also had the shrimp n grits.  It was excellent - buttery, shrimpy, a little spicy, and just grity enough without being too grity.\n\nThe lime tart was extremely good.\n\nIt was a very pleasant experience, and we would definitely come again - and will!.
