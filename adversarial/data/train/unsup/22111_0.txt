Based on previous experience with an older car that could have cost me a fortune to repair I figured these guys to be honest mechanics.  (They recommended not to bother as the car would not be worth the expense and recommended I look for another vehicle).  I also loved the fact they offer a loaner vehicle.  \n\nI bought a used CRV and over one thousand dollars later and one repair after another (based on their recommendation) I was returning once again with yet another problem.  Sluggish performance and engine light turning on.  Got a call a few hours later telling me they changed the spark plugs and it would cost me $85.  I could have changed the spark plugs!  Why not just offer and let me decide?  \n\nThe CRV ran fine but about one week later, my car was performing sluggishly once again and when I stopped back in, they said they would need more time to \"investigate\" what was wrong. \n\nSorry guys, I am not a money tree and a mechanic friend recommended I try STP fuel cleaner for $5.00 at Walmart.  Did the trick and my car has been running great ever since (Going on 6 months).  Who knows how much this might have cost me had I left it up to their discretion...  \n\nThe fact you did not consult me prior to changing the spark plugs and the fact this sluggish performance could have been repaired with a cheap bottle of fuel cleaner caused this shop to lose my confidence and recommendation as a 'go-to' repair center.
