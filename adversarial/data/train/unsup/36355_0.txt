We stumbled on this gem when we saw a certain wine in the window back in December - then proceeded to look around and ended up filling our basket until it was hard to carry! We don't normally go to this mall but anytime we are in the area we make a stop just to come to MWM.  Since our first visit the selection of items has expanded immensely which makes coming in even more fun.  The prices are hard to beat - my husband loves the sweets section, he is well traveled and gets excited they carry items from places he's visited that you wouldn't easily find anywhere else.  I stock up on spices and other items for cooking and have had a lot of fun creating new dishes from the items I find here.  We try to purchase something new to try when we come in, this last time it was a pomegranate with basil seed beverage by the register and it was wonderful. The staff is also top notch, super friendly always a  pleasure to interact with.  The other side of the store has the most BEAUTIFUL clothing items and jewelry,  On our last visit I saw they do threading (and saw good reviews for it!) so our next stop I will definitely be doing that.  Highly recommend this store even if it's just to look around.
