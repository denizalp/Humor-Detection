We're here enjoying THE MIST AWSOME AHI SALADS ! This place goes the extra mile with courteous staff and I highly recommend getting off the highway and getting everything on the menu! I'm still eating but I had to write this review to share with the rest of the world ! Go here and come hungry. You will be glad you did !
