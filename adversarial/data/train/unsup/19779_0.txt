I'm a fancy-schmancy New Yorker (by way of San Francisco) so I can be a leee-tle bit snobby when it comes to food.  I just moved to Cleveland and I had been on the phone with NYC friends bemoaning, \"oh my goodness, I'm going to STARVE here.\"  Well, I'm happy to report that I won't be starving with Washington Bistro being walking distance to my house. \n\nI love the original decor of the place.  Unlike many good restaurants where you still feel like a pig at the trough with dozens of other pigs, just shoving food through your snout, the separate rooms of the restaurant allows for a more intimate and elegant dining experience.  Elegance aside, I love the crunchy-granola soul of the place.  The food is locally sourced and the lamb I ate was grass-fed.  And it tasted accordingly.  it was scrumptious.  And then there was dessert...om nom nom nom!\n\nIn brief, take it from this former New Yorker, Washington Bistro puts a lot of NYC restaurants to shame.  Cleveland does indeed rock!\n\nPsst!  I also hear they have this Wednesday night thing where you get good food for two and a bottle of wine for...wait for it, $40.  Guys, here is a date that won't break the bank but still have the lady thinking you're a classy guy.  Ooooh, yeah.
