La Diperie is a Montreal craze than now started sprouting new franchise locations including one located near to my home in Vimont.\n\nVisited on their 2nd day they were open and enjoyed what they had to offer! Staff is quite green and you could tell by how they spoke to you (shy\/unsure) and how long they took to prep our ice cream. The final product however was well presented and tasted great!\n\nThe selection of dips\/garnishing are aaaamazing, you can easily come back 100 times and try a new combination that may blow your mind. I went with their caramel sale and graham crackers... YUMMY!\n\nI understand the creme molee is dipped in a special dip of your choice as well as garnished with another ingredient of your choice but paying nearly $8 for a large cup is expensive. For soft serve that's a bit on the high side.
