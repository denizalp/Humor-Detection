This place is good. Just like the other poke places that opened up recently in last 6 months. Sorry but they are all the same to me, those 4 or 5 places, you know. (Oh, no no. I'm not including my Poke Express. They just relocated.)\nI had OG bowl. It was fresh and delicious. To me, it was more like \"chopped sashimi bowl with sauce\". If you are used to poke bowls in Hawaii, you would probably feel this way, too. Anyways, I enjoyed it very much :-) It was a perfect healthy lunch for me! As some said, I felt it's a little pricey side for the portion you get. (I'm used to Poke Express's price tho...)\nThe staff were very friendly and super helpful. \nI'm happy that place like this opened up close to my house (+1 star)!!\nI'll be back :-)
