Where are the negative stars? It seems when i come across this airline its nothing but trouble and bad excuses, ehy do we need such an incompetant airline to represent this country? Its so shameful, lack of customer service, intentional over bookings, delayed flights, lost luggage, and the list goes on and on. 1 star only for when they do finally fulfill their obligation to fly you from point to point they actually have a pilot to do so, other than that expect headaches and a minus 5
