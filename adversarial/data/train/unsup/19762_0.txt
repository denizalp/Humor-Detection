I love my LVAC.. The hardest part really is getting up and going to the gym but once I get there I feel like I can stay there the whole day! (well not really.. Haha) My friends and I would even joke about how when we run out of places to hang out at we can just chill by the juice bar seating area and talk story.. Lol. With all the equipment and classes offered I don't see why this place would get less than 5 stars?
