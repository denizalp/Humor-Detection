One of the most enjoyable Sunday Brunches I've had to date. It's advertised as \"Butler-Style Brunch\" or, American Dim Sum, I was a bit confused by what they meant until it was explained to us. Small plates that are brought around to your table by the servers, and you pick what you want. My previous experience at La Cave was great, the outside patio option, and the view of the pool, plus the food was excellent, made me anxious to come try brunch. \n\nA little kink in the service, we did sit for awhile before being offered a drink, after someone had noticed, we were started out with bottomless mimosas ($20 extra on top of cost of brunch) but it did include a variety of drink options if mimosas aren't your thing.  They included; \n\nBloody Mary\nCaipirinha\nMargarita\nMojito\nSangria (white or red)\nMimosa\n\nI liked that you are able to switch them up.\n\nTable side items inlcuded:\n\nHeirloom Tomato and Mozzarella Salad\nChilled Tomato Soup\nFresh Fruit Salad\nYogurt Parfait with Granola\nCornflake Crusted Brioche French Toast\nNY Style Egg Sandwich\nScrambled Eggs\nAngus Mini Burgers\nMushroom Grits\nBaked Potato Loaded Tater Tots w\/ Brown Gravy\nTomato Mozzarella Flatbread\nChef's Selection Ham & Egg Flatbread\nEggs Benedict with Chorizo, Canadian Bacon or Filet\nVeal Short Rib Hash\nPancakes with Berry Compote\nBacon and Chorizo Sausage Cups\n\nEverything we had was really good, but a few really stood out, I'm not a huge french toast lover, but the one served was by far the table favorite. I had 3 servings (don't judge, they're small). The mushroom grits and the Eggs Benedict Filet, oh and the Fresh Fruit Salad (sounds boring but it was outstanding) were  my favorites. \n\nI'm not sure if it was intentional, but we did wait quite awhile in between servings, not sure if this is to let you rest and digest before the next server comes around with items, but we did have to ask a few times for refills on our drinks and well as food. There seemed to be plenty of staff. Service wasn't bad enough to knock a star off, we really did enjoy our food. Already making plans to come back.
