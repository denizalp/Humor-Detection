Good hamburgers here. However last time we ordered to go and they wrapped hot burgers in aluminum foil so when I got home the cheese was non existent and the roll and  lettuce on the burger was mush and was pretty much non edible. The fries must have been piping hot too because they were mush as well. They need to wrap in paper or let the burger cool off because I had a very expensive bag of garbage!
