We are visting from out of town and wanted to take the kids somewhere to get their energy out. My kids are 7, 3.5, and 1.5.... I asked about the cheaper $5 admission rate for the little ones but then they would be stuck in a small area totally away from my other child. So I sucked it up and paid the full $11 a piece... When we walked in we were basically the only people there. It was DEAD - perfect. Being that my younger two are little, they lost their footing quite a few times, but would get right up and back to bouncing. The younger employee \"patrolling\" though was OBNOXIOUS with telling them to stand up. Their bottom would touch the trampoline for a nanosecond and he'd be telling them to stand up, over and over. I could understand if it was busy but sheesh, it was a ghost town! We'll be moving to the area in the near future and I'm sure will be visting more until then, but I'm not sure I'd come back. The facility was clean and your standard run of the mill trampoline park, but the 16 year old on a power trip was beyond annoying. With it being as dead as it was, it would have been nice to not have someone hovering over us the entire time telling them to stand up (literally as they were attempting to stand). A little understanding goes a long way.
