If I could give this place zero stars I would. Service was horrible server never check on us and had to wait for a  long time just to get water refilled. When I got the a refill she gave me room temperature water. When I asked for ice she told me to wait. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT. The deep fried sushi was terrible, it was way too hard and the chef was RUDE ( the tallest guy there). I will never go back there again!!!!! This Place is garbage !!!! I will would never recommend anybody to go there.
