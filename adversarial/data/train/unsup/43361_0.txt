4 1\/2 stars and reviews by people that I trust on here persuaded my wife and I to try Juan's. We've been twice now. The first time was on a Thursday night and the place was busy. But our second time was on a Friday night and service...well it was \"painfully slow\". When I say slow, it was so bad my 7 year old actually flagged down a waiter himself to ask for a drink refill. \n\nWe love the complimentary salsa and chips. And the first time we went we ended up taking some stuff home as we couldn't eat it all. But the second time I ended up sending my plate back to the kitchen as part of it was undercooked. And they had one of the most flavorless tomales I have ever had the misfortune of attempting to eat. I was so bad I spit it back out and sent the rest of it back to the kitchen. While it was taken off my bill my wife's enchilada was so flat and tasteless that she left it on the plate. \n\nLet me put it this way, when I asked my wife and my son if they wanted to go back the answer was absolutely not. Maybe that will change in time. I see the 4 1\/2 stars on here but I don't care what the star count is, when you can't eat the food and the service is slow enough to get my son to put down the iPad and flag down a server on his own....yeah, we're going to have to pass on going back anytime soon. \n\nOne more thing. I know it's busy on weekends. But when you walk in and get ignored and seat others who came in behind you first, you might want to rethink how you handle waiting customers. And the parking lot seriously sucks. The traffic going to In-N-Out across the parking lot makes it scary to get in and out to Juan's. 1 Star. Sorry but this is one star count that my family completely agrees on.
