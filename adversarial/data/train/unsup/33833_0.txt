In the context of fast casual dining, Burger 320 is as good as it gets. We are particular fans of the chicken & waffles. The chicken is moist and tender due to it being so fresh (the affable owner Mario sources all his ingredients from local farms). Also, no dry waffles here, rather they have a texture reminiscent of French cruller donuts, with a moist egg-laden open cell texture. I would suggest eating in rather than taking out as the hot freshness of all the food will turn to tepid sogginess in closed containers and a plastic bag. The garlic Parmesan fries are a prime example of this...perfect in store, but flaccid if brought home to eat. The homemade gelato & burgers are also of the highest quality, so it's pretty hard to go wrong here...
