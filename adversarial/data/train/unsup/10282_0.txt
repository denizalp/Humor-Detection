Not sure why this place has such bad reviews. I came here to see Dying Fetus, Thy Art is Murder, and Rivers of Nihil. The venue and sound quality are great! The layout of the venue is open and spacious. There is nothing blocking the view of the stage. Club Red also has a patio area where you can catch some fresh air or smoke (P.S. vaping is A-OK inside!). \n\nThe drinks are priced just right. I went with the drink special on some well whiskey for $6. The bartenders were nice and it never took too long to get a drink. The security staff were awesome, too. Oh and the bathrooms were clean! I literally have no complaints about Club Red. I would definitely come back here to see a show.\n\nYELP'S 2018 REVIEW CHALLENGE: #12
