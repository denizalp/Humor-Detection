How do I start? Soooo, the first thing that comes to mind is SKETCHY, straight-up hood, and 'Annie are you ok, are you ok Annie'!  This mall is so pitiful. It was so much potential. You are considered very ballsy if you visit this mall. Why is that? Dillards outlet is the BEST thing about this establishment. There is a Macy's, Victoria's Secret, Foot Locker, Bath and Body Works. So those are the \"high-end\" stores... ;-)  Then there is K-Momo, Wave, BBB Fashions and everything in between. This place has yet to fail to entertain me. It is not well-kept; do not have any expectations when you go.
