The Encore Lobby Bar is exactly what it's name is, it's a bar inside the Encore Lobby. We came here to get a light snack before dinner and were really unimpressed. First it was extremely over crowded and hard to find a place to sit. There's no one standing at the hostess table to sit you down, you just gotta find a spot and take it. \n\nWe were ignored for a good 15 mins before someone finally came to give us menus and take our drink order. And the waitress wouldn't stand for longer then 5 seconds to answer any of our questions she would just rush off right away. \n\nSo our enormous meal comes to the table, lol just kidding it was food for a ant! The portion of the salad was seriously a joke. I'm not kidding when I say the salad was smaller then the palm of my hand, two bites of that thing and you're done! My friend for the sliders and was happy with it. I don't recommend you come here to eat, just get a drink! \n\nService here was so slow and not very friendly I won't the returning.
