One of the prettier outer appearances of FreshCo with glass panels as the side, located in a fairly busy neighbourhood. \n\nFreshCo is one of the budget grocery stores, so definitely a great location to live near to do some inexpensive grocery shopping. The inside appearance is decorated similarly to other FreshCo's, a little dim, but clean and painted walls. \n\nTheir grocery section is a little small, but because it is located in DownTown Toronto, it's a fair size. They have a decent frozen section that is always stocked!
