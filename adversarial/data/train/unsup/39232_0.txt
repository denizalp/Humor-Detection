My husband and I moved to FL from Stow, OH and this place is one of the spots we miss! The sauce and the meatballs are unbeatable. The staff is so friendly and it is the kind of place that you always feel welcome. I have never had anything on the menu there that wasn't delicious, but I am partial to the spaghetti and meatballs and baked pasta. You cannot go wrong with this place if you love Italian food.
