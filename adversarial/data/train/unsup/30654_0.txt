Always a great place to look for sales on brand named clothing, shoes, household stuff, etc... Huge selection of stores to choose from!  It's also indoors. Some stores you don't find in the other Vegas outlets.  I would say they could have better food selections.  There's also a huge carousel for the kids! Although It's a little pricey if you ask me.  I believe it's $2 a ride! Right now there's quite a bit of construction goin' on & it seems like it may start looking like the other outlet, which is outdoors.
