This is located in the heart of the New York\/New York.  A good location to bring kids, granted it's a money suck.  They have a variety of games, even some cool interactive games (@$5\/play).  That said, about $50 covered the family for a fun hour of entertainment.  They lack some of the newer games, but they have a decent enough variety. \n\nThey have several games that give you tickets, which you can redeem for prizes.  You would need to spend a small fortune to get a worthwhile prize, we walked with a whoopee cushion, and a little rubber duck.  \n\nI'm happy to report that I remain the family Champion on Ms. Pac-Man.
