I came into Yak's Fitness as a Local, but I've been out of state for school since I was 18. Annual contracts and boilerplate contracts are always preventing me from working out at a nice facility whenever I'm home. \n\nIf you're like me, look no further! This place doesn't have the long gimmicks and the empty promises of the regular gyms around the valley.\n\nThe owner, Chris will sit down with you and help you find the right membership for you. He's super patient, jovial, charismatic, & keeps the facility clean.\n\nHe understands the needs of his clients and trains doctors, dancers, and Cirque de Soleil acrobats & has the best equipment i've ever worked with.\n\nNot one single machine has an \"out of order\" sign. And there's also a cute juice bar!\n\nCheers!
