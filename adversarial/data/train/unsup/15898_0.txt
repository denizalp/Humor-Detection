i never thought that one of my favorite mexican restaurants would be in OHIO. especially since i live in California, but momocho serves a \"modern\" version of the traditional cuisine that i have not yet tasted in SoCal. i've had something similar in NYC, but the flavors at momocho are a bit bolder. everything on the menu is FRESH which is part of the appeal. \n\nthe margaritas are TDF. they only use fresh juices and they are not overly sweet. i recommend the margarita tasting menu since they have so many fun flavors and they ALL taste good -- if i had to choose, my fav is the SPICY MANGO marg. \n\nGuacamole -- fun and unique blends like goat cheese, crab, smoked trout, habanero, etc. \n\nempanadas -- the crust is light and flaky (not dense like most empanadas) and they are filled with fresh seafood. \n\nTacos -- the meats are super tender and flavorful. all the meats it taste like they have been marinating and cooking for days... ones to try PRIME RIB, DUCK and PORK BELLY. the carnitas were good, but the other 3 had more rich \/ earthy flavor\n\nCorn -- they also have the corn on the cob with cotija cheese, paprika and a creamy white dressing. it's a little on the sweet side (for me), but still very delicious. \n\nDessert -- i had high hopes for dessert, but thought it was okay. i tried their version of bread pudding. i would save my calories for the savory items.. but my friends did try the dessert empanadas and they thought it was heaven. \n\ni'm definitely obsessed with this place, so much so that i'm trying to plan extra work trips to CLE just so i can eat at momocho again :)
