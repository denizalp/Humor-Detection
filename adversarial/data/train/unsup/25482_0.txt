I have watched all of his magic shows, even re runs. I brought my parents to see him live because my Dad has wanted to see him for such a long time. I'm so glad we came. Even with being live, we still can't figure out the magic. What I loved is that he makes the audience a part of his show. He is so wonderful at what he does and he is so sweet. We were able to meet him after the show. We will be going back again. Wonderful for the whole family.
