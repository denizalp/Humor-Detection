Watched them from when they first started. So happy we got to see them perform and got to meet them back stage. Even though the meet and greet was short and they don't talk HELLER they are the Jabbawockeez and that's their M.O.! We got lots of pictures with them. \n\nLoved their show... these guys are amazingly talented! And they have wonderful greeters to...
