Pink Box oozes creative flavor combos and truly reminds me of its distant cousin -- Voodoo doughnuts located in funky Portland, OR.  I would dare say they are just as good as my frequent visits to Voodoo. Wacky flavor combos include Bacon Maple Bar - Fat Elvis - Key Lime Pie- and all sorts of other off the wall concoctions. Bacon + Doughnuts- really? It works. \n\nWhen we went to pick up the 2 dozen for an office party earlier this year - we truly couldn't decide on what we wanted. The gal working the counter eagerly helped pick out a variety for my office party to accommodate everyone. She defiantly provided a solid sampling of several different styles and tastes (jelly\/cream filled and your traditional cake style doughnuts). As I suspected, they were a big hit in the office. \n\nAs I mentioned above, these are fun to pick up for clients or coworkers. My coworker stopped by my desk today and was asking about them - which prompted my review. We were scoping out their Instagram page and the craving hit us.  I will be swinging by tomorrow to pick up Christmas treats for the office. No Christmas cards needed- pass out Doughnuts and weasel your way into being the office sweetheart ;).\n\nWe want to sample their seasonal doughnuts - which at the moment includes Eggnog--  A Santa face doughnut - A Reindeer doughnut- and candy cane doughnut- all that will delight kids and adults alike.  It's something unexpected and my coworkers go BANANAS for them. I can't wait to try their new flavors and will post updated pics at that time. \n\nIt is always fun to watch everyone sample difference flavors and enjoy learning about which doughnut was what. Clearly, I'm a fan and would suggest giving them a whirl to curb your sweet tooth when it strikes!
