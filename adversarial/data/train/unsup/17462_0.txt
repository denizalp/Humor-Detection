This place screams Hong Kong. Every time I visit, it reminds of my last visit. Everything here is straight to the point, no frills, no 5 star service(not even a 3 star for service but it's expected), no golden utensils and fancy china, no fancy decor....well..except for that beautiful fish tank. LOL. The point is they don't need any of that to be authentic. They are as authentic and genuine as it comes. Just absolutely great food at an affordable price.\n\nThey are quite adventurous with their food despite their no frills approach. You will find very interesting combinations...ONLY if you can read Chinese (that doesn't include me :( . They have almost a limitless combination of stuff they can cook with off-menu items plastered all their walls and windows.\n\nIf you want absolutely tasty and geniune HK style food and some of the experience then this place is a must visit. You should bring someone that can read Chinese for the full experience.
