Since I'm *almost* the duchess of this AJ's location (watch out Ben B), it's time for a review...\n\nAJ's is the definition of a high-end, gourmet grocery store... As mentioned in most of the other reviews, their produce is gorgeous, their food fresh and delicious, and their staff friendly and helpful (for the most part).  This seems to be my go-to spot lately for a lunchtime sandwich or a quick snack.  \n\nMy pregnant belly has been craving the vegetarian delight sandwich quite often.  (Lettuce, tomato, cucumber, avocado, provolone and I add honey mustard).  Try it... i bet you'll like it!  My pet peeve is that sometimes it gets really crowded and the wait is pretty long.  Other times it's not crowded at all but the deli staff is not so attentive.  Just something to work on, I guess... And I don't mean to be picky, but when I request a certain kind of wrap (whole wheat for example), and I sit down to eat and see that my sandwich is on a tomato-basil or spinach wrap, I'm not the happiest camper.  **If you are going to change up my bread choice, please tell me in advance!\n\nAside from my minor pet peeves above and the high prices, I do love AJ's.  Their chip selection is awesome and so is their bakery and flower shop.  Oh, and don't miss their salad bar either.  Or their cheese or prepared-foods section.  (I could go on and on).  So sure, you'll spend a pretty penny if you go, but it is a pleasure to shop at this and most of the other AJ's locations.
