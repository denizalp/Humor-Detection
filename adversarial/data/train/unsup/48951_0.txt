Excellent, fresh sushi and good value. Perfect for picking up (they have a counter of pre-packed-sets-ready-to-go or you can call and order in advance). The restaurant isn't much to look at on the outside and the hours seem touch and go though - last time I went on a Friday evening and they were closed. Regardless, definitely would go back.
