It's hard not to give Sakana five stars when the nigiri fish to rice ratio is so overwhelming that you could wrap the rice with the fish. Yes. That's how much fish they give you. Of course, this would mean nothing if the fish quality wasn't also very good. I realized last night that it's the perfect ratio. I enjoy sashimi, but I couldn't do all-you-can-eat without requesting a bowl of rice. At Sakana, I felt like I was eating a long cut of sashimi with a little bit of rice attached for good measure.\n\nThere are a couple things Sakana does that are a little different. First, they serve uni in basic nigiri format as opposed to gunkanmaki (I found that on wiki); in other words, they don't wrap it in nori. That's not a bad thing. Second, rather than give you a whole salmon kama, they serve it up as bite size portions. Not necessarily a bad thing but worth noting.\n\nAYCE sushi dinners are usually a blur. Rather than try to list everything I remember enjoying, I'll just refer you to Tony T's photos. And of course, I cannot forget about dessert. They have the staples like mochi and tempura ice cream, but I decided to get the less common Green Tea Panna Cotta and the Black Sesame Blanc Manger. Both were a great way to cap the dinner.
