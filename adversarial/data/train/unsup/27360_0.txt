Me and a few of my girlfriends came in the other night for girls night out, I ordered the sirloin which was cooked perfectly (as usual)! This was my first time at this location and I am so glad you guys opened one up closer to my house. Texas Roadhouse is one of my favorite restaurants. Ashley W. was our server and she did a fantastic job, she greeted us with a smile and gave great service. I'll be back in soon!
