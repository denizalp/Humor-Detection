Yeah, they have the same tremendous selection of fresh fruit, vegetables, meats, cheeses, seafood, nuts, oils, sauces, chips, dips, prepared foods...as every Whole Foods. \n\nYeah, it's spacious, the staff is friendly and knows what they're talking about, and on Wednesdays it's $2 less per pound at the prepared food bar.\n\nBut the reason this Whole Foods rocks is because even though they also have a huge aisle full of every type of generic 365 brand cereal you could imagine, they also have Honey Nut Cheerios. \n\nAs every grocery store should.
