Been here a handful of times just for a drink.  Today's visit was my first to actually eat something. \n\nJust finished the Color Run 5K in DTLV. Because of Hennessey's was open and one of the first stops after the finish line, this place became the post-run hang out.  At least 75% of the guest were covered with orange, blue, yellow, and green.  This tavern is fairly big, but today's seating was limited with the amount of runners\/walkers from the Color Run. Service today was just okay, not like the the great service that they usually have. \n\nI didn't drink on this visit but got something to eat. My meal was just chicken tenders and fries. I wasn't in the mood for anything heavy and the chicken tenders hit the spot.  Taste is just average. In fact, I think I could have gotten the same thing at Carl's Jr.  However, I'm not complaining. As long as I can eat, I'm a happy camper.  \n\nToday was just one of those off days for Hennessey's because of Color Run. I've been here before and the ambiance\/service has always been top notch.
