I celebrated my birthday here and was looking forward to trying the wonderful looking food I've seen posted. I even picked out the most popular items (of course, according to Yelp) and took my server's recommendations. However, I expected my taste buds to have a party that night, and it fell a little short.\n\nOverall, it was a good dinner. Service was impeccable. From beginning to end, their staff worked perfectly together to make sure we enjoyed our experience. Water were always refilled, our emptied plates were cleared immediately, yet they didn't hover or rush us. Very friendly. We really couldn't have asked for a better wait staff to serve us.\n\nWhat did we order?\n\nCrispy Taquitos - Yellowtail & Lobster\nRib-Eye Robata Skewers\nMiso Marinated Chilean Sea Bass w\/ Purple Sweet Mashed Potatoes\nPeruvian Corn\nSamba Strip Roll\nBobo Brazil Roll\nRosca - donuts\n\nThe best tasting dishes for us was of course the Chilean Sea Bass. It was good enough that we were a bit disappointed that it was such a small serving size. Two small skewers. Peruvian Corn was also a hit. However, the sushi rolls were well presented, but lacked much in flavor. The rib-eye and taquitos were decent, but as I reiterate, all pretty to look at, yet nothing came close to being a wow.\n\nSetting is very nice, the restaurant is nice set up to accommodate large parties as well as couples. Bar serves food and offer happy hour drinks till 7pm on weekdays. \n\nI definitely appreciated the complimentary birthday dessert, the Coco Duo, which was sweet and yummy. Photos are available of all items I listed here. \n\n3 stars for now, however I'd definitely give Sushi Samba another try. Maybe the wow will come later...
