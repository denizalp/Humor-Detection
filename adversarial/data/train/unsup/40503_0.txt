Our friends brought us here-their favorite Chinese restaurant. We tend to agree: the whole place looks clean(including the restrooms-a big plus), nicely furnished, service pleasant, all the dishes we tried were unique by itself and tasty at very reasonable prices.\nHighly recommended!!\nDefinitely will be back to try their other dishes.
