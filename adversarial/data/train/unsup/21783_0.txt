Oh, Bagel Cafe. I've praised this place for its delicious sweets that are proudly on display. Too bad dining here was a disappointment. \n\nEveryone seems to brunch here on the weekends, so the wait can be up to 20 minutes. Not a problem, because staring at the dessert case is the best form of entertainment.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were seated at the very back of the restaurant, which I don't believe is ideal. I felt like we were left there and forgotten about until staff members came by to ask if they could take our extra chairs, and if they could use our table to hold dirty dishes for a few moments. I didn't mind at first, but this happened several times.\n\nWe were both first-time diners, so we didn't know that the menus were the newspapers shoved in between the condiments and the wall. I ordered the spinach and feta omelette with a side of whole wheat toast and a medley of fruit. Water from the feta leaked out from inside the omelette. \n\nOur waitress forgot our corned beef hash, which we looked forward to trying. She took note of our order once again, and disappeared only to return 20 minutes later with our check. \n\nI might return for the sweets, but never again for an actual sit-down meal. So much for that corned beef hash.
