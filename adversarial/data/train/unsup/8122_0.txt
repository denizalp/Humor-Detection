I feel like a big fatty rolling out of here after I eat my weight in food. It's just that good! I'm a fan of all things Mediterranean and I've always been pleasantly surprised at how delicious MBFGR's food is. I particular like their hummus and gyros and I also really love their Greek french fries. Who doesn't enjoy a good flaming cheese!? I was especially surprised to realize how good their baklava was because I'm never a fan of baklava. However, they do something delicious to it and it made me a fan. This is definitely a good stop along the Mill Ave circuit and especially during happy hour when their pricing is practically a steal.
