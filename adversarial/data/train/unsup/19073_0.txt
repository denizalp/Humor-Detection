Never again.\n\nOh, I totally get the lure of the extra leg room and personal tv's. But let me make it clear. Those tv's, they charge you for it.\n\nBut that's not what has got my panties in a twist. \n\nFlying LAS- SFO and it's sardine city. Everyone and their mom has a rolly bag. Simple math, not everyone's rolly bag will fit in carry on overhead storage. So they start making announcements that people should check their rolly bag dimensions to make sure blah blah blah.... I just went through this with the same exact rolly bag 2 days prior and it fit no problem so I know it will fit.\n\nFast forward. I'm boarding....\n\nThen I'm not.\n\nIve been pulled from the line to check my rolly bag. I plead \"but it fits I was just on this plane'. The robot tells me that she doesn't understand why it doesn't fit now but it must be checked. i smell her bullshit. Simple math. Too many rolly bags. Some must be checked. If they aren't checked willingly then staff must make up assinine stories to force the checking.\n\nFUUUU Virgin. I don't like riding virgins anyway. Unsatisfying and not enough fun.
