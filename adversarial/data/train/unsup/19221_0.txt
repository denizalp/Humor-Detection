As one of the Las Vegas bars featured on the hot Spike TV show Bar Rescue, I really had high hopes coming into experiencing this bar for the first time. Unfortunately, it seemed to me that a lot of the improvements made to the bar can be chalked up to TV magic. Sure the bar clearly went through some changes for the better, but it seemed to look a whole lot more flattering on my television screen. The bathroom was a dump. Several beers were out of stock. From the outside, the place just doesn't appear to be a bar despite the large mural painted on the outside wall by the entrance.\n\nThe place is a dive bar, I get that, but there's just not much too it. The bartender was pleasant enough and was on top of refilling my glass, but she would not stop mentioning what time her shift ended. It was as though her customers were getting in between her and her freedom from working behind the bar. Other than that I did not get a chance to sample any of the food and may go back to do so and perhaps update this review.
