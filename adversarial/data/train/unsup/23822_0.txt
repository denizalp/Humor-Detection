This place is great for kids. My mom has a usual stylist, she likes her and this location. I however live by 2 rules.. 1, if the stylist's hair looks like crap, they are not touching my hair! Or my daughters! 2nd, never get you're hair cut anywhere the words \"great, fantastic, super..\" Are in the business name. \n\nSnooty, nope. I just like to know a stylist with a bit of experience is cutting my hair.  Not fresh out of school. And these warnings have come from stylists! \n\nSo if you want a basic quick cut, this is your place. If you want an amazing cut and awesome service, see my reviews for Athena.
