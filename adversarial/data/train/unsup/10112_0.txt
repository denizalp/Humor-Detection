If you are looking for a chill place with great, stiff drinks and excellent service, you have to come to Downtown! Seriously, this place does not disappoint. \n\nI've been here a couple of times when visiting Vegas. Both times I've been here, we struggled with the door. Both times the bouncer was inside laughing and greeting us in. He seriously has the best attitude, so it really doesn't bother me looking like a fool for a few minutes. The drinks are absolutely worth it.\n\nAs soon as you walk in, you will notice the dim lighting and the loud, but not obnoxious, music. It's beautifully decorated and gives it a lot of character. There is plenty of room to sit both near to the DJ and in the back. There are sofas as well as booths with tables where you can kick back to enjoy your drink and have a conversation. \n\nWhen you approach the bar, the bartender will greet you even if he\/she is busy. Anything you order will be awesome since they don't really hold back on the alcohol. For the quality of the drinks, they are very much reasonably priced.\n\nAnyhow, if you are looking for a classy, more tranquil ambience away from the craziness of Fremont, I absolutely recommend Downtown. It's mellow and a great experience when in good company.
