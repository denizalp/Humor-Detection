This is my favorite grocery store. Quality, healthy food and reasonable prices! I love the selections and staff is very friendly. If you can't find something ask for help! The staff really knows they're stuff! \n\nSome of my favorite items are the following:\nBerry yogurt shake, heirloom tomatoes, various nuts (I make my own trail mix with almonds, cashews and pistachio nut meat), coconut oil spray, the moisturizer (I no longer use the expensive stuff from the dept store, I've turned all the girls in my life onto it) \n\nThey have a pretty good selection of wine and cheese. \nAnd a lot of gluten free choices. \n\nThere's almost always free samples in the back of the store along with coffee.
