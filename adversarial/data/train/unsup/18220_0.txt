*Definitely not hipster enough to understand the allure of this place*\n\nIf you are a fan of order and rules, this place is not for you. I'm still trying to find the line. \n\nMy friend and I went after class for coffee and breakfast, so we ordered two caramel macchiatos and two cinnamon rolls. \n\nWhen we ordered our drinks, which every other coffee place in the history of coffee knows how to make, the barista rudely informed us that it wasn't on the menu and they don't make it like that. If I wanted attitude, I would've gone to Starbucks. \n\nAfter the coffee debacle, we asked to have our cinnamon rolls warmed up. And OH MY GOD! You would've thought that we were asking her to climb Mount Everest! The barista threw the BIGGEST FIT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. \n\nLong story short, I'm still trying to find the cinnamon for the cinnamon roll and get the burned coffee taste over my mouth. \n\n**Currently en route to Dutch Bros.**
