Cockroaches in the ice machine on floor 7. Told housekeeping but heard nothing more about it.  The worst part is we did not notice it until the bottom of ice bucket and been drinking from it all night. Lid was on ice bucket all night so could not have crawled in. Got up next morning and roach is floating in ice water.  Again nobody was concerned enough about it to call or even apologize. The housekeeper who came to clean was only concerned as to whether it was alive or dead. No apology or concern.\n\nOther than that incident the new rooms are nice. Still wish u could get a coffee pot in room but they have to push the Starbucks on two floors and new one coming in the casino.
