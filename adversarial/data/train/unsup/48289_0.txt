This is the second Review that I am doing. As far as I am concerned this is the only place here in North Las Vegas to get your car serviced. I now have been coming here for 4 years and the service and customer service is outstanding. The Manager (John) went far and beyond what I expected. He explained everything in detail and the cost to do this work on my wife's car. In fixing the car it also took care of a problem that I had when I bought the car and now it fixed that when they put the job back together again. The car runs better now than it did when I took it out of the Showroom Floor. My Wife and I are so excited and pleased to give them our cars for service. Thank You John and all the Managers and workers there for a job well done.
