I took my wife to enjoy a romantic dinner and some live entertainment for our anniversary. Lovely ambiance, food was great, and the band was excellent. We were not the only ones celebrating... \nThere was a hot mess of a 50 something mother who thought she was as young as her youngest son who was (let's hope) at least 21. Who after a little bit of pre-game with her coworkers, she showed up after the band had been playing for at least a half hour. \nThe celebration of a 50 year olds birthday would have been fine if she wasn't dancing around with her newly gifted tambouring. She was so loud and annoying that even the acoustic band kindly asked that she stop. We had to leave before my wife had put that tambouring in an uncomfortable place for her.\nDon't worry we'll be back!
