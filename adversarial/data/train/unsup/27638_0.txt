Mediocre at best. It was certainly nothing to \"write home about\".  We made special arrangements as there were several couples. I called ahead to talk with management about what time frame to allow as we were attending a play and needed to eat and be to the play on time. When we arrived the place was all but empty. We all received water immediately.......then drinks after 15 minutes. It was another 30 minutes before our food started to arrive.  Nothing that anyone ordered \"extra\" was right. I waited another 10 minutes for dressing that I ordered when I ordered my food. We were running so late by then that we all just wanted to eat and get going.  I asked for a box as there was just not enough time left to eat. I also told  the waitress that we were in a hurry as we had theatre` tickets. Several minutes passed and we could see our waitress on the other side of  the restaurant taking orders from other tables.  I finally stopped one of the other waiters and asked for a box. After asking our waitress for the second time about the checks she went back to get  them and came out and then walked with all our checks to yet another table to talk with customers.  We could see her standing with all the folded booklets of our checks and making no rush to bring  them over. After and hour and forty minutes we were finally ready to leave.  With mediocre food and bad service I know none of us will want to go there again.
