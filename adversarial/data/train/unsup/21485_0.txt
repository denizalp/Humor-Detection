I'm glad I was able to experience Phantom before it closes down this weekend. I love the music from Phantom of the Opera, so I would've been very content to just close my eyes and listen to those fabulous voices bring the music alive.\n\nBut take my word for it, keep your eyes open and enjoy the action and the story line of the Las Vegas version of the Broadway play Phantom of the Opera. The special effects were outstanding. The music and singing was spectacular. Although I wasn't a fan of the grave yard scene when they shortened \"Wishing you were somewhere here again\". But overall, I thought the story moved very quickly and was entertaining. In other words, you weren't always checking the time to see when the show was going to end. \n\nI brought a couple of rookies with me that have never seen a theatre production. They were blown away and really enjoyed themselves.
