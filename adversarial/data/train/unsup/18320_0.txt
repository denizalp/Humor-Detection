I'm not sure why no one has mentioned that back in the olden days this location was fantastic.\n However the city built up around them and it's not dark enough to see the movies! The equipment hasn't been updated since the 70s, and the sound was so bad we had an impossible time hearing our movie over the other two.\n The cost is terrific, and the snacks are snacks, nothing to great or awful.\n Maybe it's just me? Several movies I've seen after they are released on DVD and finally got to see what was happening and hear some dialogue.
