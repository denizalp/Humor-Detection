I don't know why people are giving this place such a bad review. We are visiting family in town and came here to eat. Yeah the inside of the restaurant is nothing special , but the staff is super friendly and accommodating. The portions are HUGE seriously.  One dish could feed like three people. I got the Sicilian pizza it was very good. Can tell its made fresh and you can see them preparing it and sticking it in the oven. The pizza sauce was good not great. But the crust was unbelievable. I loved it. My sister for the toasted ravioli with cheese, it was good also. My cousin got the chicken parmesan sandwich and it was amazing and huge !!! The bread they give you the garlic bread is worth it to go there just by itself. Salad was regular nothing special. I would definitely recommend this place. They have huge cannolis awesome and I'm always a sucker for cannolis. Go and eat here , you'll love it !!!
