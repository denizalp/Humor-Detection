as a former employee i can tell you that this school is not the greatest choice when it comes to law schools. i asked many many students their take on the school and they all said they were going to transfer out after their first semester. most said that this school is a temporary school, they get their feet wet here and then transfer out to asu or university. as for working for them, i can honestly say that it is very mismanaged in many departments, and when it comes to getting access to this place every semester is a hassle. your key cards always have issues, and their asshole facilities manager tommy brown is never in his office and is very apathetic to your needs, so if your key doesn't work then good luck trying to contact or finding the man. then on top of that, if you chose to go through the front lobby the guards at the front desk never have the info. they need to successfully do their job and grant access. i always had a issue if i forgot my badge or misplaced it. the worst part for this place is the fact that the turnover rate with teachers and professors, even the turn over rate for students is astounding. the students expressed to me that their biggest frustrations with this school is not knowing if you'll have a consistent professor for the ride. this place is just very mismanaged. the only positive thing i hear from the students is the connections you make, and that's about it. but there are some great faculty members there but most are very two faced. they are currently cutting a lot of corners right now, and trimming the fat. i mean the school has potential but i don't think the school will last the test of time. so beware if this is your choice in law school, and just plan on it being a temporary gig.
