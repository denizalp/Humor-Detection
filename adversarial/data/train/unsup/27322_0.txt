This farmers market is a lot bigger than the one on Thursdays at Gardens Park. There are all types of vendors from vegetables and fruits to jewelry. There was a tent that sold kid things like a batman\/superman interchangeable cape which my daughter wanted and of course I got for her. She looked so cute and had it on the whole time we were there. They also have a couple of food trucks and food tents so it would be a great idea to take the kiddos down there since the park is right next to the farmers market. Most families bought their groceries and let their kids run around. I bought some kettle corn (YES, KETTLE CORN), ate and watched my daughter burn off all the pent up energy she saved from being stuck at home with her papa. She'd play, come and eat then play some more. The vendors were for the most part friendly. There is a few who were very insistent like the honey guy. Definitely check this out on Wednesday night!
