The experience wasn't at all too bad, but it wasn't great either.  We had about an hour wait, which is expected for Cheesecake Factory.  \n\nThe FRIED MAC AND CHEESE IS TO DIE FOR, which is expected and normal.  The shrimp franchese pasta is deliciouss too; however, I had them add in the veggies from Evelyn's Favorite Pasta.  Skip the small plate side salad.  It's nothing special or delicious.  \n\nThe service was a little on the disappointing side.  The main courses came out before the appetizers and one of my friends didn't even get her food.  We waited 20 minutes before she even got her sandwich, if anything she should have gotten it first before our food.  I know its the not fault of the waiter, but the kitchens.  However, it took us 15 minutes to get the attention of the waiter.  The waiter was slow to get our drinks and refills as well.  \n\nThe restaurant got 3 stars only because of the pasta and fried mac and cheese.
