NOTE: This review is not for the food, because I left without eating.\n\nThe reason I did not eat was because of the following scenario.  We were all starved, and walking home from the nearby Smith's when we saw Sarfino's.  I love pizza, so we beelined in.  The place was completely empty, and the only two employees were two extremely unclean looking guys behind the counter, which was pristine clean and stainless steel.  While I was standing there, deciding what to order, I pulled out a wet-nap to wash my hands with, as the guy stood at the counter watching me.  I then approached the counter, and put my purse down to get out my wallet and tell him my order.  \n\nHere's the bizarre part: this weird employee took out a ballpoint pen and proceeded to *draw* blue pen ink all over my freshly washed hand.  I was annoyed, confused, and unhappy with that.  Im not sure what he was trying to do - flirt with me, or just be an ass - he certainly accomplished the latter.  At that point, after I got my speaking abilities back, I told him to cancel my order, as I'd thought the better of ordering from his establishment, and we left.  \n\nThere are a lot of far better places in town if it's pizza you seek.  My advice is to avoid this joint, in spite of the glowing recommendations I see, because the guy in there gave me the serious creeps, and the place didnt smell like pizza. Ive always been taught that if you go into a pizza place and it doesnt smell like pizza, its best to leave.
