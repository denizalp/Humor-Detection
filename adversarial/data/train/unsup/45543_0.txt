Absolutely shit, spring rolls taste like they were cooked in a plastic bag in the microwave, crab ragoon was tasteless, potstickers were hard as rock. Basically it was all frozen tasteless food that I will have the joy of dealing with the aftermath, and for the owner that decided to to tell me that it was my fault and then hung up on me in the middle of the conversation, only to have one of his employees speak on his behalf when I called back..... pathetic waste of life and space you are. To the employee that took the call thank you for being the adult over that child that you work for. Totts you get 1 star minus 4 stars you spineless snake.
