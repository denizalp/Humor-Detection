Chipotle was okay. I must say food is prepared fresh daily. I ordered a steak rice bowl with the white rice steak and corn salsa. it was yummy, but the amount of food was very little. I am not a big Eater and I ate the whole thing. Also had chip and guacamole.  very fresh with huge chucks of fresh avocados inside, nice and creamy.\nThe salsa was very fresh as you could get the Chuck mild one medium or the hot and spicy one. \nvery simple menu to selected from. You can have it in a taco style, burrito, or rice bowl style. \nI must say that the food was very well prepared, but wish it was a little more hearty for the value that you pay. If I was a big Eater I still would be hungry or hungrier later on.
