Visited for new year's eve for a $108 tasting menu. Atmosphere and service was good. Food was mostly good with some dishes very good like the bacon filled waffle and others not much taste like the calf sweetbread. Some dishes although tasty, in my opinion were off season like the icy shrimp which would be more suited for summer. But that's the chef pick so I guess there's some good intentions behind it. Wine suggestions were good. Our table was next to a wall that had serious insulation issues, we had a steady stream of cool air directly on us and our food. I have always hated eating while worrying my dish is getting cold. Most dishes were cold or temperature so I guess that was not a big deal here but still pretty annoying. I intended to give it three stars but the rest of my party agreed it was more like a four, so four it is.
