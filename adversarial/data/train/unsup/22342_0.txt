Who doesn't like Ethel M? Who brings little gifts to those you will visit while traveling? I love Ethel M and I do love bringing little gifts to my friends and family while visiting them. I also like a little snack on the plane!\n\nI have stopped in to this Ethel M Chocolates on various occasions before traveling to pick up a mini box or chocolate bars. The chocolate is always great and so is the staff. I am not sure if the prices are any different than the main store but it does not really matter if the quality is good and you are running low on time! This store is not open 24\/7 like Hudson News so depending on the time you are there, you may be standing at the closed gate in a very sad state.\n\nYummy stuff matters!
