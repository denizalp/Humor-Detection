You will pay more for admission to the baccanal than it takes to fill up your car's tank. You will wait an hour to get in line and then another half an hour when in line waiting to be seated. It is worth it!\n\nAll I can say is that I ate my weight in steamed crab legs and then got up and asked for more! Best crab on the strip; the rest of the food was awesome, too. The only part I didn't enjoy so much was dessert, but I'm not sure if that's because I was feeling pretty miserable after eating too much or if the sweets were legitimately not as good as everything else.  \n\nI tried everything except most of the sides- I was a woman on a mission and had no room for fillers, aka, veggies. I don't remember it being very vegetarian friendly, either. I mean, there are vegetarian options, but nothing nearly as appealing as everything else. \n\nIf you're like me and seek out buffets for the crab, this is your place. I ate at 2 other buffets offering crab legs in the same week and nothing compared to the baccanal!
