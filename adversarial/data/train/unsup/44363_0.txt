Great sushi, atmosphere, staff, and service.  Deducting one star for the purple rice, although I really wanted to love it.  It was just harder, maybe they could've made it a little more moist like the good japanese rice.  Definitely will go back.  Make sure to sit by the sushi bar, you get \"gifts\" from the chef ;-)
