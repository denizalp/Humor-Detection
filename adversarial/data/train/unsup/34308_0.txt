This place makes amazing cheese cream caps!  Every time I get it, it's delicious and I am never disappointed.  I recently tried their Korean stuffed cakes, the center has a runny egg and cheese so yummy it's such a nice blend of salty and sweet from the cake batter and the cheese.\n\nOnly took off one star because the wait time is long when it gets busy; so be prepared to wait a while for your order, he works very hard to get everything done though!
