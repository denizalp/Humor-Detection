It's been a few years since I've been here and I am happy to report it's gotten a little better. Most things are edible at least. We arrived around 10:20a on a Saturday morning, which was cutting it close because breakfast ends at 1030. Still, we were able to get some last minute breakfast items before they removed them. Saturday breakfast and lunch are the same price ($8.99) with your players card.\n\nFrench toast, pancakes and scrambled eggs were solid. Bacon and sausage were good, but the turkey sausage was hard as a rock. Fresh fruit was a hit or miss, but the canned fruit was fine. After 10:30 they shut down pretty much all the stations while they got lunch ready. Lunch started promptly at 11. I found that many of the lunch items were not good. The alfredo sauce, for example, was really lumpy which is never a good sign. The chicken picatta had a gelatinous sauce on top of it which was very off putting, and the fried ravioli were luke warm. Considering lunch had just started you would expect the items to be in good condition and HOT. The salad bar was fresh and the Mongolian station looked promising, although I did not try it. The desert bar was a winner. Fully stocked with various pies, cheesecakes, cookies and gelato. Honestly this isn't the worst buffet I've had and I would likely come back here, but probably for breakfast only.
