Found this spot in yelp and didn't disappoint! \nWe ordered the steak fajitas and a combo with some pozole!! Everything was great and had such a good flavor! Usually most Mexican restaurants give you chips with salsa... Juan's flamings went all out and also besides the chips and salsa we got  with  grilled onions and peppers, bean dip and another green salsa!! The best!!
