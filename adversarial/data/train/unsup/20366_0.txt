I visited this location for my birthday dinner based on an article I read on a local blog. The restaurant is beautiful and the staff was helpful. However, the food was just \"okay\". For as much as me and my guests paid, I expected to be \"wowed\". Decent portion sizes. The chicken and dumplings were not what I was expecting. Salty, the chicken was dry, the dumplings seemed like they were just pieces of cornbread. Also there was an issue with splitting the check which we were not made aware of previously. All in all, I don't think I'll be returning because the food above all else, wasn't anything special.
