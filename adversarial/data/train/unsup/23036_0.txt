This was my after-after hours bar after being on a bender for 4 days with Adam Sandler's cousin and some guy from the band INXS (they were on tour with that new singer I don't like). Needless to say we needed a change of pace from our wild time spent in the bathroom stalls of Maison Mercer!\n\nWe met a few more friends outside and headed in past the cramped patio to some tables which were conveniently right next to the kitchen AND bathroom. What a deal! No one could possibly see my chiseled jaw from here. Anyway our waitress kept talking about all the things she was allergic to, I ignored this and ordered my first half priced cocktail which was some fruity thing (like everything I drink). I also ordered a chicken panini, ironically. \n\nThe first round of drinks came soon enough and were tasty enough. I downed it and immediately ordered another. This one was even fruitier. My agent kept skyping me so I let the waitress flirt with him while I ate my just-arrived panini. It was tasty enough but I wish I got the dipping sauce my friend got. Looked delicious. Anyway everything was pretty average and unexciting and the prices were a bit much for what you get. $14 for an okay panini isn't so hot. \n\nOur driver was waiting outside so I told the waitress to keep the tip and invest it in Zynga and snickered my way out of the restaurant.
