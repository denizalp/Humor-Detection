Big fan of this place. I work at the building next door and love coming in here for their healthy and actually really tasty healthy food. Their proteins are solid, but it's their sides that are what pack all the flavour. I've tried almost all the combinations and have never been disappointed. Only reason it's not 5 stars is because of the price, $17 for a lunch is a little too much for me. Pantry down at Rosedale has a similar offering with similar portions for cheaper.
