Being from East Side San Jose, I am fortunate enough to have an array of awesome taquerias to grub at, but this place is the BEST taqueria ever! Thanks so much to my homie, Ruben for showing me the epicness that is Tacos El Gordo. Luckily, the first time I entered with the homie, there was no line so ordering and getting the food was almost instant. However, when I came EDC weekend, the lines were out the door! Nonetheless, this food is totally worth waiting for. The stuff that I have tried here include: Al pastor tacos, al pastor quesadilla, and a half order of carne asada fries.\n\nThe al pastor meat is seriously the best al pastor I've ever indulged in. The meat is super tender, juicy, well marinated, and overall awesome. I love the nice little crunch the outside of the meat has from the rotisserie cooking process. The al pastor tacos also get some toppings such as cilantro, onion, and a creamy sauce. As for the carne asada fries, the portions are huge. A regular order can feed about 4-5 people and a half order can take care of 2-3 people. The fries are perfectly crisp and are covered with delicious carne asada, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and some other sauce...drool worthy deliciousness. Not only do they have epic food, but their drink machine options are unique and refreshing. I absolutely am in love with their Orange Bahng drink. Overall, this taqueria is the seriously the best ever.
