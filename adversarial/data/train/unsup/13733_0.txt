Okay, Yes, I'm another teenager who hangs out at Southpark Mall, BUT I actually buy stuff and do more than crawl around Abercrombie looking trendy. I ate here 2 days ago with a friend of mine and I was shocked at the prices. Now I understand, Southpark is for the premium crowd, but its a bit insane to charge 15 bucks for a pasta dish. My friend and I ended up ordering children's pizzas (6 bucks for 4 microscopic pieces of mediocre pizza, yay) and the service was very average, and continued to get worse with the less money we spent. Yes, I am a teenager, but my money counts also and I am their future customer....well actually, no, I will never be a future customer at California Pizza Kitchen.
