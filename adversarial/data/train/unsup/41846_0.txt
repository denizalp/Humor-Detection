This review is for the store and its wears and nothing to do with the orchard or petting zoo experiences. \n\nWe came across Albion Orchard by accident and what a happy accident it was.   Homemade jams, tomato sauces, pies and brownies plus countless other things, including the obvious produce one would expect from an orchard.  We bought a freshly baked cherry pie, brownies, two jars of sauce and two different jams, the former two we used for a big family dinner that night.   Unanimous:  best pie and brownies ever.  \n\nSubsequent to that dinner, we have used one of the pasta sauces and opened the strawberry jam and they were both so deliciously wonderful.   \n\nTo cap off the excellent products was the amazing service we received.    The woman who helped us was helpful, approachable and just seemed like the kind of person you want to sit down with over dinner or have take care of you while you are sick.  She even held on to the pie and brownies for us to pick up later as we didn't want them sitting in our car as we drove around on a hot day.  \n\nBuy up their pies and their brownies.  \n\nPs they are only open to the public from the end of Aug to the end of December.   I am definitely getting their desserts for thxgiving and xmas but will relabel to appear as though they are my creations.\n\nMore than fair prices and I personally would pay more for the quality they provide.
