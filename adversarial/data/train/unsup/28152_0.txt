The staff have been exceptionally friendly. When I approached the check-in desk, the associate came out from behind the desk to direct me to her position since I was waiting. She made friendly conversation consistently and made jokes. During my elevator ride, a bellboy made friendly conversation as well, all the while looking me in the eyes and smiling largely. On my way down the hall to my room, a cleaning lady standing by her cart 2 doors down rose her voice to say, 'welcome to the Sheraton', with a smile. Very impressive.
