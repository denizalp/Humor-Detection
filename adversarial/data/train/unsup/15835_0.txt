This place is ridiculous. There was a waiting list when we arrived. We put our name in and decided to wait the hour. Right on the dot the hostess called to say they could not accommodate us due to a party of 60. Why could they not tell us that when we checked in they made us wait the hour exactly and then decided to call and tell us. Then the. Douche of a manager came out after we asked for him and asked how our night was? Really. You're such a Schmuck. You should not be employed as a manager dealing with the public. I will not be back or ever recommend this place to anyone.
