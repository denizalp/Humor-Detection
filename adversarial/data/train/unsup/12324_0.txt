Honey Bear. \nWhat a great name. I wish I would have named my first son Honey Bear, or Cornbread J-Cool...something sick like that. \nI think that's where going into labor fucks most women up. \nThey're all like...\"Oh yeah baby, I'm down with Luciano or Vincenzo if its a boy... sooo very Italian.\" \nThat's in the nine months preceding birth. \n\nHave a little chat with her after she delivers...it's a whole new ball game.\nNow it's all, \"My son isn't going to have a name that sounds like some greaseball mobster, WTF is the matter with you anyway?\"\n\nWow.\nI don't know how I went down that road. I WAS going to tell you about Honey Bear's but I guess I'm still pissed my first born was named Dan. \n\nAnyway, the food here is pretty tasty. I like it because you can order meat by the pound which is all I ever do. I order eight ounces of barbecued beef, no bun and a glass of water..it's around eight bucks.\nThe service is super fast too, consuming about fifteen minutes of your lunch hour if you wolf your shit like I do. \nTheir sauce is flavorful too, you'll want to slather a boatload on your beef...kind of sweet and slightly spicy...good tang. \n\nAnd speaking of good tang, what better way to finish off the remainder of your lunch hour than by going to Band Aid's show lounge...just a block away on 7th and Virginia?\n\nA lunch hour chocked with tang.\nThe fantasy of what heights your son may have aspired to had you gotten your way...naming him Cornbread.\nAnd crop-dusting that empty cubicle with some major beef and beer farts around mid afternoon...sending that evil co-worker of yours into a catatonic funk upon her return from the ladies room.\n\nNow that's what I'm talking about.
