If you don't know Mexican or Chinese food, then you'll probably like this place. If taco bell and panda express are awesome in your eyes, then this is the place for you! lol I've been here twice and not by choice. (Trying to be open minded and a team player) Each time I tried something different and both times I felt like I wasted my money. The rice is very dry as if it was sitting out all day and night. Lacks flavor. The beans are straight out of a can. Nothing I've tried tasted fresh or authentic. Never again, even if it was free. Very sad.
