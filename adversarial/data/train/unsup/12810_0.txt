I wanted to give it 4 stars but the $6.99 \"silogs\" we ordered were nothing out of the ordinary.  The lechon was overcooked, probably just refried and reheated so It was kinda hard and not crunchy at all and the portions were soo small so I was kinda disappointed with my order.  The tinapa and milkfish were ok.  Service was good, they were friendly.  Place is really really small and parking is sketchy, so try to park across the street where u can see your car.    Overall, the silogs came out pricey because of the small portions.
