I decided to walk into Campechano as I saw on blogTO they have a cute little patio in the back of the restaurant. We waited about 30 minutes and finally go table on the patio. \n\nWe ordered:\n\nGuacamole and chips - guacamole was so fresh and seasoned well. The chips were fresh and not overly salted which went well with the guac. The other dip it came with was a bit on the salty side I think it might have been some sort of liquidity spicy salsa? I could be wrong. I would have preferred a more chunky salsa. \n\nThe tortillas for all the tacos were soft and held together well with all the toppings and sauces inside. \n\nCostilla - Rib Eye beef - Flavour was okay, it wasn't anything special in my opinion and had a nice kick of heat. The meat was tender but overall a little on the salty side. \n\nPescado - They give a very generous portion of the fish, it wasn't overly battered and was still light and flakey. Probably one of the best ones. It paired very nicely with the pickled cabbage and sauce. \n\nPollo al pastor - Chicken was tender and the flavours were good. The sweetness and tartness of the pineapples helped cut the spice and also the saltiness. \n\nCarnitas - The pork was a little on the dry side, which I didn't really enjoy. It was way too salty for my liking and lacked other flavours. \n\nBacon and mushroom one - forgot the name - The best one by far - the mushrooms were so fragrant and paired so nicely with the little bits of bacon. There was a nice light dusting of cheese and a creamy white sauce. Not your traditional flavours for tacos but very tasty! \n\nOverall I think many of the tacos were too salty. The place itself is really cute and very busy. Not sure I would go again as I feel like there are better taco places in DT.
