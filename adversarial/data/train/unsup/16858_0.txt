CAUTION SENIORS AND ANYONE ON MEDICARE!!!!\nDo not fall for the Humana ads saying everything is affordable and you'll get great service. NOTHING IS FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH! Every doctor I visit has the same opinion of Humana...they stink. They promise you everything, and deliver nothing. \nThey're a great plan...until you need something. Then all they do is come up with creative new ways to deny medically needed tests. My mother signed up for this plan and told me about it. This was before we knew about their lousy customer service.\nI have watched my 70 yr. old mother deteriorate since November 08. She has needed an MRI since then... Humana says she doesn't need it. She has a VERY arthritic hip. Twice Human turned her down because...GET THIS...she doesn't have a HISTORY of hip problems! Isn't that the most idiotic thing you've ever heard.\nPLEASE, PLEASE...AVOID HUMANA AT ALL COSTS. Maybe all of the insurances stink, but honestly we would all be better if Humana went out of business. And all their wonderful employees...I'm sure we could use smoe more prison guards or ditch diggers. The world needs them too...and they would actually be making a contribution to society.\n(By the way...my apologies to all prison guards and ditch diggers. I did not mean to demean you by comparing you to Humana employees)
