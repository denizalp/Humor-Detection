Sitting here and Julie is out server. There are maybe 6 tables occupied and we have waited way too long to be waited on. She is moving chairs around 5-10 minutes after taking our order and No drinks as of yet.... finally got the drinks. 2 drinks costing $32+ which is normal\/ average price for\nWhat we are drinking. \nEither the cocktail waitress doesn't give a crap or her bartender is Worthless...been over an hour since we paid for our last drink! \nGuess she took. \"Break\" from her busy schedule... \nSo... we were listening to our favorite band for almost 4 hours here and in that time we had 2 drinks and she came to our table 3 times total. It was never packed so it isn't like she was busy. Ugh...only come here if the band is awesome!
