Wow, this place was amazing! Ever had that thought when you go to an All-You-Can-Eat Buffet and you're friend packs mountains of food on his\/her plate and the only thing you can think of is \"O.M.F.G. SO. MUCH. FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD.\"\n\nKinda like that, but you order it.\n\nOne of the places I HAVE to go when I go back to Vegas!!
