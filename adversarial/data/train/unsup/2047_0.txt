I am just amazed at how fast it is here for takeout. I was ordering a pita platter and the souvlaki platter and it was barely three minutes from the time I paid until my number was called. Impressive!\n\nThe order was perfectly accurate and had all the appropriate fixings including tzatziki sauce, salad dressing, ketchup, cutlery and napkins. Well done.\n\nThe restaurant is clean, too. As is the parking lot.
