My trees look great. Time will tell with trees so I can't really rate it 5 star for another 2-3 years. We went with a tangelo, lemon, and peach tree for our back yard. Kyle was very helpful and knew what he was talking about. He also fertilized an orange tree in our yard at no cost. \nMy only minor complaint (and it's not that big of a deal) is that the free planting is slightly deceptive. The planting is free.... however, it's $100 to deliver the trees. If you agree to plant it for free how would you plant it unless you brought it with you? It's not the end of the world and it's very common with businesses these days but it still annoys me every time it happens.
