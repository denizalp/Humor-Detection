What a cute store! What a great place to take photos!! Snap Snap Snap!!\n\nEverything is so colourful here and interesting. So Japanese feeling as everything is so clean, so tidy, so polite and so expensive ....\n\nI will be broke if I going to stuffed myself silly with Sushi here... but eating that as an appetitizers does make this a special treat! I really savoury the experience.. cross examine my medium toro, scallop and sea eel..(what a pretty colour, what a nice fresh smell) before I put that in my mouth and chew  it slowly memorizing the taste and sensation before swallowing it... \n\nThe fresh fish they served here for sure makes me smile with joy and satisfaction making it a total experience.\n\nWriting this review now gives me the urge to go over there and have some sushi NOW!!\n\nThey accepts Visa and Mastercard!
