Just finished dinner and the food was awesome...could've used more fried onion straws on my burger though, huge portion of fries. When I placed my order I went straight to the soda fountain to get my Diet Coke, it was out =( I informed one of the guys behind the counter who a couple minutes later notified another guy, then after I had decided to just get a Coke Zero I informed the gal delivering my food. It was only right before I was done eating that the soda was finally switched over, I got my correct soda to take home with me...would've appreciated it happening right away as I know it takes just a few seconds to switch it out =)
