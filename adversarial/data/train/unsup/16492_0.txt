Check out Sally's Boutique, attached. You might find something your grandfather misplaced right after the Great War. Im serious. Great little antique cove. The rest of the store is typical SA. They do have a decent inventory of used furniture and knick-knacks. This is usually where I get my kitchen stuff. Great wooden spoons and steel carving forks and plastic ladles, many for as low as .25. \n\nGreat daily specials on colored tags and other requirements, call for details. \n\nNice people, too. It's always nice to see a smile, and I'm pretty sure you will here.\n\nThis place is A-OK. \n\nAlright Salvation Army, this next paragraph is for you: \n\n     for salvation's sake, please don't 'pull a Saver's' and raise your prices to an exponential level. I can't afford to shop there anymore, it's like a really dirty Neiman Marcus. For serious. People are frequenting your stores and buying your SECOND HAND goods because they, WE, are broke and need a few essentials once in a while. If there's an old couch that nobody wants, is months old and decrepit and just sitting in the showroom collecting dust, you might want to consider any reasonable offer. I watched a poor woman beg for a better price on a piece of junk sofa that had been there since much cooler weather and the clerk refused to hear her out. I'll bet ten bucks that couch will be there for another few months. Why get greedy? We're all just a bunch of squirrels trying to find a nut, Salvation Army included.\n\nOk, off the soapbox.\n\nI come to this location once a week whether I need to or not. I've found some great stuff, and I plan on finding much more.
