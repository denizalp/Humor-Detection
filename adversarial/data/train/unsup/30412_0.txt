I reluctantly give the Purple Perk three stars rather then four. On a few occasions something has been off. One time I ordered decaf coffee in the evening. When I asked for a refund because it was cold, I was told that it was because it had been brewed and sat around for many hours; not what I want to hear. So I recommend you order your coffee freshly brewed. The chocolate cake comes in huge slices and will satisfy a craving and then some.. - but, ask if it is fresh. They have some good desserts, snacks and meal items. It is a busy, buzzing place. I go occasionally.
