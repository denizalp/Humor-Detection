My Waffle House excursion was the result of jokingly saying \"Let's go there\" and then somehow being taken seriously. Literally feet from the front door and I was ready to turn around. In case you were wondering what happened to the cast of Dangerous Minds with Michelle Pfeifer and Coolio, look no further; I've found them. \n\nAfter about ten minutes of trying not to stick to the menus, our waitress walked over and said \"You ready?\" But I wasn't ready because I was too busy trying to figure out what on the menu couldn't be made by a five-year-old with an EZ-Bake oven. Everything is a variation of grilled cheese, except for the waffles which I daringly tried because the pictured portion looked plentiful and I figure, if I have to go to a Waffle House, might as well try the namesake. \n\nAfter what I can only imagine was five minutes spent microwaving a frozen waffle, I was given a plate of grid-like moosh and a plastic packet of butter resting atop it. I HATE when people put things that they've touched with their hands on my food, but at this point I just wanted to eat and leave before the utter disdain imprinted on my face upset one of the Wrestlemania fans sitting behind me.\n\nI can't NOT recommend this place enough. It's on par with Denny's in terms of pricing, but you don't even get what you pay for. And you might get stabbed.
