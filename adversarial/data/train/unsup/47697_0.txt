This place is unfortunately NOT closed. But... do NOT shop here! My friend and I stopped by to get some accessories for a zombie costume that we were making. We bought all of our costume and had everything prepared and all we needed was the accessories to our costume. We each spent over $30 dollars in fake blood, wounds, etc. When we got home we proceeded to pour the fake blood on our costumes that we had made ONLY  to find out that the it was nothing but BLACK ink. Needless to say our costumes were ruined 3 days before Halloween due to this store selling defective products. After realizing that they had sold us ink instead of fake blood we decided to check the rest of our products. We opened up some of the fake wounds and realized that the adhesive gels were rock solid and dried out, as were the fake blood that came with them also. We opened one of the fake blood packets and the poured out in little crystals because it was so old and dried out. Not ONE item we purchased from this store was in working condition. We returned to the store the next day with the receipt, everything packaged up how we had purchased it, and explained that every item was defective only to have the manager be completely and utterly rude to us saying that it was not his fault and he would not return, exchange, or refund us for the products. I understand no refunds, but at least let us exchange for a product that is NOT defective considering that this was how you sold the product. Do not shop here unless you want to throw your money away!
