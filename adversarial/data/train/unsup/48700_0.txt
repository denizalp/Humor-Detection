Decided to try this place with my friends earlier tonight. This tiny place has very good dessert. I had the hot plate with waffles and ice cream, first thing I noticed was this place was very simple in design. But their dessert is good where I can taste the matcha flavour in the ice cream instead of other makes. Also the waffle isn't too doughy. Wish they will increase the topic choices. Aside from that, this place is worth a try.
