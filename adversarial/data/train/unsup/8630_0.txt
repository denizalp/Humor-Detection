This spot has become the go-to for all of my beauty needs! A lot of attention to detail is paid and the staff really cares about doing a perfect job. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the nail polish selection is on point. Customer service is great, and there's a charging station for phones. I really have nothing bad to say about this place.
