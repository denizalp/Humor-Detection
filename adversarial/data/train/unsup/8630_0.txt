Locals-type diner for some Hawaiian fare, but mostly for pancakes that are a bit on the sweet side.  To be quite honest, IHOP fare might be comparable.\n\nPeople really like Babystacks, though.  Business seems good here.  The room was full.\n\nThe Red Velvet short stack was comprised of three extremely red pancakes.  Rather heavy-handed in the food colouring, even for RV.  Cream cheese syrup goes very nicely with them.  The combo tastes exactly like a Red Velvet Cake.\n\nIt was pretty good, light and fluffy... if a bit on the dry side for a pancake.  I prefer hotcakes with more butter or moisture in them.  Babystacks offers interesting variety of pancake flavours, including Carrot Cake.\n\nLoco Moco was tasty.  Poached eggs, cooked medium, were still runny enough over the meat patty and scoops of rice.\n\nPortions could be bigger.  Prices are low.  Service was alright.  Restroom was clean.\n\nI really wanted to like Babystacks a lot more, but it was just okay.\n\nMaybe stop in if you happen to be in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't necessarily make a special trip.
