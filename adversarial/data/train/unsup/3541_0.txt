Now that my kitties are in their golden years, I am more comfortable utilizing a pet sitter rather than leaving out the \"all-you-can-eat\" buffet.  I have used Polly's 4 or 5 times now.  Although I believe they have overnight sitters if you choose, I opt for a once per day visit ($22).  They try to ensure you have the same sitter each time if available, not that my cats have any interest whatsoever in bonding with said sitter.\n\nSitters are screened, bonded and insured of course.  A meeting with your sitter and prepayment are required the first time you use their service.  After that, you can schedule by phone or internet and just leave payment, assuming you leave keys with the sitter.  They require 2 keys, one for the sitter and one for the office just in case.  Visits are 30 minutes I believe.  During that time, you can request mail be brought in, plants watered, pet waste disposal, etc.\n\nThe sitters will leave a diary of the time spent with your pets and the duties performed.  They must be honest because the entry is the same every day for me \"both cats sleeping, Suzi enjoyed the attention, Jasper appeared thoroughly disgusted and would not purr.\"  Yep, those are mine.  They actually don't say anything negative.  They find some redeeming quality to compliment your pet on.\n\nI was a little apprehensive at first about having a stranger in my house, but I was put at ease immediately upon meeting my sitter who I find very professional and a true animal lover.  And when you think about it, your own friends and family are probably more likely to snoop through your crap than someone who doesn't know you anyway.
