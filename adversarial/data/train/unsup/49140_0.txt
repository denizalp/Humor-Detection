My husband and I can't say enough about the positive experience we had with the Marketline Mortgage folks. The entire experience went very smooth and quick. All of our questions were quickly responded to and we really appreciated the weekly updates sent to us. Even with a very challenging credit history they made things happen for us; they succeeded where others failed.  We would like to thank MM for everything they've done for us. We highly recommend this company to everyone.
