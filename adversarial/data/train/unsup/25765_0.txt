So, Im guessing this is authentic asian cuisine. Some items on the menu, didn't seem very appetizing to my Americanized pallet. (Pig intestine...) Anyway, we went here on Monday night. We were greeted sort of happily in the quiet restaurant. (Seemed liked it needed a healthy clean and remodel). Anyway...we ordered the steamed potstickers and beef pies for appetizer. Beef pies were like pierogi with a softer than wonton outside. They were a bit greesy, but my dinner guests liked them. The potstickers didn't arrive until after the other food arrived...annoying. But they were fairly good with their 'pate type' pork filling. (No sauce to dip in, btw). We then ordered the sweet and sour chicken, house special stir fry, and shrimp fried rice. SS chicken was terrible. It was so hard and crunchy, I could hardly eat it. My 3 year old son couldnt either. Although the sauce was nice. And my husband insisted it was pork, with the meat we could barely taste. The house special (beef, shrimp, chicken) was okay. I didnt try much. And the fried rice, super bland. It needed soy sauce or something! When asked if they had sauce on the side for it to add, they said no. They had no sauce. What??? Service was subpar and the meal was subpar. However, I commend them on how busy the restaurant got after 5:30pm. We must have misordered, or weren't too adventurous enough or something to find the gems of this place. So sorry we couldn't like it. :( Maybe we'll try again?
