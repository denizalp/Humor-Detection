If you've ever wondered what it might be like to lick the floor of a tasty, tasty forest, like maybe you were on some weird culinary foraging tour led by Willy Wonka, then you just might get your wish by taking part in this restaurant's Carte Blanche 20-course tasting menu in which endless magical bites are delivered to your table and that tasty forest to which I'm referring materialized as delicately fried lichen balls that arrived perched atop a single branch, and as I popped the delightfully crunchy hybrid of fungus and algae with a tiny dollop of cream into my mouth I began to wonder whether or not Yoko Ono dressed as a faerie nymph would emerge in a flourish from the kitchen to serve me a thimble of absinthe to pair it with.
