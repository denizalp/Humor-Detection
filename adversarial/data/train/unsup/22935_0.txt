When i was a kid, a long long time ago (well...not that long ago). My mom would take us to this buffet. I remember it quite clearly because it was like $2.99 for breakfast.  This was the first place I had pigs in a blanket and cream of chipped beef. I guess your taste buds did not develop until you are old enough to vote because I thought that this was the best thing in the world since sliced bread. \n\nIt is now the year 2010. WTF was I thinking. I would not feed this crap to homeless people. Nor would I box it up and send it to Somalia. It is for a lack of a better word, despicable. \n\nFIN
