Never have I been to a place that changed my perspective on vegan fare quite like Apteka. \n\nWe stumbled across this restaurant with some friends on a Monday night and there was already a line our the door about 9 PM. This place does not look like much from the outside but the interior is very relaxed, dimly lit and an intimate atmosphere for share plates and drinks I've never heard of. Instead of waiting in the line to be sat, we met someone pretty cool to share a table with that led to great conversation and a good night!\n\nThere was a live DJ at one of the tables playing some low-key background music but it was a nice touch.\n\nBut the real highlight of Apteka was the amazing food! Lots of good options and all delicious. Nothing lacks flavor and the pierogi's were the best vegan plate I've had! You'd be missing out if you didn't try some. YUM, I'll be back but check it out if you find yourself out this way!
