Decent ESSO compared to other gas stations in the area.\n\nBut there are 3 major drawbacks:\n\n1) They mix water in the windshield cleaning fluid. So when the temperature is around freezing or below, the windshield service is useless!\n\n2) Only pumps 1 through 4 which are right in front of the cashier's station are open to pump first-pay after 24hrs. The rest of the pumps are set to pre-paid between 10pm & 6am!\nEither open them all like Petro-Canada or have the cashier take payment through a stupid hole in the wall like at most Shell gas stations.\n\n3) Given its location at a major intersection and with the T&T behind it, it's difficult to get in & out any time of the day or night with the sheer volume of traffic, and be prepared to be cut off by rash & reckless drivers while you line up behind a car to pump.
