I bought a sectional from your store in 2012. After purchasing the sectional we had various problems with it. Some resulting in your technicians having to come out to make repairs only for the same problem to happen again. About 6 to 12 months ago, we noticed one of the cushions seemed to have had the springs go out. Then a few months later another seat completely collapsed. We could no longer even use it. Not long after we were at your clearance center and saw the same sectionals for sale there. We were told that the sectional had been recalled due to collapsing springs. I tried calling your store where it was purchased and was told by customer service there was nothing that could be done. Even though the employees at the clearance center told us if we contacted the store we bought it from, they were issuing full store credit for a new purchase as well as picking up the old sectional. I have asked to speak to a manager about the problem and they're never available to talk to me and i have yet to get a call back. It's been a month since the last time i was told i would get a call back. I now have a sectional that two of the seats cannot even be used. Im disappointed not only in the quality of the product i paid so much money for but i am also disappointed in the lack of concern over my problem from your employees. I also find it hard to understand why i wasn't informed of the recall for the product. I have loved my experiences at your store in the past but this experience makes me rethink where i will buy my furniture in the future.
