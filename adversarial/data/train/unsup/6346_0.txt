The COF made it soooo easy to tie the knot!\nThere was no anxiety or anything like that, just direct, prompt sercive.\nThe chapel itself was cute and quaint...\nNo one had an attitude...\n\nOnly issues, the limo was a bit late, but he called 3x with status updates (which was awesome).....and the minister was a little bit cheesy....he told James to buy me Tiffany's during the ceremony....clearly he doesn't know me; i buy JAMES Tiffany's!! haha :)\n\nAnyhow, it was great, and it was a lot of fun!!\nAnd it's pretty reasonable for having an actual wedding\/ceremony!\n\nI recommend!\n\nxo-\nandrea
