Still the best macarons in the world. \n\nI just ate 8 of them. \n\nDid you know that they are about 160 calories each? \nAnd did you know that they are about $1.65 each (depending on how many you get)?\n\nThat means that you consume ~ 1 calorie per 1 penny spent. \n\nThat is my tip of the day passed onto you.
