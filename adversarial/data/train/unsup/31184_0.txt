Dr Layton is the most amazing OBGYN ever.  I appreciate his caring personality, but in my opinion the thing that is really important are their skills when its game time.  \n\nHe has done 3 C-sections for me.  He is absolutely an amazing surgeon.  My scar is smaller and far nicer than anyone else's scar I have ever seen.  With each C-section he seems to make the scar look even better.   \nHe also had do a couple d and c's for me and was so great throughout the miscarriage process. I cant say enough.  Pick this doctor you will not be disappointed!!!
