Everyone needs to be aware of how HORRIBLE Pizza Vespucci really is. Although their food is okay at best, and I really don't understand how it has 4 stars on Google, the service I have had with them has been absolutely appalling and I feel the need to share so others do not order from them in the future.\n\nThe first time we ever ordered from Pizza Vespucci, we got two fettuccine alfredo pastas. They came and the Alfredo sauce was not Alfredo sauce at all, but a watery, milky liquid with noodles. Obviously upset, I called and told them the problem, they insisted we keep it as evidence for them to take back while we wait for the remade food to arrive (obviously not an issue to return the horrid food, who wants to eat noodles in milk water?)\n\nSo when the remade food arrives an hour later, it looks and tastes how it SHOULD have came the first time. Fine, consistent Alfredo, not watery. Manager called to tell me he made it himself. Awesome. Well, his employees should still know how to make food.\n\nRecently, even though we did have that experience, we wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and order from them again. Some places have bad nights, I can understand. But no. \n\nThis time, I ordered beef ravioli and my significant other just wanted soup. They FORGOT MY BEEF RAVIOLI. Actually, apparently one of the guys didn't even ring the ravioli into the order. But somehow they managed to remember to bring the garlic bread! When I called to complain, they asked if I still wanted my ravioli. No, I just ordered it for no reason...\n\nI'll never order from there again. It'd be easier to cook at five-course meal at home than deal with Pizza Vespucci.
