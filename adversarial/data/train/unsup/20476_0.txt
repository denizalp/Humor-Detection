ok, \nthis place is small\nthis place is pretty damn awesome if it were in l.a.\nbut vegas??\nkinda thought they would go all out!\nbut i still had fun\nhowever, they people i was with, did provide some high end bottle service so i guess i am reviewing from a different perspective.\ni would usually be by the bar closest to the dance floor,\nbut i guess to really enjoy this club, you have to do the tables.\n\nthe music, ,.... not bad\nit leans more on the girls yelling \"thats my song!!!! we gotta dance\"\"\nand every few minutes they'll throw in  that \"i haven't  heard that jam in  minute!\" when they just played baby got back or poison....\n\nbut every now and then.. they'll actually play a song that you'll really fall into and feel like you were in some nolstagic 90's moment. and that fun.\ni went from dancing to tribe called quest to the theme from  fresh prince!\nand it even  snowed bubbles in there!!\ni felt like such a princess!! i mean prince!\n\nkinda pricey i guess, \ni dunno i didn't spent anything that night\n\nbut looks pricey\n\nthey people were cool. ( our servers were hot!! i couldn't even keep my girl off of them!)\n\nif you can.. i'd suggest table service.
