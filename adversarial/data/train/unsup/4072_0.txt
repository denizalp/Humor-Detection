This family owned establishment is one of the best supermarkets I've ever shopped in. They have a large selection of meats, produce, middle eastern and Indian foods, dairy, fresh breads and desserts! Their customer service is top notch! They have everything you need! I'm glad that they have multiple locations so there is always a Baiz near me.
