I have yet to smell tinkle, but I probably will one day.\n\nI don't hate the bus.  It does what it does.  It puts down the road and for a sum of money, you can take it all over the city.  Sometimes it may be an all-day ordeal if you plan on going somewhere significantly far away, but the bus, she will get you there.\n\nBiggest complaints have to deal with the people who ride the bus and people who drive the bus.  Bus occupants and drivers alike can sometimes border on complete lunacy.\n\nI had a bus driver disallow me from getting on the bus because he had a grudge.  I forgot to put the bike rack on the bus up on the day previous.  I know that's a retarded move, maybe unintentionally dick.  I understand.  Tell me I'm an ass.  He told me I was banned.  I was like, \"What the fuck?  You can't do that.\"\n\nHe couldn't.  I rode it again (a sweet bus route.  best kept secret in phoenix, man) and he gave me this talk that if I ever left the rack down, I'd be gone... but he spoke to me as thought he'd never seen me before.\n\nI always feel slightly trashy having ridden the bus.  It does the job, but shit...
