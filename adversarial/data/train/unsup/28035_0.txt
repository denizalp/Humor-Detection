Had a great dinner out with friends here.  The atmosphere is casual and allows you to hear conversations at your table with ease.  The customer service at this location is outstanding. Although they don't take reservations, I used yelp to get on the wait list ahead of time and an hour long wait resulted in only a 5 minute wait once we all arrived at the restaurant. If you haven't used yelp for this,  you should because it takes the hassle out of going out to dinner during prime times!  Food here is always good and reasonably priced. Hats off to all the employees who make this place a great choice to dine.
