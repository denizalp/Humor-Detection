In the movie Cabin Fever, a hillbilly kid jumped off a porch, yelled \"pancakes\" and did some karate moves then bit a man's hand for no reason. That is the first thing that crossed my mind when I came here. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9U0-pOeioKY\n\nMost of the menu is pancakes and sweet things but one can enjoy a nice breakfast at a decent price. I went with the hash, sausage and eggs. It was a good choice. MC Young P let me try a piece of the bacon and it was delicious with a great smoky flavor. The coffee in a to-go cup is a great idea that more breakfast spots should offer. The restaurant can be hectic and crowded during the weekend. Townes Van Zandt said we are just waiting around to die anyhow so it should not matter much.
