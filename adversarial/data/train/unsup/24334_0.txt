I've already written a review of Petite Thuet for the 1 King West location (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/petite-thuet-toronto-3#hrid:WMRzBXIWyF-CFAz885evpg), complete with a glowing review of the Croque Monsieur (which I'm eating as I write) and this location has all the tastiness of the 1 King West Petite Thuet, with perhaps a littttle less variety (perhaps until they get more of a customer base) but all the essentials are here. \n\nMacarons, Croque Monsieurs, coffee, croissants, decadent pastries and a large collection of jam and preserved goods. A smaller dining area but they're targeting a take-away crowd in this area (like me) and it works fine. \n\nThe best thing about this location? While the staff at the 1 King West location have always been great, the customers at best can be a bit snobby, making the experience a bit strenuous. At this location I've experienced nothing but fluffy good vibes, which is pretty much essential considering they are the first place I go before I head to work. \n\nAll the best and here's hoping my waistband doesn't expand...too much.
