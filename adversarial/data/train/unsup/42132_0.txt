I took my mother for her 1st time visit. We were greeted in a friendly manner, the M.A and Dr. Banchik were great until we got to the Coordinator of the facility couldn't catch her name. When it came to having an option on how we were going to pay she told us Credit Care, which was fine; but she just logged in to the computer and not showing friendliness, customer service just walked out of the room. \nShe just said fill it out and submit it when finished and when we got the results she described in a plane manner what were our options. Im a huge person when it comes to Customer Service, just seems like she didn't want to there and have customers deal with themselves when it comes to making payment options with treatments. \n\n\nThank you for reaching out Mrs. Banchik and thank you for clarifying your concerns, privacy, among your clients appreciated.
