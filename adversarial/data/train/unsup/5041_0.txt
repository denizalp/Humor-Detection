Of course I had to go inside and try their goodies.  I have actually gone in there more than once.  Last time I was there, they had violet gelato,  I love weird flavors.  Their macarons are good, but I prefer the ones from another place, but if I am in this part of town I am not going to deny my sweet tooth.  Their chocolates are also very tasty.  My husband said that the coffee gelato has the best coffee flavor he has had anywhere in town.  I have to take his word for it, since I don't do cold coffee in any form.  The place is very nice, and spacious.
