**THREE SOLID STARS FOR THE SADDLE RANCH**\n\nWe met our group here for the party bus and enjoyed an average brunch which included bottomless mimosas. \n\nI personally drank 10.\n\nDidn't realize that there was a bull to ride. The ATM machine charged me $3.50 for the transaction fee which I thought was BULL. \n\nORDERED:\n\n*SCRAMBLED EGGS as a side - Tasted overcooked and sloppy.\n\n*BANANA NUT FRENCH TOAST - Not the kind that would make me jizz in my golf skirt, but it was OK. The bananas were not ripe and the flavors were meh. There were three slices and we finished two.\n\nWith the 10 mimosas, the day did get better.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this place for brunch. Maybe for the bar and the bull.
