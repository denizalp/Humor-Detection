This place gets an automatic 3 starts for not being a Pizza 73. \n\nHaving avowed never to willingly consume the cardboard monstrosities being passed off as pizzas from that oddly numbered establishment ever again, I opted for a \"John's Favorite\" from good ol' PJ's.\n\nDelivery time was adequate. Pizza arrived hot. So far, so good.\n\nIt was pretty good - much better crust - the added bonus of a little packet of garlic butter for me to toss in my gullet and a jalapeno that I always eat directly in front of any women present so they know just how manly and no-care ever I really am.\n\nPapa John's isn't the best pizza out there, but as far as delivery goes it's a pretty safe bet. Way above pizza hut, miles above Pizza 73 - but its no Atlas or Coco Brooks.\n\n3.5 stars.
