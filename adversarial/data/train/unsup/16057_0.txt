The two women working here were having a knock-down drag-out fight with each other complete with screaming and choice words including f-bombs. This with my three children in the store, and at least, two other kids all under the age of 12. It lasted at least 10 minutes and was firing back up when we were leaving. I've never seen anything like it in a customer setting. An old man finally came in from outside and said, \"Are you really doing this with customers in the store\"?  Yes they were. Unbelievable and unacceptable in front of my kids. I couldn't find a number to call, and if I did, I'm sure I'd get one of those imbeciles. Nice way to experience the dam.
