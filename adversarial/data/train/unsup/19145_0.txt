Quick update: I just have to give Hotel Indigo a shout-out for helping me this morning.\n\nCalled a cab at 8 a.m. for 8:45 pickup to the airport. At 9 a.m. I'm still standing around in the lower lobby waiting for said cab to show up, even after 2 phone calls. Suddenly an SUV pulls up and offers us a ride - in a non-creepy way of course, he was a legit service - so we can get to the airport as scheduled. Why? Apparently someone from the hotel saw us standing around and called the car for us. High five, Hotel Indigo.
