Decent and inexpensive pizza. I chose HH's because, well, they were in my credit card's rewards program and I needed one more \"dine\" before the end of the year. I've been past this place lots of times and never thought to stop because of Luigi's.\n\nToday I got a medium \"Howie Maui\" which is their name for the classic Hawaiian pizza with pineapple and ham. Well topped with plenty of both, it was plenty hot and it didn't take long at all. I do like quick service!\n\nAs far as the chain pizzas go, I would put Howie's ahead of Pizza Hut and far ahead of Domino's, maybe it's almost as good as Papa John's. But like so many things, pizza is a very personal choice. You likely feel different.\n\nIf I'm ever looking for a variety of pizzas for a party or a lunch, I think Hungry Howie's would be a good choice. But if I was just looking for a slice, I'd look to Luigi's.\n\nNote: Some people drive this parking lot very quickly. Be careful.
