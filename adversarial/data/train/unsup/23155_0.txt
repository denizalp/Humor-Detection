I recently hired El Cheapo Movers to assist with my move, and had a highly satisfactory experience from start to finish.\n\nMy booking was conducted quickly and efficiently. I consistently received prompt responses from their office (re: initial inquiry, confirmation of booking, etc). Everything aspect of the move - from time, cost, etc - was completely transparent.\n\nAs for the move itself...it was a dream. I was alerted 30 mins before their arrival, and they were on time. The movers were easy to talk to, listened to my requests, and asked questions when unsure about something (better to ask rather than act if your unsure - especially when you're stuff is involved). Really nice guys who did their work very well. Most importantly, my stuff made it in one piece, undamaged.\n\nBased on my experience, I would recommend these movers and use them again.\n\nA couple quick things to note:\n- A minimum of one hour's work is all that is required. Excellent if you only have a small move. To my understanding, many other places in Toronto require a minimum of two or three hours, so this is a plus.\n- They offer 5% off if you pay in cash and an additional 5% if you are a student.
