This review is based on breakfast alone, even if my meal was at 1:00 in the afternoon, it's Vegas, I'll call it breakfast. \nI've never been lucky enough to go to The Peppermill for dinner. By nightfall I'm usually off drinking too much rum and losing $. Dancing until my shoes are in my purse and a bouncer is yelling at me to put them back on. Fuck that guy! Well, The Peppermill is always there to save me the next day.\nI'm super hungover, sad to see daylight, sunglasses lightly placed on my sad nogin. My temples have a heartbeat. \n\"Table for six\"\n\"Name?\"\n\"Idiot\"\n\"It'll be a 30 minute wait, ok?\"\nNow this is not a sad story. All down trodden hungover, breakfast seekers can wait in the fireside lounge! You have to see the place to believe it. They should charge admission. A giant circular fireplace that's always on, even when it's 110 degrees outside. They have bright pink couches, blue super squishy carpet and enough mirrors to satisfy the Kardashians, all back lit by subtle neon. The place has some ambiance, ok? \nThrough a sea of faux cherry blossoms, the heroic cocktail server is there to save the day. YES! Lovely ladies in evening gowns serving cocktails at 11:00am on Sunday without judgment. I love drinking in the lounge while I wait for an amazing breakfast!\n\"Idiot, party of 6!\"\n\"Yay, that's me!\"\nThe menu is huge as are the portions. Be prepared to want a nap when you're done! I always get the steak and eggs. My husband gets the corned-beef hash with extra hash browns. I seriously dream about their hash browns! \nAll in all this place is awesome. Great service, food, drinks, at a reasonable price and a Vegas atmosphere that you won't find anywhere else on The Strip.
