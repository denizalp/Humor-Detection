This place makes me nauseous. We're diamond level and have stayed at almost every hotel on the strip. Our current experience here at Ceasars will be our last. \n\n- At VIP check in (which was a zoo), the gentlemen was very nice and gave us a comp upgrade. But when we got upstairs, our Non-Smoking room smelled like a disgusting mixture of smoke and vomit. We called down to change but they said they were full. They had someone come to spray the room - but when we returned, it smelled exactly the same. \n- Now 10pm, we called down again and the incompetent woman (Joanna) was completely unhelpful. She offered us a Pet-Friendly room. Why would a room that smelled like dog be better?\n- Someone in housekeeping just came again, and even he agreed it smelled gross in here. \n- Currently trying to find someone in VIP tell help us... \n\n- In addition, every bartender in this place has a real attitude problem. Dude, you're a bartender at a mid-level casino! I'm sure you want to be an actor or model, but you're not that good-looking! Please, get over yourself.
