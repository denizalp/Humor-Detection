This place is really cool and has some of the freshest Noodles in town. Just happened to be in the neighborhood and had to check them out. After all they have a dude in the back tossing noodle up and down and slamming them on a large table. You can see him through the kitchen window.\n\nThe menu here has a large assortment of different types of both noodle sizes and shapes. You can basically pick the type of noodle you want and they will make one of their tasty dishes to your specifications.\n\nInside is very nice with all the condiments you need right at your table. Some of the tables are bigger and can suport those crazy noodle parties that can spontaneously erupt.\n\nStarted with the Pan Fried Dumplings with dipping sauce. The plate was gigantic and could be a meal just by itself. Ordered the Seafood Noodle Soup with one of the larger flat noodles. Both dishes were delightful and I really enjoyed getting to doctor them up with their homemade hot sauce.\n\nSo many different things on the menu with several choices of flavors and textures. This place is really fun and a delicious treat. Can't wait to come back and try some of their other items. Hear that the Spicy Pig Ear is also very good. No Pun intended.\n\nLocated in the same parking lot as Lee Lee's. See ya there next time. MAGIC TAKES THE SHOT ... SCORES!\n\n4.5 STARS
