Not a very good experience.  The decor is boring and plain.  Our host\/waiter was typical no-personality poor service expected from a Chinese waiter.  Except for filling our teapot one time, no one asked about our food, if we wanted anything else, etc.  We had to ask for the bill at the end of our meal.\n\nAs for the food?  We originally ordered 4 dishes from the MENU. Three were not available.  We were notified after our order was placed that two of the three were not available (at different times I may add), requiring us to look at the menu three times to choose 4 dishes that were available.  We had shrimp cakes that tasted like crab, and pork, so were either very old or they just didn't want to come back and tell us the shrimp cakes were also out of stock.  The \"porkchops\" were salty, looked more like short ribs.  The only dish that was tasty was the green beans.  \n\nFinally, they gave us a family style bowl of rice without our ordering it.  $2.00 was then added to the bill for two orders of rice.  Since they did not charge for the hot tea, I paid without complaining and my party did eat the rice.  The total for the rice and 4 dishes, two of which were only vegetables was over $61.49.\n\nI would not recommend this place for ambiance, food, service or price and will not be returning.
