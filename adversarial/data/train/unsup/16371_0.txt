Hummuslicious!  A new word in the Webster Dictionary.\nDefinition: A delicious, scrumptious, tongue licking, mouth savoring dish made by Bunky's Cafe.  \n\nHummus has basic ingredients but everytime I try Bunky's Hummus it is always better than anything store bought, hands down.  We picked up Bunky's last night for Concerts on the Square.  Fantastic grilled lemon chicken, baba ghanoush, pita bread, salad with a tangy salad dressing, grilled flatbreads and a perfect finale of baklava.  \n\nCan't wait to go back and enjoy the rest of the menu!
