I was invited to dine here for lunch as media and liked it so much I will be planning to come back for a personal Christmas dinner with my friends.\n\nI tried the Baja Fish Tacos for my appetizer, Butternut Squash Ravioli for my main and Caramel Chocolate Mousse for dessert. For drinks, I had the Signature Sangria and Moscow Mule. \n\nThe Ravioli was my favourite and had a strong taste of truffles from truffle butter used. So if you don't like that and are allergic to seafood, maybe choose another dish. I spotted a lot of people trying out the burgers (huge btw). Fish tacos were also big, pretty filling and a good dish to pick if you want to save $$ for some drinks. Lol. The Caramel Chocolate Mousse is very sweet and has bits of spongey toffee in it. \n\nFor drinks, I have to say...I LOVE the Sangria! It has a shot of peach bellini which makes it so delicious!! I could drink a pitcher of it....you know, spaced out within a couple of hours.  Haha. The Moscow Mule is also a good alternative if you don't really like sweet flavours. It has ginger beer in it, which always makes for a refreshing taste. \n\nInterior is really nice. They even have a elevator to get to their rooftop and in winter will blast all their ceiling heater vents on so you don't even feel the cold. If it's a concern, they make it wheelchair accessible to get up there and for washrooms too. Really like this place. Haven't experienced any of the service issues some are talking about but I will update after I have my dinner.
