I was craving some fried chicken, and I hadn't been to a Church's since I was back in Alabama a few years back.  I signed up for their app and they instantly provide you with coupons.  The coupon was for 4 chicken strips, small fries and a biscuit for $3.99.  Not bad...not bad at all.  I drove down, got my food and took it back to work.  Here is how it was...........\n\nChicken Strips-  They were very tasty!  Church's uses a real light batter but it's still plenty crunchy and tasty.  My chicken strips were a little uneven though.  I had 2 giant strips and then 2 super skinny strips.  I guess they evened each other out, but if you got all 4 skinny strips, that would suck.  I got some honey mustard and honey BBQ for the dipping sauces.  They were both really good and worked well with the juicy chicken strips!\n\nSmall Fries-  Crinkle cut.  Salted well.  They were alright.\n\nBiscuit-  My favorite part of the meal.  Church's kind of dips\/glazes their biscuits in honey.  They have a slight crunch when you bite into them but then they are soft in the middle.  They are kind of in the shape of a large macaroon cookie.  The biscuit was very good!\n\nService was extremely fast and friendly.  Not sure how often I will be coming back down here, but if a chicken craving hits, I could definitely see myself coming back.
