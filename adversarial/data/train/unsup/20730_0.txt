Like: Great entertainment! Interactive dinner-show for a great price. There's a discount code for 'residents'. I forgot what the code is, but I'm sure you can google it. \nIt's definitely something different than your expensive Vegas shows on the strip. MCs are super witty. Facebook interactive. They take photos too, which I think is fun to see what shots they might've gotten of you. \n\nDislike: I got the chicken, and I did not like it at all. Food quality is bad. Get the tri tip-probably the best option from what my fiance got. I got the chicken and didn't like it at all. It's away from the strip so a taxi ride will take time and money. Location is in the older and sketchy side of town. DO NOT walk there from the strip-taxi driver said we would get mugged for sure.
