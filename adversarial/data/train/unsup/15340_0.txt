The place to go in Vegas for chicken rice! \n\nHainanese chicken rice is one of my favorite things to eat. EVER! It's a dish I grew up on Thailand, and to this day reminds me of being there. Yes it is more associated with Singapore than Thailand, but trust me there's many versions of it all over Southeast Asia. In Thai we call it khao mun gai, which literally translates to oily rice chicken. It's not commonly found in Thai restaurants, and when it is, it's not usually great. The chicken rice at F&F is pretty great. Chef Sheridan Su has perfected the rice! There are several options for the chicken- Traditional steamed\/boiled chicken is what I prefer and most commonly served for this dish. He also offers fried chicken in the form of chicken strips, and roasted chicken which is served bone in. \n\nI have tried all three and I enjoy all of them. I still prefer the traditional number one the most. And I definitely recommend adding an egg. There are several places around that country that strictly serve chicken rice, and this is one my favorites!
