We called ahead to see what the wait was and were told no wait. Great, especially since we had 90 minutes until a show at The Pressroom. Our group of 4 was sat quickly but it took about 10 minutes for our sever to stop by for drinks. 10 Minutes later we were able to place our order. 30 minutes and a second round of drinks later  the server realized the kitchen hadn't even started preparing our order. She was great about it and offered us a complimentary dessert. At this point we only had 20 minutes until we had to leave for our show so she sent the manager over. He asked what the problem was and if we still wanted our food since it was ready in the next minute. Sure, we want our food, we ordered it right? Our plates came out staggered over the next few minutes. The sea bass was undercooked and the prime rib was a little rare for our liking. \nWhen we commented on the meal, the manager simply stated he'd put a discount on the ticket but didn't offer to cook the fish a little longer, that it was cooked to medium (even though it was obviously raw in the center). \nOverall, great drinks and we'll go again for happy hour if in the area but not wasting time for another meal.
