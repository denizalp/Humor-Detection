My girlfriend and I wanted mexican but also wanted to branch out from our beloved stand-bys (Guadalajara, Jalapeno, Mestiza, etc) so we thought we would try the crazy little donkey.  Trust me, even a crazy donkey would not eat here.  \nAfter being seated, we opted for guacamole and chips.  Knowing that this was a small family place (with a food truck downtown), I was expecting a great homemade guac with cilantro, red onions, etc.  Nope, not even close.  The guac tasted artificial and was whipped to a strange almost mayo like consistency.  It definitely was not homemade and either came out of a container or a dry mix.\nSince we were foolish. we continued on our dining journey and ordered a half pitcher of margaritas.  We were excited to see that you could choose from Don Julio, Patron and other tequilas but that excitement quickly dissipated when we were told they only had rail tequila. Thirsty and still foolish, we went with the rail option.  Right when we saw the margarita, we knew we were in trouble.  It glowed bright neon green and was so sweet, it took only one sip for us to know that we would not have another.  Imagine the worst margarita mix you have ever tasted and then think about what regret would taste like if it had a taste.  Yep, that is how bad it was.\nSo bad, we promptly asked for our check, paid, and left.  One chip with guac and one sip of margarita equals an absolute train wreck.
