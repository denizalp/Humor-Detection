Went in to have service done on my A\/C. Just needed a recharge. Been taking both of my cars here for 5 years. Didn't see regular crew around so had to talk to a guy I hadn't seen before. Some POS with gauges in his ears decide to be argumentative with me. Wanted to correct everything I said. I'm 59 years old and don't need some POS talking down to me. Got my key back from him and left. That's the end of me dealing with Pep Boys. If they can't treat their loyal customers better than that, then I'll take my cars to Firestone...
