I can't believe all of the negative reviews on this place. THEY'VE BEEN OPEN A WEEK, PEOPLE! CHILL!  Yes, there is a bit of a wait. Give these guys some time and I'm sure they'll run a tighter ship before long. I have been here twice and have been happy both times. The people that work here are all very friend and nice. I take onboard that it's pricey, but for $16 I got a 1\/3 patty cooked medium rare, the way I like it, with cheddar, bleu cheese, bacon, spinach, grilled onions and saut√©ed mushrooms with a side of onion strings. The patty was SOLID: fresh and cooked to perfection; all of the extras were of high quality and the onion strings were DELICIOUS. \n\nI thought that they give you plenty of food. Yes, you pay more, but we're talking high quality ingredients, not pre-cooked McDonald's. I can't afford to do this every day but I deserve something like this once or twice a month. I'm really eager to try their milkshakes....and then there's the bar. Again, don't let the negative reviews deter you, this is right up my alley. If you're short on time, give them a few weeks to settle in or go later in the day, not during the lunch rush.
