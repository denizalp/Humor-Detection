I went here last Friday and took my mother.  It was the first time she had been there.  She said that Juan's is by far, the best Mexican food she's ever had.  Anytime I go here, the service is great, the food is excellent, and it seems like the entire staff checks on you to make sure everything is good.  Even the manager came out and greeted us and asked how everything was.  Of course, the answer was excellent!  It's one place I don't mind waiting for a seat.
