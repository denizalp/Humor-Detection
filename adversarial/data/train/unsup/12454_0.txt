i had heard this place is just a little bit famous...\n\nand consequently attracts herds of people and long waits (no surprisingly). \n\nbut with time to kill before my flight home, 2:30 on a monday seemed like a safe bet to dine without the crowds they are known for. Success! the place was virtually empty.\n\nthere is something magical about pizza cooked in a wood fire oven - it really has the best taste.  obviously that great taste stems from the organic ingredients and homemade mozzarella though! and on top of the wonderfully charred outer crust, it comes out in mere minutes. happiness for the A.D.D in us all :)\n\nyou can never go wrong with margarita, but for something a bit more unique we decided to get the biancoverde - ricatto cheese on pizza is always a good thing, and the arugula piled on top only added to the deliciousness. It's traditionally served without sauce (server warned when we ordered, which was nice since we didnt realize), but they will add sauce to it if you like. im sure its great as its intended but i enjoyed it with sauce.\n\nwe split between 3 of us for 2 slices each. decent for a small meal (since the crust is really thin). saw several people ordering a whole pie for themselves but i think splitting between 2 people is perfect to finish completely and be satisfied.\n\ni was kickin myself we didnt order the caprese salad that comes with their fresh baguettes sliced along with it. so bright, so fresh and delicious-looking.\n\nthe chocolate shaved ice was a nice ending...light and airy.\n\ni loved the building, part of the historic buildings in Heritage Square of downtown phoenix. The little garden boxes out front and around the corner are charming.\n\nFree valet parking for customers.
