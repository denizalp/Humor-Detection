Such a cute little store!\n\nThe space is small but they're packed to the rafters with all sorts of children's comics, books, and goodies. You can find a whole range of mainstream lines like Tin Tin, Marvel, The Hardy Boys, and Archie, but also many, many lesser known varieties.\n\nPart of the space is still closed off, but they are getting it ready to do things like readings, events, and kick-off's. \n\nThe girl working the day I went in was very knowledgeable. As I browsed she was very engaged in helping a young boy find something new to read. She asked lots of questions of what he's read and the things he likes, then made some suggestions.\n\nWhether you have kids or you're just a kid at heart, you'll probably want to check this place out.
