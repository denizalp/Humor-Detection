Our family wanted to reward ourselves for working all weekend, so we went to the new Korean restaurant in Koreatown on Rainbow and Spring Mountain, Lee's Korean BBQ. We had the best meal. Luckily for the locals in Las Vegas, Lee's Restaurant is open 24 hours each day. We weren't the only family. Many parents felt the same as we did. All the children, mothers, and fathers take their families to Lee's barbeque. More people arrived as we were leaving to shop in the Greenland Korean Market next door that was open until 11 pm.
