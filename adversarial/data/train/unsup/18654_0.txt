I would stay far away from this place! The customer service is far from stellar. The Owner was very rude and arrogant. I spent above $300 on my bike repairs and eloquently asked questions about the products and services I was receiving. I was only doing what any consumer would do when spending hundreds of dollars. The owner was very short with me but still I returned a week later when the brand new tire I bought went flat. When I returned I told him how I ride my bike alot and asked if perhaps I should spend more on better material and he seemed very annoyed by my inquiry...So at that point I was sincerly put off by his establisment...And still I returned today for a complete winter overhaul on my bike and the Owner asked me to leave because he did not like me. I was willing to do business with this rude individual again and he refused to work on my bike. Instead of adjusting his customer service skills and feeling professional enough to inform his patrons to on product knowledge hedecides to sever a business relationship. Instead of seeing me as someone that wants to insure I am spending my money on the right product he saw me as an expendable item of no value. But I will not be treated in that manner at any business. I have contacted the better business bureau and our local business commisions about this. There are many other great bike shops that will be happy to help you and teach you about your bike if you ask with no problem.
