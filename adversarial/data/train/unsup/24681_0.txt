I dined here with my wife and a friend the other night for a couple of hours and really enjoyed the food, the service (thanks Dan) and of course my dinner companions. I just can't believe I have never been here before the other night. My friend suggested this restaurant since he said he's been there a couple of times and has enjoyed it each time. He was treating so I didn't really care about the pricing. Somehow food always tastes better whenever someone else is footing the bill. We were celebrating some business referrals I sent him that turned into sales.\n\nWe ordered a plate of Hummus, Feta Cheese and some other spread with pita bread which was just ok, nothing spectacular. We were served never ending bread all night, it was fantastic when dipped in olive oil. The appetizer that was the hit of the night for me was the grilled octopus. OMG - live a little people and step outside of your box and try the grilled octopus instead of  the calamari.\n\nMy friend had the Leg of Lamb with the green beans. He shared a little with me. It was a 3 star taste for me. The beans had a hint of cinnamon in them. My wife was stuffed with the appetizers and didn't order a main course.\n\nI had a Horiatiki side salad which is sometimes referred to as a Greek Hillbilly Salad. It normally consists of tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, green bell peppers, feta cheese, olive oil, oregano and kalamata olives. The fresh ingredients made this salad a winner. I ordered the special which was Braised Lamb with Eggplant. The lamb fell off the bone and was succulent and eggplant had a mushy consistency and was a perfect complement to the lamb. The main course reminded me of the Greek Islands in Chicago. And I find out from reading the previous reviews that the owner and chef are from Chicago. No wonder this place rocks since I went home and crashed into a blissful food coma.\n\nSo if you're looking for a home cooked dinner, go over to Athena and enjoy.
