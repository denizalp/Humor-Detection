First of All: BYOB.  Second, like those before me have proclaimed, \"THIS IS THE CITY'S BEST MAC AND CHEESE!\"  The ribs were really good too, as well as the greens and the corn bread. The chicken & dumpling soup was easily the best I've had in a while and I'd go back just for their fish stew.  The candied yams and rice & beans were less exciting, however, and the desserts are for sure worth skipping  But man, what a lot of good food you get with a dinner entree. \n\nYou definitely can't complain about the food or the pricing, but the room is really ugly and the lighting is a disaster, they have super bright energy saving bulbs in these low hanging lamps over each table that make you feel like you're in an interrogation room, and the service is slowwwww-perfectly friendly but slowww.  I feel like some of the servers just have no idea what is expected of them from the customer stand-point as far as setting the table, checking on drinks and making sure you have been served all the many sides you picked out in the beginning. \n\nOverall not a bad experience, especially since they keep posting groupons for dinners for four for around 30 bucks!  If I lived on the Northside, I would have a hard time not getting take out from here often.
