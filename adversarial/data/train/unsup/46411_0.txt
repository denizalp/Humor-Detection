My husbandand I had a great experience last Tuesday night at El Chorro. A bit out of our usual stomping grounds but we had to be in the area for work so we decided to stop in. Our server Stephen was great... he helped point us in the right direction from start to finish. Our favorite's were the Shrimp Pepper Pot and the Trout Almandine. Also, the glass of Rombauer Chardonnay Stephen recommended paired perfectly. Great experience overall.
