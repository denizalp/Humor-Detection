I love the decor of this place. It's themed like school. The menus are scantron and composite notebook themed & The napkins look like pieces of paper. \n\nFor an appetizer we had the crispy buffalo cauliflower bites and those things were out of this world good! My entree was the CCB burger and that was packed so full of flavor, I couldn't get enough. Honestly everyone's meals looked so good. I can't wait to go back. It will be a new spot for sure!
