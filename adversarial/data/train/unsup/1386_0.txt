*update below, I bumped them up one star* I had an appointment for a quote at 4:30 pm on Dec 29th.  Marcel showed up 45 min late.  He clearly didn't want to be here and said that his company couldn't make shutters in the shape I wanted.  A shape that is featured in their ad in \"The Home Mag\" and on the flier he had with him.  I think he had somewhere to be and didn't want to be bothered with a big house that would take over an hour to quote. He said he would have someone else call me who did what I was looking for.  Guess what...after 10 days, still no call.  As far as I can see, they reinforced a lot of the other reviews about poor service. * Shutters for Less (SfL) and Marcel called me today (5 days after my review) about 5 min apart. Marcel did apologize profusely, said he had been over-booked that day and said that he called his contact at SfL immediately when he left my house. Then he asked me to delete my review since I didn't actually buy shutters from them. Ultimately a poor customer experience is still a poor experience.  I bumped them up a star for the apology.
