Located in the desperately lacking nightlife area of Peoria, Sangria is a breath of vodka and redbull air. \n\nSangria is like a little slice of Scottsdale, minus the 30 minute drive. With that, it has it's good and bad points.\n\nGood Point - \n- an actual nightclub not called Hurricane Bay on the west side of town.\n- decent pricing, except for \"Bottle Tables\" which are ridiculous to begin with\n- plenty of places to sit, outdoor area for smoking, all that jazz\n\nBad Point -\n- pretty small, places feels a little too compact\n- I went on a dead night (Saturdays are dead now, apparently)\n- DJ was meh - unforgettable\n\nOverall, I wouldn't call it a dud, and I'll probably find myself going there again within the month, but it's not going to knock you on your ass either.
