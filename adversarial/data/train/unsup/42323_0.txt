I don't know what happend to this place but the quality and skill  of the staff and dropped. We visit Vegas about 4 or 5 times a year and always visit a touch of Las Vegas, and have referred several friends. But after spending  $300 for the worst and most painful experience of my life I will never return.  \n\nWe booked two 100 min Swedish massages and it was 100 mins of PAIN and NOT relaxing and all!! \n\nAfter this experience we will just pay the extra money and go back to the hotel spa.
