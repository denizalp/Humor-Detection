This place saddened me, as I had great memories of the first time we were here. This time, although service was friendly, they made some errors - for example, didn't tell us what was sold out until we ordered it from the menu (hate that). The menu reads confusingly -- it says \"biscuits. Gravy\" (you get both, but there's a period) but also \"bacon. Sausage\" but you have to pick one or the other, you don't get both. Need to be more careful with their punctuation and presentation.  \n\nWhile my Reuben was mighty, there's no way it was worth $17. I think $13 is more reasonable for a sandwich.  Since I no longer feel the price matches the product, I had to adjust my review.
