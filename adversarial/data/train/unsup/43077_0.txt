I was planning on getting a tattoo removed. I did the paperwork to get it all started and within hours a friend shared their terrible experience with them and how she still has her tattoo after half a dozen treatments. Hers is much smaller and simpler than mine. My wife and I decided it would be a bad decision to go forth especially after some research and realizing they have outdated removal tech as is.       I called them to cancel everything. They asked me to come in to do so. I did and all they tried to do was use my tattoo removal loan as credits for hair waxing for my wife. After explaining I wanted it cancelled they then told me they can't because it was Saturday. \nI called on Monday to have it taken care of. I was told the manager would call me right back. 3 hours later, I called back. Finally she told me it would be handled. I called the loan company myself Tuesday morning and they said no cancellation paperwork exists. I called back and told them I want an email with proof the cancellation process was started because they told me it takes time to show up in their system. One hour later still no email. So I sent them a message through their website so they would hopefully see that. I got a text telling me of their current deals and a phone call asking me to come in for a consultation. I told this person of my situation and she said it was a general line and not that store(even though that store phone was in my caller ID). She then told me she would transfer the call. She didn't put me on hold and I could hear people talking. Then the manager gets on the phone and I explained I'm still waiting on an email. She FINALLY sends it and it's nothing official. No attachments, no screenshot. Just a message saying no charges will occur. \nWednesday morning comes around and I called the loan company to which they said the cancel paperwork is in. Finally! Don't do business here! Even if I had done what I wanted I feel like I would have had problems either way.
