This is one of the strangest places I have ever been in my life.\n\nLet me cut to the chase: The food is on a conveyor belt and it moves around and if you want it, you have to grab it off of the conveyor belt. They have normal tables too and a normal menu, but it seems like that's just for people without the agility to get the real food, or maybe they came in and were too embarrassed to sit at the conveyor belt, but also too embarrassed to leave so they just acted like everything was normal and sat at a normal table, but guess what people: IT ISNT NORMAL AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT.\n\nAlso, when we went there was a lot of smoke in the place, and the lady running the joint was very appologetic and said that the fan in the kitchen had broken and that they were getting it repaired immediately, but honestly I think she was trying to distract people and increase the difficulty of getting the food. I don't know why she would do this because she seemed like a very nice woman, but I just have a feeling. Either way, it's gonna take more than some smoke to keep me from getting food when I'm hungry! We sat at the conveyor belt bar thing and the food came around and before I knew it I had snagged 7 plates and was feeling kind of funny from all the saki and smoke and it was a great time. To make things easier every plate was $2 so the math was east to do to figure out if I should keep eating more food or not.\n\nSo this place was pretty fun. It's not sushi like at a really good sushi place, but it's not stale old sushi either. I'd say it's a step above sushi you'd get in the grocery store, and the price is reasonable, and holy cow what a time.
