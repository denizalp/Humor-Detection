I hover between 3 and 4 stars. The service was great, very patient with our rowdy 7-people group. The food was well-presented but only average in taste. Don't get the mixed grille unless you order multiple selections because with one selection I got 6 small bites of filet and a mountain of boring veggies like baby corn and celery. The filet was excellent but celery? I didn't pay $16 for celery! And the flourless chocolate torte was bland...definitely not as rich as expected.
