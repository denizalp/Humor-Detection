I came here with a friend prior to attending a concert. It was early so the restaurant was not too busy. The waitress was very friendly and gave some great recommendations. The food and drinks were tasty! The wait staff was a little too aggressive in picking up our finished plates (or what appeared to be finished). It felt as though there was someone at the table every five minutes. Then again, it's better to go above and beyond (;
