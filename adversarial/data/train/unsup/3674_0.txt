I love getting blow outs when I'm out of town on vacation. It feels great to be pampered.  Saw this place on Yelp and made my appointment on Yelp. The place is inside a nondescript strip mall next to a Dunkin donuts. The decor is very cute with tall ceilings. The place was clean which is very important when you have hair being tamed everywhere. The guy who did my blow out was friendly and conversational. I have really long hair so I'm sure it wasn't a walk in the park for him. They offer a variety of soft beverages,  coffee, tea etc.
