I like Jamba Juice.\n\nI like this particular location as well.\n\nLike Alicia, the place was JAMbING loud with music-- like really loud, like I thought I turned into my parent's b\/c I almost wanted to say, \"Can you turn the music down, it's hurting my ears.\"\n\nI bit my tongue and anxiously awaited for my Orange-A-Peel.  It was good.  It was exactly what I expected and wanted at that very moment. \n\nClean, nice staff, good smoothie.  Just loud.
