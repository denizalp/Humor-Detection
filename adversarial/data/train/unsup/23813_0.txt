Everyone raves about Archi's so instead of going to our usual Pin Kaow, my boyfriend and I finally decide to come here on a Monday night.\n\nWe ordered three dishes: Shrimp basil, chicken pad thai and beef pad see ew.\n\nBoyfriend really enjoyed his shrimp and mixed veggies in a basil garlic sauce. Spiciness=6\/10. It comes with a bowl of rice. He also ordered chicken pad thai. Spiciness 6\/10. He said it tasted better than Pin Kaow. I beg to differ. Archi's pad thai was just too.....sweet and tangy for me. If that makes any sense. I couldn't put my finger on why I wasn't too fond of it until I read a previous review and that Yelper described it perfectly: sweet and tangy.\n\nI ordered my usual go-to Thai dish....beef pad see ew. Spiciness=7\/10. I usually order an 8 but since this is a restaurant I haven't been to, don't wanna get too carried away. It was delicious. Good portions of beef, perfect amount of spice, and noodles came out pippin' hot. Now, I'm a pretty small eater. 98% of the time I always have leftovers...no matter what cuisine\/restaurant I go to. I don't know why but my pad see ew came in small oval plate while my boyfriend's pad thai came on a big round plate. If I wanted to, I could have killed the pad see ew all in one sitting. I kid you not. I wasn't even hangry that night. Wasn't too pleased that the portions seemed inconsistent. \n\nArchi's is a solid Thai restaurant but if 2+ months have passed, I can tell you I wouldn't have the urge or craving to come back here.
