The Strip was more interesting years ago. It was filled with the same ethnic stores as today and tons of nightclubs. They even had a floating dock with two clubs, a seated boardwalk and floating stage. They had an outdoor club called Coconuts that was tropical and more.\n\nToday most of that is gone. It's just some small ethnic food stores, souvenir stores and a couple of restaurants.\n\nThe parking along the warehouse used to be free on the weekends.... and there were more stores and an open warehouse with food. \n\nIt's OK to browse here for Steelers merchandise or some cheap vegetables.
