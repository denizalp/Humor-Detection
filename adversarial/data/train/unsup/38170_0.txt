I stopped by here yesterday with my girlfriend at around 2:30 or so.  We got our tickets through living social and so they were $15 for both of us instead of $15 each.\n\nIt was held on the second floor of the convention center, in the back.  Whenever I walked in I was surprised at how small it was with around 30 vendors or being there.  While many vendors were giving out free samples, it was to get you to buy their product.  It almost felt liking walking through the strip district on a Saturday.  I also do not think that I really learned anything which was sad.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would not head back here next year.  Even though it only cost $15 for both of us, I felt that it was at least $11 more than it was worth.
