This restaurant is the only Chinese hot spicy dip restaurant in Mississauga, as far as I know. It is a chained restaurant, and you may find the other ones in North York or somewhere north of Toronto. \n\nIt is fairly authentic in terms of the taste and the process of picking your favourite ingredients for the dip. There are five levels of spice, and customers can choose the dip with soup base or dry base. Besides that, we can also choose different kinds of meat, such as beef, lamb and pork as well as shrimps. It is very convenient for people who are running a busy schedule or taking a lunch break. The price isn't cheap tho because the ingredients are fairly basic, and if people would like to have more meat, you have to pay extra on top of the weights of the ingredients you picked. \n\nThe quality of these ingredients sometimes can be some issues. You may find razor clams and mussels among the ingredients. However, they are soaking in the water, which the water doesn't look clean (maybe the clams and mussels are in there for some time). We had a group of four to have dinner there, and two of them had a stomachache after having the clams. However, it's not often, as long as you don't pick these river seafood, other ingredients look fairly fresh and clean. \n\nIf you don't have time to go to this place, I will suggest you order it on the Foodhwy, so you will be able to try it out by having it delivered. Again, I rated a three-star because of the rare food quality issue. Since it doesn't happen often on me, I still like to go there once a while.
