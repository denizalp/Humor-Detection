A great location to grab a phenomenal dinner before shows at the Luxor or nearing casinos. The service is a 10 on a 1 to 5 scale. Our wait staff was attentive and ensured that everything they could control was well above standards. \n\nSo why did I rate this a 3? This is a steakhouse. And while we were there, the place was 1\/2 empty, meaning that the chef(s) were not overwhelmed by a huge rush of orders. However, in our time there, we saw three meals sent back due to meat being undercooked. Two filets at the table next to us, and my lamb. This wasn't simply underdone because we were picky people - the center of these cuts were all rare. Cold & uncooked.\n\nThe wait staff was quick to respond and get these resolved, but at a steakhouse of this tier, this occurring 3x in one sitting is simply a red flag. \n\nThat said, once cooked properly, the meat was phenomenal. The wine & cocktail list is well above standard. The starters were perfect in size and preparing our pallets for the main course. And dessert was spot-on. \n\nI will qualify that the desserts being spot-on comment had nothing to do with the fact they were comped due to the meat being sent back.\n\nThis taken into account, I would actually return. The peripheral meal and experience was phenomenal. Perhaps I'm too forgiving, but I'd still recommend Tender to anyone visiting Vegas looking for a solid steakhouse.
