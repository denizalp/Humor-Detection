Not only do you walk into a place and think \"This doesn't feel like a typical movie theater, it's pretty darn fancy\" with a tower skylight and indoor water fountains, but the options of real food instead of junk to eat is fantastic. The coffee and wine bar located on the other side of the entrance make fine drinks and enhance the movie going experience yet again.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin as to why I choose this theater over any other is that they have D-BOX seats. Not only can I reserve the seat ahead of time and not worry about showing up two hours early for a good seat, but once you've had a full motion viewing all other movie watching seems dull in comparison.
