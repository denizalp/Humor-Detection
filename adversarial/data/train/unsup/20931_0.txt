This place is my JAM! Thankfully, I'm located less than 2 minutes from this little gem of a place and since discovering it on 9\/29, I've been 6 times. That's right - 6 times in 8 days.\n\nI can't get enough of their falafel wrap, and let me explain why:\n\n1. 2.99 - with tax, total comes out to $3.64\n2. Falafel is so moist, yet perfectly fried - it's a miracle and sin all in one\n3. The salad they put on it is always fresh, light and cool\n4. Please see #1 & #2\n5. Izzat is always there and while I can't understand a word of what he says over the phone, when I walk in he is always smiling and asking after my health (Perhaps he wants to be sure I am in good health so I can continue to put his kids through college thanks to the rate at which he sees me).\n6. Please see #1-5\n\nSo yes, I am in LURVE with this place and you should definitely try it. I've also had the grape leaves (good, salty though!), the hummos (home run, all the way, amazing) and the Babaganoush (yummy). An accomplice on one of my visits tried the Chicken wrap and before I could ask for a bite it was gone, so that also says something ;)\n\nAs others have said, don't let the shanty strip mall it's in get you down - this really is a very real, honest establishment that appears to really hold onto their roots and rock the Casbah of tastebuds in my mouth!
