Ew, if I could give this place 0 stars I would, all thanks to one of the employees shining some light on what kind of shady illegal secret businesses they have going on at this club. Escorting services and\/or prostitution. I'm a local, I have been to pretty much every club in Vegas, and have friends that work at some clubs as well, so I was offended as no one has ever approached me in this manner. \n\nMy friend and I (both females) went to Marque on Industry night. As we were just casually standing by the bar, some VIP Promoter approached us and asked if we would like to join \"his\" table. We did, and we were the only ones not drinking. 10 minutes in, and he calls me over. He asked me where I'm from, and what I do. I told him I work in medical and I am a local. So this guy starts talking about if we'll take the old rich man up to his room, the one that was supposedly paying for the table & bottles where we were sitting at. He said if we didn't wanna do anything with him, to take him up anyway, but then convince him to go back down to the club to keep partying so he could continue buying bottles so we could continue to enjoy our night. I said \"excuse me?!\" What the h*** do we look like?!\" \n\nAccording to him, in their club if you say you are a local and of course a female, to them that means you are a working girl. Escort, prostitute, whatever term he was thinking. He started acting like a di**, and said \"next time, don't say you are a local, say you are from anywhere else you wanna be, because when you say local, that to us means you are working.\" \n\nLike uh no, I live in Vegas, I AM a local, but not into that crap, boy bye.
