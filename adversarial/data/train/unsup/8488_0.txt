I haven't been to many gay bars in Phoenix, so after Yelping my options, I decided on Icepics. It looks rather unassuming on the outside, but once you walk in, the space is fairly large and the bar extends back quite a bit. They have TONS of alcohol here and there's really no drink they can't make. \n\nWe didn't know, but it was happy hour and I was served a pretty heavy pour. It didn't take long until I turned into my cheap-date-red-Asian-glow look. I'd say this visit was a success. \n\nThey have a separate room they use for drag performances, and sad that I had to leave before the show started, but it looks like it would've been awesome. The bartenders are very nice and the crowd looks diverse. Can't wait to go back and get red again!
