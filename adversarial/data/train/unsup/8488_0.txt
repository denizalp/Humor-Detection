It's a movie theater. I somehow thought the Town Square location made it more likely to be a higher-end \"luxury\" theater, but it was fairly basic. There is an on-site bar that has not been open either of the times I've visited.\n\nAuditoriums have stadium seating, which I don't particularly like. Layout of most theaters features a small side section of paired-off seats, which I actually do like. Haven't had any service issues while here. \n\nWeekend matinee prices are $7.99\/adult; evening prices closer to $11.
