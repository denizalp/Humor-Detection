Initial impression was awful. As we parked we saw the manager or host (guy in a red shirt)outside talking to what appeared to be a friend of his. Went inside and were  not greeted until about fifteen minutes later when the waitress greeted and sat us. From there it was great. Service was fast and extremely friendly, and food was great.
