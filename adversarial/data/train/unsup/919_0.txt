I didn't come here expecting a whole lot. It's a dark, big pub full of slot machines and TV screens. If you're looking to get cheap drinks, come here for a pitcher of strong sangria and well-priced pints. But let's talk food.\n\nAll of the plates ordered  were appetisers. First, there was the calamari. It was crispy and fresh, but I couldn't taste any squid. The dipping sauce was an odd salsa-type mixture that didn't pair well. The onion rings are a better choice, and I quite enjoyed those. It was also my first time trying cheese-stuffed jalapeno poppers. I didn't like them. The cheese was the equivalent of melted Kraft-singles! Lastly, the nachos; pretty standard, and nothing special. \n\nMy friends ordered the club sandwich plate, Mediterranean pizza and the gyro plate. The pizza did not look appealing, and wasn't very big. The club sandwich looked tasty, but I think the biggest plate was the gyro. It came with both fries and salad, and a gyro stuffed with tzatziki sauce and chicken. \n\nThe service was decent. It took longer for the waiter to come to take our order, than the food to come out. \n\nIf you want to get wasted and eat some greasy food, come to PJs. But don't expect any type of atmosphere, other than \"sketchy-suburban pub\".
