We slammed this place with about 25 of us on Saturday morning and they handled it famously.  \n\nCoffee was good and hot and refilled without hesitation. I was all ready for a bloody mary, but unfortunately, they only have beer and wine!\n\nWe shared the homemade corned beef hash with 3 eggs, potatoes, and toast.  I wanna say it was $7.95.  The portion was huge!  They even served it on two seperate plates.  Now, I admit it....I am a fan of the good ole' fashined corned beef hash out of the can so I am generally apprehensive about the homemade renditions.  This one was good! The corned beef was lean, tasty and flavorful.  It was chopped up with big chucks of potatoes; furthermore, the breakfast was served with potatoes, so we did end up with a potato surplus.  We also had the potato and zucchini latkes with carmelized apples and gravy and sour cream.  These were a real winner!! It was a clever take on potatoe pancakes.  They substituted the usual applesauce with the carmelized apples and added a savory gravy for good measure.  The balance between the sweet and savory aspects made this a true brunch delight.  It was a large portion as well for only $4.95!\n\nMy sister had the penne with shrimp which she liked very much after adding seasoning...just needed salt.  She said the pasta was nice and al dente and the whole dish was light and flavorful.  \n\nMy mom did the chopped salad.   It wasn't what she expected (less chopped than she anticipated) but nonetheless delicious and she ate every bite!\n\nThe food here will ot dissapoint and the price and portion will keep you coming back! Thumbs up!!
