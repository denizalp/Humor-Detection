DO NOT SIGN UP HERE. First of all they are overly priced and if you try to cancel they try to charge you ridiculous money. They will do whatever to get you to sign up & tell you you're getting a deal but you're really getting charged like everyone else. I had a horrible experience with them, when I tried to cancel because I could no longer afford it with work & school full time they tried to tell me \"So you can pay every other bill but can't pay this one?\" SO UNPROFESSIONAL AND ALL THEY WANT IS YOUR MONEY. Horrible place & smells like feet.
