\"FAIL\"\n Got my front brakes fixed on our van when we were passing through Cleveland. I got on the road with a deadline to meet 300+ miles away and noticed the brakes were still grinding. Brought it into another shop and found that they hadn't tightened the bolt on the brake caliper. Are you kidding me? This place is rediculous. If they would make an 1st year car mechanic mistake on something as simple as brakes I dont even wanna think what kind of mistake they would make on a big repair job. Not cool.
