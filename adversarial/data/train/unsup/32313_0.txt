Passed SW Swelch on the way to get bagels from St Viatur. A photography book in the display caught my eye so I went in to have a closer look. The owner is a friendly guy and we had a chat about phones and cameras. There's a good selection of what appears to be out of print and collectible books. The prices are very reasonable. I got a coffee table book for $20. Visited on 12 Nov 2013.
