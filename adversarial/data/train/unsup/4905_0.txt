This is a great place to meet friends for lunch, but you have to get there early or you will have to WAIT.  The bread is so good that I always get sandwiches rather than salads, particularly the tuna salad sandwich (I know, it sounds a little like I just contradicted myself there).  The restaurant has an open and airy atmosphere, and the menu has a greater selection than some of the other sandwich places in town.  I do not like having to valet (we're in Phoenix, people, just build a surface lot for heaven's sake), but what can you do?  Solid 4 stars.
