This place is a joke. My husband bought a lifetime warranty on my engagement ring and go figure they dont honor it! They make up fine print that does not exist and tell me I would gace had to call customer service to figure this out. Remind you I have been maintaining this ring ever six month for the past 6 years and now all of a sudden this is not valid!! I paid whatever cost it was to fix the prong but will never be back for any reason! And for further shoppers ask all these questions!!!
