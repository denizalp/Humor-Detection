So I thought I'd surprise the GF with a new handbag...or is it a purse???  I get really confused in this area and I had a budget too......so after going to Southpark mall and having sticker shock with new Coach bags...lets just call them that for the rest of the review ok *wink*.  I decided to check out the Coach Outlet store at Concord Mills.\n\nThe space is nice and the selection is huge.  In addition, they do a good job of sorting out bags by price....one set of shelves are the largest and highest priced bags...the next shelf is a slightly smaller bag and lower price and so on.\n\nAs I entered the store I was greeted by a nice associate that gave me a discount flier which lowered my bill by another 20%.  So I looked and I looked and I looked and found the bag and along with the coupon I saved over $250!!!  Money saved, gift bought, GF happy....what more could a guy ask for.
