Rude staff. $20 for a cut which isn't bad. But the guy who cut was very unprofessional and he wouldn't turn me towards the mirror cause he wanted to chat with his buddies. \nI don't usually go to barbers, but I went here cause I heard good things. \nMy hair ended up okay. But the experience was not good at all! He even said I could leave if I didn't like how he was cutting.
