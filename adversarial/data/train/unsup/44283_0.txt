The service on this trip was disappointing.  I was in Las Vegas for work.  I made a reservation for 10 at this restaurant at 6:45 on a Wednesday night (not their peak time).  Two people from my group showed up 10-15 min early to have a drink and the hostess showed them where we'd be sitting.  As I showed up, they gave the table to another group (explanation - \"someone in their party was named Chris also\").  I didn't complain that it took 25-30 min after the reservation time before they sat us at another table but I was surprised that there wasn't an apology.  3 hours after I left the restaurant, I received a notice from OpenTable that the restaurant cancelled the reservation.  I called since I wasn't happy that they couldn't give me 100 Open Table points for a reservation of 10 people.  I got a manager who promised to fix it; never did.  \n\nThe food is alright but go somewhere with better service.
