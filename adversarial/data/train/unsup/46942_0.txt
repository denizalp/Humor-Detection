Due to cold weather, my windshield fluid could not come out. I drove by Mr. Lube, just hoping to get some expert advice on what to do. More than just explaining what was wrong, they promptly fixed the problem by sucking out old fluid which was frozen and added in winter windshield fluid (-46 degree) and fixed it in minutes. They did this all for free, even when I took out my wallet wanting to give some tips, they refused. What a great service! Highly recommended.
