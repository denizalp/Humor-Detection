Prompted to write a review after seeing the Mike Bullard endorsement,and the firm's commercials.Of course Mr.Bullard would be well looked after by Diamond and Diamond,he's a public figure.Other less known accident victims may not be so pleased with their outcome.The referral fees business in personal injury litigation leaves claimants in a precarious situation when a firm can become at odds with its \"referral\" partner.The practice should be disallowed in Ontario with its anti claimant legislation can make a claim very traumatic. \n\nIn the one year dealing with this firm,one shouldn't be unaware their case was \"referred\"given their post accident vulnerable position,and compromised health.Trying to reach the referral lawyer to find out the status of the case was incredibly difficult.Ultimately had to move the file elsewhere sums up this review.In addition to the Globe and Mail article,Case offers window into widespread referral fee use:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/news\/toronto\/case-offers-window-into-widespread-referral-fee-use\/article5083777\/\n\n\"Were you practising law in your relationship with Diamond & Diamond?\" asked Alan Rachlin, lawyer for Bergmanis Preyra.\n\"That can - I mean I'm - I don't really understand that question,\" replied Mr. Diamond.\n\n\nMr.J.Diamond as an \"independent contractor\" is representing the firm if he's meeting claimants at Diamond and Diamond,how is he merely a \"figure head?\" Further underlines the tenuous situation a claimant is walking into with a referral based law firm.Would  the combined referral fee ,and \"contractor\"based relationships allow  firms like Diamond and Diamond to take zero responsibility if they torpedo someone's personal injury claim?Frightening thought.
