Food: 4\/5\nAtmosphere\/other patrons: 0\/5\nService: 0\/5\n\nWent for dinner with my husband, college-aged brother and parents.\nArrived at 7, and no one even acknowledged us when we walked in. We should have walked out right then.  After standing near the entrance waiting for someone to seat us for a few minutes, we asked the bartender if we should sit where we like. She said \"Yeah, that is fine.  Your server will be right over with your menus.\"\n\nAfter about 10 mins, we still didn't have menus or a waitress. Again, we should have walked out then, but we were all starving and it was 7pm on a Friday so we figures we would have to wait anywhere else too.  Please note that there are a total of 3 filled table at this point in time (oours included). The waitress finally arrived and my brother couldn't quite see to the bar so he asked what was on draft. The waitress made him continue to squint\/try to decipher them, instead of listing them off.   She did not write down our drink order and forgot mine as soon as she walked away from the table.\n\nThen we waited, at least another 10 mins for everyone's drinks to arrive (2 beers, 2 glasses of wine and a coke so nothing fancy) .  At this point we were about half an hour into the dining experience and have yet to order, although we all knew what we wanted after being in the restaurant for a short period of time.  After our drinks were received, we then sat for another 15 mins before our waitress even came back to take our order.\n\nWe ordered 4 pizzas, 2 appetizers and a salad.  Then the waiting continued.  Our waitress didn't check on us once between the time we ordered and the 45 mins it took to get the appetizers.\n\nIn total, this was a 2 hour dinner, and not because we lingered, we scarfed down our food in about 10 mins after it arrived. \n\nAt some point while we were actually eating, one of the strippers from the Crazy Horse down the road (I knew she worked there because her jacket said \"Crazy Horse Dancer\"), came into the place, took over the jukebox and started grinding on a 60+ year old man in the middle of the place.\n\nAt the end of the night, our waitress asked how things were, and we indicated the food was good but that service was slow. She said the kitchen got \"slammed\",  I'm not sure how, because again there were 3 tables when we arrived.\n\nThis place 's only saving grace was the food. It is a shame that I will never be back, they are doing themselves a disservice with their staff.
