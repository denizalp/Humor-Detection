Today is their 4th day opening.  Service is good.  Food quality is good.  Even though it's all you can eat but the quality is better than your average ayce.  Pictures speak louder than words - i will post some soon!  Really busy place.  The restaurant isn't that big (kinda small)  and their seating floor isnt all opened up yet so there will be a wait with no reservation.  I arrived around 6pm on a Tuesday night and had to wait around 25 minutes.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  They speak English and Chinese.  Portions are small so you can take your time and try everything before ordering your favs.  There is a BBQ section and ready to eat section.  My fav for meat bbq section is chicken knee cartilage (not many places have it).  My fav for ready to eat is salmon carpaccio!  Yep they have salmon sashimi ayce too! Love it!  Will be back soon again!  If u r on a diet... well... after coming here u will forget about that diet cuz its pretty awesome.
