Lululemon is the GOLD STANDARD in fitness wear.  Even if you're not in to Yoga, you will LOVE how their pants \"lift and separate\" your bootie.  They seriously knock off at least 5 lbs from the hip area girls.  I hope they open a big store soon, because I can't get enough of all their clothes!  I don't just work out in 'em, I wear them all the time.  After you buy just one item you'll never look at fitness wear the same again.
