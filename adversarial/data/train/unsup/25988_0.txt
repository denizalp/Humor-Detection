This practice is incredibly efficient and  dependable.  With other practices I visit, I have to make several reminder calls to acquire routine  things I need like lab tests, appointments, questions about prescription side effects, etc.   With this practice, I know they will help me quickly. Roxie Anderson is amazing.  Thoughtful and knowledgeable.   They also have Saturday hours which is amazing!
