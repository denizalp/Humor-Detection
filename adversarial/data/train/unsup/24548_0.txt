I absolutely loved my nails. Loved loved them. I got a gel mani and a regular pedi. Although I believed I was overcharged. It was $65, and on the menu it says $25 for gel (one color) and $25 for a pedi. I have no idea where the $15 came from and unfortunately didn't stop to think about it until I was driving home. It wasn't even a \"manicure.\" No lotion or massage, which would make it $35 dollars so her pricing for me was completely off. I'm torn because she did such a wonderful job (Kelly) but she overcharged me, said the callus removal is $5 extra (when on the site it says it is included in the classic $25 dollar pedicure), and she seemed like she just really didn't want to be there. I complimented her when I left and said she did a really great job and she didn't really say anything. It was around 7:30 pm and it seemed like she took me on as the last person of the day. The shop as others have mentioned is very dirty as well, but has so much potential if they really tried. I've been looking for a great spot for the longest time since my last one closed, and I'm torn in making it this one. She did a great job but the above mentioned has me deeply second guessing.
