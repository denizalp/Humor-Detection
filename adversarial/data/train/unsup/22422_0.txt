6\/23\/10\n\nMy lovely sister and I came here to be pampered-- she treated us both to a mani\/pedi.  She kept telling me to get flowers on my big toes.  I balked at the extra fee ($5 per toe?  Perhaps it was just an extra $5.)  Had I known that these were going to look so cute, I'd have let her spring for the extra cost!  \n\nThought I'd include a pic of her lovely doggies!  After such an enjoyable 90 minutes of pampering at My Bella, ours certainly weren't barking!\n\nMusic accompaniment: Dionne Warwick: The Definitive Collection.\n---\n\np.s.  Was informed by sis that the actual location we visited was on Mallard Creek Rd, and  not Rea.  Was going to edit, but could not find the correct address listed here on Yelp...
