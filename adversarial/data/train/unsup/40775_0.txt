Went to purchase my dad some merchandise from this location and was disapointed by the poor customer service. Kaemon (associate) rang me up and asked for my ID in which I assumed to match to my credit card. Without my permission started putting my information in their system. So I asked him to please not take my information. Then since I was purchasing gifts I asked for a gift box. He told me they were all out when there were plenty in sight. I guess he was upset I asked him not to take my information. Have a better day Kaemon. I won't be shopping at this location again, I'll go back to the location on Rainbow.
