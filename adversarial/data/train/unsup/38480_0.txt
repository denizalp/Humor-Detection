The food here is great and the service is fast and friendly.  There are a variety of choices and the prices are reasonable (\"Dinner combo\" served anytime includes soup, steamed or fried rice, wonton, egg roll and a generous portion of the main dish) for $9-$11.  The place is a dive and the atmosphere is dated.  Still, if you're in the mood for delicious Chinese food, this is it.
