I was having problems with my Rolex bracelet for awhile.  after reading the yelp post I rolled down Tatum and went to David   it is an intimate, eclectic shop with a special surprise \nDavid fixed my watch in two minutes no charge and I could have been gone.  but we discussed when the watch might require a cleaning again. good info. but the surprise was Chester the 16-year-old pug.  he is a glorious little man   \n\ndefinately, if you need jewelry repaired and you are up in the area you don't have to google anything else just stop in  \n\ni will be back
