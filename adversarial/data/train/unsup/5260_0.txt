It was the most amazing dinner I've ever experienced! My parents, brother and I spent the weekend at MGM where everything was COMPED! \n\nWe decided to take advantage of this \"free\" weekend and make reservations at the renowned Craft Steak (my brother is obsessed with Top Chef). Our party of 4 ordered the Chef Tasting Menu- Kobe \"Surf & Turf\" (3 courses) at a whopping $155\/person which is changed on a daily basis by the Chef.  We also ordered a bottle of $100 wine (you cant drink water with a meal like this). \n\n1st Course Appetizer: \n- Kobe Beef Tartar- amazing flavors, reminded me of ahi tuna. I loved the raw egg on top which gave it a nice rich flavor. \n- Roasted Red Peppers with olive oil\n- Grilled shrimp\n- Caesar salad\n\nEntree:\n-Kobe Steak  (3 types)- Rib eye, Sirloin, and Skirt Steak. All was perfectly cooked and incredibly tender. IT was my first experience with Kobe beef and I was very impressed with the quality of the meat. \n- 2 Lb. Lobster sitting in a bowl of butter sauce...mmmm...butteerrrr...\n\nSide Dishes:\nGrilled mushrooms, carrots (BEST EVER, perfectly cooked and sweet, this was my Mom's favorite dish), grilled asparagus, and Yukon mashed potatoes (melted in your mouth, very rich, mmm buttteerr). \n\nDessert:\n-Berry Crumble\n-6 diff ice creams and homemade sorbet - my dad's fave dish! He's still raving about the sorbet. \n-Chocolate cake with melted chocolate in the middle - my bro's fave.\n- Bread pudding- MY FAVE! Very rich and perfectly baked. \n- Blueberry tart\n \nAnyways, the bill came out to a total of $900 (including tip) and we were definitely more than satisfied with our meal. Even the espresso and coffee (french pressed at your table) was incredible. \n\nMy dad asked \"So, would you come here again if we had to pay??\"\n\nYES!
