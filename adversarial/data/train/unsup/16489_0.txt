Rock N Roll atmosphere: Check\n\nLot's of TV's for watching sports: Check\n\nBeer: Check\n\nOne pound, 22 inch long hot dog: Say whaaaa? \n\nOh yeah, Cooper'stown, named after legendary rocker Alice Cooper, is Home of the Big Unit (one pound, 22 inch long hot dog). I didn't try it on this visit, but will definitely be back to take on this hefty hot dog another day. \n\nThis is a great place to watch some sports, grab a bite to eat and have some beers with friends. I tried the Johnny Beef Depp (French Dip). Not bad at all. Actually it was better than I thought it would be. I got fries and cole slaw with it. The fries were good but I wasn't crazy about the slaw. \n\nThe atmosphere definitely won me over most of all. I liked the old brick building with the iron gates and big open patio. And inside, no matter which way you turn there was a tv, so it was great for watching football.   \n\nOverall, it's a cool place. Especially if you like big wieners.
