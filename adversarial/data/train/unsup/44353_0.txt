Lots of great photo ops here with the flower wall and giant teddy bear.\n\nThe drinks I had were good. I got the house fruit tea fruit which had pieces of watermelon, strawberries, apple, orange, and lime. I actually didn't end up drinking this one until 3 hours after ordering. It was quite sweet and fruity by then.\n\nI also got the mango and coconut sago mix. It was pretty thick and was rich mango flavours.\n\nThe major downside is the cost. Almost every drink is $7+, and there is no option for smaller sizes.
