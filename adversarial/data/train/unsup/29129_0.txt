This place is good for a couple of reasons:\n-It's open 24\/7.\n-There's a decent beer selection (for a gas station).\n-The attendants have always been super friendly and nice.\nAnd that's it. \n\nThis place is sketchy for a lot of reason, I won't go on with all of them, but one time I did see hypodermic needles on the ground in the parking lot. That was suuuuper gross. We let the people inside know and they didn't seem to care. Yuck.\n\nIt's definitely not a great gas station by any means, but I have seen worse.
