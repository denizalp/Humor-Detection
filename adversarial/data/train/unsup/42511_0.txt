Jimmy at Green Sinner is a visionary. Green Sinner creates unique arrangements with can only be described at living works of art. At an event consultant for a local business, I see florists come and go every week. This florist sticks shines above much of the local competition. If you want something truly unique and inspired I would wholeheartedly recommend Green Sinner.\n\nUpdate: My husband and I decided to get married in the summer of 2017 and of course my first and only choice was Jimmy's team. I asked for very little, just an earthy floral crown, boutonni√®re and bouquet for our ceremony by the lake. What the team gave me was more my vision than even I could have conveyed. I could've cried tears of joy, but my eyeliner needed to set, haha. You can't do better than greenSinner.
