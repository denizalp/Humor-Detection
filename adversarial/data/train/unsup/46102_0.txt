Who doesn't love KFC? Probably one of the best places to go for Korean fried chicken! \nThis is a small restaurant with limited parking so we had to park on the side streets. The interior of this place is nice and dim, with rustic decor. The service here was amazing, there were only 2 waitresses but the place is small so it makes sense, they were very attentive and came back to check on us if we needed refills or anything else. The chicken here is so yummy, it has the perfect amount of crispiness but also very soft and tender on the inside. We got the large green onion boneless chicken and I personally think that is the best one out of all of the chicken selections. \nI highly recommend this place!
