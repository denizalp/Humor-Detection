We got the 5-course tasting menu and every dish was amazing! Also I don't know how they define what makes a \"course\" but there was definitely way more then 5 dishes brought to the table. They even brought us 2 desserts which was the best surprise ever hahaha \nWe loved every single dish but our favourites were the cauliflower style wings, the broccolini and the chicken thighs. The flavours were unbelievable, unlike anything we've ever had before. Great value at $50 per person.
