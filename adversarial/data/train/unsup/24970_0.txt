My husband and I both do not like pancakes but they came with our omelettes. They were amazing!!!! Not dense, not overly sweet, perfect little pancakes.\n \nWe got omelettes (ham and cheese for me, sausage and cheese for husband). Huge huge huge portions, so good. \n\nWe were stuffed for hours and loved it so much we came back a week later. We will keep coming back!!!!
