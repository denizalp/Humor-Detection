Hidden Gem of Scottsdale!!\n\nI have no idea how I wave walked and driven past this place so many times without noticing it. Luckily I did, checked it out on Yelp! and decided to have lunch\/brunch for two on Sat midday. we waked in to a very lovely patio and inside a small but nice restaurant. \nIt had  fun paintings on the wall, several small tables and a full bar with French music playing. \n\nNot big on too much French words I had to guess what was what and we went ahead and ordered. Our Cheese plate was wonderful although I thought it took a little to long to come out, being it was a cheese plate and there was only 2 other people in the place. \n\nIt was very good and i highly recommend it!
