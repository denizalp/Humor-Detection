The Silverton is wonderful off-strip casino. Exceptionally friendly staff and nice atmosphere. I recommend getting some cocktails and kicking back in the Mermaid lounge. Plus, the mermaids shows are free and happen frequently. It was a nice and festive touch that their costumes were ready for Christmas.  A lot to offer for less than most other casinos.
