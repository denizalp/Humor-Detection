It's a tough business when your combining with the greatest chefs and restaurants in the world... But the location in MGM is always going to be healthy. So the authenticity of Mexican food in a food court is always taken with a grain of salt (btw... As some salt people). The tacos were decent and the black beans and rice were also tasty. I'd come here again since the price was nice for the portions provided.
