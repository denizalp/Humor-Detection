This place is a hidden gem!  No frills, friendly service, and delicious homemade food.  The owner takes great pride in serving large quantities of freshly prepared food.  Not as fast or cheap as McD's but way better quality food and bigger quantity; made with care by adults who have been working there for years.  Texas Burger makes delicious souvlaki, burgers, and fries, and there are several other menu items I have yet to try. A lot of regulars go here for a reason, and I think they deserve more recognition and visits by first timers.
