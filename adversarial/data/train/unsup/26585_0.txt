Nice place for good food, good drinks, and fun. I came here very late at night and was craving bar food. I ordered poutine at a very cheap price. The poutine was delicious. The place has a few pool tables, a table where people were playing pong, and many jenga sets around. I definitely recommend coming here if you're looking for cheap bars.
