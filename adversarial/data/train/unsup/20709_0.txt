Located in front of the Monte Carlo, the Double Barrel offers a great meal!\n\nWe stopped in one afternoon to try them out.  Since it was a nice Vegas day, we sat on the patio to enjoy the sun.  It's a nice view of the strip while people watching.  Our service here was great.  Greeted immediately, drinks always filled and fun personality.  \n\nWe ordered the loaded nachos with wood grilled chicken to share. Trust me when I say there are more than enough for two. The nachos are topped with avocado cream, jalape√±os, sour cream and cotija cheese.  Absolutely delicious.  The chicken had a great smokey flavor along with their well seasoned nacho chips. I'd definitely order these again.  \n\nWe also split the Stacked BBQ Burger.  Meat on top of meat? Sure!  BBQ brisket on top of angus, onions, cheddar and sauce. With the great smoked meat, it gives this burger a little something extra.  \n\nIt was an excellent meal all around.   Plus with the Yelp check in discount of 20%, I was definitely pleased.
