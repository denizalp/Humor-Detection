I can't remember the last time I was this thoroughly disappointed in a burger. First off, it should be a sin to not offer a free side with a burger order. Their veggie burger has to be the worst I've had in a while. Apart from being mushy and barely staying together in a patty form, they couldn't even find a bun that could fit the patty properly, forcing me to eat it by scooping up the broken patty pieces with a fork. Come on Bill, get it together.
