A solid 3.5 stars.\n\nThe service was very friendly and professional.\n\nThe food was good, but not fantastic. \n\nThe price was high and as many of the other reviewers here have stated, there are actually a lot of other restaurants that have better food for (generally) lower prices.\n\nOverall, it's an enjoyable experience, but was not amazing.\n\nI had the scallop appetizer. It was wrapped in bacon, which I normally like, but it detracted from the purity of the scallop taste today. The Chilean sea bass entree was good, but seemed to be missing something. As I'm watching Chopped right now, I'm wondering if it was missing acid (which, they did provide a half lemon for squeezing, but I'm of the belief that the dish should come out as final as the chef would want it to be, and the lemon is for those who want even more acid). Or I'm just watching too many chef shows.\n\nThe dessert, carrot cake was good, but again not spectacular. Our server was very honest (thank you!) in stating that the cake is not made in-house. The cream cheese dressing was great, the components of the cake itself was chunkier than I personally like, but it is a style.  The cake was good, and I may not have been able to fully appreciate it as I was very full by the time we got around to dessert.\n\nOverall, I have no issues with coming back, but I'm not sure if I would be willing to pay for it out of pocket.
