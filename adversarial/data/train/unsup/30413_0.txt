Just stopped in at Cowtown Beef Shack while waiting for another shop to open nearby.  I ordered the beef dip sandwich and it was absolutely amazing!!!! My husband and kids weren't hungry and still ate half of my sandwich.  We will definitely be coming back for more!!  I'm glad we went in.  Friendly place, excellent beef\/flavour and all-around pleasant experience.
