I was extremely disappointed with their food and service. I ordered the Nabayaki Soba Noodles (with broth, seafood medley, and shrimp tempura) and what I got on delivery instead was fried soba noodles, no broth, and with what i asume was chicken or maybe pork! (I do not eat meat so i couldn't eat this at all)--I couldn't believe it. \n\nThis was so far from what i had ordered I was flabbergasted and frustrated (already really hungry) when I called them just asking for an explanation as to why this mistake had happened. But before I could get a sentence in they became defensive and began shouting that I had \"told\" them i wanted \"yaki noodles with chicken\" i very calmly explained that wasn't possible since i ordered through a third party delivery service and it said clearly on the receipt I did not order that (which is why i was sure the third party did not get it wrong). I spoke to two of their staff, going back and forth, by this time i was stressed, tired, and hungry, i began to cry and they just got even more defensive and never admitted to a mistake and kept insisting I had called and changed my order. It was unbelievable! I have never experienced such inconsiderate and rude service in my life. \n\nI will never order from them again and i warn anyone else from doing so as well. It was an awful experience.\n\nOn top of it all the one thing they did get right (veggie spring rolls) were sad, little (small and thin like a pinky finger) and flavour-less. The least enjoyable meal i've ever had. The absolute worst. \n\nIf i could rate them less than 1 star I would.
