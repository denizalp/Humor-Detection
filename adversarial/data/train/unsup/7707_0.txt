This is easy - 5 stars all the way. What a fantastic dinner experience. Best steak in Toronto - END of STORY. Add good friends and you have the perfect evening. \n\nWhy 5 stars you ask? The highlights:\n\n- impeccable service the minute you walk through the door. Amazing greeting, good conversation, they take your coats and quickly escort to your table. Multiple servers were fantastic, they knew what I needed before I did!\n\n- Kudos for a cool beer menu and bonus points for having Beau's Lugtread.... a perfect pairing for my steak. So good I had a few.\n\n- Amazing bread starter, tasted like Yorkshire Pudding, off to a great start. \n\n- Started with the Caesar salad made fresh at the table to your liking - stupid good!\n\n- Kick ass steak selection with prices for every budget ranging from $40 - $1,025 per steak. You can get Wagyu from Australia, U.S. or Japan and \/ or multiple steak cuts aged for 30, 40 or 70 days. The eager servers walk you through the steak menu and are happy to answer questions or make recommendations. I had the 70 day aged sirloin cut which was cooked a perfect medium rare. The aging really enhanced the flavour of the steak.\n\n- The provide complimentary salts and sauce \/ dips for your steak if you would like to add. I say nay nay to this!\n\n- Order your side dishes from a list of about 10 options. I recommend getting a few to share. My table ordered the Potato Gratin which was so $^($@ good, I can't describe it. So rich and heavenly. Duck fat fries were also a nice addition as well. This was a guys night out so we skipped veggies.\n\n- Deserts looked really good but there was no way I could eat another bite.\n\n- They have the steaks aging in clear glass fridge in the middle of the restaurant. As I walked over to look at the display, the manager came over and explained the process and how aging enhances the flavour.   \n\nThe only negative I could come up with is the price... but it's worth every last penny.\n\nIf your like me and love a good steak dinner, RUN like the wind to Jacobs.\n\nBK
