Food-good. Portions-average (small for an Asian restaurant). Service-disappointing. We are big fans of Taiwanese cuisine and knew we had to try it here. Had heard great things and knew a little of the history. The first time we were there, they were so nice and accommodating. The next time; not so much. The next, no better. The last time the service was just dreadful. And then one day when we asked (very early in the day) if we could make a reservation for 10 people they thought it would be OK to put all of us at a table for 6. No, that wasn't going to work. It made me realize they really didn't value us as customers. I do feel a bit like a sardine when I've been there. I've gone back the times I have as others have raved about their experiences and they ask us to go along. Well, the food is good, but I'm paying for an experience, not just food. I can make food at home-or I can order take out. Going out for dinner is a social activity that I enjoy. But, with so many other great Asian restaurants in the area, I think I'll try them all before heading back here.
