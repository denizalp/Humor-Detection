I didn't think my expectations for Norm's were too high, but I've been wrong before. I was looking for a decent diner style breakfast with friendly service. Unfortunately they didn't deliver.  The menu does have a good variety of choices.  Since I was heading out on a road trip with friends I to decided to play it safe and order the Lumberjack. The meat was what I would expect an elementary school to serve. It was very small and rubbery like it was microwaved. The biscuit and gravy was so terrible that I only managed 1 bite. The waitress never gave us refills on our drinks. We stopped another server and asked for refills, she said she would get our waitress. She never showed until she dropped off a group check at the end without stopping as she was waking (never asking if  we were paying together). When we got to the register, they had trouble separating the check. We were told we should have informed our waitress so 'it wouldn't take so long.' When you leave breakfast hungry something is obviously not right!
