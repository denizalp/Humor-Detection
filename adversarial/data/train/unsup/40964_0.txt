This place was definitely overhyped. It was a blazing hot day in August, but my family was persisted and visited every garden. For the cost of the admission, we were not at all impressed. The few flowers that weren't dead were overgrown and unkempt. The one bright spot was the Chinese garden, but it definitely didn't make up for the rest of the lackluster gardens. Overall, it was disappointing and a waste of a day.
