Sadly, I recently had to put down my dog, but I was so impressed with the treatment I received from the staff. Everyone was  so caring and compassionate, it really left a positive impact on me. I knew that my dog would spend her last moments with people that I could trust. I received  a card in the mail today from the hospital regarding my loss, that really meant a lot to me, I can't thank the staff enough!
