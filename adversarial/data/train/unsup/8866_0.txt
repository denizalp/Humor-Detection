Gelato. . .some people say that it is just like Ice Cream and I say NO!!  They are so different in flavor and texture. . .the actual make up of the ingredients. . .\n\nDid you know that Gelato actually has less fat then normal Ice Cream?  Well it does.  Gelato tends to be made with more milk then heavy cream. . .like ice cream.  So if you want to think that Gelato is healthier for you then ice cream. . .in a sense. . .it actually is as it has less fat!  =)\n\nYou might also wonder then why is gelato so much creamier then ice cream?  Well it's the temperature that they serve it at.  Ice cream is normally served at 6-10 degrees F. . .while Gelato is served traditionally at 10-22 degrees F.  So OF COURSE, gelato feels and tastes creamier.  \n\nSo now that the ice cream vs gelato lesson is over. . .=)  Let's get on with the review on the gelato!!\n\nI have been here numerous times and they have never disappointed.  I have tried more flavors then I bought of course. . .since I tasted about 5-7 before buying a cup with 2 flavors in it. . .LOL  \n\nBut the one that stands out is the Gorgonzola with pear. . .if you love gorgonzola cheese as much as I do. . .then you would have LOVED this one.  But remember once you have something and you love it. . .go back often as they change their flavors frequently!\n\nOlive Oil gelato. . .one of my all time favorites!!  Yeah I tend to like sweets with a savory twist and this totally made my day!  I could tell they had used EVOO from the first cold press as the flavor of the EVOO was very very fresh and fruity!  LOVED it!\n\nI also loved their caramel popcorn gelato. . .the flavors dead on. . .BUT I have to say that popcorn was a little soggy for me. . .\n\nPeanut Butter. . .OMG. . .heavenly!!  So creamy!!  It tasted like you were eating heavenly light spoonfuls of peanut buttery goodness!!\n\nIn other words, I have yet to have anything that I did NOT like. . .I have some that I liked over others. . .BUT everything has been delicious!\n\nWriting this review makes me wish that I had a large cup of gelati in front of me right now!!  =)\n\nAmbiance. . .it is really cute and clean. . .very bright!\n\nPeople taking my order have always been very friendly.  \n\nThey seem to be branching out into other baked goods. . .sadly I can not write a review on those as I have never gotten past the gelati!  \n\nSeriously. . .go and get some!!!  Like right now. . .go get some!!!  =)
