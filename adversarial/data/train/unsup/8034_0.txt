Eat Drink Party wasn't my first restaurant choice. However, when it's NYE and you don't have reservations or feel like braving through the crowds along the strip, this was the best option in Circus Circus. There was no wait and the restaurant wasn't even half full. I was surprised to see so many kids eating there, but then again, it is inside of Circus Circus. Food was average, but service was surprisingly good. They had a DJ on stage, but he was somewhat awkward. \n\nStarted with the firecracker wings. Given the name, I assumed these would be spicy. Maybe we received BBQ by mistake because these had no kick to them at all. On the bright side, they were fried nicely. For my entree, I had the grilled chicken and avocado burger. The chicken had a lot of flavor, the bacon was crispy, and there was a generous amount of avocado and pico de gallo. However, I found my burger to be just okay. I did really enjoy the cheddar jalapeno bun, though. The side of fries were plentiful, but again, just okay.\n\nService was excellent, with our waitress being very accommodating throughout our meal. With so many options along the Strip, not sure I'd make it back here again when I'm in town.
