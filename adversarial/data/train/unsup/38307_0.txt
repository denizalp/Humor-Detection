Although I've only been to Jewel's for pastries and cakes, it is one of my favorite bakeries in the Valley.  You wouldn't even know Jewel's divine desserts are gluten-free.  Her pastries and cakes are moist and light and packed with flavor.  With a rotating array of goodies behind the counter, you'll never be at a loss to find something sweet and delicious when you stop in.
