We try sushi places all over the valley and a lot of them are not worth the price you pay but we've been coming here for many years and I love this place. Everyone I bring here loves it too. It is definitely our go-to spot. Good prices, friendly staff, great family running it and great sushi! Love their jalepe√±o poppers and crab angels!
