Aww hate to go against the grain, but here we go.\n\nIt was dinnertime and we had some friends and family in town, who wanted the Old Town Scottsdale experience.  \n\nOpened up my trusty Yelp app, I pulled up the search \"Best Restaurants\" in \"Old Town Scottsdale\": Tommy V's was #4 on the list, and that's what our guests chose.  This was my first trip to Tommy's so I was excited seeing they had a solid 4.5 Star rating on Yelp.  \n\nI'll start by saying the restaurant itself was well decorated and had a nice atmosphere.  For 7:30 dinner on a Monday, the place was empty.  Our large party was seated near the entry way with the big glass windows.  That might have been a mistake.  It was HOT and felt as if there was no circulating air on our table.  Once our hot food came out I literally went into a hot flash and started pouring sweat.  I had to excuse myself and went to the bathroom to wipe my face down.  As I walked towards the rear of the building I could tell it was 15-20 degrees cooler and I immediately cooled off and was fine lol.  But, the table we sat at was noticeably hotter than the other side of the restaurant.\n\nThe Strawberry salad was excellent.  The use of feta cheese and the candied nuts with the vinaigrette was very tasty.  That was probably the most enjoyable thing I tried at Tommy V's.\n\nI ordered the Filet Mignon for my main course, and it was ok.  I ordered it medium but it was over cooked along the entire outer part of the steak.  There were a few bites towards the center that were not over cooked and those bites were much more tasty, juicy and flavorful.  The over cooked bites just tasted like dried chewy beef, maybe I should order medium rare next time?  \n\nIn all honesty I was expecting more... The mixture of an over-cooked $34 steak and the hot temperatures made this a 2 star experience for myself, but our guests did enjoy themselves and enjoyed their meal. \n\n3 Stars
