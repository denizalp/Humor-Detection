I see the service department has quite the reputation, I should have read the reviews here before taking my car in...anywho....\n\nI took my car there because the front passenger side tire panel broke off and was making noise when I was driving. I ended up making an appointment to get my car done because the wait time was 2.5-3 hours before my car would have been seen, i'm sorry but this place didn't look THAT busy. I made the appointment showed up on Monday, they told me it would take 40 min to an hour, no problem. I went about my day and came back almost 2 hours later and my car still wasn't ready. Finally when the sales associate came out, he whipped out this laundry list of car repairs it needed. Rear brakes: $225, this is not including drums, JUST the brakes! Power steering flush: $130, EEEEK! Transmission pan seeping oil? Huh? Anyways: $275, and last but not least Motor Mount is slightly worn but should be replaced, Price:*Drumroll*...$990 bucks, ya thats right, $990 effin dollars, really?? Then they said my two front tires should be changed which I acknowledged that it was around that time of the year, I asked how much, they said $180, with labor, no taxes included, oh and it would have been another 80 bucks for the alignment, really?? I just quoted discount tires and they offered $148 with labor and taxes out the door. Anyways, I didn't get any of the above repaired and had plans to bring my car elsewhere the following week to get the tires change,etc. Following morning as I was driving to work, my front passenger wheel tire blew out, ya call me a conspiracy theorist but this is quite the coincidence that they were messing with that same exact spot the day before, hmmmm very interesting....anyways I will NEVER EVER EVER go that there again, that place is a rip-off! Took it to Fletchers and I saved a good 80 bucks getting my tires and power steering flush done there.
