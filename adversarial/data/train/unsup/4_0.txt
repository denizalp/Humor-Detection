Rude owner! I'm a service employee that is well traveled and friendly to all. This place is very plain with a sports bar type atmosphere that can be very comforting. However, this place needs an attitude adjustment. There are dingy pool tables, mediocre food and a great expensive beer selection. The owner knocked over one of my coworkers beers on a pool table and passively walked off with no apology or acknowledgment of his mistake or our presence for that matter. Airline crews who come by these types of joints are very friendly and kind. Unfortunately, we were treated with disrespect from the owner, not to mention the way he was barking orders at the very polite wait staff. As if they were slaves.  If the owner didn't have greedy dollar signs in his eyes, and a disrespectful, socially inept demeanor then I'd be back. If you do go, tip the wait staff and tell them you are sorry their boss sucks and that they deserve better. You deserve better too, so skip this place and go somewhere that deserves your business. It's a shame to see a business ran so poorly.
