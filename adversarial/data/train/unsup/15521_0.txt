2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     26\/100\n\nMy go-to Filipino grocery market. Located within Vegas' Filipino central... If this is your first time here, as you walk in you'll also see Filipino fast food restaurants such as Chow King, Jollibee, Red Ribbon Bakery, Valerio's Bake Shop, and few new ones as well. \n\nI come here for the affordable produce, fruits and veggies I can't find at my neighborhood market. They also sell fresh fish, meats by the pound, Asian skincare, Asian or Filipino snacks, baked goods from local vendors, a variety of spam flavors, red hot dog, fried fish, and many other Filipino and Asian foods. They have a bigger selection to choose from compared to the smaller Filipino markets in Henderson. Some items are cheaper than the smaller markets around town. \n\nI like it because it's a once stop shop for most of my Filipino food needs. And on my way out, I usually stop at Valerio's Bakery for fresh Pan De Sal and either a drink from Jollibee or Chow King.
