This might be the 358th non-filtered review for Baguette Cafe, but it's the first review to mention the organic acai bowl. A favorite spot for almost three years, I walked in this morning with thoughts of fresh croissants, melted cheese, tomato pesto, and omelets, but when I saw a new menu the words açaí bowl, I went in that direction. Olivier's super cool mom described the preparation: organic açaí blended with almond milk, banana, and a touch of agave, served with granola and sweet pineapple- ananas, as she told me in French. :) Later, Olivier asked how I enjoyed the bowl and mentioned that it was inspired by his Hawaiian vacation-- not Rio, but that's OK. (mental image of Olivier at Carnavál carrying pineapples on his head goes here)\n\nIt was different from a traditional açaí bowl, but very flavorful and enjoyable. The Amazonian açaí was not thick nor overwhelmed by banana. If you prefer a smoothie texture, ask if they can accommodate. The pineapple was perfectly ripe. They carry a selection of organic bottled beverages, and the grapefruit ginger juice paired nicely with the bowl. If I type the word açaí one more time, this review will be filtered as Portuguese.\n\nThe best soups in Las Vegas are found at Baguette Cafe. I'm looking forward to summer if only for the chilled gazpacho with crunchy granité and whipped creme fraiche. I usually order a half sandwich and soup combo and am satisfied with the portions. The quiche, breakfast pastries, tarts, and desserts are all excellent.\n\nI wish Yelp would implement a filter to ignore any Elitist review that deducts a star because the reviewer thinks Baguette Cafe is hard to find or complains that this family business closes on Saturday and Sunday. Yelp responsibly, or don't be taken seriously. Bonjour!
