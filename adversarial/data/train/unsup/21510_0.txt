A GREAT PLACE TO GET FOOD POISONING!\n\nThe only thing I had to eat last Sunday was Pepe's Super Nachos with carne asada....It is Tuesday and I still am sick. I had to take off work for two days because of this place. I went to this place on a SOBER stomach and I have not eaten out in 4 days before this visit I might add. My food poisoning has been so debilitating that I am going out of my way to contact the Southern Nevada Health District as well as write this review on yelp in hopes that this doesn't happen to anyone else. \n\nIf I were you I would take a good hard look at the bad reviews on here about this place. Everything they say I have experienced personally but lets break this down logically and not emotionally why you should not spend your money here.\n\nPros:\n*Mildly mediocre food to fill you up when you are starving to death or have been drinking. \n*The carne asada usually tastes fine until you feel it a couple hours later lol.\n*They have nice TV screens for the menu.\n*The male employees are actually very helpful.\n*Open 24\/7 \n\n\nCons: \n*Racist female employees \"Adela\" and others behind the counter scowling at you before you even say hello. They will never say \"Hi\", \"Hello\", \"Welcome\", or anything to greet me personally when I order and will talk shit about me right in front of my face in Spanish as I am ordering as well. (They don't expect anyone who doesn't look Latino to understand Spanish). \n*Obnoxiously loud Latin Music blasting in your ears as you try to enjoy a meal\n*Filthy Restrooms...it looks like a torture room from a SAW movie. \n*An almost impossible parking lot...SO TINY and a ridiculous location on cross streets with so many people trying to make u-turns from Fremont and others trying to enter and exit the diagonally awkward parking lot. This means someone is always honking at others to get out of their way and I've seen two verbal fights break out from just parking issues alone. \n*Homeless people inside and outside of the store ambushing you to ask for some of your food that you just bought or for money to buy their item (bicycle they stole or equipment they could not sell next door at the pawn shop). \n*The ordering and pick up system is never working the same, one day the pick up is the ordering side and the ordering side is the pick up side and some days they are both on the same side. It's not very organized and when it gets busy everyone is huddled around each other in uncomfortable awkward irritable silences. \n*No one watches their children in here and kids constantly put their filthy hands in the covered area with the limes, onions and cilantro grabbing limes and pieces of ice. \n*If you sit at the booth right under the air conditioning vent by the covered food area it will leak moisture on your food from the ceiling vent.\n*They use nacho cheese instead of real queso, they should be ashamed of themselves for this lol really.\n*The Chorizo they use is NOT Chorizo! Chorizo is not pink! Try a chorizo and egg breakfast burrito....you'll see.\n*You can tell this place used to be an IHOP, who are they trying to fool? haha\n\nBefore anyone reads this and tells their friends reading this \"oh this is probably just one person who complains all the time\" actually I'm not, I eat here all the time but mostly when I am drunk and in a happy mood because its always open. I refuse to go anymore and would not want this case of food poisoning to be experienced by any of my worst enemies. \n\nFor all you people giving them good reviews just go when you aren't drunk or stoned and you will start to see everything more clearly.
