Went to La Belle et la Boeuf for a late lunch with my sister and an infant on a Tuesday, therefore it wasn't very busy. There was still 7-8 occupied tables out on the terrace, none inside the restaurant. \n\nWe asked to be seated outside on the terrace as it was nice and not too warm out. They promptly offered if we wanted the sunshades to be opened seeing as we had a child, which we accepted. \n\nThey opened them as we settled into our seats, I was expecting someone to bring an umbrella type shade but no, they opened up great big beautiful sunshades which had adorable rustic string lighting inside. The sunshade covered most (but not all) the tables, the ones on the edge of the terrace still had plenty of sun for those who wanted it. \n\nSo already before we had even been seated our experience was already on the up and coming. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, the drink menu is very elaborate which was awesome. There's a different drink for everyone. \n\nI had a poutine which has really good, big old portion. My sister had a salad that had blue cheese in it, she doesn't like blue cheese therefore asked for feta, after going to the kitchen the waiter promptly came back to let her know that they unfortunately didn't have any feta. He did a couple back and fourths between the kitchens and our table to make sure she got what she wanted. So bonus points for his efforts. \n\nGenerally, an all around great experience.
