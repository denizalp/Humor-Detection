Should not even get one star!!! The worst car rental I've even encountered, say they don't have the car you reserved then charge you much higher rate, and when you return it's even higher!!!  Very long lines and employees don't care, they continue to talk and eat their food. Don't bother calling, I held to dispute my bill for over an hour. \nOne word of advice, it's switch and bate on their website. DON'T USE THEY COMPANY, THEY SHOULD BE PUT OUT OF BUSINESS AT MINIMUM NOT ALLOWED AT AIRPORTS!!!\nYOU'LL BE SORRY YOU USED THEM THINKING YOUR SAVING A DOLLAR!!!
