No longer called Koi, has changed name to Sumo (and their weekend happy hour is no more.)\n\nMy wife and I sought out Koi because we remembered it being very good and the specials were also great.\n\nWell, the specials are gone, but the food is still good. The reason Koi gets three stars today though is due to the horrible smells inside the building, like someone had started a fire in a deep fryer. It also doesn't help that the venue itself is downright tiny.\n\nThe high prices aren't helping it too much either, and I don't appreciate the lack of clear information updates on any of their internet listings (Still labeled as Koi everywhere I can tell.)\n\nSo, really, Sumo Sushi isn't bad. The service is good, but with a big city like Phoenix where competition is stiff and good sushi is all over the place, there really isn't anything about it setting it apart or driving me to return anytime soon.
