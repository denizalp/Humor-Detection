Generally places that try to do too much (fusion) fail or come up short at any one thing. Here we have regular Japanese menu, hibachi, extensive sushi menu, and extensive Chinese food menu yet from what we have sampled everything was delicious. We tried two sushi rolls (sushi rolls are named and almost identical to those at Sushi Bay... odd) Paradise roll and Valley of Fire roll... both delicious and what we expected. The calamari tempura appetizer was just okay...compared to Sushi Mon's it failed miserably. We also shared an entree of General Tso's Chicken and that was fresh and delicious... pretty standard higher quality Americanized Chinese food. \n\nThe service was okay...we had three different servers and one of them annoyed me briefly. I asked for a Sapporo and she said \"Let me see your ID\" ...so basically demanded it instead of asking to see my ID. What the hell? But, everyone else was nice, the food reasonably priced for the quality and portion and it was a cute little place. I would come back to try more of their dishes.
