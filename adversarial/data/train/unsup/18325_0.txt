This place was horrid, what was to be 2-3 hrs was 5-6hrs & when you're on vacation, time is of the essence. We had a sales guy who understood that we had to get going after breakfast, could we please look at place and go? He said \"too bad, there are procedures to follow and you have to expect this\". We explained that we had family event, still nothing. He had us sitting to meet his manager, said he would try to hurry it along. My daughter went near them & listened, they were discussing sports! He knew we were in a hurry and purposefully delayed us. \n\nWhen I refused to shake the manager's hand - he called ME rude & the salesguy said \"Well you aren't buying anyway, so whatever\" - um, I had enough money to buy a suite OUTRIGHT, but they were suck dicks that I would NEVER recommend dealing with them, nevermind buying anything from them. \n\nBAD BAD BAD!
