The buildup: \nTons of articles, over 1200 yelp reviews at a 4.5 star avg. and even Michelin-starred chefs admitting to craving this place when in Vegas.\n\nThe order:\n3 asada tacos\n3 al pastor tacos\n1 small carne asada fries\n\nThe verdict:\nGood, but WAY overrated. Some of the al pastor meat was crunchy...why did they give me the burnt ends? Also, one taco had more pineapple than meat. Thanks.\n\nThe carne asada was tasty, probably better than most...salty, but not too salty, on point...so props to that.\n\nHOWEVER...If you've been to Tijuana (which is where this place originates) you can't walk a block without bumping into a better taco...on any street corner...there are even some trucks here in Vegas that put out a taco that's easily as good.
