This place is ok. Fresh food. \nOrdered Lentil soup, that was awesome. highly recommended.\nTiramisu cake was delicious.\nChicken shawarma gyro was a bit disappointing . The chicken is very tasty, don't get me wrong, and very juicy, but the sauce is too watery for a gyro, makes the bread soggy, i didn't like that. This is not shawarma. The chicken looked like it was boiled with spices, again, it tasted good, but it wasn't what i was expecting.
