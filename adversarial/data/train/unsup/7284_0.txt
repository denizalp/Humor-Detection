I wanted to give a good review, I'm sorry I can't. When we walked in the door, we were instantly confused. The atmosphere is of a high end steakhouse, but there are enough loud tv's to be a sports bar. With all the sports bars and sports books here, no one would come here to watch a game... and they kill the steakhouse feel. When we went to the bar while waiting on our table. The service was slowww. The bartender ignored us. We were helped by the service-tender, between him filling orders for the waitresses.\nOur booth was nice and comfortable for 4 people, but the table was small.  The salads were good, but slow arriving. So, of course, the meal arrived way too soon. I HATE THAT. So do you forget the salad and start eating the hot food, or finish the salad and eat a cold steak? Or send the food back to sit under a heatlamp? And remember the small table?!!!!!!\nPerson #1- the pasta was boring.\nPerson #2- the burger and mushrooms were overlooked.\nPerson #3- the steak was flavorless and tasted microwaved.\nPerson #4 (me)- the bacon filet was small. Cut several times on the edge (obviously checking for done-ness). Dry and rubbery. And it looked smaller than it actually was because there was no garnish to fill the blank area of the large plate (O platter presentation).\nThe waitress did come check on us several times, but NEVER prebused, even though I DID and used plates were stacked! Did I mention the small table?\nMy friend ordered a vodka martini at the bar, very nice presentation. When he ordered his second at the table, it was a shot of vodka in a cocktail glass with his olives carried separately in her other hand. Well, we were all so overit by this point, he just poured the shot in his empty martini glass and tossed in the olives.\nWhen we want a high-end lounge, we will go elsewhere....\nWhen we want a steakhouse, we will go elsewhere...\nWhen we want a sportsbar, we will go elsewhere...
