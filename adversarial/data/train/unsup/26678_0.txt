The weekend night laser shows are one of the must-do in Pittsburgh. Usually the Led Zeppelin show is around 10 pm on Friday night and is followed by the Pink Floyd midnight treat.\nI have always been dazzled by 45 minutes of sparkling shower in the planetarium dome. The people running the show are very friendly and will even accept requests (Dark Side of the Moon !!) if you are courteous and warn patrons to not act funny even though most people do smell funny in there !\n\nThanks to these guys for some of my best weekend times in Pitt \n\nTip - The back of the $8 coupon often has a 5$ Supercuts coupons.....
