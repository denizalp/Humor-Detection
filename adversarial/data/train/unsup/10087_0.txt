Another win for Yelp!\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nI was scrolling along my Yelp feed, and saw a fellow Yelper's posts about Pie Snob. I told the Yelper how jealous I was and that I wanted pie. He simply said, Pie Snob is in your city, just go there and get some.\n\nPIE SNOB\n\nPie Snob is owned by Traci Wilber, a mother of two and longtime Arcadia resident. She credits her mother and grandmother as being the catalyst for her pie business, and states that their pies are much better than hers, although, she has won countless awards, including the Phoenix New Times Pie Social.\n\nMs. Wilbur's workspace is an industrial kitchen custom built by her husband and home to her bakery, Pie Snob.\n\nAnd until 2017, the only way you could get one of Ms. Wilbur's pies, was to stop by her Arcadia home.\n\nLuckily for us, she now has a shop open to the public on Indian School Road, in Arcadia.\n\nTHE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE\n\nSince seeing the pies on Yelp, I couldn't wait to get some time to head over to Pie Snob.\n\nWhen I looked at the photos previously posted, I noticed two things: the unappealing strip mall for the shop and it's Arcadia location.\n\nBut, a fellow Yelper said it was fantastic, so I had to try this pie!\n\nWhen I got there, the strip mall was yuck; just not even slightly appealing to me. Also, it's hidden off the street, so I passed it a couple times, even though I had seen photos of exactly what I was looking for.\n\nThe shop looked as I expected; cutely decorated and tiny.\n\nA sweet, yet timid, for lack of a better word, employee named Kayla helped me.\n\nShe explained, there are regular mainstay pies they have every month, and seasonal monthly pies that change as the mood of Ms. Wilbur changes.\n\nOn Saturday, there was Apple Crumble, Rhubarb, Blueberry, Chocolate Cream, Key Lime, Strawberry Cream, Chocolate Brownie with Espresso, Buttermilk, and a lemon cheesecake. \n\nI got a slice of each to go, and a heated cinnamon roll to eat whilst waiting.\n\nThe heated cinnamon roll was crazy fantastic! I wish I had gotten more.\n\nI took the box of pie slices to my family dinner: I figured, I'd take my bias out of the equation and see what my family thought of these pies.\n\nFirst impressions: My family thought the 7 slices in one pie was very cute and fun. They loved the idea of pie tasting too.\n\nThen we tried the pies. Whoaaaaa DELICIOUS PIES!!\n\nEach pie was better than the next. All were amazing! My favorite was the Strawberry Cream.\n\nMy pie tasting idea was a big hit!\n\nCONCLUSION \n\nThe store is less than uneventful (2\/5). \n\nThe pies are the event (4\/5). I'd get my pies to go.\n\n4\/5 RECOMMEND \n\nOF NOTE\n\n*Tiny parking lot out front.\n\n*For more information: piesnob.com
