Bed makes my back hurt.  Heater doesn't stay warm.  I did use the lotion a lot.  I felt that I didn't have enough surface area outside of the shared nightstand.  I liked the vertical bar in the bathtub and two soap dishes so you can reach one whether you're taking a bath or shower.\n\nMy view was  of the top of the parking structure so we moved our car to that floor.  No refrigerator or wifi in classic double queen.  One bed had a rut on the left side and the other seemed too firm.  The bathroom has a lot of counter space.  The best stations on the TV only seemed to be Biography and NHK.  \n\nThe pillows poke (feathers?).  The tub drained fine.  The water was hot quickly enough.  There is no work desk, just a small round table surrounded by a couple of chairs and lamp.  We didn't need to ask for extra towels.
