Another visit to Raku and had another stellar experience at the kitchen bar.  One thing that I tried to do different this time was to order things I've haven't had before.  Even though I've been to Raku five times already, there were still plenty more things on and off their menu that I've yet to try.\n\nOn to the food.  So pretty much everything except for the last two items were all new dishes for me.\n\nMushoom Salad Complimentary Appetizer -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1BCj0L6\nThis was their amuse-bouche for the day.  I love mushrooms so this was a very good way to start off my dinner.\n\nPoached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1GYp7JQ\nNot only was this appetizer photogenic, it was really good!  Of course anything with a runny egg is good in my book.  And the uni and roe combo was creamy and surprisingly not too salty.  I'd would definitely order this again!\n\nBraised Abalone Special with Dashi Gravy -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1ex5NsV\nThis was off of their specials board.  And I'm glad I ordered it.  I have never had abalone before so this was a new experience for me.  The abalone was grilled, sliced up, and smothered with gravy.  I was thinking that it was going to have a very strong fishy taste, but that wasn't the case.  It was almost like eating a lobster or monkfish where it had a chewy texture and it would take a long time to chew out the flavor which had a lot of umami thanks to the dashi gravy.  Delicious!\n\nGrilled Langoustine -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1GxVpda\nAs I was eating my appetizer, I was peering over to their seafood table behind the bar and saw these amazing looking Langoustines.  I had to have one so immediately ordered it.  It was good!  The Langoustine was grilled to perfection where it was easily removable from the shell and the meat was very tender and flavorful.  It was worth the impulsive splurge.\n\nDuck with Balsamic Soy Sauce -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1I4MPoL\nI ordered this last time I here and it was still just as good.  The duck was grilled nicely and had a very rich flavor with the Balsamic Soy Sauce.\n\nGrilled Foie Gras with Black Garlic and Glazed Soy-based Sauce -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/1Ncae7D\nWhat better way to finish my meal off than with a stick of their famous grilled foie gras.  It actually has been a while since I last ordered this so I figured it was worth another go around.  They really don't hold back with the portion size as you can see from the pic.  It's a very generous sized piece of foie gras.  And it was so good.  I love how they include a piece of black garlic to give it a more intense flavor.  I'll be alternating between this and their Foie Gras Steamed Custard from now on.  As much as I'd like to have both as the same time, it'd be better for me to keep them separate since they're equally rich and exquisite.\n\nRaku does it again for me with their great service and impressive dishes.  I'm so happy to see that business is still doing well for them.  Reservations are still hard to get here as I found that out from another customer that she made her reservation almost a month in advance.  Hopefully with their recently announced expansion, it'll be much easier to get a reservation and should provide more tables for walk-ins as well.  There's still plenty more for me to try at Raku, so expect another review from me in the near future.
