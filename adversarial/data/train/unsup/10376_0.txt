the first thing you notice about this place when you walk in is the beer pong table. its got motorized ball driers and washers. thats pretty sick! dunno if it was custom made or bought, but its pretty nice. \n\n2nd thing i noticed was the seats backs were at weird angles. you know what i mean when you sit down. \n\nordered the shoyu ramen. lots of pork! broth had really good flavor. \n\nwaitress was very talkative and attentive.\n\nbathroom signs are funny.
