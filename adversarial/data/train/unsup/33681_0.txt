The long wait for the food was not worth it. My partner's meal came bits and pieces all separately instead of together - they even forgot the fruit until we reminded them. I couldn't finish my benny because the hollandaise was way too fatty. Though yummy for the first couple bites the heaviness of the meal ruins it. Potatoes nothing great about them. Same with pancakes. I wanted to like it - it's closeby and it seems to really support local businesses via their placemat ads. Unfortunately I cannot recommend them and would not go back. If you don't have over an hour to sit around for mediocre food then don't come here.
