Chill atmosphere, decent vegan options and moderate prices; why did it take me so long to visit?\n\nThe Diamond has lots of local drama drama in how it came to be (and how The Penguin came to suck). For more reading! Look at others' reviews or google it.\n\nNow to focus on the place itself: comfy booths, dim lighting, and very popular to the alternative-sort of people without Charlotte. This place is one of the Must-Go's in Plaza Midwood.\n\nThe food is as diner traditional as they can get (while still adding a modern flourish). I have the Jumbo Soy Dog which came with meatless chili, mustard, onions and coleslaw on it. I was pretty impressed and quite happy.\n\nEven though much of the menu is barred off to do due to my veganism and hatred of greasy food, I'll definitely be back!
