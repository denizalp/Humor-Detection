Flavours for the sauce were good; both garlic butter and Boil King sauce are distinct but great. Cajun fried rice was extremely underwhelming given that there was nothing \"cajun\" about it - squid was not seasoned at all. Overall a very unique concept in the Entertainment District, but the price point is on the higher end. Would be 4 stars if they adjusted pricing a bit relative to the amount of food. Definitely worth a try though, just not 100% sure about coming back.
