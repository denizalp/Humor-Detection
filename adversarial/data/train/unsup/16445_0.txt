NO CONCEALED CARRY...  Saw this sign on the front door.  They do not support a persons right to carry concealed, thus giving them the ability to protect themselves and their family.  I decided to take my business to Steak and Shake.  I will not be attending bike night, and I will make sure that CBA along with SOH know of the non protection policy.  There was no problem with two felons shooting at each other a couple of weeks ago, who WERE CARRYING ILLEGALLY.  Rock House, DID They obey your no carry sign?  Thus your management endangered EVERYONE present that night.
