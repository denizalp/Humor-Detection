I usually go to the cafe on w lake mead and they're fabulous with everything. Something changed my mind this time. I went to the one on rampart and I did a to go order over the phone. The customer service was out of this world! I was pretty upset due to the fact that they were out of a lot of things that I had ordered. The assistant manager and one of the associate trainers were so kind and payed for my meal!! They greeted me with smiles and were so happy to help me! I'll be visiting this one more often!
