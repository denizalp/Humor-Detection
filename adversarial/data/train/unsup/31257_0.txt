Wow!! If they can deliver these dishes during restaurant week then we must go back! A very stylish setting; great ambience and a super vibe. The restaurant was full yet service was prompt and top class; food came quick, superbly plated  and very tasty. There were three of us so we got to taste a good deal of the menu and not one plate disappointed. Kudos too for a cheese-plate as a desert during Queens Feast. Our server had good wine recommendations. The only drawback I would say is the bar is very small; maybe by design, but it makes it hard to drop in without a reservation to have an appetizer or two and glass of wine (or two).
