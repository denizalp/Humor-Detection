Fantastic take out spot. A great take out spot for a quick bit of thin crust or call a head and get a great deep dish pizza. It is a rare pizza place that dishes out a deep dish pie, and Pizza Chicago puts together a great sausage, mushroom and onion pie that's thick with sauce and cheese. the crust is a light cornmeal dough that is crisp and moist on the inside. We will definitely be ordering again. The wait of 45 minutes is worth it. I think I might call right now!
