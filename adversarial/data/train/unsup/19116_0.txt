Da Vinci - The Genius Exhibit:  Bucking the trend again.  A ton of poor reviews and I think different.  \n\nLet me start by thanking Vanessa V. for giving me the heads up that this exhibit was ending today. I knew about this exhibit back in September 2012, but took it for granted that it will always be here.  Then I read the reviews and thought, probably not worth the trip.  But after hearing from Vanessa that it was a must see and ending on 1\/27\/2013, I had to make a stop and glad I did.  Cristina P. happened to be free and decided to come with.\n\nThe biggest issue with everyone is the hefty $27 price or $22 if you're local. I've also learned that when you live in Vegas, it also doesn't hurt to ask if there's a special price for special locals.  If my charm didn't work, the worse that can happen is that I pay $22 each for me and Cristina P.  The cashier told me that she would make it $10 and I was stoked.  I was about to enter Da Vinci the Genius, but felt like Mel the Genius.  Didn't matter now how good or bad the exhibit was, I felt like I just made money because I paid only $10 per person. Score!!\n\nThe exhibit is small and the entrance starts with highlights of Da Vinci's birth to death.  The rooms are separated into his inventions, ideas, the Last Supper, and the Mona Lisa.  Da Vinci's ideas ranged from tools, weapons, inventions, a scuba suit, and even a robot (yes, he was that far ahead of his time).  My favorite had to be the short film on the \"Last Supper\", the Mona Lisa section, and the mirror room. The mirror room is simply a small room of angled mirrors where everything looks like it goes on and on (Think Bruce Lee of Enter the Dragon). \n\nAlso in the exhibit, there's a sales person attempting to sell some of Da Vinci's \"Horse and Rider\" cast molds.  No price is posted and you know what that means.  Means baller price.  I actually entertained the thought of buying one, but think the price of $20,000 per cast mold is $19,900 more than my budget.  \n\nPictures and touching is prohibited, but that didn't stop Cristina P. from snapping a few photos for me to add to Yelp.  Overall, I am a fan of this exhibit. I expected worse after reading the other reviews, but was amazed by the sheer brilliance of Da Vinci.  By the time you read this review, the exhibit will be over.  Maybe in a different location, maybe in another town.  Regardless, at only $10 Da Vinci the Genius was worth it.  \n\nPS.  Thanks Vanessa V. for giving me the heads up.  Thank you Cristina P. for putting up with my last minute invites.
