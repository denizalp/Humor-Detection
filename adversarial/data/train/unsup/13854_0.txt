Bought an acoustic guitar for my wife's birthday as a surprise.  The staff helped out a lot when showing me a selection of models that fit her hand and body size.  \n\nWhen she opened it she wanted to exchange it for another model with a better looking top.  The staff was excellent in the exchange process.  Great shop run by guitar enthusiasts.
