This was the first store I went into on my first trip to Kensington Market, and boy was I delighted!\n\nSometimes, when I see a neat place with all sorts of antique-y fun junky sort of stuff I begin humming that song from the Little Mermaid, you know the one that goes \"...Look at this trove, treasures untold\nHow many wonders can one cavern hold?...\" Indeed. Funky Junky, I want to be part of your world.\n\nThey had quite a collection of art, furniture, glasses, old video games, SHOES!, magazines, and random decor. AND, the best part about it: It was reasonably priced! I cannot stand vintage stores that try to cheat you out of a million bucks from something that you could have probably found if you looked hard enough in your Grandma's attic.\n\nMy boyfriend and I settled on buying a water pitcher in the shape of a Penguin. Like I said, really neat random stuff.\n\nOne more comment: We were able to talk to the woman working the store at the time, and she was great! I'm pretty sure it was the same woman who the previous reviewer had spoken about.I love that in Canada people speak to you instead of just hiding behind the counter like they do elsewhere. She was really helpful and answered all of our questions about where the store gets their stuff and whatnot and what sort of treasures would be in next week. Super nice!
