I would stay here again. My husband and I booked a package through Costco. We stayed 4 nights for less than 300 dollars. They do charge an unexpected resort fee that I now know all vegas hotels are doing. \n\nThe room was great: good size, clean, good design, nice bathroom.  The hotel has a nice location on the strip. The casino part obviously smells like smoke, but once you go up into the hallways of the rooms, the smell is no longer there. \n\nIt came with free wifi and other standard amenities.
