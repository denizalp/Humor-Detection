So I'm basing this review on the experience I had and based on the meal I had. \n\nCame here with a buddy - we had very different experiences. \n\nOrdered the pork bone soup. I was introduced to this dish at Owl of Minerva and I came to appreciate a certain performance level. \n\nThe soup from the get go was scattered with bone fragments. I know it's a bone type soup but there is no bloody reason why you should almost ingest a mouthful of bone fragments upon first bite. Without warning. \n\nLet's break it down: \n- the meat. Honestly it was like -5 points from Owl of Minerva where I fell in love with Pork Bone soup. The broth hadn't matured enough and the meat was less in quantity. What irked me the most was the bits and pieces of unexpected and unnecessary bone pieces. I had to be careful I'm almost every bite not to ingest the bone. \n\nOwl is definitely more whole when it comes to the bone - which I think is the right way to go. \n\nThat on top having to wait forever for our kimchi and other goods - the best this place should receive in my books is a solid 3*. Listen this place is not terrible. But there are definitely better places. So trust your gut, eat well and do what you gotta do.
