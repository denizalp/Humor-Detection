Why did no one decide to bring me here until now? This place is a hidden gem and I quickly learned from the friendly lady at the cashier that Kaiju is one of the top restaurants in the GTA. Trust me, she wasn't lying. We ordered the classic chicken katsu curry with rice. What I like about the katsu is that it is fried perfectly crisp but doesn't feel oily. As well, the coleslaw is a nice touch to balance the flavour-filled dish. The cherry on top to the great food was that the service was amazing despite this being a food court. The lady at the cashier (assuming the owner) was super cute bringing the food over and checking up on us after the meal. As a side note, on Saturdays, they also offer tofu cheesecake which I will be back for next time!
