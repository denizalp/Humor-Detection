I am in here on a regular basis. I have noticed three things. There seems to be a general \"we don't care about you\" attitude from the staff. Some of them are good but most of them, specifically the tall guy with dark hair and a beard, have really shitty attitudes. I have noticed that Mr. passive-aggressive-hipster-artist-beard guy consistently pulls your cup out early from under the espresso spout and he does this for all drinks, unless he decides to bless you with having the full amount. I am not the only one who noticed. The food is decent if the bearded lady isn't the one who makes it. I suggest requesting someone else makes your shit if he is working, and if he is the only one working just skip it because he seems intent on making it a bad experience.
