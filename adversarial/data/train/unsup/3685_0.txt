For months, I've heard amazing things about Sage and was planning the dinner I would have in my head.  But when I got there, I made a last minute change.  Instead of the tasting menu, I went with the Oysters with Tobasco sorbet to start and Kobe Skirt Steak for my entree. \n\nPlus, I knew I could count on my dining companion to go with the Signature Tasting Menu.  This was an experience! Our waiter informed us that it required 2 1\/2 hours and he wasn't kidding.  If you have the time, this is the way to do Sage right.  Also did the beer pairing for $39 and every course was complemented by a unique beer.  Naturally, I tried everything!  The standout courses were the rabbit (I'm sorry Bugs Bunny.  I had no idea you taste so good!!) and the 48 hour beef belly.  Have tried pork belly several times and this was such a cool dish.  Definitely less fatty than pork, but melted in your mouth.  Truly incredible.\n\nAs for my food - - those oysters were phenomenal.  I was worried the tobasco sorbet would overwhelm the oyster but my worries were for naught.  I may go back soon just to have a few martinis and these oysters that's how much I loved these!  The Kobe skirt steak was also fantastic.  Cooked perfectly and nicely paired with grilled brussel sprouts, a little spinach and these things that looked like tater tots until you cut into them and discovered what Sage calls potato puree (call a spade a spade - it's mashed potatoes people).\n\nOne of my favorite parts was the country bacon bread roll with Sage's homemade butter and sea salt.  I had two of these suckers and I almost always skip bread.  Unfortunately, I ate them so fast I didn't take a photo.\n\nService was flawless and the dining room is so sexy.  Can't say enough great things about this place.  Wonderful!  Also cool - the after-dinner drinks include several types of Absinthe.  I would never drink that crap but enjoyed watching a few couples around me order it!
