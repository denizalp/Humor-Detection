I really shouldn't have gone here. What the crap is that $65 fitting fee? I've never been charged any such thing. BEFORE my exam, I was told my insurance would pay for it. AFTER my exam, I was asked to cough up the cash and the receptionist got really pushy (and rude) with me and told me (laughing) \"Insurance doesn't pay for that!\" Wow.\n\nBefore that--they dialated me. Didn't tell me before hand \"hey by the way, we'll be dialating you today. You might want to have someone with you to drive you and you probably won't be able to return to work.\" THAT would have been nice. But no no no--dialated me and told me what the drops were AFTER they put them in--I was pissed. I couldn't see. So they gave me the \"reversal drops.\" DON'T USE THOSE!! Oh my goodness, it made it worse--I was trapped in the shopping center next to the office (where Harris Teeter and PetSmart are), I couldn't see near nor far, I needed to get back to work but couldn't see my dash in my car much less other vehicles or traffic lights, I got an immense headache, and became physically ill from the dizziness and blurred vision. Worst experience of my life. Needless to say--I couldn't return to work, and I had to wait in my car (because I couldn't see to even walk around a store AND the lights were so bright)... I waited in my car over an hour for someone else to take off work and come rescue me. Had to leave my car there overnight. \n\nI saw Dr. Vaziri. He was nice and wanted to know how I found them. Honestly they were the only optometrists close to my work that my insurance listed they would cover in network. I will take the extra time next time to go to someone rated well.
