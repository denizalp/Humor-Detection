I enjoyed the atmosphere AND food!\nBartenders were very nice and friendly even when it got very crowded. They have their original cocktails, which are nice if you feel adventurous.\n\nNice variety of oysters to enjoy as well.\n\nIt gets busy very quick on Friday nights, which tells you something about the place!
