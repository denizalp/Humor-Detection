Ordered a small pepperoni pizza 6\/5\/14. I always test out a new pizza joint with the pizza they cannot mess up, Pepperoni. \nIt was on par with Peter Piper Pizza. Edible, but not impressive. \nThey do not have a soda fountain, nor ice cubes. You drink out of a bottle or can. \nGot home, an hour later I was sitting on the ceramic throne...something was wrong with that pizza. Sorry, I will not ever be back.
