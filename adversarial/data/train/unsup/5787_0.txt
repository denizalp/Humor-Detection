The Wynn was cool, but I'm a Bellagio guy. \n\nFirst of all the service was really good, and I loved the intimate feel of the poker room. Our room was huge, but compared to some of the other rooms in town, it felt a little tacky. \n\n3 things I wasn't impressed with:\n\n1. The European pool. It should be called the Sausage Pool.\n2. The buffet was good, but not Bellagio good.\n3. Like I said, the wallpaper was like I stepped back into 1977.
