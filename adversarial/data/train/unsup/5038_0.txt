This was about my third trip to Wild Wing Cafe. I had been before for lunch and often their all-you-can-eat-wings-and-tater-tots-bar. It was, at best, meh. \n\nToday I decided I would forgo the sticky-hands experience of wings and order some boneless wings. Or as they call them here, \"nuggets\". They had a sampler platter... choose 5 wings or nuggets of 5 flavors  - 25 wings for around $20. I wanted to try several flavors so I went with that. \n\nI would bother to remember the flavors I tried, but it hardly matters:\n \nIn a word - Sucked. \nIn two words - They sucked. \n\nIn case I'm not being clear - All 25 of these boneless chicken nuggets sucked big-time. \n\nThe flavors ranged from salty to oh-my-God-but-that-is-salty. . \n\nBut, not one to turn away food in front of me, or send something back, I did eat about half of them, but that stopped once I ran out of ranch dressing and blue cheese to liberally coat these disturbingly scrotum-like \"nuggets\".
