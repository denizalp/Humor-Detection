this hotel was really fantastic, great rooms with a view,wonderful beds, great staff and a little quiet for las vegas. just because it's off the strip doesn't make it a bad place. it's a half a block from the strip and right across the street from bally's                                                             i stayed here because i won a 3 days weekend stay from a ellen show taping. it was worth it.
