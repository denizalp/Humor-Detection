As the other reviewer said, each JJ has a standard layout\/protocol. Aside from the fact that they are usually SUPER noisy, I can't stop myself from craving their delightfully, refreshing concoctions. My current fav is the Acai Super-Antioxident--totally FABULOUS!\n\nIt's a great way to start the day or for an afternoon pick me up. If you've never had a JJ, dont' put it off any longer.
