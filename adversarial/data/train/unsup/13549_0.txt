I came today to get 2 pizzas for my kids' lunch.  I got there at 11.50am, they open at 11.30am.  I asked for two 7\" pizzas.  The server goes to ask one of the cooks, if they have any.  He says no, they only have 12\" dough and the dough maker ain't coming to work till later.  HELLO? WTH? Why can't you use the dough you do have and serve customers that are in the store?  You could have even split one dough to make me the 2 pizzas.\n\nSuch a shame because I like their UK style pizzas but the place is run by a bunch of muppets.
