Came here for dinner not too long ago because I was craving thai food. The restaurant had a romantic feel to it and the walls had racks of wine up (they had an extensive wine menu). \n\nI had the duck fried rice, tom yum salmon with bok choy, and the chinese broccoli with crispy pork. I'm used to going to thai restaurants that serve food in family size portions, so the sizes of the portions here are a bit small. Luckily I only went with one other person, so three plates were enough to get us full.\n\nFor some reason, everything seemed to be a bit salty to me (it might have just been me though because we also went to mastro's the next day and I thought the food there was also salty). My boyfriend thought everything was fine. Out of the three dishes we ordered, the duck fried rice was my absolute favorite. I've found myself to crave it every so often, but have yet to find a restaurant in California that does it as well as Chada Thai. \n\nI was really looking forward to the chinese broccoli with crispy pork because I love all things pork and crispy, but found myself chewing on really tough pieces that were almost inedible. The tom yum salmon was a very interesting concept, but this was the plate that I found to be on the salty side.\n\nThe duck fried rice was enough to make me want to go back though.
