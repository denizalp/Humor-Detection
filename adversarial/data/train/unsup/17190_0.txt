If it's one think I've learned in adulthood, it's to spend the money on quality and you can't go wrong. Took in my broken Kirby and not only did they fix it quickly, but even sold me another smaller oreck for my stairs and car (those kirbys can get heavy ). I'm already in love with the new one and plan to head back for my carpet shampooing needs. Kevin helped me and he was very nice and conversational and even answered my endless line of questions. He can definitely help you find the right solution for your needs (especially if your dealing with pets and pet hair). Thanks guys.
