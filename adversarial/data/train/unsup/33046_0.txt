Stopped in on a Friday evening and it was already fairly crowded downstairs by 6 or 6:30 so my husband and I sat at the bar - had really great service by he bartender Jarvis, tried a flight of beer and ordered nachos (huge!) and poutine (my first time trying and it was delicious here). I had read good things about this place and the neighborhood and it did not disappoint. \n\nGreat place to try in Toronto for some local fare.
