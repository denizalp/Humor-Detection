\"Duuuuuuude, we gotta hit Wet Republic to see _____\" - Every Visiting Friend\n\nI took the plunge... and was pleasantly surprised. There was no line to get in (cloudy skies, post-labor day) and we breezed past security. Cover was $50, which suuucks. Next time an internet search for a guest list or a text to a promoter has got to happen. I'm sure this varies by day, but the crowd wasn't bad at all. No aggressive meatheads, no snooty ladies, no crooks stealing our phones, just a chill group looking to have fun. I give them extra props on the drinks. $30 for a drink is usually a sign for me to bounce, but these drinks were massive. In a town where some pools sell you $18 Corona, a plastic bottle with at least 4 drinks worth of top shelf liquor at that price ain't half bad. So, get on the guest list, splash when the beat drops, and you'll be just fine here.
