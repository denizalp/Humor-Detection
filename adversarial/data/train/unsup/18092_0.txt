They just opened three days ago. It's the first time I've been in the Lab. They offer more than 1000 cocktails according to the waitress.\nI was impressed first by the beaker on the bar. I haven't seen one in years since my high school. Real thing, like in the chem lab.  I thought those are for decor but the drink we ordered required the beaker instead of the shaker. i had a Japanese sake martini and my husband had a dry martini.\nI love the design of their menu and the background music. Everything was just perfect. \nThey have a huge selection of cocktail. Can't decide which one to have? Just describe what base you like and what tone you may want. The bartender will have something for you. \nOur bartender Tony was amazing. He really got some techniques for the drink. He is so cool. Will come again\n\nThe most important thing they own a Pokemon Gym.
