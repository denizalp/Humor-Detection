I was driving to a job training class, dreading having to attend because I have been fighting off a cold for 3 weeks. I am constantly losing my voice, and nothing really seems to work to prevent it besides a nice cup of hot tea. \n\nSick, unable to speak, and a little dizzy from all of the pills my doctors have me taking, I pulled into Dutch Bros. Coffee. \n\nI couldn't really speak to get my order out, but they were patient with me. I chose a tea, and they actually suggested one that would be better for my sore throat. \n\nThey even added a little caramel and honey to it for me at no extra charge. \n\nThanks guys. You have definitely earned a repeat customer in me!
