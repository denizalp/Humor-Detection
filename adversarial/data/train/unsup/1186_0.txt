I'd give this restaurant 0 stars if I could. I've visited this location numerous times over the past few years it's been open & have received okay service in the past. My most recent visit on 9\/23\/15 will be my last. My brother & I were out & decided to grab some brunch. Since this was the closest breakfast\/lunch establishment in vicinity to my house I picked US EGG.  Our server was Caitlin. She was unpleasant  from the beginning & we initially ignored it. But as time went on, her attitude could no longer be ignored. The interesting thing is she didn't treat her other tables the way she treated ours. She didn't even bother to check on us once she brought our orders. Once we were done & she came to bring the bill, she had the nerve to ask if we needed anything else! I guess it's a miracle to find decent service anymore. Needless to say, she received no tip & I'm now yelping 1 star. The food is overpriced for the quality & the selection is very limited. My advice, stay home & eat a bowl of cereal.
