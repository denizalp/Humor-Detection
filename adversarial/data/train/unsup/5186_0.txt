Not much experience with Bar at Times Square other than to say that they have a wonderful happy hour!  Located in New York New York, this bar serves happy hour specials from 4-8pm!  My $6 choice was a very nice margarita with a double shot!  The bartender was exceptional, and she was chatty enough to make you feel as though she wasn't just going through the motions!
