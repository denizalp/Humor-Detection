STAY AWAY-unless you enjoy paying too much for used clothing that is often in very poor shape (I agree with other reviewers-overwhelming inventory and a lot of goodwill type digging to be done). But my biggest complaint is the \"trade\" system, read on:\n\nI used to love this store-I was quite loyal. However, now that the Scottsdale location has expanded, I have run into too many disappointments, First of all, requiring loyal customers (who LITERALLY provide the owner's inventory) to pay a $5.00 pick up fee for EACH item the client wants back (due to not selling-being marked down very low or what have) is BS. Although I realize that there is overhead and picking up has the potential for abuse, a system needs to be put in place that is more fair to the client. But, that's not what really bothers me: last time around I took in at least 50 items and they \"consigned\" at least 30 of them. Some of these were designer pieces. They all get thrown into a bin and you never know what they are being marked at. I used to receive a decent cut, but now I can't help but feel that my items are just a few of many that get lost in the shuffle-I barely received anything (around $100) last time around and have no idea what my items sold for-it just all rings a bit fishy in my book. Other resale shops disclose your pricing on your items to you, not this place-they simply give you a paper that shows how many items they are taking. In addition, the prices have gone WAY up-must be to cover the rent of that huge space-it would be fine if the items were of stellar quality, but I find so many damaged (holes, stains, pilling etc.) on the clothing now that I don't even go into look. There are other options in town (and internet sources), and I plan on taking advantage of them in the near future. I think MSC may have gotten a little big for its britches-pun intended.
