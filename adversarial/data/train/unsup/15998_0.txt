Yea it's a beautiful place and I do appreciate that there is an outside patio also. However...I had the worse experience here.  Me and my girlfriend went alone and immediately the owner escorted us in- surpassing the lines- so yea- we were thinking  \"Hot damn, we just got in, no qualms about it\"... so  anyway- he takes us to VIP.  VIP consists of rich old hairy overbearing married men who wanna get fresh with woman half their age while wifey thinks they're out on business. \n\nThe owner made sure we were given unlimited refills on our watery vodka-cranberries and then proceeded to tell us  \"DANCE\"- as in- entertain the chauvinists! They tried to grab at us and told my friend to give them  'head'- I'm sorry I'm trying to keep this as PG as possible. \n\nDon't go here unless you're in a big group. Otherwise- the music sucks, the people are unattractive, overbearing, and old, and well  I don't need to say much more. \n\nIt's not a safe place to be, nor is it the least bit 'fun'. \n\nVegas is supposed to be fun right?
