Came by with a colleague during lunch time. It just so happens that Summerlicious is on: $15 dollar for Appetizer, Main Course and Desert. I started with soup, had a porn shank for main course and ended with a Lemon Cheese cake. My colleague had Beef Carpaccio, Risotto and Creme Brûlée. Both the appetizer and main courses are nicely done but the deserts felt like they were store bought. The overall dining experience was above average and for the price; we couldn't be happier. \n\nWe'll definitely give it another try of their regular menu in the future.
