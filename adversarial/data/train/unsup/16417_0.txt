Popped in for a quick lunch.  I don't consume any bread products so a burger is a real treat.  I was very disappointed. Asked for a bacon cheeseburger and asked if it was \"real\" cheddar and not that processed \"fake\" cheese.  I was told it was real cheddar, which it was not! For $9.69 I expect real cheddar.  They made me a new one, without the cheese.  It was an average burger, nothing to say I would consider coming back especially as a cheat food.
