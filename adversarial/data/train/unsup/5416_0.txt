We came here for lunch on the weekend and had a wonderful experience. The ambience is very nice, with a cute outdoor patio that opens into the restaurant and a bar in the center. \n\nWe had so much trouble deciding what to eat since everything looked delicious! They have a brunch menu as well on the weekends, but the lunch menu seemed more enticing since there were more seafood options. \n\nWe started with the Pan Roasted Mussels which is one of the best mussel dishes we've ever had- such plump juicy mussels!\n\nFrom their sushi menu we had the Lobster Tobanjan Roll. I liked that it tasted very light and fresh. It doesn't have a particular strong flavor though. \n\nWe also had the Thai Style Crab Salad which was to die for and I highly recommend. It had just the right amount of light citrus tang and peanut flavor with generous cuts of Crab. Perfect flavor combination. I don't normally find salads delicious but I gobbled this one right up. \n\nFood came out quickly and service was great. \n\nI loved how they gave us mini-cookie samples on the way out! They sell delicious cookies by the door.
