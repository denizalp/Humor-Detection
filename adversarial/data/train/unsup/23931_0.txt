I was excited to visit The Linq & the new plaza because of the ads\/e-mails from Vegas. Unfortunately, The Linq & the plaza is nothing special...It's pretty to see at night and the ferris wheel moves REALLY REALLY SLOW. What's interesting is that there are different prices and if you don't book ahead, the tickets to ride the ferris wheel is about $60\/person (NOT WORTH IT IMO). I would much rather take that $60 to the tables or spend it on food. \n\nThere are a couple of shops\/restaurants in the plaza such as Sprinkles (Yes, this one has the cupcake atm machine) & the polaroid store, Kitson, etc. Not many stores that people would frequent.\n\nAlthough the plaza is sandwiched between ghetto\/old casinos (The Quad, formerly Imperial Palace, O'sheas, and the Flamingo),the restrooms are great here. Really clean and doesn't smell because each toilet has air freshners that work when you flush. There are mints in the restroom too and someone to open the door for you.\n\nNot really worth it to go out of your way to check this place out.
