I don't like going to the movies very often and I remember why...it's not so much the theater itself, but a reminder of HOW inconsiderate other people can be.\n\nI end up sitting BEHIND some moron who not only feels compelled to rock excessively in the theater seat, but continues checking their stupid \"electronic device\" for messages every 10 minutes...nothing like the illuminating cell phone light to add to the whole experience.\n\nPlease tell me WHY anyone feels that it's perfectly OK to bring ALL of your little kids to an R-rated or PG-13 movie and allow them to kick the seat in front of them? There were so many little toddlers, plus a crying baby in a stroller in the entire theater to see \"Iron Man 2\"....for a moment I thought I wandered into the wrong theater that was playing a Disney flick. \n\nPARENTS:: LEAVE the little kids at HOME!!! Or wait for DVD!!!\n\nI wonder if people who leave piles of candy wrappers and giant drink cups strewn about the aisles do this at home or in their car? I suppose they do. I guess it's too much activity for them to carry it out to discard it into the trash can on their way out of the theater. I feel so badly for the employees who have to clean up garbage left by lazy customers.\n\nOK, about the 4-stars...(non-MSG) yummy popcorn toppings, clean restrooms, clean theaters, parking has been plentiful, & quick moving ticket lines (sometimes). I do like this Harkins.
