We just moved into a new house three weeks ago and our hot water heater decided to spring a leak on a Sunday morning.  This company got good reviews on Yelp so we decided to give them a call.  Since it was a Sunday we were afraid we wouldn't be able to get anyone.  Amber called me right back and said she could have someone respond with half an hour.  The plumber that came over was extremely professional and knowledgeable.  He gave us suggestions on what we could do but we just wanted a new hot water heater so we could be confident that we wouldn't have another problem for a few years.  Of course he stopped the leak, drained the old heater and took it away.  The next day they arrived with a new heater much earlier than originally anticipated (yay).    The guy that installed the heater did the neatest and cleanest work that we've ever seen!  These were truly the most professional, efficient, and nicest plumbing company we've ever dealt with.  Needless to say we wouldn't think of calling anyone else in the future.
