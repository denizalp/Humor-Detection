Worst possible experience ever. Can't find any kind of customer service throughout the store whatsoever.  When we finally find a live body, we're told to go and find \"them\" to help in that department.  Great another 30 minutes of searching for another live body. Finally, we think we'll get help....and get told things in acronyms.  So I guess I need to be a computer geek to shop here to understand it all. Then he says\" It's an acronym.\" No shit Sherlock. I was asking what it stood for and what's the difference between the two that we were looking at.  Totally hate places that make hard working people feel like idiots. Guess this idiot will go spend my hard earned money elsewhere.
