One of the bottom 3 restaurants in my entire life.\n1) The place is filthy. Floor had food on it, table was sticky.\n2) The girl at the counter was rude.\n3) I ordered Kung Pao Chicken. It had no pepper and no peanuts and was EXACTLY the same plate as my friend that ordered Teriyaki chicken. It was neither Kung Pao OR Teriyaki.\n4) We asked what was up with the order, they said they were out of peanuts, peppers and teriyaki sauce.\n5) We asked for our money back and they refused to refund money even though we did not get what we ordered and did not eat what they gave us.\n6) I happened to notice that you also have to pay full price for refills, even tea.\n\nThis was over a year ago, but I forgot to rate it then....\nHorrible horrible establishment.\nIf you want dirty rude atmosphere with low end food that you did not order, go here for sure.
