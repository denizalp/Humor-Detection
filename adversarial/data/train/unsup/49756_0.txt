Great event for the entire family. Tickets are expensive, but once you get into the gates there's so much to do for all ages. I highly suggest packing a cooler and heading back to the car when the crew gets hungry. Unless you're totally down to spend $15 on nachos...have at it! \n\nOh, bring sunscreen.
