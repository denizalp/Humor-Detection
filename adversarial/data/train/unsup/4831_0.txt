7\/01\/10\n\nI've had Tortas El Guero bookmarked for a couple of weeks when a friend told me of the wonderful torta she had here recently, I thought I'd visit it on my next days off.  Came in prior to 430p, and the woman manning the counter could not speak any English at all.  Good thing I still retained a little of basic Spanish to request that a few ingredients be omitted.  (Had I waited till 5p, I'd have no problem w\/ the bilingual Caucasian server that arrived.)  \n\nChose the carne asada torta, and the bread was good.  However, the filling was very sparse.  I suggest that TEG either use smaller-sized bread, or up the filling a bit!  The cost of the sandwich is definitely too high-- I wouldn't order this same sandwich for that price again (especially when I could order a huge serving that is equally as tasty, perhaps more so, at Phoenix Ranch Market-- the telera bread there is amazing!).  Indeed, I had to order two side tacos for their meat contents (pastor y carne asada) to be able to fill in the rest of the torta :(  Based on what I tried, if I were to come back, I'd order the pastor.  I don't think I'll be back, though.\n\n(I will, however, visit the Michoacan ice cream parlor again next door!!  The coffee and mango flavors I tried were delicious!  What I wouldn't do to have some of the coffee right now...)
