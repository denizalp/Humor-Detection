Waw. I have given this establishment 3 chances and now I am ready to describe my feelings. The title is very descriptive of the experience because it feels like it's ran by a drop out. After waiting about an hour for a table, prepare for at least a 2 hour overpriced meal. The food is artesian inspired but is more basic tasting than an Instagram selfie with no filter. I'm surprised I even got my food after waiting 45+ minutes every time I've had the displeasure of dining here. My drink (the only good thing) was constantly empty and I never received an extra side of ketchup after 3 attempts. I'm convinced Chingy receives better service than this \"chillin' at the Holiday Inn\" ... Their \"scratch kitchen\" also ran out of tortilla chips AND meatloaf... UNFORGIVABLE. \n\nIf you're a basic wanna be hipster and have a lot of extra free time to overpay for mediocre \"artisan\" food that they probably ran out of... Feel free to come on by.
