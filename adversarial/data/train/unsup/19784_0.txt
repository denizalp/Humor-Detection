Extremely disappointed at the portion size. Ordered 2 \"Pride\" poke bowls to go. The. bowls were not the same size one was larger in weight than the other. I weighed the bowls when I got home, one bowl weighed 10.5 oz and the other 13.8 oz. the 2 bowls cost me just under $25.00, she initially charged me $28.00. It's a shame because the food is actually good but they are exorbitantly expensive for what you get. I don't have a problem paying for expensive food as long as I get what I pay for. This is not the case here.  I will never go back to Poke Addiction I will drive to the other poke  place on Rainbow and Sahara or the one in Centennial Hills. I have to been to both places before and will continue to patronize them.
