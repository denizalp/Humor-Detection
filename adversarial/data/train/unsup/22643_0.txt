Needs to have more vegan food.  Since all they had were meat dishes, I did order steak well done.  They had a hard time figuring that out! Did give us a free desert, but I really just wanted to eat with my family when they ate. Also parking is a nightmare.  Who would put two restaurants that are BUSY in one small plaza,  You can always park at the office building across the street and walk.  Just hope it's not 20 degrees.
