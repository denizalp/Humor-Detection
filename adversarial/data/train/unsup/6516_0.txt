Let me know when you people fix the goddamn air-conditioning, and I'll *consider* coming back for a second try. \n\nIt is an outrage that you dared to open this in August\/September, knew there was an a\/c problem (as evidenced by the comments of your staff when some in our party complained), and have still done nothing about it as of late September. Absolutely infuriating to walk into a place on a 100-degree night only to find it feeling like 105 inside. I should've listened to the game on the radio in my car. When the waitress asked if there was anything else she could get for us, I almost said \"Yeah, a shower.\"
