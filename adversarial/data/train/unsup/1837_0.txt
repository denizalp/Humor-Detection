My hubby and I came here for date night.  Disclaimer...we both have not touched golf clubs in the last decade probably but we still had fun.  It's a pricey place, but you come in expecting as much.  We enjoyed the game concept of it versus going to a golfing range, even though technically this is a glorified golfing range.  They provide the clubs and the balls.  The balls are tracked so you know where they land and depending on the game...they equate to a certain amount of points.  For locals or military, they have a discount...so don't forget to mention that to your server.  Or if you go earlier before noon...they also offer discounts.  We picked the tier 1 since we wanted minimal wait time, and less witnesses to our subpar golf skills.  Next time, I'd try the upper levels since they offer a better for view.  I would eat dinner before I get here, the food was mediocre at best.  We got the pork skewers as a snack...and they were as dry as jerky.  Probably best with a group of 4 if your only going for an hour, any additional people and you won't get to hit too many balls.
