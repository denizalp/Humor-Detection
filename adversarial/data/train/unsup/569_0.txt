I got an oil change and my mother In law decided to surprise us and accidentally got an oil change the next day. Basically only drove 50 km and we got charged for a second oil change. Went back expecting a refund and understanding but was instead told \"tracking miles is not our responsibility\" and refused to refund. Definitely ripped off and took advantage of a senior citizen. Careful you may be up sold or charged for additional service unnecessarily.. Best to try another location.
