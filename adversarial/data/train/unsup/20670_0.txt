This place was just bad.  I called a week in advance and make appointments for my mom and I as part of a spa day, but still had to wait 35 minutes with nobody to ask us if we wanted to sit down or offer us anything.  Even an apology would have been nice?  We literally stood there, standing for 35 minutes and nobody even noticed us.  Then the two girls who did our nails laughed at other customers and didnt talk to us at all about what we wanted.  They only talked to each other and messed a lot of things up on our nails....They also did a less than stellar job on our pedicures.  I cant believe this place gets good reviews!  The decor is great, but is that what you want in a nail salon?
