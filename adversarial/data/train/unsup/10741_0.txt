My family came here for dinner.  It's pretty much impossible to eat here if you can't have wheat and dairy - and several in my family have to avoid them.\n\nMost brewpubs and gastropubs will have at least ONE thing on the menu for folks who have to follow a strict diet.  Not Huss.  If you're lucky enough to own an iron gut then I guess you could come here for food.  But vegetarians, vegans and other people who have to avoid dairy or wheat, eat before you show up.
