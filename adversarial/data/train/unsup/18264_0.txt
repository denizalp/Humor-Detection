Obviously this place has to be pretty sweet with a name like the Thirsty Beaver.   Cheap drinks, good location down the road from the center of Plaza-Midwood, friendly folks, live events, hosts some fundraisers, hosts some biker gang rallies, hosts some people with 3-button suits and others with cowboy hats, longhorn skull draped with bras above the entrance ---- yeah, they've got it all!  \n\nMy uncle kept jokingly \"checking in\" his coworkers here while at work and got one of them in trouble with his wife.  \"What are you doing at a strip club when you are supposed to be work!\"   \n\nNo matter what a cowboy tells you, there are no strippers in the Thirsty Beaver.
