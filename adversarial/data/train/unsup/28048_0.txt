I obtained my open water certification with these guys in 2015. It was average at best. The instruction was fine. Jim is a fantastic diver, and he taught me a lot. Beth was awful as business owner. Every visit to the shop was a high pressure situation to buy something that I did not need. They also bring unsafe people to dive with them. Beth and another diver found it acceptable to grab my fins underwater which created an unsafe situation. I do not recommend these guys. There are plenty of other scuba centers that dive much closer to Pittsburgh than them.
