The room we stayed in was great. But the hotel itself is not in the best shape. Case in point: I am walking back to my room barefoot at 8am (don't ask) and step in a huge puddle of water in the hallway. Gross. All I'm thinking is I hope that wasn't vomit or urine. It was probably just A\/C fluid. Happy thoughts Moner...happy thoughts.\n\nThat night when I was leaving my room again there was a security guard standing next to the puddle directing people around it.\nMe: Wow, you guys are finally fixing that. I accidentally stepped in that last night. That is A\/C fluid, right?\nSecurity guard: no ma'am, it's not A\/C fluid.\nMe: I don't need to know more. Thanks. \n\nAlso, the food places in here take forever to get food out. And I'm talking about the two casual places. All-American and Sao Paul Caf√©.  We literally had to wait at least 30 minutes each time for it to come out. \n\nThe 21 and over pool is fun...I would stay away from the other pools.  Lots of kids and ugly people.
