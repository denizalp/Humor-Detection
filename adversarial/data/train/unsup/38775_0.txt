this place sucks! The service is slow and crap, and the cups\/cutlery\/seats were dirty. It's great that they start u off with free chips and salsa but they were pretty stale. I had the tex mex salad and this was just not good.  I'm biased though because the corn salsa had coriander and raw onions in it, both which i hate with a passion.  do NOT come here
