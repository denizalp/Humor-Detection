I'm in love and his name is Joe.\n\nLet me count the ways:\n1. Paper bag waist skirt, $24\n2. Sleeveless shift dress, $39\n3. Double layer tee, $12\n4. Sateen thong sandals, $19\n\nThis apparel line - stocked with classically good looking, well-cut basics at astonishingly low prices - was launched by Canadian grocer Loblaws. Which means that you can easily snap up some $24 yoga pants (that look and feel nearly identical to those found at Lululemon) or a pair of jeans along with your milk, bread, eggs and toilet paper.\n\nAnd if you're still unclear about how I fell so hard and so fast for Joe, just wait until we get some spring temperatures. Because you can be sure that when the weather warms up a bit, I'll be rockin' my new Joe acquisitions all over the city.\n\nFrank Gehry. Joni Mitchell. Alex Trebek. William Shatner. To this list of esteemed Canadians we must add Joseph Mimran (aka Joe Fresh).
