Now I know why they call it \"the Cheesecake Factory\" BEST cheesecake I ever had.  I ordered the sea salt and Carmel. The menu was literally 35 pages long, so it takes awhile to decide.  I went on a busy weekend night but my husband went up to the bar and ordered us Mai Tais and they were really good, we sat outside on a beautiful night with our mai Tais and people watched, the time went by quickly.  I ordered some spicy shrimp dish that was delicious, the bread was good and they had something for everyone. I will return.  Good service and not overly priced.
