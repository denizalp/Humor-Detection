We went here to avoid driving to Sky Zone on the North Shore. BIG mistake! Flight is a mess. It was ridiculously crowded. We waited ten minutes just to get in, and that was when I had singed the waivers and paid online. My boys only like to do dodgeball, and they were kicked out of the dodgeball area TWICE for a private party game. WHAT?? There is nothing about that online. I did read online that the kids had to wear jump socks or go barefoot. They want you to pay for their socks, so the kids wore their Sky Zone socks. They were told by an employee to take them off because \"Sky Zone socks are not covered by our waiver.\" Are you KIDDING me? They are exactly the same. While they were taking their socks off, another kids walks up to his dad and says, \"Dad, I need to wash my feet. I just stepped in barf.\"  Lovely!! We will NEVER GO BACK!
