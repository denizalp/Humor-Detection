This place isn't the best dim sum place but its pretty good for the area. This place is rated #1 best dim sum by all the white people and asians seem to like it too. We went for dim sum Sunday at 11am. We got the last table before the long line began! \n\nService was really good. Shrimp har-gow was hot, fresh, and tasty. The shrimp noodle was delicious! The steamed pork buns and the glazed pork buns were good. The pork dumplings were tasty, although came with sweet and sour sauce (odd?). For the four of us, it was about $30. The hostess and cashier were very nice and attentive. The cooks were all old chinese men which was a plus. It looked pretty legit.\n\nI will definitely come back when I'm in Vegas and craving dim sum. Food was good, prices were good, service was excellent! The place is pretty small and there aren't a ton of carts. I wasn't expecting much since its Vegas and there aren't as many chinese people here than in Cali. Since I came with no expectations, it was nice to leave full and satisfied. Tip: Go with another Chinese speaking person so you get exactly what you want. lol.
