If you're in the cosmopolitan get your coffee here! I'm addicted.  A friend of mine was getting her iced lattes here and I was curious to try their coffee for myself. Always looking for something better I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I'm srsly hooked. The quality, service and price is on point. You can really taste the difference. The juice is perfectly done as well. Cute presentation and its yummy. Bee Royal and the Bee Resilient are my personal favs. Had a sample of one of their cocktails. That's next on my list and everyone is so super helpful. Keep up the good work :))
