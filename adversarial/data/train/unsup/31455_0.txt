Really Fantastic. Not sure why the reviews only say average. Beautiful modern Mediterranean  ambiance overlooking the strip. Awesome food. Very fresh. Finely detailed. Incredible prefix for lunch, great value. More of a refined Mediterranean fish restaurant with fine Greek undertones. Not Greek. Anyway. I defiantly recommend it. I don't know how you could possibly be disappointed.
