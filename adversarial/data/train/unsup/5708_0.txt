Awful establishment. No sign on the street to tell you where they are located in the building complex. I don't even remember seeing a sign for the company on their building! It was disguised by a tax service sign. My towed car wasn't even on the lot at the time I came to get it. (Called another tow company and they said they've seen this company deliberately tow cars behind a Food-lion building because they don't have enough space in their own gate. These are illegal practices and isn't covered under any Limited Liability insurance they may have.) And my friends car was just sitting in a parking spot, not even enclosed behind a gate. Went inside to pay to get our cars back and it looked like a tax office inside. I asked the gentleman if they did taxes there and he said they do taxes in the front and towing in the back. Further in the back you could read on their board \"Money is easy to come by\", along with the breakdown of how much money the anticipate to make in a week\/month\/year. Almost like a laugh or slap in my face will picking my car up. These are very shady people doing very shady business. I can't be 100% upset with them though because my HOA is now in cahoots with them to make as much money off the residents as they collectively can. If you get your car towed, try to negotiate a price. That's what I did and saved a lot of unnecessary money for them towing my rental car. Oh and by the way the only other comment is the owners girlfriend. Not a real customer. No wonder why it's the only review and is positive. Shady.\n\nBelow is a picture of the office and owner, he tried to cut me a \"$10 deal\" if I drove to pick my car up at another location that was never disclosed to me. After I cut a deal with him he took my rental car keys and agreed to drive my rental car back to my home. Very shady business. I never once saw my car until it was drove back by him into the very spot it was towed from. Oh and after paying $477.00 of course.
