My friend was raving about this place so we had to pay this restaurant a visit! We came on a Saturday evening around 5pm (they open at 5:30pm) so that we could beat the line! The outside looks kinda dingy and ehhhh..but once you step inside, it's huge!! There's a huge wine collection in the middle of the restaurant and tons of pictures with celebrities that have eaten here! We were the first to be seated since we were first in line, but they do take reservations! We had tried to call and make a reservation about a week ago, but they told us it was already full!\n\nCrispy duck curry (~27): There's a reason this item is on everyone's list! The duck was of course crispy, great texture, and cooked perfectly. It was laid on top of the sweet, flavorful curry! Loved it! I couldn't wait to drench my rice with that curry!\n\nGarlic prawns (~28): Another dish that is insanely popular here...and for a reason! This was my favorite dish of the night. The prawns are fried with a crunchy outer exterior and seasoned with perfectly. The meat was juicy! They also fried up the shells of the prawns making for even more crunchy goodness!\n\nPad See Ew (~11): We got this with chicken. The noodles were soft, but overall nothing that mind-blowing.\n\nCrab fried rice (~15): The fried rice was good but they gave too little crab. Overall too small of a dish.\n\nThe service was also great, our waters were always filled, dishes were taken away as soon as we finished. Overall, a great thai restaurant with some interesting dishes, but prices are certainly a bit much. The portions are quite small so if you do opt for family style, make sure you account for that! Their menu is very extensive so it'd be great to try their other dishes ( like the ones from Northern Thai) next time!
