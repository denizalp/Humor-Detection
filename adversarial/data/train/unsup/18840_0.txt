Since my wife is Cebuano and since I lived in her town on Mindano for a couple of years, we were excited to be able to get lechon and other Bisayan food during our trip to Las Vegas.  We took our son with us since the only filipino food he has ever had is pancit and lumpia.  He's a sous chef at a high end restaurant in The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas.  He tried the lechon and lumpia but wouldn't even touch the other stuff.  \n\nThe lechon was fatty and not good.  We also ordered a kind of sweet style adobo which turned out to be overcooked tough chunks of pork in a bowl of colored water.  We also ordered dinuguan - the worst we've ever had. \n\nSome of the reviews mention that the decor is \"authentic\".  Since it was a cold, dark, warehouse-like room with zero charm and loud acid rock blaring the whole time, I can only wonder where the reviewers had been in the past that led them to label this \"authentic\".\n\nNever again.
