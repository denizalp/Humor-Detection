I am writing to sing the praises of the Ni√ßoise salad.  The seared tuna on it was flawlessly prepared, the haricot verts were perfectly al dente and I loved the touch of roasted tomatoes. And at $13 which may seem a little steep, it was a lot of food---I didn't finish it.  The people that worked there were very friendly. \n\nIt's a little hard to find, being at the back of the shopping center next to Crudo.
