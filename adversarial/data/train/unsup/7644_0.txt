I was visiting family in Avondale over a weekend before Christmas. After eating lunch, my little cousin was moaning about his teeth aching. Since I had time on my hands, after teasing him for drinking too much soda, I took him to this dental clinic. I was lucky that they're flexible with their schedule and was able to arrange an appointment on the same day. Upon arrival, Dr. Nguyen and Dr. Tran drilled his cavities and filled the tooth up. I'm sure he can't wait for his next routine cleaning lol. \n\nIt's nice chatting with the doctors, they're very friendly. They're a married too! It's cute that the couple is running the clinic together. Coincidentally, they are from Orange County like me. They have eaten at Luc Dinh Ky, which is one of my favorite restaurants in Little Saigon.  \n\nIsn't it weird how you learn to appreciate dentists when you grow older, in contrast to fearing them as a child?
