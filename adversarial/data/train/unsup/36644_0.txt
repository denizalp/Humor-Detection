LUNCH BUFFET REVIEW ONLY\n\nThis place deserves 5 stars period for lunch. I was looking for a cheap place to indulge prior to hitting to a more \"expensive\" buffet for dinner if you will, and this place hit the spot.\n\nFood on the strip is expensive, period. For example, a slice of NY pizza is about 10 bucks. For 19.99, you have an all you can eat experience, which makes sense.\n\nAbout twenty bucks gets you prime rib, sausages, turkey and other meats from the carving station. You also get a great variety of vegetables at the salad bar. \n\nThere's an area for pizza and delicious pasta. If You don't like Italian there's common foods you'll find like mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, fried chicken and many common items you will find at a buffet.\n\nThe sushi section was pretty weak with California rolls and old salmon. I wasn't coming in knowing I paid 20 bucks for good sushi, I'm not a retard. \n\nOverall, great service, refills and a wide assortment of desserts. A great bang for your buck, if your planning on dining for an expensive spot for dinner.
