After getting my sons hair cut we were wandering around and found this little tea place. I love tea in all forms and had to come in. I was very glad that I did since the tea that we had was just fantastic. The store is very inviting with coaches to lounge and have great conversation over tea. Or customers can sit at a table and have a small bite to eat and tea.\n\nThe cashier was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about their product. She pointed out on the menu her favorite and offered us a sample of a tea with almond milk. This one was so delicious that I had that flavor. We also ordered the jasmine green tea with boa boa in it. Both drinks were very delicious. The cups were given to us with a lid already on it which is so convenient and no mess. All you do is stick the straw and off one goes with there tea.
