My favorite restaurant in all of Charlotte! I've been twice now and it never disappoints. Their music hand picked by the chef and bartender gives it a great vibe. I LOVE the Nortorious P.I.G's, although every thing else I've tried hasn't disappointed. Craft cocktails are good, love that they smoke the old fashioned and bring it to your table under the glass. All servers are great at explaining the menus both before ordering and explaining what is on your plate once you receive it. Overall amazing experiences both time.
