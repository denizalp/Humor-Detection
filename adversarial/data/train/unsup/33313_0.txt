Booked a car this past week, a Toyota Camry, which was OK, until Friday afternoon when the battery died.  Seriously, they don't run a diagnostic on each car before giving it out???!!!  Got bounced around the \"24-hour\" 800 number for 45 minutes and was fuming by the time I was helped.  No one offered to come out and swap cars with us we had to have the car jumped, (thank goodness for the nice people at Camelback Ranch and O'Reilly Auto Parts), and bring it back to the airport ourselves to swap out.  Beware, there is NO customer service with this company; stick with a name-brand rental agency.
