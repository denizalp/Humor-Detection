Came here on Wednesday after work.  It is located at the corner of Leslie and major Mac in the freshco Plaza. Tucked away in a small corner. \n\nThe restaurant isn't that big, there is a bar upon entering, and a couple of booths, and when you turn the corner, there is a narrow line of tables. \n\nThey have $5.00 appetizers from 5pm-7pm. We decided to try the calamari which retails for $10.00 and bacon wrapped scallops which retails for $12.00. \nOn Wednesdays they have $5.50 for 1lb wings with the purchase of a drink.  \n\nWas looking at the menu for wing flavours, and noticed that it said for an additional 1.75 you can add waffle fries, sweet potato fries or onion rings.  The wings also came with carrot and celery and dip. \nI got the sweet chili flavour with onion rings, and my friend got the dry Cajun rub wings with waffle fries. \n\nWhen the appetizers came, the bacon wrapped scallops were 5 small pieces.  If this was for regular price $12.00 it is definitely not worth it.  There is a blob of butter at the bottom of each bacon wrapped scallop. It tasted pretty good, but was shocked at the size. \n\nThe calamari was much better, there was a fair amount, and the sauce was okay, didn't have too much taste. Was fresh and crispy, but a little too much batter. \n\nThe wings came, there were 9 wings, lightly dressed which I really appreciated.  Sometimes some restaurants totally drench the wings with sauce. \nThere was quite a bit of onion rings, but one piece of carrot and one piece of celery.  Looked like decoration.  \nThe wings were crispy, freshly fried and had a lot of flavour.  The sweet chili was had the right amount of tang.\n\nI tried one of my friend's dry Cajun rub and it was pretty good too, nicely coated and not too salty.  Onion rings and waffle fries were good.  Onion rings were huge, and had a good amount of onion flavour. \n\nThe service was pretty good.  Our waiter admitted today was his first time serving, so I could see some nervousness, but he did pretty good.  Always checking up on us and giving us refills. \n\nWhen we asked for take out boxes, we weren't given bags, maybe they don't have any. \n\nThe bill came, and I noticed that the onion rings and waffle fries were charged at regular price.  When asking the waiter he said that the Wednesday special you couldn't get the 1.75 upgrade.  It cost 4.63 at regular price. Which was a little disappointing, as it didn't say anywhere. \n\nIt started filling up when we left at 8. People lining up at the front.  \n\nThe restaurant is still pretty new, with new waiters and owners (looks like a group of friends combined to open this place).  I'll come back and give it another chance for their Tuesday burger special.  Although the wings are worth coming back for on 5.50 Wednesdays too.
