Great food, terrific service and a really good vibe. The staff is friendly and relaxed but they don't miss a beat. The menu is interesting, the ingredients fresh and the food is delicious. The room is small but very comfortable and has a great feel.  One of the best new restaurants to open in Toronto in a long time.  Loved it !
