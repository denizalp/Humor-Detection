Yum! Happy to have a new option that I don't have to schlep to The Strip for. Had dinner at HoneySalt (not sure if it's one word or two) with a friend. They have beautiful lights hung outside and a cute patio (good for spring\/fall...summer\/winter stay inside). They know what to highlight since the first thing you see when you walk in is the table covered in delicious pastries. \n\nThey're still working a few of the bugs out, but overall everything was good. The portions are small, which gives you the opportunity to try a little bit of everything on the menu. We had the Veggies and Hummus to start, as well as the Yellowtail Crudo. Both were really tasty and great for sharing. For dinner, we split the Whole Wheat Pizza which was delicious as well, topped with lots of veggies. Lastly, we ordered a side of the kale and pepper mac n' cheese. If I can make one recommendation...do not skip this, it's so so so good.\n\nMost importantly, their cocktails and desserts are divine. Cocktails are strong, so pace yourself, which might be difficult when they taste so yummy. For dessert, we ordered the Brown Bag Apple Pie, also not to be skipped. Here's a tip, swap the vanilla ice cream on the side for the salted caramel. Delicious.
