Unexpected find in Lakewood.  On a mission for a Sunday afternoon lunch and my wife had been dying to give this place a shot...the food was surprisingly tasty!\n\nMy daughter and I decided to split a dish, and we chose the Quadratic Calzone.  It was full of fresh ingredients (mushrooms, spinach, broccoli, sauce, mozzarella cheese) and although the outside appeared charred it was actually quite moist and chewy inside.  The accompanying marinara dipping sauce was served cold, however (the only \"ding\" against the entire meal).\n\nMy wife settle on the Clevo sandwich which was nice as well...served open faced with hummus and sliced mushrooms (had an great earthy taste to it).  The small side salad that came with her sandwich had a wonderful bright \/ fresh dressing (which she took home it was so good).\n\nDaughter and I finished off the meal with a chocolate chip cookie that was moist and not overly sweet.\n\nNot a place I'm going to come back to over and over again (just because this is not really my style of food), but so glad we gave it a try and discovered a new option for us to add to the rotation while in the area.
