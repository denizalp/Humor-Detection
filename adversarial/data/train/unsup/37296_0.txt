I was thinking of buying a used safe from craigslist. I called The Safe Keeper to inquire about the safe. The man spent about 10 minutes on the phone with me giving me plenty of information. Very polite, and he let me know they can move the safe if I needed help.\nI decided against the used safe, and went to TSK store on Rainbow. Staff was very knowledgeable, and didn't seem pushy at all. \nOver the next 4 weeks, I went to the store 4 times and eventually bought a very nice safe. TSK delivered it as promised, on time. Delivery crew had an unmarked truck, and left the safe in the cardboard box until out of sight from neighbors.  Safe installed,leveled,  bolted down.\nVery happy with entire experience.
