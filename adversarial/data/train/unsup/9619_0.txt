About Me:\nA year-round flip flop aficiando whose nail painting skills are on par with a drunk pre-schooler's attempts at replicating a Van Gogh masterpiece.\n\nWhy I've been a Red Rock Nails customer for almost 3 years:\nI truly value the precision and expertise of the Red Rock Nails' staff's very steady hands and the public service they do by cleaning up the snaggle-toed masses of Summerlin.\n\nReasonable prices and impeccable cleanliness (no fear of funky foot fungi here) are just extra icing on my freshly frosted toes.
