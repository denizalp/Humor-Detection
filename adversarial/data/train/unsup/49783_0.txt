I came here and there was nobody there but myself. The cashier Bret was very unfriendly. He did not ask if it was for here or to go. It was packed to go and I was eating there. Had to ask for receipt cause he did not give me one. How can I eat corn and mashed potatoes without a fork. Had to ask for one. Now I see why they have a very low rating. The food was ok.
