Why would anyone conclude a perfect 5 star dinner experience by annoying the customer at the last moment?\n\nI almost never frequent The Keg when I'm paying, but I couldn't resist when they emailed me a free entree birthday certificate, so I carefully planned out what my date and I would be ordering to estimate costs, settling on the Bleu Cheese Filet for $34.\n\nIt sounded amazing... a filet mignon wrapped in pepper bacon and grilled to your liking, covered in a bleu cheese crust, served golden brown and sprinkled with roasted garlic cloves.  YES PLEASE!\n\nIn hindsight, I realized what happened when I placed my order.  The waiter confirmed my order back to me, but he said \"a bacon wrapped filet classic with bleu cheese crust, sauteed mushrooms and twice baked potato\"\n\nI assumed that he had just repeated my order back to me, but he really confirmed several upgrades, such as a larger $44 steak with sauteed mushrooms and a $2\/per crust.\n\nI assumed I was just going to pay $34 + tax for one of the entrees, but I was charged $46 + tax.  Its not that much more, but it was more than I had expected to pay... so I was visibly annoyed.\n\nBut rather than being a `Yelp Mafia Douche`, I considered how my date and I raved about the meal, and agreed it was definitely worth the extra coinage and this 5 star review.\n\nSee you next year, Keg
