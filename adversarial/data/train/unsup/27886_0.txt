I love coming for the Grand Buffet at the Bellagio.  It's expensive but worth it.  You get to try things you normally wouldn't get to try.  Get there early the lines can get long.\nI love the Seaweed Salad, Beef Wellington, Crab and Shrimp.  It's been awhile since I have been but I wanted to weigh in.  \n\nI love the Spice Market Buffet and the Rio Seafood Buffet as well.
