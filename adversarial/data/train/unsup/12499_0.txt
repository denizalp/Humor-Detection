I don't know where to start, I honestly feel all their reviews are fake. Let's start with the service, the wait staff did smile once as if they're miserable and unhappy to be there. \n\nTheir dinning area is very cramped, which makes extremely loud and hard to even hold a conversation. The food, the eggs seems processed and similar to Denny's. The pancakes also lacked authenticity and tasted very processed. The bananas on the pancakes and their bacon is all that tasted freshly made. \n\nAlong with the unhappy wait staff, the proceeded food, they have an unusual fly issue in their indoor dinning area. I literally couldn't go 20 seconds without swatting them away, I even killed one at my table leaving it as a souvenir for the bus staff. \n\nOverall I wouldn't recommend this breakfast spot to anyone looking for authentic home style cooking experience.
