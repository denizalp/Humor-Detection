When I sat down to watch this show I was not happy at all and I was planning on giving it 1 star!  My husband, when buying the tickets, had selected the \"Best Available\" seats 2 weeks ahead of time only to find ourselves near the back of the theater.  This has never been an issue at a Cirque du Soleil show because there is no such thing as a bad seat, until now.  This theaters seating was built on a slight slant with the stage all the way at the bottom.  If you do this layout correctly (like Carrot Top) everyone has a great view, but here, at this show, all you can see is the persons head in front of you because the slant is not enough and you have to be looking down to the stage.  I spent the first half of the show ready to walk out as I could only see the few acts that happened up high.  I was so disappointed as I have been so excited to go see this show.  \n\nSo, why the 4 stars?  The last half of the show got so good I completely forgot how upset I was and truly enjoyed myself.  Wow!  I felt like Michael was there in the room with us!  I love Michael's music and I love Cirque du Soleil and when you bring those two together you have pure magic!  I will one day return to this show but I will handpick the seats.
