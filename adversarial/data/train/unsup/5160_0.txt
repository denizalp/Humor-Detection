Mamie Clafoutis is one of the best things that have happened to Nun's Island in the recent years. First of all it eliminates the need to venture out of my domain for good croissants. Second it is walking distance from where I reside, but not very close so I can enjoy a nice walk and earn the fluffy goodness. The bakery is actually on the north side of the island, next to the Bell offices and I'm sure the Bell employees are very happy in the early morning hours with its presence. I personally would not rush to Mamie Clafoutis for their coffee, it is good enough, but they are not necessarily master baristas. The bakery though delivers some of the best breads that have a real crust, the walnut one being my favorite. Some of these breads are sold in the local IGA supermarket, which is great alternative if you don't have time for a quick visit or have missed the opening hours. Of course there are number of pastries that could be enjoyed in Mamie Clafoutis. On a weekend day the place is sometimes a little bit crowded and messy, even the numbers system doesn't help the line up for fresh baked goods. Just try to avoid the peak hour and you will be served promptly, and attentively.
