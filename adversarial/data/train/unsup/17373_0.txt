Typical crappy Krogers Smith's...\n\nThis parking lot is a NIGHTMARE. I warned you. \n\nThe first time I entered the store is because my husband wanted bread and I called and they carry Dave's Killer Bread in Good Seed and its a damn miracle. A few other times I entered was because I needed potatoes (yes they had organic) and then I wanted a pack of Simply Pure?something? vegan chkn patties my friend told me to try. \n\nWhen you walk into this place it smells like rotting meat mixed with rotting shit. \n\nI drive to Whole Foods Rain\/Lake when I want groceries. Or I drive to Fresh & Easy Chey\/Jones. This place is pathetic. \n\nIt's very sad that this area can't have a more quality grocery near Alta Loop, Rancho Circle, and Rancho Bel Air!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nOne star for having his fav bread (makes me hate bread more than I already do), and another star because the cashier said she \"remembers me\" because I only buy vegetables? and I have pretty hair................ok.\n\nI guess once a month or so is not going to kill me.
