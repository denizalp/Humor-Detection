While rolling down Camelback Road on our way to check out some San Diego Padre Spring Training, the thought of coffee became almost to much to bare.  There were still many miles to be traveled and caffeine would be needed to safely complete the journey.\n\nA quick glance of a down the road Starbucks was all that it took to activate the right turn blinker.  There was however, a quick sweep of the area.  There was some shady looking folks roaming about the area.  Keep you head on a swivel.  \n\nThis location is a stand a large stand alone structure.  I must say it is probably the largest one I have ever visited.  The drive-thru we pulled into seemed to stretch a country mile. It's more than capable of supporting whatever high volume traffic seeking a legal stimulate to support them.  There was six vehicles ahead of use.  Normally, I would take a pass rather than feeling like a coffee lemming,but something told me this location could take any java infused, lemming migration in stride.\n\nWe pulled in and the line keep on rolling to the cliff that is glorious window.  The voice on the other end of the squawk box was friendly enough.\n\nThe line continued to roll and in short order, we would pay and receive our drinks.   A friendly face now with a squawk box voice this coffee and tea slinging expert would set the tone with happiness.  While heading toward the 17, we just might be stopping again on our AZ adventure.
