Delicious, $3 large French press made with love from a spunky little barista. Three cheers for a locally owned business.  Least not forget about the cute little green and yellow cups. Color me caffeinated.\n\nOne of my MOST favorite thing about Central Coffee, it's like a library, really, no one is yapping on their phone.  In fact, I can hear my keys taping typing this review.  It's that quiet.  The music is low and when they make espresso, the humming of the machine and the baristas cleaning is soothing.  Weird, huh?\n\nI also tried the breakfast casserole that Jimmy makes on the weekends, it is delicious! I have an appointment in 15 minutes and I do not want to leave. I want to stay in here where it's nice and quiet.
