WTH is snooker? OK, so master Q is a snooker hall...i'm still confused about snooker..... They give you a pool table that is bigger than the regular table, then you have to hit the regular pool balls, then you have to his the red balls... OMG CONFUSED! \n\nWe'll had another eventful time in toronto, getting drunk, playing dices, shooting snooker, and singing unlimited amounts of Karaoke! Man what a night! Thank Diane P. for taking care of the bill =P.\n\nNot a bad place to hang out, especially in the VIP room all the way in the back. Own personal bathroom and everything! WOOT!
