Just by chance I passed by the studio and saw the ad for the 'Hip hop hustle' workshop.  Four sundays in June for $40--never mind that I live an hour away, never mind I'd be out of town for one of those sundays...I. Wanted. To. Live. My. Dream.  Yes, it's a save the last dance\/step up kind of dream but dreams are quirky.  You want what you want.\n\nI told this all to the husband, he quickly agreed-not because he really wants me to achieve my dream-he didn't mind spending a day in Madison every week.  \n\nThe dance space is nice, a bit over the top pink but there was a respectable mirror ball.  My instructor, Jeanne, was friendly and, more importantly, helpful.  The first 15 minutes was a little warm up, learning some pretty easy choreography and then the majority of the class was learning a longer hip hop piece.  We learned a chunk every week and put it together at the end.  I felt pretty accomplished by the end of the lessons and wanted to continue the dream...\n\nThe studio offers lots of different lessons, even a thriller workshop or a britney spears set of classes, and---my next dream: west  african dance.  I had been to Mali and there is really nothing to compare dancing with live drums; you are alive and you are joyful.\n\nI either wish I lived closer or they moved here...but moving to beloit? or janesville? hehee....highly unlikely.  I could probably fit a couple more classes but once summer is over, I'll have to put the dream away.
