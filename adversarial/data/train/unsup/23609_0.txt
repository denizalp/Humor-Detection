In a city that is still discovering \"personality\", Cellblock is king. \n\nCellblock is fun. It's crazy and dirty and sketchy and dark and sexy, but above all, it's fun. Everyone here is always having fun. \n\nFor those of you who don't know it by reputation, Cellblock is \"that\" bar. The one that your perfectly-manicured friends warn you about. It's the Hoist, the Eagle, the Gauntlet, and the Mineshaft. The classic dirty gay leather bar. There is a cross and a cage, a boot-blacking chair and a sex shop. You do not order a pink martini. \n\nI've brought a few girls and straight friends here, and they loved it, and the other patrons loved them. Just use common sense. This isn't a hag bar, and the energy is definitely masculine. \n\nThe bartenders are one of the greatest things about this place. They are incredibly, sincerely friendly. The drinks are the strongest of any bar I've ever been in anywhere, and the cheapest. \n\nThe DJ is also incredible. I've never met him, but I wish I knew his (their?) name. \n\nEvery night is a different promo. Beer busts, 50 cent pitchers, strippers, underwear, shirtless, gear. \n\nIt's currently under construction, but Bill (the owner) and the bartenders are keeping us updated, and it plans to reopen.
