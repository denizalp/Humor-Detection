I dream about Ian's pizza sometimes now that 3,000 miles tragically separates me from their $2.75 slices of perfection.  *Sigh.  \r\n\r\nFor those still in Madison, you must try:  \r\n\r\nBBQ Chicken pineapple\r\nChicken pesto\r\nMac & Cheese\r\nChicken Parm\r\n\r\nThe best cure for that feeling you get when you just start to realize that last shot of Jose wasn't such a great idea....
