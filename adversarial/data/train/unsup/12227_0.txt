I bought $9k worth of engineered flooring from Mitch in early 2016. It took me over a month to find just the right color and texture. \n  My husband and i didnt live at the house at the time. I was not told to check to be sure they had ordered the correct flooring so when it arrived we had it installed.  Only to find out after the install that it was completely different. \nMitch didnt offer any explanation and told us that its not his issue once its been installed. Im so disgusted. The rest of my flooring needs will NOT be purchased through Mitch @ Bram Flooring    BEWARE!!!!!!\n     **** in RESPONSE to Bram Flooring \nYour rep NEVER contacted us! The amount you charge for install was well over the going rate. If that meant getting the flooring we ordered, then thats a high price to pay. It sounds to me that if Bram flooring doesn't get the entire job then customers are SOL. When we ordered the flooring we were never told to be sure and check it against the sample we made our choice from. It was under my understanding that paying Bram flooring that follow through would be their job. They are a business and should take their own advice on quality control and verification of product. We feel we should receive some sort of refund do to Brams mistake.
