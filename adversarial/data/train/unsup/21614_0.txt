This is by no means the first time I have been to Firefly. It has been a place I go now and then over the years for a late night bite to eat or a social gathering or two. Sometimes it's loud and there are tons of people.. but the food usually quality and if you can get a table you are golden. \n\nI went again the other night and it seems they have done away with alot of the clutter, added more dining areas and used the once \"Dragonfly\" Sushi next door ( a short-lived endeavor) and turned it into a disco ball having lounge of sorts. ( I haven't ventured in there yet) So the dining room is free for just that. The food is always good, inexpensive and easy to get to. \n\nBetween my friend and I, we shared a pitcher of red sangria, 4 tapas and dessert.. the bill was about 60 bucks. Not bad for an hour and a half of dining for two peeps. Check it out. Its a fun spot!
