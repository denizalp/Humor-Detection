This place is a shit show on the weekend! \nIt caters to low-class ballers on a budget and looks like a Wal Mart let loose it's Friday night crowd into the venues. \nYou won't see many sophisticated people in here. You will see a lot of obese people with Marlboro 100s hanging from their lip and yanking on a Duck Dynasty slot machine. There are so many other casinos to go to.\n\nThe room itself was decent. The bed was huge , soft, and clean. The bathroom was stale and old. \n\nOverall , I think this is a decent at best place to crash; but you will want to spend your waking hours elsewhere.
