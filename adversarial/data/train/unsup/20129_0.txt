DO NOT join this establishment.  I won't even call it a gym because it feels more like a used car sales lot.  The pressure they put on members to buy this or that is beyond acceptable.  I bought some personal training sessions and quit prior to using them.  I asked for a refund 3 times from 3 different \"persons of authority\" and had zero success in getting my $400 back.  In addition, I cancelled on January 1 and they still charged me for February (the cancellation policy is 30 days.)
