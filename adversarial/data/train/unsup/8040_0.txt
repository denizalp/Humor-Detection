I used to eat a lot of Taco Bell back in my college days when I was broke. Now that I'm no longer a college student and a lot more health conscious, I rarely eat fast food nowadays. But once in a while, my inner fat kid emerges and the cravings will be overwhelming. \n\nThe food is what you expect of any Taco Bell. It's fast, it's cheap and heartburn waiting to happen. However, it is deliciously so bad for you. Everyone knows their menu consists of tacos, burritos, nachos, and most recently added to their menu was the Quesalupa. My last visit, my food was piping hot. The tacos and the nacho chips were crunchy. And my nacho cheese was melty and hot! Their soda machine had 15+ options, but I always gravitate towards the Baja Blast Mountain Dew. The employee who took my order was friendly and smiling when he took my order. And he didn't seem annoyed when I asked him for extra Fire sauce. \n\nI can't give a fast food chain 4 stars, but I was pleased with my recent visit. I'll see you again in about 6 months!
