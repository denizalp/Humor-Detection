This quirky little place makes me weak at the knees. It's my favorite ice cream place in Pittsburgh. \n\nThe biggest draw is the mix-in board, allowing for some serious creativity in your ice cream consumption. Nuts, breakfast cereals, commercially-produced candy, baked goods-- all available for going in your ice cream! Nutella is a staple add-in for me. Some of the others aren't quite as ideal-- my boyfriend ordered swedish fish in his and they froze, making them very difficult to chew, and even more difficult to remove from teeth.\n\nMix-ins aside, the soy cookie dough (even though I'm not vegan) is one of the best ice creams available. The sugar-free vanilla is good, too. It's a good base if you plan on adding a lot of sugary mix-ins.\n\nThe combination of ice cream and coffee is the ultimate mix for me. They serve a good decaf brew, and mellows me out after the sugar rush. \n\nThe outdoor seating is wonderful in warm weather. It's the perfect late night spot to hang out after a movie or date.\n\nBe warned that the toilet has a two-way mirror on the door, so that from the outside it looks like a mirror, but from the inside you can see everyone in the shop. It's very disconcerting, particularly if your boyfriend decides to line up some people to stare into the mirror just to freak you out.
