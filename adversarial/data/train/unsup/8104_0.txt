This used to be Beautiful Nails.\n\nThanks to my Sister in law (S.I.L.) I would have never known it changed ownership. The spa chairs rock! Seriously I have not seen spa chairs this nice...EVER...not even in Scottsdale shhhhh. They are like TEH ultimate primo massage pedi chairs of all the land. My S.I.L. has been raving about them for awhile now and I was pretty damn curious. We went in for pedi's without an appointment around 11:30 or so yesterday. We were seated right away after picking our colors but we got lucky because right after we got comfy 3 more pedis walked in the door and they had to soak and wait. The unbelievable chairs were now all full!  \n\nEven though they now had more customers to work on we were still handled properly and with care. I didn't feel as if they were rushing us at any point. That is a huge pet peeve of mine especially if you have an appointment somewhere and they get slammed and rush to get you out the door I HATE that!! The new owners are very nice and they were chatting and keeping ALL the customer's very happy. \n\nWe just got normal spa pedi's here but it was a hekka lot more than anywhere I've been for  the price. You cant beat it in this recession really. I'm talking better than Snobsdale $60+ pedi's and hunny I've been everywhere!! They had the same citrus scrub here and hot towels the killer bonus at no extra charge other than the chairs of course was that they did a hot rock massage too. My senses were on feel good overload. \n\nNo they did not have free fruit, tea, or water with lemon and orange slices in it but who cares!?!? Between the awesome job they did on my pedi and what the chair did for my back I just have one word for you....HEAVEN. I feel a polish change coming on and this place gets an all over body Yumgasm!! They just need to add Aqua Detox and they'd totally be set!!
