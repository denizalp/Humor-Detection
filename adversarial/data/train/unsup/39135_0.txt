Definitely a beautiful place to be overlooking the city. The drinks are pricy and they aren't eager to serve you. As a hotel guest I wasn't thrilled that it was open to the public at night because it was crowded and there was a line out the hotel as we were coming back to our room. I didn't like my whisky sour. It was basically just lemon I couldn't taste the whisky. The couches are comfy and the view is worth it.
