Needed to run several errands and this Walgreens is pretty reliable. The beauty section has had an upgrade so there is a seat where you can actually try on products with decent lighting. Not bad for a drugstore. They sectioned the products much better now and included the growing brand NYX on its own display area.\n\nThe store is clean and organized too. This location has a clinic inside in and several people were waiting to be seen for general ailments like an ear infection or cold. The pharmacy is good too. The technicians have been helpful and I haven't had any issues they couldn't resolve or explain to me about. The several pharmacists I have interacted with have been professional and friendly as well. I also like the fact that this location has some medical equipments like crutches or canes, but these you pay for yourself. If your doctor have you a prescription for a crutch and you want your insurance to pay for it you would have to go to a medical supply store. Either way, unless you don't want to go to the medical supply store, this Walgreens could handle your prescription needs, general merchandise needs and get you on your way.
