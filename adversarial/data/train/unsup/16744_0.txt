We contacted Happy Entertainment about getting a Dolly Parton impersonator for my dad's retirement party. We were told that she would be available. We then asked for photos and\/or videos, so we knew who we would be hiring as their website had none of this impersonator. Apparently this request was considered too much for them, and the owner rudely replied that we shouldn't need so much information for such a small event. Needless to say, we didn't go ahead and hire an unseen performer. Their customer service is atrocious. They only care about the business if you are paying them thousands, otherwise your requests are trivial. Go elsewhere if you would like to be treated with kindness and respect!
