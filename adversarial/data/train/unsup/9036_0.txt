I must update my review after the wonderful dinner I had tonight!\n\nFirst of all, I finally experienced Crop's wonderful Sunday prix fixe menu. At $25 bucks a pop for a phenomenal (and huge) three course meal, life just doesn't get better. \n\nSecondly, we went with a ginormous Yelp group of 19 people, including 3 children and one baby, and everything went beyond smoothly. Special entrees and prices ($10) for kids, like their amazing mac 'n cheese and handmade chicken fingers make this a dream come true. On top of that, all the dinners and side dishes came out at once!! Yes, that's right. Almost 20 people and no one left sitting without food while others just looked down at their plates wondering if it's getting cold. \n\nDid I happen to mention that everything was downright delicious? I thought I loved Crop before, but now... it I think we're soul mates.
