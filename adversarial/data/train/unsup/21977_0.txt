With a name like theirs all I was expecting was something along the lines of an \"average Joe's\", although my nephew and his family thought quite highly of it.  Located at the end of the newer wing of the Forum Shops it still had the feel of being within a mall, so dining alfresco really meant that you have a great view of the escalators.  Well, to our surprise, it was a tuxedo waitered affair with full linen service...\n\nWith our expectations in check, we were initially led to a table between the doors leading to the patio by a slightly stoic maitre 'd that we failed to impress.  That said we told him that we preferred a larger, more centered 4-top that was available, and so we were seated without a problem.  In retrospect, he may have thought that the tiny two-top was a more intimate seating, but no way, not between the doorway and it certainly would have been a problem with all the food we would wind up ordering...\n\nI'm down for seafood, prime steak, and Stone Crab just like the man says;  but they weren't highlighting their signature Stone Crabs with their distinctive black tipped claws saying that they're not quite in season and frozen at the time of our visit.  Bummer.  For appetizer, we would wind up ordering a Colossal Lump Crab Cake to share and for once we were glad that we did http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#049L-tNAbUwi0aI7OMuT8g.  One of the better crab cakes that we've had, it was meaty and succulent interior belittling it's perfectly crisp scone-like battered exterior (more on this later) prompting my wife to declare that this was the best crab cake she tasted, as good as Old Ebbitt's in DC.  The Caesar Salad (of course) was tossed and divided for us without even having to ask, the freshly grated Parmesan was good quality and had that slightly salty flavor...\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#HcnqzqvXr5vmnf6z4C4Umw\n\nHere at Joe's they have a set of signature Bone-In cuts and I was tempted for a moment to order the Filet Mignon with the bone because I've never really heard of such a thing, but for my first try I wanted to have a basis for comparison to others the tried and true bone-in ribeye cut.  The 20oz Bone-In Rib Eye is flown in just like everything else in LV from somewhere in the midwest, it was prepared perfectly with a good even outer sear http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#MYSVBsRccwc5b83vREBdkA.  Delicious and savory with much of it flavor from the extra marbling, it rivaled steaks at other places that sometimes cost more.  Wifey had a little land and sea action of her own in the Seared Sea Scallops on a bed of Crispy Braised Pork Belly served with cabbage and kale http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#oiTUiM-A23ti5BJV_6xTKg.  Like most traditional steakhouse experiences, the sides are separate and usually uber simple in presentation and these were no exception.  The Baked Potato was a huge russet with all of the dressings on the side as I requested http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#2d345ddy1_34dMQL7_F3rA.  The Grilled Asparagus was interesting if for the sweet and tangy flavors of the accompanying Romesco...\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#uId88jY4q9-OrFODrK1Hyg\n\nAlthough we didn't notice it much at the time since we were enjoying the salad, our crab cake appetizer was actually served after the salad because the kitchen burnt the first one and insisted on making another one before it came out resulting in an out of order but otherwise unnoticed delay.  Because of their faux pas, they decided to comp us two slices from their famous pie only dessert menu:  the Banana Cream Pie http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#z4g_Kdhogn6XqcjtyLEGXA and their signature Key Lime Pie http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#ZEw71UqTC2Y7ELYfUQYdQA.  I favored the former for its sweetness over the later's tartness, but both were fabulously fresh tasting...\n\nThe service was exemplary,  our waiter was chatty but delightful to converse with.  The food preparation was excellent and I appreciated that they felt that something was not good enough to be served without waiting for the customer to complain before doing something about it.   I would love to come back to try the stone crab albeit we seem to in LV at the same time every year...
