I was trying to think of a way to make this funny or clever. \n\nThere's no way to do that here.\n\nFirst, there's the wait. The clinically messed up fans of Melt who go so far as to permanently tattoo the logo on their bodies may not mind (nothing says, \"Be proud of me, grandkids\" like a restaurant logo on grandpa's left butt cheek). Most people, however, mind waiting two to three HOURS to even be seated. That's not to get your food. That'll take almost another hour.\n\nThey're really pushing the fact that they're opening a second restaurant in the Heights. It was supposed to be open months ago. Ironic, isn't it? Having to WAIT to get into Melt? Oh, they don't take reservations.\n\nThen there's the loud music. Don't expect to actually talk to anyone. It's yelling only here. \n\nBut the worst is probably the obscenely incompetent kitchen staff. Never have I had my orders more consistently butchered. Never have I had to deal with the experience of receiving a mushroom burger WITH NO MUSHROOM. I tried to give them a second chance to get it right a few months later. Ordered the mushroom burger again. This time, it came WITH NO BURGER. I'm not sure who they have back there, but there's some disconnect.\n\nI will never go here again until I'm satisfied I can be seated in a reasonable amount of time and the food I order will actually contain everything in its name. Terrible experience, terrible environment, terrible wait, terrible kitchen staff. \n\nProbably the most overrated place in town, and nowhere near worthy of a tattoo. They need to do some serious work before I ever consider recommending this place. In the meantime, I'll continue to share the horrors of it with anyone who says they heard of this place called \"Melt.\"
