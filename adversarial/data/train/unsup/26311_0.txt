Showed up at 7:30 on a Thursday (9\/18\/13) sat at the bar, bar was empty. Had a beer, ordered two slices, halfway through second beer and halfway through the second slice, short blonde server with glasses hands me the bill and says I'll take this when your ready. I instantly felt like I was at Denny or IHOP! Football is on, two of us at the bar, and apparently nobody trained her very well. manager was nice, but all of the employees acted like it was a McDonalds crew. Not real professional and was a bit irritating as they were all hanging around the bar talking smack.\nFood was good. Beer was cold. Bar was clean and there was volume on the game so I was happy about that. I just think they need a bit more training on customer service and welcome new customers by telling tem about the place or the food or something.
