In the hood and decided to try this Korean resto. \n\nBusy place at 8:45 on a Friday night.  Service is friendly and prompt.  We ordered soon du bu, soon dae, and seafood pancake.  Food came out pretty quickly and it was all tasty except the soon dae was not as good as other places.  It was sliced too thick which makes a difference too.\n\nWorth a trip back when in the hood....
