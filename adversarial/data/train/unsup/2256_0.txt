We've been anticipating Southern Tier to open for some time now and we're very happy it did! We got there around 11:30 and it wasn't too busy (we got there just in time. It has a really cool feeling when you walk in, there's a bar to your right and a lot of seating. You can see where they brew some of the beer and there's a window into the kitchen. Everything was very clean, as expected since it's only been open a week. Our waiter was very nice and super knowledgeable about the beers they have and beer in general.\n\nI had: the Fish and Chip sandwich with fries. Everything was delicious! The garlic aioli really topped it off! I only wish that the piece of fish would've been bigger, but we were there for lunch so it wasn't a huge deal. The fries were very well seasoned and delicious as well. I also had a Victory Sour Monkey beer which was extremely good!\n\nHe had: the Pastrami Reuben with fries. In his words... \"it was awesome\" He went with a Nu Skool brew as recommended by the waiter and he was a big fan. \n\nAll in all everything was great and we look forward to coming back many times over!
