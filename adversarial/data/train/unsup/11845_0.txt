It's a Cheesecake Factory. It's a chain. It's over-priced. But it sure is tasty. And there are so many food, drink, and dessert options. I can dine forever on just appetizers here.\n\nThis particular location is nestled in the Caesar's Forum Shops. It's rarely too crazy busy where there's a wait. I prefer dining on the faux \"patio\" so I can people watch the mall. And you can sorta see, albeit mostly hear, the free show thingy that happens at the fountain \/ fish tank out front of this location.\n\nService was decent. A bit scattered. But attentive and friendly enough.\n\nOn my visit here, they were out of buffalo blasts. Which was incredibly sad as those are the absolute most greatest thing ever at Cheesecake Factory. In fact, they are the best take on buffalo wings my taste buds have had the pleasure of enjoying.\n\nBut it wasn't a total dismal thing as there was a new (at least to me) menu item - buffalo chicken meatballs. They were just like the buffalo blasts, but in meatball form. Extremely tasty.\n\nThe mac 'n' cheese bites were also a hit. The Cheesecake Factory really does do this trendy appetizer better than most.\n\nAll the other appetizers we sampled were tasty too, but less memorable and crave-worthy.\n\nAll in all, there are far better, more unique, Vegas-specific places to throw down your money for good eats. But when you need to please a crowd, have a specific craving, everywhere else is full, and\/or you just need to get off your feet and eat right now and you're right by here... It's better than most other chains and it's got decent people watching.
