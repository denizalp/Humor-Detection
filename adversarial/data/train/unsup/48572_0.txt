Love this place. While there are several options on the menu the bruschetta board is the way to go. They make changes ever few months to the options - but my personal favorites are the bacon & burrata, warm artichoke and the pepper jam. Usually a bruschetta board and a salad split between two people is enough to fill me up.\n\nThey also have some great wine specials on certain weeknights and happy hour.
