Visited Gilbert on business, and stayed two nights here at this hotel and casino.  Very nice place.  Clean, though the air inside the hotel has the distinct smell of cigar smoke.  That wouldn't sway me to lower the star rating though.  They could be doing that to provide a sense of ambiance.  My suggestion to them is either rotate the hotel air out or change the air filters.\n\nOur hotel room was really nice.  9th floor and a beautiful view of Greater Phoenix.  Too bad they don't have a buffet, but I understand.  They took those costs and applied it to making the resort better overall.\n\nThe cafe inside the casino, Cafe 24\/7, is as the title says....open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Good food.  The wait staff is somewhat attentive.  I don't know what it was when we arrived there, but the Native American staff always had either a somber look on their face, or they were upset about something.  24\/7.  But again, that doesn't take away from the star rating.\n\nThe casino is SMALL by indian casino standards.  No craps table even, but the casino staff is attentive and helpful.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to stay and spend a few bucks, come here.
