While out shopping we encountered this Starbucks location and did not even know was here. This store is conveniently located in the corner of a shopping center and was designed nicely. It has large windows in the front to let in light and shades covering them to block the sun perfectly. The cashier that greeted me was bubbly and super sweet, and the barista was working in unison with the cashier already making my drink order while I was still ordering.\n\nWith such great team work and organization between the employees my drinks were made in record time. I ordered a white chocolate mocha and a Carmel macchiato. I was sharing the drinks with my twins so I ordered them both in Venti size. The barista got my Carmel macchiato just perfect with added whip cream and Carmel to the top of it. Our coffees were wonderful and so was our experience so gold stars .
