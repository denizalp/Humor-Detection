Had sample platters cause hey life is all about choices. We loved the chicken, the sausage was ok,  the brisket was pretty good, pulled pork ya ok alright. Waffle fries two thumbs up. The sauces are bomb a little regional sampling from the big BBQ kings in the states. The mustard one was killer. I was not a huge fan of max and cheese need to pep up the flavor on that a bit. All in all I will say this it tastes pretty good and the place is wicked clean so ya I'll be back and hey saving 25% on our first try all good stuff.
