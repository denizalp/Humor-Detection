I had the privilege to stay at the Hostel one night and it was even better than I could have hoped. Although the entire place was not quite complete, the owner went out of his way to accomodate me. Meeting the other guests and hanging out with them was also a huge highlight - I now have a friend from Tokyo! \nWe were able to watch fireworks from a beautiful rooftop deck, and my room was spotless. You will not find another place in Cleveland with such a great location either - Ohio City is an absolute blast. I can't recommend the Hostel enough!
