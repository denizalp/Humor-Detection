I agree with the previous post. The mini speedboat F13 are not well maintained. The steering slanted to the left and we had to hold it this way to go straight. For a taste of maneuvering on lake Ontario at about 8km\/h without high expectations it's worth a try - I guess. Be sure to choose a time where there aren't too many boats out the island will be less congested. \n\nIt would help if the registration staff was more friendly. To be fair, a few of them were helpful when checking in. When leaving we got an earful from the \"green girl\" who screamed and scolded us for being late when we came back at the time we were told by the other staff - so NOT our fault. Making a mediocre experience end on a very negative note.
