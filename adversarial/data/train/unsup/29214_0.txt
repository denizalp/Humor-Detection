Fantastic coffee. I travel for work -- and work took me here to Toronto this week -- when I want good coffee, I know to look for an Aussie coffee shop. The toasties were perfect snack while getting a little bit of work done. The owner is very sweet and friendly. My partner had a flat white, I had a long black, both great. Highly recommended.
