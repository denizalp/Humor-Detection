A dark, mysterious no frills cocktail bar. They're in the business of making pretty decent and cheap mixed drinks. It's intimate and dimly lit with a charming poetic vibe. The cocktail range is incredible. They have everything from fun tropical drinks served in coconut shells and tiny umbrellas to brandy, amarula, bourbon, triple sec drinks, all for under $7.75. \n\nThey don't have a food menu but are ok with outside food. As small as they are, they have a tiny dance floor near the DJ. The music is not fantastic but a few umbrella drinks are bound to put you in the mood.
