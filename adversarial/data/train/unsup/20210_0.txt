Went last night, not very impressed. The pics online and in menu are deceiving. Yes marketing pictures are typically that way but this was an exception. The Jack burger was flavorless and the fries cold. My friends daughter had the ribs which were tough and the sauce bland. Unfortunately for us it was live band night and it was so loud we couldn't visit. We ask to go outside just so we could hear each other. Service was mediocre. I over heard someone at another outdoor table say  \"this place isn't going to last long\"  yikes!!!!! I wish them the best!
