As the current Duke of the Blake House, I figure it's time for a review.\n \nThis recently reno'd pub hits that balance of \"clean, casual, and not a shit hole.\" I hate places that are so loud you have to yell to your companions (looking at you, W Burger Bar), and for better or worse I've yet to see this place get overly busy or crowded. The large patio is well-shaded, and the interior looks good with banquettes and dark wood. This place has curb appeal, but I question whether there's enough pedestrian traffic on Jarvis to support it. Somehow I doubt the ballerinas from across the street are streaming over.\n\nThe draught selection is more than acceptable, including Mill Street (Original, Organic and Tankhouse), Creemore, Steamwhistle, KLB, Guinness, and Waupoos Cider on tap. Yes, they offer pitchers.\n\nI've had a few items off the menu. The Chicken Caesar Salad was surprisingly good, with a lighter caesar dressing (not gloopy) that still had some zip. The fries are solid and worth an order. The Avocado BLT is a popular choice, and is served on some serious egg bread. To my surprise, however, I found the bacon to be overly salty (and I'm not one to eschew bacon...or salt for that matter.)\n\nBeware: the \"nachos\" are not nachos, but a cheese-chili concoction served on homemade potato chips (think cactus cut potatoes). I'm an idiot, and didn't read the menu properly, but heads up: these are a much heavier meal than typical nachos would be.\n\nNo doubt we'll be back here again.
