I used TruCab for a recent trip to and from the airport from downtown Phoenix for a trip spanning 3 weeks. Communication was fantastic throughout the trip and the reassuring call before pickups were great. Text messaging also helped as I wasn't able to call with flight number details. I was a little disappointed our driver to the airport forgot our coffee and doughnuts as promised but was pleased they arrived on time, I didn't need the calories anyway. :) Our return trip was great and was picked up in a black Lincoln Navigator by Larry since we previously booked the return pickup. Super friendly and I enjoyed our conversation. Wouldn't hesitate to use them again!
