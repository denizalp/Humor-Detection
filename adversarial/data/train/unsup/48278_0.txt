Worst service! Waiters have no knowledge of the menu and ingredients. We tried it 3 times as eddies wok and roll was busy each time. Every single time was more of a disappointment. Food not the greatest taste like bottled sauces but the service!!! horrible!!! We had a young girl each time that knows nothing on the menu and then a guy posing like a manager (guy with glasses) was rude when we complained about our food being not what was described in taste by the server. Ugggg no wonder they changed names with the same management cause they suck!!!!
