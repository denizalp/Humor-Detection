I had to write a review because this spot is such a great local hidden gem. The studio has a great feel and energy about it from the moment you walk in. The aerial swings can seem a bit intimidating but all of the instructors seem to be very aware of their students and are continually guiding and making sure u are completely secure in ur postures while in the swing.  It can be a workout or it can be yin in the swing....either way it's awesome! You kind of feel like you are magically floating on air. Mat classes here are also awesome. If you want a great workout try the yoga sculpt. You will feel it the next day! Everyone there is great but I want to shout out to Kassi who makes it so fun and amazing and Nikki who makes everything in my body feel better with her yin class. You will not want to exit the swing when you are done with one of Nikki's classes.
