Omg...when you see a perfect 5 stars with over 1000 reviews, you know it is going to be amazing, and IT WAS! My husband and I visited Arizona for the month of February on our year long trip around the US. We were looking for a good BBQ place and this was the first place that popped up on Yelp. Based on the reviews, we knew we had to go.\n\nWe went around lunch time during the week, waited in line for maybe 25 minutes, and were enjoying our delicious BBQ shortly after! We do what we always do, and each got 2 different meats and 2 different sides so we could share. I don't know how, but we both cleared our plates! We have found that many BBQ places over salt their food, which is good, but only for a few bites. I have a hard time eating BBQ that is too salty, because after a few bites I feel full, but that was NOT the case here. The meat was perfectly seasoned and smoked, where it wasn't too overwhelming (and I was able to clear my plate!) All the sides were excellent! \n\nWhat I really liked was how they served you the food. They asked specifically what you wanted, such as \"more fat or less fat, more ribs or more brisket\" which was great! Normally we just get what we get! :) \n\nI would 100% be back next time we are in Phoenix!\n\nI actually just wrote about our experience here in my blog post about the Food and Fun in Arizona: https:\/\/tandaintheusofa.com\/2017\/03\/16\/food-and-fun-in-arizona\/
