Stay away from Title management & Sharlene Hodgkins escrow officer in arrowhead.\nI'm still in the process of closing on my house as of 08\/27\/2013.\n\n.I received an email from Sharlene asking me to have my wife sign & email back a one page document to her asap.I emailed Sharlene back asking her to sign what? there is no attachment? She emails me back saying to me (ED you're behind on your emails) I didn't know what the hell She was talking about? so I called her on her cell phone,I Asked her again what Do you want my wife to sign?\n\n she responded back with sarcasm (Edmund,Edmund,Edmund).I asked her again what's with the attitude? this time she said your pain in my ass.I was shocked that just as I exactly described our conversation that she would use that kind of language with a client.so I responded back with a fuck you too Sharlene & hanged up the phone.\n\nThat's honest to god the truth & accurate about the whole conversation.Now having Told you my horrible experience with Sharlene Hodgkins would you still want to do Business with her? you have been warned.
