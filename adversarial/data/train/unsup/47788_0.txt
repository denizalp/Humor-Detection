This place is probably the best place I've had rice rolls at. My family was is this business after all so a think I know a little about what I'm talking about. I grew up eating rolls everyday.  The rice rolls (ordered the beef rice rolls) were so great. The unique style or shape of the rolls means there are no additives. Unlike the ones you get when you go to a restaurant for dim sum. The congee (we had the seafood) could have use a few more seafood pieces but overall the taste is great.  The size is a little small but there are place that charge more for a lot less tasty food.
