Good location right next to Walmart, it really wasn't that packed for a Sunday afternoon. We were seated quick and easy with no hassle. Our server Michael was really good; he knew a great deal of the menu and was responsible enough to make sure all our needs were meet and was really good with the kids. Our server was very lenient with us and our order; cheerful happy and professional. I had biscuits and gravy blueberry pancakes and a steak omelet; I know I'm a fatty!! Lol!!  We sat near the kitchen and staff was a bit loud and lots of plates and glasses rattling and banging around.Yet I sort of lost my appetite the place needs a serious remodel and cleaning. The booth back splash had coffee stains and crayon marking all over the wall which made me look around a bit more. The wall just above us was covered in a thick layer of dust like nobody cleaned these wall in months and the vent just above us was dirty as well covered in thick black mold. This is all pretty scary sitting with my food just above all this dust and mold. Place has potential but they need to clean up their act, better yet just clean up.  Our server MICHAEL WAS GOOD!! You can be extremely great somewhere else!!
