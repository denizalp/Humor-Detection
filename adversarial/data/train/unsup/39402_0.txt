This is one of my favorite thrift stores in Madison. I don't buy shoes second hand all that often--mostly for lack of selection--but this place has a fantastic selection that changes pretty often. Their prices are a bit higher than you'd expect for a thrift store, but the difference isn't huge. They've also got a little punch card program: when you fill up a card you get like $10 off a purchase or something. Be sure to ask about it. :)
