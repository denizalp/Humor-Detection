First time I have ever been to this location here in Tempe. The hardest thing was finding a place to park! Other than that it was great. \nWe got the appetizer with all the tastes of Greece. Grape leaves were wonderful, as well as the Hummus. Lots of bread was served with everything. Pita Bread and a type of bread in small slices, which was very good and fresh.\nSo wonderful and delish was the Flaming Cheese! That was amazing!\nI got the lamb and awesome... I would get it again.\nWe did get the Baklava cake, not my favorite. Real Baklava is much better.  \nService was very fast and friendly. Restrooms were clean. \nI would go back here any time.
