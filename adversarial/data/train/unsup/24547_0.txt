I came here on a Wednesday night and I am glad I stopped by here. I normally don't order fancy cocktails but I had an old fashioned. Tau was the bartender and the drink was pretty delicious!\n\nThe bar is a chill spot to hang out. It wasn't too busy on a Wednesday night but it is a good spot to hang out and relax with friends for drinks. I thought the coasters were pretty cool too! I would definitely stop by for drinks with friends if I am back in the area.
