We let the chef and server essentially create a blend of the 3 different fusion cuisines they offer. It was simple. We told them what we don't like and the budget and they handled the rest. We had great sushi some Brazilian steak and some Chilean sea bass. Great presentation, great service and frankly for the price vs other over priced strip dining you can't beat this one. \n\nThe ambience is loud, colorful and very close\nSeating. So assuming you are ok with this you will enjoy. Fantastic job!
