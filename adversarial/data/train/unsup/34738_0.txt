Waited almost 25 minutes for my food and then it was cold? So basically it was just sitting there for 10 minutes. Not a great first experience. I walked across the street from my hotel, The Palazzo to try something new. Won't be doing that again.\n\nEdit: I had given them two stars but they got dinged one star for the joke of a customer relations call from the Wynn to try and \"resolve\" this matter.\n\nCouldn't even keep your two star review huh guys?
