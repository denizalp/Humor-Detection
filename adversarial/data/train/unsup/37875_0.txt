So this location in the Rio is only open for breakfast and lunch...say what!!!  That's ridiculous. Why even bother having this location. I came here one morning before my convention and I was seated quickly enough. I went with the #1 Farm Scramble. When it arrived, it was not that warm and the crispy potatoes seemed like they had been sitting there awhile. But what was really terrible was the biscuit. I was really excited for their biscuits because they are usually so good. Well this one wasn't.  It was super dry and you need a gallon of water just to muster it down.\n\nThe service was fine but this location is the pits. And with the limited hours...it should just go ahead and stay closed for 24 hours.
