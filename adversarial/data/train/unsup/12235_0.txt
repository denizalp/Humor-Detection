I wish I could give this place zero star!!\n\nMy appointment was on 12\/16\/14 at 4:30 and they didn't call me in until 5:30 FOR A CLEANING ONLY with nobody in the waiting room. Anyway, I was calmed no need for anger. Once inside they did x-rays and the dentist KYONG HWA MOON DDS looked at them and recommended whatever I needed. Then, the hygienist tells me that because its so late my insurance company is closed so we will need to reschedule the cleaning. Yes!! they weren't going to clean my teeth, until I asked them why they would schedule me the time they did if they knew what time insurance companies closed, and that they could have called before since they had my insurance info when I made the appointment. And that it wasn't my fault they took me in so late if I was there on time. I told them I left work for this and that they were going to clean my teeth today. The hygienist said she was going to ask, and she came back and said that it will be another 20 minute wait and I said ok just because I had to leave the country that week and had to get my second cleaning before the end of the year or else I would have left. The dentist ended up cleaning them since the hygienist was busy and she took like 10 min to clean my teeth: brush, (polished by another hygienist), some scrapping, no floss, no goodie bag, etc. \n\nWhat dentist sends patients away? not take care of what the appointment was for, especially for a cleaning appointment?? \n\nHORRIBLE UNBELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE :(
