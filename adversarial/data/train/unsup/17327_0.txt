Like other yelpers, I went to the theatre to see John Fogerty of CCR.  He puts on a nice show, which lasts close to two hours.  He packs in all of the hits you'd expect, and puts forth a great physical effort considering he's 71. The show is worth the price of admission.  Drinks, as one might expect, are pricey ($22 for a cocktail and a beer), and service can be slow.  If you want snacks, you have to bring them in from outside.  \n\nFor seating, I was in section 1, row T, which is the last row of the lower section.  I had a nice view, and since T is the last row, you don't have anyone breathing down your neck or kicking the back of your seat.  Overall, the theatre is a good venue to see a band, and I'd certainly recommend the show (which seems to rotate in and out).
