The food is alright nothing spectacular except their $$-$$$$ pricing depending on what is ordered. Eg. Their baked goods & cookies are EXTR. Overpriced as well as their Pantalones $19.99-65.99?!!! Huh what the hell why? Cookies 10.99-45.99\/kg. Same reactions huh.... Etc.?!!! You go ahead & buy\/try & let me know what is all the fuss & expense? Too much for my taste. Oh yeah they are selective to give out their wifi usage p.w. Try one day & another day. They are trying to be cheap with their service even though it seems that they are not hurting. Their Italian\/ non Italian customers are plentiful prosperous eg. Many luxury cars pull up every am or evening. I see the mini parking lot EXTR. Busy when I am going to work early in am & back from. Good luck & try to enjoy yourself.\nService is quite friendly with a few helpers behind the counter but cashiers are hit & miss...!
