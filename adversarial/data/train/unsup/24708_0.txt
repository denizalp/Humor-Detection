Trevi is an Italian restaurant nestled inside Cesar's Palace Forum Shops.  It's surrounded by all the high end shops like Gucci, Tiffany, Cartier and Louie Vuitton so you can't miss it.\n\nThe name, famous for the fountain in Rome, can be found...not surprisingly in front of a pseudo mini Trevi Fountain. The nice thing is that the restaurant has an outdoor cafe feel without really being out in the elements.\n\nWe wanted to rest our tired feet and have a glass of wine and an appetizer.  I will warn you the restaurant is very noisy due to the sound of the fountain and the tourist's milling around it taking photos.\n\nDespite the crowded noisy atmosphere and one large drunken party of 12 who were loud and obnoxious...we enjoyed it...especially after they left.  \n\nService was friendly but the hostess needs to smile and be a little more cheerful with all the customers. \n\nA bread basket was brought out and it had a warm soft rosemary loaf that was full of flavor and some olive oil was perfect for dipping!\n\nWe ordered the Fritto Misto ($14.95) which is lightly breaded seafood and vegetable appetizer. It was heavenly! \n\nLots of surprises in this starter including the lemony garlic aoli dipping sauce which was the perfect accompaniment.  \n\nI will caution you that you will find fried cloves of garlic.  So if you want to ward off the vampires... eat these!  \n\nCalamari, lemon slices, squash, and scallops were also found in the mix.  It really was a nice starter. The best thing was the portion size. It was a nice generous serving and enough for the three of us to nibble on.  \n\nTo top it off we each had a fruity refreshing glass of Pinot Grigio ($11) and we thought that was all we needed...until we saw the gelato.  \n\nTheir Tiramisu gelato ($6.50) was full of that wonderful coffee flavor and it had some bits of ladyfingers in it too. Yummy!  If you don't want to sit at the restaurant they offer a counter where you can just buy a cup to take with you.\n\nThis place fills up quickly so either get a reservation or come early.
