Went in for a checkup on Wednesday. Saw the great reviews and hey, it is cheap for the checkup! But with insurance, I didn't have to pay anything for the first visit. It was actually pretty nice, I had scheduled for 3pm since I got off of work at 2pm, but that day I ended up getting off work early and as I drove home, they called to see if I wanted to go in early. Perfect!\n\nGot there, filled out paperwork. They already knew who I was as I walked in the door. Got me back right away. And they had 50 First Dates playing to keep me busy! The x-ray thing is uncomfortable, but the girl did the best she could do get them done quickly.\n\nThen I saw Dr. Cheng (the female dentist) and she was really nice. She was knowledgable and explained everything to me after the exam. The cleaning was quick and painless.\n\nGoing back in 2 weeks for fillings, so I'll let you know how that goes! But for now, I would give it 4 stars. Good clean facilities, good location (Next to Sushi Bomb!) and great customer service.. very efficient. We will see how the fills go! Hopefully painless. THEN i shall bump them to 5 stars!
