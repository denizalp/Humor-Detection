Chicken Wars 2009\n\nKFC, Popeyes & El Pollo Loco have all been trying to get your fast food chicken $$.\n\nBoth KFC & Popeye's FREE Give aways have turned into complete fiascos BUT El Pollo Loco somehow manages to serve tons more customers daily without a hitch.\n\nI walked into a packed restaurant with 5 cars in the drive-thru yet it only took me less than 10 minutes to order & get my food.\n\nI got the 2 pc white meat w\/2 sides & flour tortillas.SIdes were Cole Slaw & mac n cheese plus I oalso got spanish rice.\n\nThey have a salsa bar here so load up on pico,salsa & sauces.\n\nThe chicken is lime-marinated fire roasted so it is GOOD!!!! Very moist & juicy very tangy and so damn good. \n\nI mean its NOT Koo Koo Roo which used to be in this very location BUT it is way and I mean way better than KFC or Popeye's.\n\nThe sides are real good too.
