Yummmmmmie!! I love POKE! \n\nI got the two kinds of Poke and rice. One is shoyu tuna poke and the other is spicy ahi tuna poke. It came with two scoops of rice. My friend got chicken katsu, shoyu tuna poke, mac salad, edamame and two scoops of rice. Now that was a meal in itself. All the food was delish. Everything flavorful with the taste of the islands.  \n\nThe place is cute. Big enough for a couple of groups. Clean and well organized. The sauces for chicken and stuff are on the counter. Serve yourself soda pop. Staff is friendly and helpful with the food items. Great job to the owners of teaching them well manners. \n\nI can't wait to go back. It's delish here.
