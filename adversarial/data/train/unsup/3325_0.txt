I have known about Lazy Dog from back when I lived in California, but never got around to trying it. The husband and I were shopping at Downtown Summerlin on Mother's Day, and although we figured this place would be crowded, we decided to walk here and find out how long the wait was. 45-55 minutes. No thank you. Came back a week later and as we were parking, I was afraid the wait would be long again. The parking lot was packed for some reason and a lot of people were waiting outside. But I guess people were just hanging out. We walked in and hostess seated us at a booth right away. \n\nOur server was attentive, but I didn't feel like he was too friendly. A manager also stopped by our table to ask how everything was going. The food was delicious! I ordered the Hawaiian Sticky Ribs, which was cooked perfectly and I loved the generous amount of sauce that was on it. Juicy and full of flavor to the bone! Honestly, I don't like to order ribs too often because most places never prepare them right. It annoys me when they are dry and barely have sauce on them. It also came with Umami Fries, which had a kick to it, but it was good. I could have done without the asian slaw on the plate, which was really soggy and bland. My husband ordered the Country Chicken and Biscuit, which is part of their weekend brunch menu. I didn't try it, but he said that it was one of the best chicken and biscuit dishes that he had. We didn't leave any room for dessert, but definitely next time because the Butter Cake does look good!\n\nI would like to come back again to try different dishes. I like the wide variety of food that they have to offer. Also think its cool that you can bring your dogs to dine with you on the patio, along with a dog menu!
