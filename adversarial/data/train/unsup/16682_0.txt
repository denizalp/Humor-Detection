Lots of hype but came out of it all with a 'meh'\n\nI felt somewhat awkward with how I was greated... compared to the other places I've gone, I didn't feel like it was a very welcoming atmosphere. Cool decor but weird vibes. \n\nAnyways, I spent $50 on a haircut with some neat features. My hands were dipped in wax (felt nice, but I got the wax all over my jeans... which looked... awful haha) My hair was washed a bit longer than I would normally wash it. They put a hot cloth on my face then put some toner on it. Thats the neat features.\n\nIn terms of the actual haircut, it looked super good. I went on their website to remember the name of the person who cut it, but I cant find her on there.\n\nOverall, cool and amusing experience but not a place I would dish out $50 once a month for a haircut. \n\nAlso, the whole 'man' thing got aggravating near the end. What if a woman walked in with a men's short hair style, would she get turned away? Stereotypically, a man who wants to pay $50+ for his hair probably won't give 2 shats about an xbox.
