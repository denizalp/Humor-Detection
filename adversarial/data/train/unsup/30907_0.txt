Ribs and pulled pork - Fabulous! Very juicy and full of good meat flavor. The seasonings don't overpower the food but properly enhance the essence of the pork. \nWe found the sides didn't live up to the meats, but they had only been open three days. I'm giving them another shot for sure. At the least, getting ribs by the rack and pulled pork by the pound is a great meal starter.
