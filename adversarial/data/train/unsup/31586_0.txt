Creative Mediterranean food at a decent price. I've had difficulty finding great Mediterranean food in Vegas until now. My wife and I loved the duck pastry dish, salad, and cucumber dip. I hear the brussel sprouts are a must....next time!\n\nGood service and good drinks too. Cocktails are creative, but overpriced at $14.
