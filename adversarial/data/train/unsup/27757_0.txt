I don't normally Yelp but I had such a good experience with this Pep Boys that I thought it worthwhile to share.   I had to purchase tires for my wife's car and she worked with a person named Herold who was a gentleman from start to finish. Instead of pushing extra services, he spent considerable time explaining what needed to be done, what our options were and what was the most cost effective solution.  No, this is not what one expects from a car part dealers....\n\nKudos to Herold for showing that the words \"customer service\" still actually mean something!
