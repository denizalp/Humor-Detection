It's bad when your salesman walks around with your clean title & car keys your there for 4 hours. Anthony, then you get home and realize that the car was reposed 2 months before. And the paperwork is screwy. The worse part is the Toyota Camary gets crummy mileage. Compare to your VW Jetta . You go back the next day. Anthony is gone of course. You want your Jetta back. It's gone too. We go screwed. Anthony is constantly eating breath mints. I would never recommend These people or their dog to my worst enemy. As far as their maintainence department. When we were there some blonde little woman was getting yelled out.  I was done. I asked Anthony for my title & keys hold on! This might be you. NEVER EVER USE THEM!
