such rude staff. \nI walked in and almost walked out after not being greeted for over five minutes. ended up having to wait another 30. \nWorst full set I've ever received. it looks so tacky and fake. there's huge bubbles in every nail and the woman insisted I pay her BEFORE for this reason I'm guessing. I kept asking her to make them more round and each time she looked at me like I was speaking Swahili. \nwhat a joke of a salon. do not go here if you're looking for quality.
