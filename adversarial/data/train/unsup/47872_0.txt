Jessica is amazing! This was actually my second time there. The first time I had just gotten a haircut and the stylist really messed it up. I was so embarrassed that I wore a hat when I went to see Jessica. She was so kind and fixed my hair beautifully. This last time I got a cut and highlights. I LOVE the results. She is professional and friendly. She really knows what she is doing and she will tell you if the style you picked will look good for you, which is a quality I love! She even took the time to show me the best way to style my new do. She's more than a hair stylist, she's an artist. I will only let Jessica do my hair from now on!
