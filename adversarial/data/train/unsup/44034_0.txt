Much better than I had expected for a home improvement store within city limits! Staff were helpful and knew exactly where to point me when I needed some guidance. The organization of the store is pretty much like Corporate dictates - the same as the rest. The items offered are reasonable quality, although most aren't super high end when it comes to fixtures and appliances. That being said, I have always been able to find a great many items that are key to maintaining my home in tip top shape. They keep a nice supply of LED bulbs, garden tools, hardware, and regular tools, so I am satisfied. I haven't ever consulted with them for a home improvement project, so I can't really comment on that aspect, but they definitely advertise the services! Will definitely be back due to it's convenient location.
