My husband and I tried this place for the first time and were beyond thrilled. The service was amazing, the margaritas were delicious, and the food...omg. so good. We started with chips and salsa with guac, and I probably ate way too much of it because I seriously couldn't stop. There were several things on the menu we wanted to try, so we will definitely be back. I ordered the Chimichilada, and my husband ordered the Christmas stack. Very flavorful and perfectly cooked. I ordered the black pomerita and was pleased that it wasn't too sweet or tart. Nice balance of flavors. My husband ordered the Cruise Caddy which he enjoyed. \nThe atmosphere was pleasant, nice lighting, appropriate music that was not too loud. Our server was very knowledgable about the menu, and had such a great attitude. \nCan't wait to come back!
