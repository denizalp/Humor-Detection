We choose this place because of Yelp's ratings. Very tasty food at a reasonable price. The smoked meats were delicious! The fire roasted corn appetizer, yummy! Only minor issue was our server who apparently had a rough night before was forgetful, charged wrong but apologetic.  Otherwise worth the trip!!!
