Fab falafal! I found the experience here so overwhelming though, that I actually got my food to go and sat in the car to eat it. \n\nI was there during the Saturday lunch rush it seemed, and it also seemed that everyone knew where to go and what to do but me. As a first time patron I would have liked a little direction. The tables were mostly full in this massive warehouse-like restaurant and lines were everywhere. I wound up just getting a falafal pita which I really enjoyed but I'm not sure if I would return and endure the stress of the place for one again. Maybe going at an off hour would be better and give me the opportunity to really peruse the menu and ask questions to the staff. We shall see.
