TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! \n\nWe were out of town and had guests staying at our property when our fridge went out so we called A-1 Appliance Repair to come out and fix the problem.\n\nThe service repair tech who came out to fix the fridge damaged our kitchen floor by putting a huge scratch in it. The floor is stained concrete and the damage was pretty bad. \n\nThe repair tech told us after the fact and said that it wasn't a big deal. \n\nWhen we arrived back in town we saw that there was a huge chunk taken out of the floor and was much more than a little scratch. \n\nI called the owner of the company to let him know what happened and he stated that they were not liable for any damage. \n\nAt no point in time did I give his company permission to work on my property and waive all potential damage they did to the property.\n\nThe owner stated he had a recorded phone call saying we gave them permission to work on the property and any damage they were not liable for. I asked the owner to provide me a copy of this recorded call of which he refused.\n\nThe gentleman who runs this company doesn't understand good business practices. If you do a job for someone and damage their property you are liable for fixing the damage you caused. \n\nThe owner refuses to pay for the repair of the floor. I would highly suggest staying away from this company.
