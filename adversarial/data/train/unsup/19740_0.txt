Take me out to the ballgame, take me out to the crowd... buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks... I love baseball!\n\nHow I've been in Scottsdale for four years and just now finally made it to see some Spring Training games, I don't know... but better late than never!\n\nI've been to a couple of games at Scottsdale Stadium (home of the SF Giants) so far this year... and I intend to make a few more as well.  It's easy since we're walking distance to the stadium and lawn seats are a bargain.\n\nI grew up a huge Detroit Tiger fan but I have to admit, I haven't been following baseball as much as I'd like.  But, there is something about going to these games that brings back childhood memories... they are so fun!  Go for the baseball, go for the people-watching, go for the beer... go for whatever the hell you want, but just go to a game - you'll thank me later!  Have fun!
