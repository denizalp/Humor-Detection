Culinary creativity is a rare entity to encounter in Pittsburgh.  However, thanks to photos uploaded by fellow Yelpers, chef Keith Fuller's gastronomic work caught my attention during one of my random nights perusing this site.  The next step was to verify my curiosity, by making a visit to Root 174 and indulge myself with the multi-course tasting menu.   \n\nFood (9.5\/10) = \n1) Watermelon soup with cantaloupe, peach, ricotta cheese, pistachios = A very refreshing way to initiate the multi-course dinner on a summer night.  The pistachios provided a balanced nutty component to the natural sweetness of the fruits, while the ricotta cheese added a non intrusive creamy\/savory element.\n2) Crispy brussel sprouts with bacon-black pepper jam = Big fan of brussel sprouts!  Root 174 excels with this dish.  The name of the dish says it all.  It's crispy.  There's the fattiness from the bacon.  There's the sweetness from the jam.  A true winner.\n3) Black caviar caesar with parmesan, baby kale, egg, white anchovies, focaccia = I'm usually bored with caesar salads, however the execution of this caesar salad was impressive.  Note, I'm also a sucker for poached eggs!\n4) Figs with blue cheese, beets, brown sugar crumble, and a gastrique (forgot what kind of gastrique) = One of the best fruits to indulge in during the summer months.  It doesn't get any better than pairing fresh ripe figs with cheese.\n5) Apple fennel salad with  macadamia \"cheese,\" maple black pepper vin, grilled radicchio, walnuts =  Another outstanding refreshing summer time salad.  Certainly a great dish to have before moving on to the more savory dishes on the menu.\n6) Pork belly with rhubarb, strawberry apple compote, savory rice crispy, jalapeno, barbequed pop rocks, banana = Love pork belly.  But to pair it with rice crispy treats and barbequed pop rock candy?  WTF?!  This was the most creative dish of the night, and was I immediately intrigued when I saw it on the menu.  All the components work well with each other.  This dish was absolutely fun and playful, and I wonder if this dish best exhibits chef Fuller's personality.\n7) Grilled octopus with romesco, olives, pickled potato salad, pesto = I rarely...RARELY order octopus, since most of my prior experiences were overcooked, tough octopus meat.  Wow, was I pleasantly surprised when my fork sank into the meat with little effort.  I did not expect to find octopus this tender in the middle of Pittsburgh.  Bravo.  The brininess of the olives were well balanced with the octopus.\n8) Coffee confit chicken wings with curried creme fraiche, dried banana chips = The only other time I've had coffee rubbed into meat was with steak.  I've now been educated that coffee can work well with chicken.  \n9) Chorizo stuffed chicken leg with mole sauce, creamy grits, pickled cauliflower, and peanuts = My favorite dish of the night.  The chicken meat was hella tender, and married well with the spiciness of the chorizo.  Also, some of the best grits I've had since I left the South.  \n10) Hanger steak with halloumi, apricot, cardamom, black rice puree, kale, cream corn, tomato, bread = The hanger steak was very tender and well executed.  The black rice puree looks just like chocolate.  \n11) Beignets with ganache and orange chips = The only dish of the night I was not impressed with.  Having lived in Louisiana for several years, my palate has been spoiled by beignets from down South.\n12) Bread pudding with ice cream dessert = Soft.  Moist.  Warm.  Sweet.  Chocolate.  Ice cream.  Need I say more?\n13) Celery sorbet = Second time in my life I've encountered celery sorbet (first time was in San Francisco 6-8 years ago at One Market Restaurant).  This dessert was a fantastic way to conclude the night, and was just as exciting and refreshing as the watermelon soup, \n\nService (9.5\/10) = Our waiter was fantastic.  Not overbearing, and he knew the menu well to describe the components of these complex dishes as they were brought to our table.   \n\nAmbiance (8.5\/10) = A very simple and small yet cozy environment. \n\nOverall Opinion = Chef Keith Fuller's tasting menu is an absolute killer.  $67 for all the dishes I mentioned in this review?  What an awesome experience.  I'm surprised this restaurant doesn't share the same level of popularity as other restaurants in Pittsburgh (e.g. Meat and Potatoes, Butcher and the Rye, etc.).  Is it location?  Is it the simple ambiance?  Is it the level of creativity that Pittsburgh palates may not be accustomed to?  Who knows... What I do know is this restaurant is a true gem, and if you have been in Pittsburgh for a while and haven't visited Root 174, get your ass to this place ASAP.  Why didn't I give this place 5 Yelp stars?  Well, it was the beignets.  I only give 5 stars when everything has been perfect to me.   Ideally, I would've given this restaurant 4.5 stars.  Regardless, bravo to Chef Fuller!
