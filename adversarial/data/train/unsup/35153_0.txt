Mercado de Los Cielos is an indoor Swapmeet. You'll find Pi√±atas, Mexican Candy, Shoes, Clothes, and lots more. It has tons of different vendors and access to the Dessert Sky Mall.\n\nPlease Note some Vendors DON'T open on Wednesdays! \n\nI personally dont trust small vendor shops with my credit card so to these places I carry cash. Some vendors charge you a fee of 0.50 cents to use your debit\/credit card
