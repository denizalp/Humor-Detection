This was my first hot yoga experience.\n\nI was surprised to find that the room, though crowded, did not stink. I was situated between two large men, and it did not stink. \n\nAnd at the end of the intense session, a nice cold lavender-scented face cloth wraps that entire workout up.\n\nThey're currently running a promotion - 10 days of yoga for $10! \n\nIt's definitely worth checking out. It's a VERY short walk from the Eglington West station. Easy to find, even for a visitor to Toronto.
