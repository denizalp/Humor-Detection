We visited here for the first time for lunch today.  I will say I am not impressed and will not return.  I ask to order my meal off the children's menu and explained to the waitress that due to medical issue could only eat a very small bit.  I was told no. Not even a let me check with the manager.  Normally I would leave the restaurant and go someplace else that would accommodate me.  But since we were with other people I stayed. I ordered a regular item, ate 3 bites and was done. Others in our party were not pleased with the food as they said it did not taste fresh.  It's sad as it's a beautiful restaurant and good atmosphere.
