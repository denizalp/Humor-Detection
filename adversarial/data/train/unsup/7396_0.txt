I have been a loyal iPhone customer for over 4 years. Between myself and my wife we have owned 5 Apple products, 4 of them being iPhones. However when seeking a replacement for my cracked screen at this location they asked for $150 to replace it. The \"Genius\" even confirmed that the original crack was definitely a defect, but because the crack had progressed since then, they couldn't replace it under warranty. \n\nHaving spent thousands of dollars on their equipment, and receiving no consideration for even a declared manufacturer's defect. I have decided to quit buying products that are expensive, defective, and that they refuse to back up with warranties that mean something. \n\nGoodbye Apple. Hello.... pretty much anything else.
