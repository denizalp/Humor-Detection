We came to Vegas and stayed here for the first time.  \n\nPros:\n1. Elegant\n2. Modern\n3. Big rooms (We stayed in the suite)\n4. Close proximity to the casino and bars\/restaurants\n5. Big bathrooms \n6. Great staff\n\nCons:\n1. The casino (Mandalay Bay) was pretty bright and intense.  I preferred the Luxor's laid back atmosphere much more, but the good thing is that the casinos are attached. \n2. They were a little slow with the housekeeping \/ room service\n\nOverall, a great place to stay.  We usually stay at the Venetian, but this place held its own for half the price. I am definitely staying here next time.
