Aside from buying a house and a car, getting a new roof is maybe the most expensive purchase you might ever make. So when it was time, we did a LOT of shopping around. Yelp still doesn't have too much for roofing companies, but we used what's on here as well as other research, and we drew up a list of \"the best of the best\" to come make a bid.\n\nAfter all this, we chose Hinckley Roofing. Now that the job is done, we're so glad that we did. We learned where a lot of roofers cut corners, and Hinckley did the opposite. They went above and beyond to get the job done right. A lot of houses in this development have the same kind of water issues and problems, but ours was completely fixed by Hinckley.\n\nEven after all the work was done, the owner of the company came out to make sure that everything was to our satisfaction. It was!
