I found this to be a smaller airport. No trains to catch to get to your gate, so I welcome that. After flying back from Aruba, all I wanted was to get on my next flight and be home. We found a restaurant to sit down and grab a bite to eat. We used the wall\/plug outlets at the bar to charge our phones. I deducted a start because there were very few charging outlets\/options in the airport. After walking out of the restaurant, it seemed like the terminal was suddenly busy. And this was almost 10pm. I guess it's a major airport for American Airlines. Anyway, while walking to my gate, I really, really liked the row of trees with white rocking chairs underneath each one. If I'd had more time between flights, I definitely would've tried to relax in one and listen to music on my headphones. Add a star because of the trees. Really nice way to bring a bit of nature into an unexpected place. Overall, I had no issues here besides few charging outlets.
