Went back two days later. Same great service, we had pasta, perfectly cooked and tasty puttanesca sauce.  Too much sauce on the pasta for my liking.  Americans seem to expect this, I like it better how they serve it in Italy. Big portion. Split with my husband and with a salad was plenty. Owner sent us after dinner drinks when she realized we were there for 2nd time that week.
