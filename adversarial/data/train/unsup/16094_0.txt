I was referred to All Desert by my home warranty as well.  I needed to have my Fisher & Paykel washing machine repaired - although good overall, it is a bit obscure and a bit difficult to find a service for it.  I didn't wait for All Desert to call me - I called them and spoke to Jennifer.  Very pleasant and helpful.  The first scheduled repair was on New Year's Eve.  Should've known better than to expect anyone to show and the tech didn't call or show.  I called after the holiday to complain and reschedule.  Jennifer was very apologetic and again, very pleasant.  She scheduled another tech to come ASAP and gave me a shorter service window.  The \"new\" tech assigned was Alex. He called me prior to arriving and was there waiting when I got home.  He was very professional and very thorough and very friendly.  He explained the situation and his suggested fix.  I did have to wait about a week for parts to show - not sure if this was normal or not, but I stayed on top of the situation.  Alex was scheduled to return for the repair.  The service window (2-6) was almost over when Alex called to say that he would be a bit late and offered to come a bit later.  He kept his word and returned with the parts.  Although a bit late, I really appreciated the call and was glad he was willing to complete the repair.  Again, he was very thorough and professional.  I would recommend them and urge you to be sure to stay in touch with them to confirm appointments or returns.  I highly recommend Alex!
