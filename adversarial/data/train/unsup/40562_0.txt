Fue un desmadre.   Restaurant was nearly empty yet it took 20 minutes to be seated.  Only 3 of us received menus.   Only 3 of us received silverware.   My son was given 2 random soup spoons.   Out of 5 orders 1 was correct.   The food came out haphazardly.   My enchiladas has sat under a heat lamp but were then allowed to sit and get cold.    All vegetables (lettuce and tomato) were omitted from all orders.   My wife's tacos were cold and served just meat and and tortillas.   The refried beans were the consistency of soup.   Truly an awful example of a chain Mexican restaurant failing at the easiest of things.    This was the culinary equivalent of waiting at the DMV or sitting through the emoji movie.   Skip this unless you're a masochist.
