This place is huuuuuge! There are so many displays and lots of stuff to look at. I have not decided if I like it better than Michaels because it is quite different from Michaels\/Joann's.\n\nThe only bad thing is that they don't take competitors' coupons. However, they almost always have a 40% coupon online.\n\nI've used this place for buying regular arts and crafts, home decorations, and wedding decorations. They have a ton of great wedding items and lots of wall art. Their displays at Christmas are huge! However, I recently just went here for Project Life by Becky Higgins Scrapbooking items, and they didn't have too much. :(\n\nIf what you want is not on sale this week, it will most likely be on sale the week after that. I think the items alternate being on sale.\n\nYou can also rent an arch here for your wedding, plus a few other things. There's a flyer by the floral & wedding department.\n\nDon't forget they are closed every Sunday!
