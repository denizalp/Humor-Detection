AMAZING food - it is nearly all homemade pub food (the fried pickles are the best). Daytimes are a little slow on the weekends and you may be caught in there on your own listening to Frank Sinatra, but it is a chill environment where you can enjoy a pint and relax while watching tv or reading a book. Truly an enjoyable place to spend time.
