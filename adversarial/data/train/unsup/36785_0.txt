My car broke down across the street from their shop, so I chose them out of convenience.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nThey charged me about $1200 to replace the fuel pump in my Mazda. I didn't have much of a choice since my wife needed the car for school the next day.\n\nThe car broke down again a week later. I called my regular repair guys, and they quoted me $500 for a fuel pump replacement. LESS THAN HALF of what the predators at CJ Auto Repair took me for.\n\nAnd then it turned out there never was a problem with the fuel pump. The fuel injector had gone out (a common problem in Mazdas).\n\nMy regular guys took care of the actual problem for $150.\n\ntldr: If you want to pay 10 times the price of the right job for the wrong job, then head on down to CJ Auto Repair. They'll be happy to take you for a ride!
