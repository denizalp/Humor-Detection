Came here for an event and YUM YUM! The event served a 3 course meal and all the food was so good! I had a green salad with a delicious dressing (i  just wish i had asked for the dressing on the side because the greens were swamped,) the pasta pistachio - great portion size btw - didn't think I would finish it - but apparently i was super hungry! and the amazing dessert definietly the winner of the meal, a delicious chocolate mousse cup with a peanut butter brittle. One thing I would say is that this place is in dire need of an update. A lot of Pittsburgh places that are classics look like they haven't been touched since the 80's or 90's and this is one of them. The price points of the menu's are pretty reasonable though and the bar is absolultey beautiful with huge windows (in a seperate room than the dining area.) I would def recommend coming here!
