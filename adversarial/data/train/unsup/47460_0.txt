I ordered a gate from this company.  They were slightly more than a previous quote from another company but I chose to go with them anyway.  I had a picture of a neighbor's gate for them to duplicate.  The salesman (Chad) drew it out and did not indicate that it would be a problem to duplicate it.  They called and asked to install the gate on a day that I was not going to be able to be home.  They said it was no problem, just to sign that it had been delivered.  The installer showed up right when I was leaving and I signed the invoice.  I pointed out to the installer that the \"knuckles\" looked sloppy but due to the fact I needed the installation done and I had to leave I let him install it and figured I would inspect it later.  I had the opportunity to look at the gate that I took a photo of close up and another gate with the same \"knuckles\" and realized that they did a very substandard job.  There is an excess of metal on the \"knuckles\" and they are not well defined as in the other gates that I sent them photos of.  My initial contact with them was not returned and I had to call several times to get a response.  When I emailed them the photos of the other gates, they responded very quickly to let me know that I had signed a release saying the gate was fine and they would not do anything to rectify it.  They insisted on installing it the day I said I would not be home long enough to make sure it was installed and now they are claiming I signed a release.  If they did a poor job they should fix it regardless of what was signed.  I am appalled at their lack of motivation to make sure they installed a quality gate and their unwillingness to try to find a solution.
