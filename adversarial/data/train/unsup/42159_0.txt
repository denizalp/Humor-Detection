I went to see this show about a year and a half ago and ever since then I have become a fan. Now it's become a must see on my list everytime I go to Las Vegas and I drag my friends to see it. Now I got them into it :) These guys are sweet, entertaining, and wonderful to watch on stage. Yes sometimes the moves are not always in sync, but if you are looking for dancers to be in sync then go see a show on Broadway!\n\nThese guys are more than happy to get up close and personal with the ladies, but don't be nervous about it. Just enjoy the attention and you'll definitely remember it as one of your light Sin City memories. The guys have friendly and vibrant personalities. They even come out after the show to talk to the fans.   \n\nIf you want to have a ladies night out or see a male revue without feeling guilty or dirty afterwards, then go see Thunder. Also the routines change periodically so you never know what to expect. Besides who can complain about seeing some shapely bodies, handsome faces, and hearing smooth Australian accents!
