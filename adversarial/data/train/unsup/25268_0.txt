This may seem like a better version of Denny's or IHOP, but US EGG stands alone! After you eat here you will understand. I'm super picky, and enjoy the finer things in life.  I went here on a layover several months ago and am now back! This is a beacon of breakfast food(never tried lunch here). I order an Idaho hash ( eggs, avocado, hash browns, bacon, chicken, tomatoes, onions and cheese along with a side of their famous protein pancakes) So, SO, So good! Just try it!
