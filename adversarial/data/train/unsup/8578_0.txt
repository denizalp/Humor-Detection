I'll keep it simple: If you want great food that's not frozen, thoroughly cooked and at your table in under 30 minutes: don't eat here. If you want to stare at the wall or a bunch of replicated NASCAR junk: you should come here because there's something wrong with you. \n\nSave your money. Burger King is cheaper.
