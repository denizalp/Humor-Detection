I went to this establishment on one the TapOut promotional events. The food and drinks were moderately priced and the portions were plentiful. The service was pleasant and attentive but it was a Thursday night. The happy hour beer and sliders promotion needs a couple more additions. Good place for cold beer after hiking at red rock.
