Although I have had many a good meal here, tonight was utter disappointment and I was a walkout. \n\nHostess said there would be a 15-20 minute wait for my party of one. With a less than half-filled dining room it was obvious they were understaffed \n\nWas offered a seat at the near empty bar. Five minutes before the female bartender asked what I wanted to drink. Got the drink and then stared at the menu and tv for another 10 minutes while she made drinks and I walked out the door. And the folks in the lobby were still waiting. \n\nBUSINESS CLOSED LATE 2017.
