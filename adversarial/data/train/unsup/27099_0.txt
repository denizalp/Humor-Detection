A part of me wants to keep this a secret! But, this business deserves some serious love. \n\nIn this awesome strip of antique stores and restaurants in Indian Trail is mid century salvage, only open on the weekends and overflowing with retro goodness... If you get there when the doors open. Our early afternoon stop still let us take in some great pieces, and very reasonably priced. Some were in their mostly original condition, some were partially refurbished, and some had been completely reupholstered and restored. They keep most of the items closest to their original shape as possible until after purchased, when the sky is the limit (they had a dining set in serious need of repair, and the full restoration was included in the price). I had my eye on a piece and the owner (?) starting telling me all of the awesome things we could do with it, from a simple fabric swap to modifying the size, to breaking it into two pieces and changing the base materials. \n\nThey do all the modifications on site it seems, and bust their butts finding great pieces throughout the week to sell on the weekends. Besides larger dining sets and couches they also had some wall art, lamps, end tables, and small accessories. There was fabric in the window but didn't ask about it. \n\nHe also has a wish list if you're looking for a specific piece, he'll try to find it for you!
