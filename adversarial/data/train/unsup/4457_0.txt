Unbelievable...the first time we came here we had a horrible experience where we had someone name drop the owner of the casinos to get in on their reservation on time when we had been waiting for ours for 35 minutes. After my yelp review I was contacted and comped a meal which I really appreciated. We have since come back and had no issues until today when I talked this restaurant up to our closest friends only to have a waitress who doesn't come to the table, won't stay for more than a second, didn't ask how our food was, and what's going on with every person who works here not knowing anything about the menu? I gave this place a second chance and clearly there is a lack of direction, training, passion or even an ounce of consideration for the customer. You're in Summerlin which is probably on par with the strip on what you expect when you drop $200-$400 on a meal. There shouldn't be any issues when you're paying  $16 for an omelette that comes out bland and boring. I'm embarrassed that we brought them here to this. We won't be coming back off of shear principle. Things need to be fixed or this will be the next restaurant to turnover quickly. With restaurants like Andiron less than a mile a way you can't operate how you are.
