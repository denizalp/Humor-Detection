I came here for breakfast and ordered the pork Benedict special. Eggs are done right. Pork & potatoes are filthy in a good way. Bottomless coffee and the waiter was very generous when it comes to offering refills.\n\nI know, you probably don't think breakfast when you think Sneaky dee's. But check it out if you are in the area, it's pretty good.
