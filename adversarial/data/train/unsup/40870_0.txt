Beautiful interior. Nails done well all three times I have been since it was opened. They have a sugar scrub for $7 with oranges and it smells nice and is lovely. No mini pedicures they only have full pedicures so do not call asking for that. Staff is mostly friendly but some have not been so nice. But if you are going for a great nail job it is worth it!
