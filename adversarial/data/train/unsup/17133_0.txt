All and All this place has  a very dot com trendy new wave young vibe to it..  and it seemed it was really about as to whom is trying to impress whom.. I loved the decor and and lighting and the colors were perfect. The Martinis were excellent. The draped private party in the center was very nicely done, and would be great for a larger party.\n\nOur waiter had a tad of attitude issues but I suppose he feels he needs to be,working there, but it really was not necessary. We are in our 50's and still cool I would say and this waiter was a bit cold to us, why I am not sure. Our money spends the same as others who are younger.\n\nI have dined all over the world and in nicer places than this, so I was irritated when I politely asked the waiter if he had any fresh parmesan cheese, for our butternut ravioli and my husbands pasta. Yes, I know we are in a steak house but we both were in the mood for pasta and the NOVE was closed.\n\nThe waiter smiled at me with such attitude like I was asking a STUPID question, and answered that we do not offer any parmesan...  and then just stared at me.... with a big fake smile...\n\nI  stared back with his same fake smile and stated that when you serve italian on the menu it would be correct to serve fresh parmesan, he rolled his eyes and off he went to help a table of 4 drunk guys that were louder than the whole restaurant yet very entertaining.\n\n\nWould I go back, maybe if I was there, would I make a trip to go back, NOT A CHANCE...
