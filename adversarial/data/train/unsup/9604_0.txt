I honestly have to say that I never really was a huge fan of tacos. I have had them if friends ordered them, but I never really had a craving for it. Until now.\nTako serves the best tacos in town for sure. I had a couple of different ones to try so far and I loved all of them. All of them have a unique combination of flavors with my favorite being the \"tako taco\". The octopus is grilled to perfection and is accompanied with a zingy sauce and greens. The amount of octopus you get for $18 is very reasonable! However, the only thing that did disappoint was the guacamole that everyone was raving about! We took the classic one and for my taste there wasn't enough lime and cilantro in it and was rather bland and to charge $11 for it, is a bit of an overkill. \n\nTheir margaritas however are really good, and so are their desserts. I also do love the the place itself (dark, fun and cozy) and most of the staff is really friendly and if you're ever picking up food you can watch the chefs preparing it. It can be quite hard to reserve a spot at this place so be prepared to wait a couple of weeks if you're a bigger group. I was usually quite lucky walking in on a Sunday afternoon without having to wait! Definitely one of my top 10 places to eat here. I'd give them 4.5 stars.
