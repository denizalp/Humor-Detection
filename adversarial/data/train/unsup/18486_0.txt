Patisserie Manon? More like, Patisserie Ma-NOM!\n\nI apologize, that was terrible.\n\nBut really this place is pretty, pretty, pretty good. After trying and epically failing trying to go here (showed up on Monday, then showed up when they were on summer break...) I finally got to eat here and was it worth the wait? Oui.\n\nBefore we talk about the food lets talk about the baked goods cause my lord the baked goods. I went at like 8AM on a Weds and still ate like 50 dollars worth of cakes, cookies, and tarts (love a good tart... or a bad one... especially the bad tarts...) Other reviewers go into this in detail but I'm not really a macaroon expert I just know these were delicious- very macaroony. \n\nFood\n\nThings I have eaten so far\n-Croque Madame- its a ham and cheese sandwich with more cheese and a cheese sauce and a fried egg. Take that clean arteries. \n-Quiches- real men don't eat quiches, but luckily I am a fancy boy so I do. Spinach and goat cheese is respectable, as is mushroom and bacon but the quiche Loraine takes it IMO.\n-Omelettes- If you know 3 things about the french its that they surrender, they are snobs, and they love omelettes. The last 2 really work in your favor here as the omelette is top notch.and you can get a large swath of ingredients added to it- Brie is a great one as they put two huge slices of it right on top. \n-Baguettes- I know, how good can bread be? Pretty good. Hot bread with butter is one of the simplest and most delicious things in the world and this place knows their way around the oven.\n-Croissant- pretty damn good. Extremely flaky and buttery, the opposite of how I like my women.
