My neighbor recommended this place to me after having their Italian sandwich.  Of course I had to try it, so on my first trip, I ordered the Italian sandwich.  It was very good, and had a generous amount of fine Italian meats and cheeses.  Even had enough left over for my lunch the next day.  I then saw they had zeppoles on their menu.  I LOVE zeppoles...but I am from NY so I had a different expectation, I guess.  Their version was almost raw pizza dough (?) with lots of powdered sugar, and a side of jam.  It tasted nothing like the zeppoles I know and love, but were satisfying in a dough-y, chewy sort of way.  OK, but probably won't order them again.  \nMy next trip, I ordered a medium pizza, with their meatballs and sausage.  Meatballs were amazing, although very thinly sliced.  Sausage had a 'different' flavor, not the normal pizza type sausage I'm used to.  The owner is very friendly, and will offer samples if you want.  Place was busy on the times I have been there, so I think that is a good sign.  Price was a bit higher than I would have liked, but the food and service are a cut above the ordinary pizza places.  I definately will be back to try more items in the future.
