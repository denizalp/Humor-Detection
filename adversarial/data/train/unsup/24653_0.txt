We came here on a Saturday night.  I booked the limo expecting to have to share it.  Limo driver shows up on time.  No shared ride, he took us directly to the restaurant.  Nice limo too.  Bonus.\n\nThe place smells good when you come in.  We waited for our table at the bar.  My GF hit four of a kind on a VP machine and won over $200.00.  Nice way to start the evening. $$$\n\nReally, this place is awesome.  From the drinks, the food, the live music, and service.  I had the Veal Parmesan.  It was terrific.  GF had the Lobster Ravioli, #2 Daughter had the Cioppino.  We shared the Fried Calamari and a Antipasto Salad.  There was so much food!\n\nPerfect old Vegas style without being cheesy.  Take the one you love to Casa Di Amore.  It's a classy move.  We'd go back in a minute.  Loved this place!
