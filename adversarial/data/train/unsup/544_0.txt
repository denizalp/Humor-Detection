There's nothing like walking into a joint that you're, at first, frightened to dine in.  This place isn't carpeted but it feels carpeted, ya know!  The rule is, maybe you shouldn't look in the corner of the floor or look behind the counter but one thing you should definitely fucking do is eat here.  The dumplings: homemade.  Your wallet: still fat. Your belly: now fatter.  You: Straight-up content with a glistening, dumpling-grease smile.  \n\nThis is the real, delicately-folded dumpling dough of goodness, my friends.  I haven't done much right in my life but by this review and spreading the love that is this place, hopefully rights my wrongs.  \n\nTry this perfection. \n\n\nRATING: 2 painfully erect nipples.  OUCH!
