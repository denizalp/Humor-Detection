DELICIOUS!! JUICY AND DELICIOUS!!! whew I can not get enough of that steak.  Anyway Hi there!!! We (me and my wife) where lucky and I mean lucky to get into this 5 star steakhouse inside the hotel and casino \"Paris\" I bet most of the people know the famous English Chef Gordon Ramsay from the realty tv show \"Hells Kitchen\" .  We got in here courtesy of our resort by just attending our \"owners education\" class.  This place is no joke and very high end down to the variety of bread given to us.\n\n\nWe got lucky very lucky to got on here because it's reservation only.  In fact our reservation was at 9:30 pm but we had a concert to go during that span of time so we decided to go and chance it and went prior to their opening schedule at 4:30 and got in for that time.  We both had 8 oz filet, mushroom , and mash potatoes.  I can't describe how the steak was so cooked perfectly in opinion.  Juicy, soft and we both had ours cooked at medium well.  It was just right.  It's all worth it and it's as good as advertised.  Pricey but worth it.  I forgot, prior to, our waiter came and showed us all the steak cuts.  And the service was great.  Definitely going to come back here again someday
