I didn't think the food was anything too above average, but the service was really great. The server helped us understand the menu and made it very clear what was vegan or not. I had the almond French toast which tasted good, but was pretty small and left me wanting more. My partner had the tofu scramble and it wasn't anything I couldn't make at home, but still good. However, they do offer vegan shakes which is so hard to find and that is my favorite thing about Monty's.
