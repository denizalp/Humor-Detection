I have to say.. in my opinion the buffet had good choices that were tasty! Didn't find it to be not too much or not too flavorful at all. I did go for breakfast so maybe dinner is different but I thought it was an okay buffet. Especially for what you pay for it was only $18 a person which for what you get it's not too bad! You get your own drinks which was different but we also liked it because we didn't feel we had to tip too excessively. Overall it was a decent buffet (again for the price.) Wish it would have included at least one mimosa or something but other than that I don't have a complaint!
