I am a fan!  My dearest and I went last night - he is borderline diabetic so doesn't eat pizza very often.  But, he had a need for za so we went to Grimaldi's.  We had been there once before many year ago with a larger party but this was just the two of us.  Red and white checkered tablecloths - I looked around for LADY or a TRAMP but none in sight.  We got there early and were lucky to score a high top table as the place was filled otherwise.  Our waitress was so good.  Personable, knowledgeable about the menu and much more importantly, friendly.  \n\nI ordered the house pinot  for $4.00.  WOW.  Generous pour and a really nice pinot.  OK so my dearest went with a Miller Lite.............  There are three basic choices for the pizza.   Regular, tomato based sauce (sure it was San Marzano's), white sauce and pesto.  We opted for the regular with meatball, onion, mushroom and green pepper on half for you know who!  Not me!\n\nThe atmosphere is fun - lively, kids doing their thing, and a great patio!  We waited awhile for our pizza but it was fun just date talking and people watching.   Several of the people around us ordered one of their salads.  They looked wonderful and the small one easily feeds 3 if not 4.  \n\nWhen our pizza came it was delicioso!  I am such a fan.  They only serve beer and wine but what's not to like with an excellent pino grig at $4 and Miller Lite ( oh yes they did have many other more palatable options).  \n\nI am looking forward to going back!  Highly recommended!
