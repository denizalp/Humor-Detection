great food. too bad we were all there for a bachelorette party and didn't want to over stuff ourselves because we were in dresses that don't allow much room for food babies. vanity won out over happy tummies that night. \n\ni got the kobe short rib, which was good but had no wow factor. now the chicken on the other hand was an outstanding restaurant chicken. i hardly ever order chicken from a restaurant (because it usually sucks or isn't very inventive) but i wish i had here. it was incredibly flavorful and juicy for a roast chicken. the mac n cheese was divine and the mashed taters were pretty good too. \n\nthe only dessert we got was a complimentary congratulations chocolate peanutbutter thing that was crazy good. too bad it wasn't to congratulate me, or i would have told my friends to back off and ate it all myself (j\/k). lucky for me my friend wanted to share with all of us!
