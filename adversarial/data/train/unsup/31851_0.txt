This place is adorable! They've definitely done well with the decor. The service is ok. We had several people constantly checking on us and they were fast and efficient. However, everyone that came to our table was lacking personality. Food was good, not great. I'm glad we came here to try it, but it wasn't so amazing that I'd come back.
