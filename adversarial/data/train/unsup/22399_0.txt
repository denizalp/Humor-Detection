Ok I decided to cut sugar from my diet just recently and along comes this new place to the 'Hill to spoil things..\n\nDayyaam!  Yogurt is good for you right?  Probiotics.. sure :)  well I was curious so the no sugar diet was put on hold temporarily.. hehe\n\nEntering the shop, first impression is that it's spacious with a purple and white theme. the ceiling are very high about 25 feet making a very airy feel.\n\n\nThe shop is logically laid out\n\nIf you hadn't been here before this is how you go about your business.\n\n1. You start at the back with the frozen yogurt dispensing machines and fill up your cup to your hearts content. \n\n2. slide over and work your way to the toppings bar.\n\n3.  then finally cash out on the scales. \n\nyeah the price of your yougurty order is based on overall * weight * of your order (yougurt +toppings) reason for the scales.\n\nOur sinful red velvet+white chocolate+brownie concoction scaled in at $7. as mentioned the price varyies depending on the weight of your order. \n\n\nSome stand out items of this place:\n\nOffers unique and great tasting frozen yogurt flavours - like the Red Velvet cake. cool! \n\nA1 quality toppings - ingredients that ranged from fresh fruits, nuts and details like the Ghirardelli chocolate syrup. yum\n\nWorking the metal levers of the dispensing machine - it gives me a a satisfying feeling, this might be a man thing though.. :p\n\nLCD monitor where you can Tweet to and view your tweets live - this is geeky and high tech I know, but cool nonetheless. \n\nDifferent types of seating. Bar type, outdoor and indoor seating. \n\nAh Yogurty's.. you broke my diet but this time I forgive you. :)
