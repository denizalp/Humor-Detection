We had a small water leak and when they came out to assess it I was mentally preparing for a $2k quote to fix the problem. Instead, Ken showed me where he thought it might be coming from, and recommended a very easy solution (removing the leaf\/debris buildup) that would be easy and free for me to do before starting to take more drastic measures. So thankful for an honest assessment without them trying to oversell me on what I \"need\" to fix it. Thanks Ken!
