MMMMM went here for the first time to have some happy hour with my favoritest person ever! She goes here all the time! Me on the other hand has never seen Westgate before hmm 9 pm and the only thing I usually order is a nice strong drink. I was rather excited. I see her at the top of the escalator, just like those cheesy movies we hug when I reach her. We sit at the bar...first thing I notice is a really bad smell. It wasn't her haha I gave her a hug and it was fine. It wasn't me, I smelt like perfume. Hmmm the bartender in me came back...so I smelt the menu. EWWWWWW it was cleaned with a rag from the sanitizer bucket probaly, but it has not been switched out for a while. I had to wash my hands. I ordered a kirin and a spicy tuna salad. Everything tasted amazing...my bill was a lovely 8 bucks. I left stuffed and satisfied with the food...but I could not get the smell of those menus out of my nose!
