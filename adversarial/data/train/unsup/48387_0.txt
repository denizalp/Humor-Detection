Stack'd is your typical burgers and beer bar\/restaurant, located in an area where most of the clients are college students looking to hangout. It is self seating, and the wait staff eventually will find you - typically takes longer on busy nights.\n\nThe food comes in large portions and like most meat off the grill is greasy but very tasty. The available toppings are numerous and combinations endless. This alone can provide you with entertainment and an interesting burger\/experience. \n\nThe half of specials are worth it - Monday - half off wings, Tuesday - half off regular burgers, Wednesday - half off veggie burgers. Just make sure you get there early on Tuesday!\n\nStack'd remains one of my favorite burger joints, for a half price, meaty meal.
