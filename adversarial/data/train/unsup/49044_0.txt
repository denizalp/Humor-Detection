I stumbled across this place when I was in town for a wedding a Yelp'd \"vegan\".  I wish that it was in Orange County.  \n\nThe food was great.  I had \"Thee green salad\" and some samosas.  It was easily enough food for two people, but I knew I would never be coming back so I wanted to try a few things.  The dressing on the salad was delicious and the flavor profile was very well put together.  The samosas were cooked to flaky, perfection.
