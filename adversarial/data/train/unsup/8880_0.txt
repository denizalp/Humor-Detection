It's hard to say, \"I'm not a hot dog kind of gal,\" when I just ate two hot dogs for lunch today. And one yesterday. \n\nI like the simplicity of saying, \"Want a hot dog?\" when a \"Yes\" means I get  a Tokyo Brat with Daikon radish, boiled eggs, wasabi sauce, and green onions. Or, a Chilean hot dog with avocados, spicy mayo, and sauerkraut. Today I had the Chicago with peppers, pickles and onions.\n\nLike others have said, the environment is basic. A few small tables, some old school lunch boxes, a clean counter, an easy-to-navigate menu written in colorful chalk. \n\nThe wafflewiches are overdone. The waffles are huge, crunchy, but not too dense. They should be shared. Before eating, apply chapstick and do a little warm up routine to loosen your lips.That's how fat the wafflewich is.
