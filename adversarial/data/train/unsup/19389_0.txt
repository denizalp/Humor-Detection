It was my first time at the market, I spent the day there at Kids Korner Hanging out with Gabi decorating Yelp Bags. The kids booth is just as busy as any of the other vendors it was a lot of fun! \n\nI made a few laps and was really happy to see all the fresh produce and food items. I bought organic golden beets, tri-colored carrots, broccoli, butternut squash, meyer lemons, sweet potatoes, romaine and something that I don't even remember what it is ;-) at McClendons. \n\nI tried some amazing vegan tamales....SOLD! I'm not even vegan but they were delicious with corn, spinach and mushrooms. \n\nI had an equally delicious Raw Organic Vegan wrap from Chef Sarah's booth (not me) (see pics) It had Almond Hummus, Tapenade, and a bunch of veggies and greens all wrapped up in a collard green leaf. \n\nI also bought 3 loaves of bread from the Phoenicians IL Terrazzo. \nA Rosemary, A Pecan, Raisin and Currant and Ridiculously tasty Chocolate Cherry Sourdough which didn't even make it through the night! \n\nI topped it all off with a scoop of Love in the form of Basil Lime Sorbet from Sweet Republic. \n\nIt was a great day and I will be back!
