Let's just say for a moment you're a snob. You're one of those fru-fru people that likes their chocolate one way, dark, because that's the only \"true\" way to enjoy good chocolate. If you love Hershey bars, read no further. Click some other link and get out of here. Why you ask? Because at Mon Aimee, it's likely you're going to pay $5 for a chocolate bar.\n\nBut, dear reader, that is going to be one of the best damn pieces of chocolate you've ever had. Of course they have a wide variety of chocolate from all over the world, not just dark. That just happens to be the way the person described in the first two sentences of this review likes chocolate. And don't let me make you think this is some stuffy place. It certainly is not. The owners love their chocolate, they love good food, and they're more than willing to help you.\n\nFirst time I was here as a chocolate neophyte, trying to choose between Belgian, French, German, and Italian chocolates, having no clue as to what was good or bad, one of the employees asked if I needed assistance. In broken English with a thick Spanish accent, he took me on a whirlwind tour of all these different brands. All I remember him saying was, \"Dis is really good stuff!\".\n\nHe couldn't be more right. This place rocks.
