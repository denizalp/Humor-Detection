Came in for dinner on a Saturday night at about 9 PM.  A little busy, but the service was fairly quick.  Large selection - mostly bar food.\n\nGirlfriend had a taco salad which had a very greasy shell. I had a club sandwich with fries and a cup of chili.  Fries were made there, crispy and great. Club was not toasted and had no spread. Chili was tasty.\n\nPrices were a bit higher than a Phoenix bar & grill, but I guess it is Cave Creek.
