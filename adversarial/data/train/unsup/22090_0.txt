It took several hours for me to be able to even write this review, I was so upset, after getting off the phone with the District Manager Lyle. He works out of this location on Eastern Ave. It never ceases to amaze me, that the restaurants in Las Vegas think that they can act and treat their customers terrible and they will keep their jobs and the business will continue, to keep its doors open. I leave this review in hopes, that is NOT THE CASE! I called the restaurant to place a to go order for pickup. I had send someone to the restaurant to pick it up, but when they arrived, no one had a clue what was going on??? I said, put me on the phone with them. After going around with 2 gals on the phone and one manager, Drew, trying to get my order for a soup and salad ready, for about 10 minutes, I said, I'm not paying for this order, you guys screwed this up, this is ridiculous! He says, \"Well, we can't give you free food!\" Number one, the order was called in, you dropped the ball! Number two, then I had to talk to 3 different employees, the gal got the soup wrong (fixed it, the size AND the kind, were both wrong!), while the manager ran around and LITERALLY THREW, my salad together!! Ridiculous behavior when they are charging $19.00, for these two items!!! You can have Great Food all day long, but if you have HORRIBLE SERVICE, and employees that are VERY RUDE, guess what, PEOPLE WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! Just like I will next time!! There's a million places to eat in Las Vegas!! Bye Bye Zupas:( I hope Corporate is happy with your behavior, because they are on my to do list for tomorrow!
