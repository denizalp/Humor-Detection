I dont know what I put last time for this place, but I love it. Its within walking distance of my house. Never want a DUI, worst ever seems like.\n\nGood beer selection, cool staff, foe the most part. As far as ive had, foods good, so far. Bartenders are cool as hell, im just optimistic about Gordon Square. My latest review on Gypsy says it all. I see this neighborhood coming up, fast. \n\nAlthough, I just had a convo with two guys, one looking like Sloth from \"The Goonies\", one of my favorite movies btw. He was telling me I should try XTC and Viagra mixed. He said its called,\"SeXTC\". Wtf is this world coming to? I took him for a square and hea telling me he loves acid and mixtures of drugs, so freely. I dont know what to say. This had nothing to do with XYZ. ITS AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO COME AND RELAX! Theres just things we cant stop and its people like this showing up wherever they want. \n\nOh well...
