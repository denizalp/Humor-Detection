They have an awesome selection of electronic toys. I bought my ASUS G75V gaming laptop there. The only thing I dislike is there return policy's are stricter than Best Buy's but other than that it is awesome and they have a coffee shop as well.\nThe ASUS laptop I bought blows away the gaming desktop I had this gaming laptop will run anything I throw at it.I play Battlefield3 with no problem and flight simulator X is awesome on it as well. This laptop mad most desktops obsolete.
