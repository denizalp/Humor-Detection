Oh my god I dunno where to even begin, I been a customer of this place from day one, when they first opened on Jane St. I was very busy with my business, and I wanted to make sure that my dog the love of my life was still active and not bored at home alone, so I thought DOGGIELAND was the right place, I took him a couple of times at the beginning for just the day care part and he seemed to really enjoy it then I made the decision to start buying there monthly package and I would drop him off there at least 3 to 4 times a week then I needed to bored him as I was taken a trip for business, and I wish I never did or at least looked deeper in to this place but I didn't, as I was away I got a call that my dog got injured as he was playing his nail got caught on to there stupid rubber flooring they and it was yanked right out of his paw I came back to find his paws double the size and infected really bad, it cost over $2000 in vet bills and he had to get a surgery to remove the nail completely out of his paws and sins then he's been traumatized from visiting any vet, I should have put a stop to it back then and sued there ass, but I didn't given that they were new in business and I some what thought I can trust the owner\/manegment (Sandra). I continued to bring my dog there he was still very exited everytime we passed by the place and always anxious to go there and they seemed to put a front every time I dropped him off that they were so nice but God only knows what happened after I left keep in mind I was steady buying packages from this place so they were making good money off me and pretended to treat me and my dog good but it was all an act, then again one day I picked up my dog and he had bite marks and dry blood all over him they told me he was playing that's BS and you know it the a third time the same thing happens I thought oh well it the dogs it's not the staff but that was wrong because if the staff knew what they were doing that wouldn't happen, then I boarded him again at there new location and when I came back he smelled so bad and he was sick he had pneumonia, I asked then where he was kept and how com he's sick and the owner tried to tell me that she took him home with her and he was at her house another BS God knows where they left him or if they had any heat on as it was in the freezing winter. After that time I started really backing off from that place and not buying as much packages and I would only take him there 1 to 2 times a month and that's when there staff started showing there true colours and the owner Sandra as she wasn't making that much money from me anymore. The prices kept on going up every few months and I would ask why and they say oh second location and new staff more rent bla bla bla BS she just got greedy, her staff were so rude and unprofessional except (Christina) she was nice. The last time I took my dog there he came back limping and again sick with a cold and they had basically told me that my dog is getting old and not getting along with other dogs and that I should consider another place and they had put his file with the rest of his stuff I found it when I got home how rude and ugly can people be my dog is a sweetheart im a bit to blame as I kept taken him there but I really thought he enjoyed and what was happening was just accidents but it wasn't accident cause accidents  happen one or twice not 10 times. Please be carful with is place don't go there there fake and they don't treat the dogs right they don't deserve no star but then I don't think I can write review protect your pets this place is bad and I'm going to make sure I tell everyone that goes there my story and I have proofs and medical records to show. I must say thank you for the file cause I will be able to match his stay there with the medical records and the will see what my next step will be as I will make it my mission to make sure everyone knows how bad this place is and what my dog went through over there this place is horrible
