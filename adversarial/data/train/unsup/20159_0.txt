I came here on a Saturday night for my sister's bachelorette party and this is a pretty cool venue.  From what I could remember, my group of girls and I received 2 free drink tickets, which was pretty awesome.  I like how the venue has an inside (which I did not get to go in because it was so packed), but glad the outside area is spacious because it could get super hot inside, especially during summer days.  Music was awesome and the performer that night was David Guetta.  I didn't remember much since i was drunk but thank you to the group of guys who was also celebrating their friend getting married.  Thank god we did not stand the whole time!  Great place!  Would definitely come back!
