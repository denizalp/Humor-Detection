So at 8pm we arrive... wait in line for 20 minutes for THREE people ahead of us. There were two women on the line and two visible chefs. More than half of the food was not made, about half of what was left was old and barely left in the pan. By far one of the worst experiences we've ever had at panda. Service was so slow, uninviting and the food looked gross. I have worked in customer service\/restaurants for 6 years now. Get it together panda.
