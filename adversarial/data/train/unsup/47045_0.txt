Used to go to golds gym until it closed and had to switch. Luckily this gym just opened and decided to try it out. \nI've always heard that LVACs are usually crowded but not this one. There's so many cardio machines and free weights that I don't have to worry about waiting. Love the women's only gym even though it is somewhat small. \nJust recently discovered the dry sauna and use it after almost every workout. Definitely recommend this gym even though it was a little out of my price range, it's totally worth it!
