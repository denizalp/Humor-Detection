Really enjoyed my first Indian bbq experience. Open family style dining with plenty of cooking activity to keep you mildly entertained as you wait for your freshly prepared meal. From the Nan cooked in front of you to the delicious lamb meatballs with yogurt mint sauce the meal was almost too much to eat. But save room for desert the Kulfi Mango ice cream is a must!
