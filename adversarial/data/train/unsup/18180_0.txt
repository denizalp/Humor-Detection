I am wildly unathletic and uncoordinated.\nGod gave me a whole lota limbs but not the will to control them in any organized way.\nThis place is honestly the best fitness\/excersize experience I've had.\nI've been coming here for just over a month now, and I love it.\nLinda, the owner and one of the instructors, is amazing!  She loves what she does and it shows.\nShe and all the instructors keep the class going, with encouragement,  support and just a smidge of tough love nessisary to push you and help you keep your goals. \nEvery class starts with a warm up, and it really is the worst part. Great and challenging conditioning work.\nThen its stretches followed by 6 sets of punch\/kick combos on the bags.\nNext is parter work with punches, usually followed by a bit more conditioning to finish!\nThese classes are fun, and the hour goes by sooo quickly considering what a great workout you're getting in.\nSuch a nice and friendly atmosphere! I love the other members and the whole staff.  There is a real sense of community and it makes you feel accountable to come back and have your butt kicked again.
