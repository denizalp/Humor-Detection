This is an excellent place for happy hour. The house margarita is a pre made mix. You can upgrade from a small to a large for an extra $1 but they don't physically pour tequila in it as it's already premade (which is disappointing ). The pomegranate margarita was delicious. There was the Coronarita one which was also good and you could taste the liquor. The guac was good and the chips are hot. They serve complimentary chips and salsa. The guy bartender with the beard was excellent. He was always attentive and on top of our drinks.
