I have nothing but fantastic things to say about this place (and that's coming from someone who is two dogs away from being the 'crazy dog lady' - i.e., I have pretty high vet standards).  Dr. Francis explained exactly what he was doing at every step of the check-ups and vaccinations because he wants pet owners to be as informed about their pets as they would expect to be about their own medical decisions - and, in addition, he was fantastic at handling both my dog and cat. It is a small business and, consequently, the building is pretty small and cozy.  It'd not decked out in fancy decorations, but the prices aren't outrageous either, so I'm all about the utilitarian approach (it was ~$75 total for the yearly check-up and all vaccinations for a cat and a 50 pound dog).
