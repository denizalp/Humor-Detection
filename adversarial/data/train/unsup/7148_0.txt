This place is really awesome. \n\nI came here yesterday in a group of 3, looking for some pakistani noms.\n\nWe decided to come here, because we all agreed it was some of the best.\n\nNote: The interior may be tacky, and the seating may be shitty, but who cares.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n1. The Lamb Chops - OMG SUPERB. DELICIOUS. SOOO MEATY. SOOO BEAUTIFUL.\n\n2. The Tandoori Chicken - Really really well done. You could tell the meat had been marinating for days. \n\n3. The Butter Chicken - So thick, and juicy. While I was trying to wrap my naan around the piece, it slipped out of my hand and onto the floor. I almost cried.\n\n4. The Palak Paneer - A white person favourite. I loved it. It was good. Not a lot of spice though.\n\n5. The Naan - so fresh, hot and buttery. Mmmm. We had to double our order half way through.\n\n\nFinal Verdict: A M A Z I N G.
