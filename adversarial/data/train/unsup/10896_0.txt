[Sigh]\n\nI had to share my meal. \n\nI'm an idiot. \n(But if you know me you already knew that. But seriously -  Never give up the FORK POWER!)\n\nLuncha Libra was at the Scottsdale Food Truck Caravan. I'm going to keep an ear to the ground to see where these kids are around town. GOOD STUFF!\n\nAll Thai'D Up\" (Ha!)\nConsisted of citrus marinated chicken, serranos, onions (no one needs to kiss me, food is involved! carry on), jack cheese and sweet thai chile sauce. When there's a feeding frenzy going on it isn't pretty. (Hey, the FOOD WAS GOOD!)\n\nWhen asked if \"regular\" was ok we nodded. \"Eh?\" Turns out that \"spicy\" really would have been a kick in the pants. And this is from the kid who grew up sucking on Taco Bell extra hot packets. And the adult who has an established relationship with Sriracha.\n\n(Listen, I have a very myopic view on life: Food\/booze, the gym, fashion and beauty products. Women understand. Spice goes well with food. These guys totally have the hot market cornered!)\n\nBiting into the Quesadilla was a delightful mix of textures and flavors. The tortilla was thicker than I expected and had a slight crunch to the outside. (None of the expected goopy mushiness that can happen with so many other quesadillas.) The chicken had been grilled and I can't do justice to describe how wonderful the taste was. Which really just means YOU SHOULD EAT THIS. \n\nYeah, pretty much. I'm sitting here trying to articulate how great my eating experience was. Words fail right now. I should have whipped out my Yelp pen. But NO. I was too busy STUFFING MY FACE. Yeah. That.\n\nOh! Drinks are really good. They have some fancy sounding drinks (which I can't find on their menu) that come in a mason jar. The Guava something - Hoh My. YUM!\n\nHigh Five for This Food Truck!
