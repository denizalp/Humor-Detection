This lady is really starting to love Thai food!  I am certainly not the expert on what is authentic and what is not.  What I do know is I enjoyed their dishes very much.  \n\nLocated on the NW corner of Stephanie & Paseo Verde, it was easy to pop in for a To-go order.  I was able to try the Pineapple Fried Rice & the Pad Se Ew with beef.  The fried rice was such a large portion.  It's made with curry seasoning which I love.  It's combined with shrimp, chicken, onion, tomatoes, cashews and pineapple.  I wish I knew they topped it with cilantro.  Luckily it was easy to pick off.  Next time I will ask to leave that off.  \n\nThe Pad Se -Ew with beef was delicious!  The dish consists of flat rice noodles with egg and broccoli in a soy sauce. When initially ordering, the lady asked what spice level I wanted.  I told her 7 but she looked at me like I was crazy.  She thought putting the spice on the side so we could add what we wanted was a better option.  Now this has happened at other Thai restaurants so you'd think I would be used to it.  I certainly spiced it up at home with the small container they included. Nonetheless, I would order this dish again!\n\nThere were a few little snafus but that won't stop me from coming back.
