This spot is so great. I thought the wynn buffet was the best. But know this place have so many options, and so many seafood dishes. I love the clams, the crab, and every single vegetable dish that they have. It is so delicious words can hardly describe how yummy it tastes. At the Wynn buffet they are basically eight dollars more and granted it's a good buffet but its something about this buffet here that is better. I am a foodie all the way but I know when a place has superior flavors and superior food. This place fits the bill.
