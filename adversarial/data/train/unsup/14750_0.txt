Like the US customs here way better than the US customs in US... people are so much friendlier here! :D\n\nAnd yes, US customs in Calgary- so when you land in US you walk out of the door as if you arrived from domestic flight. We like this way better than having to wait for security check in when departing and then the customs line at the arrival destination . All done in one-go and the family doesn't have to wait indefinitely for you to walk out of that arrivals door.\n\nAnd you don't have to remove your shoes in the Nexus line.. Yay!
