Stop 2 on the Natey\/Gory espresso run West-End edition was Cherry Bomb coffee.  \n\nI made the wonderful decision to wear my Chuck Taylor shoes on a frigid day. The walk to this place nearly kills me. I want to hit that smug (lucky) bastard Nathan because he's sporting proper boots like a normal person but I resist the urge. I just keep moving. \n\nThis place was too cutesy for me on the outside and the inside didn't change my opinion of it, either.  It's \"Pushing Daisies\" does espresso shop. It is crazy busy and there is no idling room. Needless to say, expectations are low. \n\nDouble espressos are ordered. The shots arrive looking darker with a bit of crema on top. Not like the mahogany tone of Blondie's.  This coffee rules. Not what I expected at all. The shot is flavourful and consistently full bodied. Sweet cinnamon \/ nutmeg tones are detected. It retains the flavah without tasting like the mudwater it kinda looks like. It's the most \"Italian\" of the shots we'll try that day. \n\nService feels a little rushed but when they pump out a quality product like this, who can complain? I leave fully satisfied and vowing I will never be such a superficial jerk again.  But that passes.
