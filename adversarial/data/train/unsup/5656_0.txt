Let's see, $3.50 Absolut ($5.50 Grey Goose)....SOLD!!!! \n\nThis is a little gem of a dive bar where you can get your drink on HELLA cheap! I think the most expensive drink is the top shelf tequila for $6. The crowd is a mismash of old timers and interesting locals.\n\nI had a great time with some of my fellow yelpers as we were nearly intimidated into playing pool while another patron decided he wanted to kick my ass. The jury is still out on why, but it was fun speculating. \n\nOne of my favorite drinking scenarios is when I enter a bar with $20 and leave wasted with some change left. The Rite Inn delivered!
