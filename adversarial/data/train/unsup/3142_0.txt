I am getting old. The Jesus Year of age 33 has been transformative and life changing as was expected. The creeping shadow of death follows each step and haunts thoughts. This path has been the only way. The Wu Wei. As was said in Shogun Assassin \"Oh Mad One. We see your trap. You can never escape your fate.\" The Mad One is the Demiurge of Gnosticism. I see the traps now and am aware. One trap I fall into is alcohol. Alcohol provides an altered state. Boba Tea carries roughly the same caloric load without the feeling of floating in space and transcendence. I enjoyed the white gourd bubble tea the most. The standard tea and milk flavor is satisfying. I believe the hype surrounding this bizarre drink of balls. I will limit my intake because of caloric count and the warning from Germany stating the tapioca balls may contain cancer causing agents. The sushi is decent for fast food style rolls. They are heavy. Kenko is a great addition to Uptown development in University Circle.
