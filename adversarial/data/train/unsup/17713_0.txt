Honestly and hands down the best vape shop in Las Vegas.  I live in Centennial Hills and there are many vape shops around me, all within a 5 or 10 minute drive from me, but making the trip to Vapeco is definitely worth the drive.  \nThe staff is among the friendliest and most knowledgeable that I have encountered.  I've been to other shops where the staff doesn't acknowledge you, do not expect that here.  They will make you feel really welcome here and you will definitely want to be back.\nThey have one of the widest and most unique shops that I have seen.  There are no cheap house-made brands here, they sell QUALITY juices.  Over 200 flavors from different vendors... even some hard to find ones!  I got a bottle of Five Pawns Castle Long Reserve and all I can say is wow!  Made only once a year from a blend of vanillas and bourbons, it is worth it!  If that is your kind of flavor, tell them you heard it from me on Yelp.\nThe loyalty program is probably one of the better ones that I have encountered.  Every 5 visits earns you a 20% discount on almost everything that you could want, I think the only exception is the high-end mods.
