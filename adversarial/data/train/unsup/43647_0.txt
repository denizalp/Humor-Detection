Not a good experience. Felt rushed the entire time for a mani\/pedi that was booked a few days before. Pretty sure they were overbooked, so they rushed us through our appointments. Cuticles were very poorly trimmed, nail polish is chipping a day later & the lady injured my toe with the foot grater. She put a bit of cotton ball on the side of my toe but failed to tell me that she cut me. Went home and soaked my foot in hydrogen peroxide. Will not being going back. Would not recommend.
