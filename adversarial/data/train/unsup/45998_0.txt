Seanachie's has been a convenient place for our single's group to meet.\n\nThe food has never been that good but acceptable for a pub.\n\nWell tonight, with new management rules, they will no longer keep individual tabs or reserve a table for our singles group.  \n\nA singles group works best when individuals can come and go in the group as desired, each paying their own tab when they leave.  Some will be there for only one drink.  Some will have several drinks and some will eat.  Without prices lists for drinks both before and after happy hour, it puts undue pressure on those wanting to leave early or those coming or  staying late.  A single bill for the group just doesn't work for that kind of group.\n\nFortunately Seachie's only advantage is it's central location for singles in all parts of the city.   It's food and prices will not be missed by the group.
