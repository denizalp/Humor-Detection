After several visits giving a new place the benefit of the doubt, my friend and I had our last visit to Marty's today.  Let me first say that the food is limited but tasty. After that, nothing is consistently good...even for regulars. Coffee takes forever once seated and never refilled. If you ask, you are charged...and sometimes served in a paper cup when they run out of serving cups. That's happened three times...even when I've seen clean cups at the coffee bar. The wait staff are unorganized and walk around a lot in circles and then stand and talk while prepared food sits and gets cold. We had cold food served to us twice. The wrong food was served today along with the paper coffee cups...again...with no apology, as if it's acceptable in a high-priced wannabe. When the wrong food was served, my friend finally complained and sent it back. His complaint was followed by a visit to the table by the \"owner.\" All she could muster up for service recovery was, \"Thanks for the input.\"  Are you kidding me? No apology...no attempt to comp coffees...even in paper cups.  What a joke. I don't know how an entrepreneur dependent on return business can afford to be so nonchalant. Good luck to you and Marty's whoever you are since you also failed to identify yourself.  I hate to see another strip district casualty, but this place is doomed.
