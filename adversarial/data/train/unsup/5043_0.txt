I've been to a handful of bars where there is no menu. It's always annoyed me slightly, there was just something pretentious happening. Not here. Here the no menu thing works, is not gimmicky and results in genuine conversations about tastes, life and a perfectly rafted cocktail. Lovely candlelit bar, hold the judgement. Clink clink!
