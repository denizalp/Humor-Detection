We dined at the DOCG Enoteca back to back over 2 days. It was for lunch on both occasions. It was a party of two the first day and a party of 12 on the second day. The food and service on both occasions was great. I had the delicious Strozzapreti Pasta for lunch. This dish was absolutely delicious with generous portions of seafood and pasta. The creamy texture on a tomato base clicked with the spices infused into the fish. We ordered the Prosciutto Pizza as well which had a heavy garlic base and therefore complemented the pasta dish.\nThis location is inside the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas and has a great ambiance. Service was great as well. Servers were informative and helped pick out the dishes to go with my tastes.\nI will recommend others to patronize this restaurant and I will do so again when another opportunity permits.
