It's Queen Street West and there are no shortage of places to enjoy a nice cocktail. That being said, I will be sure to skip this one next time and encourage as many people to Rush on past Rush Lame and head to the next spot. As a an ex-bartender and lover of libations, i feel as though my opinion of the rude and pompous douche of a bartender is well warranted. A few friends and I crossed the city after a game with hopes of enjoying a few no-cheap yet well-made cocktails at this spot, however, what we got more of were rules and insults and just plain shitty service. I probably should have known better right from the get go as there was a completely unnecessary doorman clad with a clicker (nightclub?) that asked my friends to remove their hats and toques before entering the half filled room of boring adults. It's the dead of winter in Ontario and we are being asked to remove our hats! And for no obvious reason other than perhaps the bearded \"king\" behind the bar. I'd be lying if I said that these guys didn't make a good cocktail but not sure why it has to be served with so much attitude? I don't remember any of them being free if that even be some acceptable form of exchange. I think my breaking point, however, was when the said cocktail master decided to rudely interrupt my friend and I to tell him he was spilling drink \"all over the place\". Should this have been in a polite manner, we would have been far more appreciative. \n\nIn reading some of the other reviews for this place, I realize what a contrast mine is in comparison. Nonetheless, I don't think I will be returning to this place and would sooner forfeit the sophistication of an innovative cocktail for service that is genuine and reliable.
