I've tried a number of escape games around toronto. Hands down - this is the best place I\"ve been to yet. realistic environments, challenging puzzles, all around fun. I've succeeded in all of the games except Counter Ops ( 2% success rate) and Diamond Thief. \n\nTheir best game is the Noriko. The puzzles will blow your mind!!
