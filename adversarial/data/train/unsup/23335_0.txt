The fam decided to try SoBo again. Kind of a Deja Vu experience. We sat in the same booth, got the same server, Kat, and had an eerily similar experience. The difference this time was the place was empty. Thursday night, almost 9. Hmmm. The last time we were here it was a Monday & football was on all the TV's. Not tonight. Regardless.\nKat was great again. She brought our waters, took our order and had a short pleasant conversation with us.\nSince we loved the Mac & Cheese with Bacon ($11) last time we started with it again. It was really very good again.\nC got the Kids Sliders with Fries ($5). This is a great deal. C said the 2 beef sliders were a bit over cooked but good just the same.\nK got the Ruben ($10) again. And like before said it was awesome. One of the best she's had. Meat was perfect. The bread seemed fresh.\nI got the Shortrib Sliders ($12). Sorry to say the kitchen missed on mine again. The Shortrib was dry. Way overcooked. Like a roast left in the slow cooker for 15 hours. The onion straws were very similar in texture to French's French Fried Onions. The Pineapple Green Chile was barely noticeable as was the Marmalade and the Au Jus was fairly salty. I left the horsey sauce off. The rolls were fine but nothing great. Such promise without delivery.\nGreat service, great Ruben, otherwise inconsistent food quality, fair prices. 3.5 Stars
