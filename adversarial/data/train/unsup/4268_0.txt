Gen gave me really nice experience!! I came here yesterday with 8 other friends. What surprised me the most was that we were a large group, but our server YUHAO aka HOWARD served us really well. He gave us lots of recommendations and was always there when we need him. And also when Yuhao went on break, Terry helped us a lot. He is nice, too. The food was good. My favorite was spicy octopus. I literally ate more than 5 dishes of them!! And more importantly, with such nice environment, service, and high quality foods, it was only $20 a person and $15 for lunch!! I have been to so many KBBQ AYCE restaurants in Chinatown, they can't even offer a price like this!! I will definitely recommend everyone to come here and try. You will know why I like here so much.
