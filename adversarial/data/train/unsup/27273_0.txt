If you don't sit through my whole review, here is The short version: Book with them immediately. You won't be disappointed. They go above and beyond, are professional and so fun to work with. \n\nI Hired as a referral from a friend for newborn photos. Maria went out of her way to come by my house before the shoot to check out lighting and the situation so that we wouldn't waste time the day of. How personal is that?! She is so cool and laid back and makes you feel so comfortable-- like you've known her for months.\n\nThe day of the shoot she came so prepared. Helped me out (I have a toddler and a newborn) and was totally flexible if I had to stop and feed. I love that she brought her computer so I could sneak peek the photos as we went so I could make sure I was liking them. So convenient and smart. She brings all her gear and even a few props but mostly we just wanted photos of us. She is MAGIC when it comes to Angles and lighting. I swear I look 20 lbs less and my face looked flawless lol! \n\nShe got me my photos back within a week and they were so easy to view download and print. I am so thrilled with the final product!\n\nI can't say enough good things about Elizabeth Douglas and I can't wait for her to photograph future family memories of us! I would definitely recommend her to anyone and everyone and sing her good praises!
