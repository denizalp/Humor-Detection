As a bartender and a beer enthusiast certified in the Cicerone program, I can not recommend this place to friends. 2nd time visiting and they have messed up my tab each time. The beer selection isn't terrible for their bottles and cans but leaves something to be desired in their drafts. They have a lot of local beers, but there are a lot of local beers that aren't good, which clutters their tap lines. The environment is decent but the employees clearly don't know much about beer. The food is decent but also overpriced. I would consider it more of a wine bar that serves beer than an actual beer hall as they advertise
