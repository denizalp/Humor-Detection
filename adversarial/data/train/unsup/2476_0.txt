It's a bar that spans a few floors with a giant Chandelier that runs down the middle. That's pretty much what this place is. \n\nDrinks are overpriced like any Vegas bar, but if you want to look cool and pretend that you're rich then come here and drink. It really didn't win me over, but I don't regret trying it out. Still, it's not a real experience you need to try more than once. \n\nPlenty of better bars in Vegas.
