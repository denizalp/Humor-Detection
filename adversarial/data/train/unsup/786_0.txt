It's hard to screw up spaghetti and meatballs, so they do ok here. But I always get the sensation that if it were a little easier to make an unsatisfactory pasta dish (I'm not too picky with the basics), they might do it here. \n\nI've eaten here many, many times and have never walked away disappointed or let down, but I think the trick is that this is one of the first Italian restaurants I ever went to. I can't even tell you how many birthday parties in the trolley I attended and came home with spumoni caked on the front of my Hypercolor t-shirt. \n\nNow, having been to a few more restaurants of all varieties, I can unquestionably say that food here is not bad nor good, but it's great if you're a six year old who doesn't know the difference. \n\nPost Script\/N.B.* My girlfriend has informed me that if you call ahead for a kids' pasta meal, you can get a healthy portion of pasta, side salad, loaf of bread, and a carton of milk for $4. Be advised, they may look at you funny when you pick up your meal, unless you are indeed a child rather than a starving college student, in which case you shouldn't have a problem.
