I had been craving a banana split, and after doing a Yelp search for the area I was in, I learned that Dutch Dreams was only a 20 minute walk away! When we got there, there were about 6 people ahead of me, and I found it difficult to read the menu, and look at the ice cream options. It really is crowded, and all their trinkets get in the way of seeing the menu! Once it was my turn, I asked for a banana split, and provided the person serving me with my three ice cream options. I was surprised when he disappeared and I did not see him again until after he had put together the banana split. I thought you would be asked what toppings you wanted on it?! Lucky for them, I wanted it all, so when I saw that my banana split had pretty much everything that could possibly go on a banana split (fruit, whipped cream, cotton candy, chocolate...) I was happy. \n\nThe total with tax was just under $10. Pretty pricey, but not bad considering the quality of the ice cream and the toppings you get on it. I would definitely come back! Though I wish their menu was more prominent!
