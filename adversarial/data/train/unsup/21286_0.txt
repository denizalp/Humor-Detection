The Brunch is what I am reviewing, not the hotel.\n\n1) Old people clamoring and elbowing for the lobster table is scary. \n\n2) The chimney backed up and started spewing smoke. Mothers with babies sat in pearls trying to look unphased as they started asphyxiating. That's the kind of reserved elegance you are supposed to feel in this place. Hogwash. The staff stood around laughing. I ran for the door and had to put a menu wedged in since noone was paying attention.\n\nOtherwise, the brunch was extensive and tasty. Hot buffet of savories, and tables piles with sweets. \n\nWe walked off the calories on the grounds and inside the labyrinthine walls later.
