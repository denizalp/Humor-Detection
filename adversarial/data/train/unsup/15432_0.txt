Crab rangoons were tasty. The red curry has a decent flavor. I ordered it thai hot and it wasn't spicy at all - I actually had to add my own spices. \n\nWhen you order curry to-go, they don't put it in a soup container. Instead, they wrap it in tin foil and put it in a styrofoam tray. It leaked all over inside the bag.\n\nIt's strange, because my boyfriend's tom yum soup WAS in a soup container - so they definitely have them. He said the tom yum was okay, but nothing special.\n\nI would have given them 3\/5, except for the worst offense - there was a ROCK in the lettuce wraps.\n\nAwful.
