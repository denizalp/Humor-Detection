In a word. Overpriced. The food was average, there wasn't that much of it for the very large amount I paid. I feel like Anatolia is only doing well because Joe's in rocky river hasn't opened an East side location yet. I've had better middle eastern food for less money at a ton of other places. I would also recommend Simply Greek over this in a heartbeat. Not as nice of an atmosphere but a much better deal with definite menu overlaps.
