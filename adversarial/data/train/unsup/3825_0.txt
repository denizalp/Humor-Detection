I normally go here during lunch, mainly for the subs. Well today I go an try a salad. Chicken finger salad. Nice looking salad, I say looking is because as I sit here at my desk lookin at this salad because the staff failed to give me silverware or anything to eat with. Wtf .. stick to the subs unless u like see food lol
