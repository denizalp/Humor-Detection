While it's nice to see a much needed facelift for this property, I do sort of miss the old\/cheesy feel of the Imperial Palace.\n\nThat said, it is nice to see this area spruced up.  I personally like the updated\/modern feel of this casino and spent a decent amount of time playing here.  I am glad they kept the dealers that were dressed like impersonators.  It was fun having Michael Jackson deal cards and do a little dance in between hands.  \n\nIt's also good to see they retained the old O'Shea's casino inside this property - the party atmosphere there is good, even if the tables are pretty rough to play at.  \n\nI didn't stay in this property so I can't speak to the rooms, but I can attest to the weird smell that everyone seems to be referring to.  There is a strange smell that seems to waft around the entire building.  I really can't put my finger on it, but it smells something like bad cologne or cleaning fluids.  It's weird and I'm thinking the rooms had the same odor, I'd be pretty disturbed by it.
