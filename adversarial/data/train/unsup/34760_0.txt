Went in and asked if they accepted walk ins and the guy said yes it'll be a few mins .now i understand if you dont accept walk ins you can just let me know and ill go else where. Waited well over 30 mins.so the guy that told us a few mins finally finishes and goes to the next which im guessing  its an appt.now you could of told me from the fricken beginning that it would be over an hour wait and i wouldnt of wasted my damn time .pretty rude if you ask me! Not worth it watched for those 30-40mins and honestly only one of the people cutting hair looked decent the other 2 were just giving massages
