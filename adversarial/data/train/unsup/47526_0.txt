Stopped in this place yesterday late in the day while walking to the CVS, because it was cold.  Wanted a cup of coffee.  Woman at the bar was eating stuffed hot pepper and we started talking about how good it looked, so I ordered some apps to take home and they were fantastic.  It wasn't just the food, but the bartender introduced herself formally (who does that?), the owner couldn't have been more hospitable and the few customers that were there while I was were really please with their treatment and the food.  Plus, the place feels homey, like the original location in Chagrin Falls.  I have a business meeting which I've scheduled there for this Saturday and hoping to have the same experience.
