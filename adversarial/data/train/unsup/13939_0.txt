Spearmint Rhino, sadly, does not have any sort of deal for locals. Cover cost includes a ticket for one drink. Upon arrival and post-payment and purse search, you are led to one of the many tiny tables. So they seat you, no choice in where you sit. There's very little pole dancing. Mostly just girls walking around wanting to give lap dances - $20 per a song. Hint: They won't always just stop after the song ends - they'll keep going and charge you another $20 and another $20... Drinks are, of course, weak and overpriced. Beer offerings are crap. The biggest downside here is how dark it is inside. So dark you can't even see the girls. Or the people you're with. Way too dark. Much too dark. What are they trying to hide? It has a corporate feel, but less so than say Sapphire. If you're into diversity (a.k.a. not all blondes or Asians), come during the earlier hours. Not exactly a fun strip club.
