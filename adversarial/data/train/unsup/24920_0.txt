XS is the best club in vegas...the lines moved SO FAST which is one of the reasons it gets 5 stars...the club is HUGE and you can also go outside and there are pools with little chairs in the pools...you can also play blackjack and its just a huge club, don't remember the music, but i just loved the layout, vibe, and definitely a positive and fun experience!
