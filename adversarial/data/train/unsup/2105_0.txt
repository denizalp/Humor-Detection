This Einstein is not smart. The number of mistakes they made on my order, brother's order, and a customers order is stuff a business can only get away with in an airport concession. I ordered a toasted blueberry bagel with salmon shmear. They didn't toast my bagel. My brother ordered a toasted bagel without cream cheese. They did not toast his bagel plus they added a bagel with cream cheese that they charged him for. When I poured my dark roast coffee another customer brought it to their attention that they gave her the wrong bagel. We were about to board a plane for Chicago and didn't sweat over the small stuff.\n\n  Obviously the Terminal B Einstein Brothers Bagels is not sweating over the small stuff such as their bagels. It leaves a poor impression on the business when they are out of sesame and poppy seed bagels at 6 in the morning. But they sweat over the big stuff: making a profit. The bagel with salmon smear and coffee that costs me $5 and a few pennies at a local Einstein Brothers Bagels costed about $6.50 here. \n\n  Two things save this location from my pending \"Mad Check-ins: 1 Star places that Annoy Me\" list. Although the employees need to be trained to comprehend what the customer is ordering and to learn to toast a bagel they made the wrong orders fast and with a smile. And the coffee was strong and favorable on the tadte buds. It is the same setup with all the Einstein Bagels where you serve your own coffee. And that is a good thing because if I was pouring it I know it would not be decaffeinated.  \n\n  What this location has going for it is its location beyond security. Because their isn't much competition beyond the security gate,  especially at 6 a.m.; Einstein Brothers Bagels is in a position to charge more and continue to run a 2 star business. In the future I will try to leave more time so that I could have a 3 star or above breakfast experience anyplace else before a flight.
