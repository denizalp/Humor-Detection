Stick with the original location. Like most expansions the customer service and quality is severely lacking in this location. Its unfortunate because the staff and the location is great, but beware of using uber eats grubhub or delivery when you order from here... \n\nthey cancelled an order or left out an item 3 times! Messaged Robert the General Manager and here is his response \n\n\"I do appologize for this inconvienience but we no longer carry the steak subs at our paradise location. We have recently updated our menu and our deliverie services are still working on updating it on their end.\" \n\nI checked their website and they still have the sandwiches up. I don't understand the need to lie. Don't blame a 3rd party delivery service when you don't even update your website.\n\nStay away from their express locations and stick with the main location.
