I picked this hotel for the good reviews online.  It's a great location near the water with excellent walking\/biking paths.  Price is reasonable and there is a convenient shuttle which Took us to and from downtown with not much of a wait.  The front desk,  on the other hand,  was not friendly, helpful, nor did they seem to care about the guest needs.  We called ahead of time to ensure we would have a refrigerator in our room which we were told we would.  We got there and we informed they were out and had to throw away all our leftovers.  The gentleman did not seem to care at all either.  We were placed on a pretty friendly floor without notice.  While I'm a pet lover i would have liked to be told and guests that may have allergies would probably like to know too. The floor smelled like wet dog and urine and i was kept up late listening to dogs barking,  doors slamming,  and kids running down the halls. The room was nice and bed was comfortable.  Food was good in the morning except it was not complimentary.
