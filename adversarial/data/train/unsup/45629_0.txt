What a great place!  I felt like a bad puppy Mom for being slightly behind (ahem, like a year late), on my dog's annual plus shots, etc.  Preparing myself for the frightening charge, I was ecstatic when the vet tech explained that I could get everything done for half of what I was used to paying at other vets.  Both the tech and the Dr. were warm and friendly, which eased the guilt I felt walking in the door :)\n\nIt's a clean and pleasant place, they are fair and honest, and took great care of my girl. Although I've moved out of Fort Mill, I still plan on taking my puppy down next time she's due for a visit.
