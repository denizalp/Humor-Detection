It's the go-to place for a good lunch\n\nAlthough a bit pricey, it is often worth it, the food is fresh and flavorful and made on the spot rather then brought over from some factory. \n\nNever disappointed by anything i've eaten there - but their Pizzas are the best. Thin and crispy and the ingredients are simple fresh and delicious
