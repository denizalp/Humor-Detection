This place rocks! Solid food, very well defined Flavors and textures. Fantastic wine program accentuated with Trocken Rieslings and beautiful Austrians. \nService is great, big upper hand when compared to Lotus. Items recommended:\nCrab curry\nQuail eggs and dried shrimp\nBeef Jerky\nPad Thai ( I know, maybe boring, but it's the main indicator of quality for me)\n\nDon't be afraid to over order one or two dishes. The price allows to do that. \nMake reservations!
