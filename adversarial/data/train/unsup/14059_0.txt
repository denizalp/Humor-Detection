It's been a year now. I still regret giving this jerk and his unethical liar office manager Jessica my trust. Jessica did my pre-op. I asked her if she is a nurse and she told me she was. Turns out Jessica only went to high school. Smith never had an RN see me post op, a tech. Who gave horrible advice on how to do wet to dry bandages so post op I had a gouge in my breast the size of a quarter. One was a size bigger than the other. But when I went in to have it fixed, which he said he would for free considering all the crap they did Jessica sent me a bill for an additional $8000 to fix the problem and even it out with lipo on the sides as it stops almost at a straight line. I never called again to even discuss it. They're unprofessional, he won't hire proper staff. Apart from his Anesthesiologist who was absolutely amazing. He didn't wash his hands when he came in and when I asked him to before he touched my wounds he gave me a lecture about him using hand sanitizer before he came into the room. I could keep going on but you get the idea. Don't go there, there are other places in town.
