Dr Frankie is the BEST!!!  I CrossFit multiple times a week and Dr Frankie helps to keep my body going.  He is certified in chiropractic sports medicine and he definitely knows what he is doing\/talking about.  Dr Frankie takes the time to listen to you and provide outstanding adjustments,  always followed by ideas\/techniques for at home stretching\/care.  He has helped me though a back injury and multiple other ailments from being an athlete.  I have seen multiple chiropractors over the years and no one compares to Dr Frankie!  I believe in him so much that i drive 20 minutes one way to get my adjustments from him, even thought there is another  LSM chiropractor 1 mile away.
