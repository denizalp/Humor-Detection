The good is you can make your own choices for what you want on the small sized pizza. The ingredients are fresh and tasty. \nThe pizza is wood fired. There are some other limited options to choose from if you do not want pizza. \nMy son created a pizza with bacon, smoked Parmesan and mozzarella cheese that we shared. It amounted to 3 small pieces, which if you thought about it was probably equivalent to one piece of normal sized pizza. \nThey deliver the food to the table you select.\nThe bad, it is super over priced for what you get. I would not recommend it on that fact alone. The price point is way high in their favor. You would think they would have you rather spend the cash on gambling, nope.
