OMG, freshly-cooked and custom-topped donuts made to order while you wait?   What could be better than that?  I tried the bacon and blueberry donuts (the first two of their suggestions).  The bacon donut was dipped in maple glaze then topped with bacon pieces (real ones, not the bottled mystery stuff).  The blueberry one was dipped in blueberry glaze and topped with powdered sugar.  Both were very tasty and surprisingly not too-sweet.  The only thing I wish was a bit different was if the donuts were fried a bit longer.  They have a little crunch to them that most cake donuts have none of.  But it would be nicer (and I think a good complement to the glaze and topping) if the crust was just a bit crunchier.\n\nI can imagine parking being a horror story at times with this place sharing the stalls with Sweet Tomatoes, Five Guys, Rolled Ice Cream, and other businesses.  Probably best to avoid prime meal times when going.
