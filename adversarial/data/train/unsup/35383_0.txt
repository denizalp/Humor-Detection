My definite go to for eye care and their selection of luxury frames are fantastic! I was immediately greeted and introduced to the entire staff. I felt very welcomed. Joanna and Kristen were very helpful and personable. They showed me some of the new easy to use equipment for checking your eyes so no more squirming from anticipating that high psi air being shot into your eyes. Dey got dat new new tech. My eye doctor, Lisa, was great too. She was very gentle and patient with me when checking for my vision. And I mean Very patient, when I can't decide every 5 minutes if 1 or 3 is clearer. ‚Äç Christina showcased me the Frames. She was knowledgeable with the product and gave me great options on upgrades such as light weight lenses, anti glare, etc. She help me choose the right frames to get my eyeglass game on fleek! Other than the staff the store is beautifully designed, clean with modern furniture, and their selection of sunglasses and eyeglasses was opulent. Tom Ford, Dolce, Gucci to say the least.
