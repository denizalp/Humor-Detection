Have you ever been to a fine dining and was asked to leave so that they can accommodate others waiting to be seated?\n\nSix of us went to dinner here. Food was great. Right after dessert, we were ask to give up our table.  In my 30 years of dining, I have never been ask of such question. Maybe we were all minority in a white \"neighborhood\" and we were ask to leave. We were not loud or anything. We were all having pleasant conversations with friends and exchanging family pictures. \n\nI would not come back here again.
