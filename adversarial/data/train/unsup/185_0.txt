Simply the best day spa I've ever experienced. All others will pale in comparison. You have been warned.\n\nI've been going to Qua since 2007 but it just struck me that I have yet to write a review. Time to give Qua its much deserved five stars.\n\nI don't book any treatments here. I just pay the $45 for all day access and enjoy the quintessential gym and spa day. You honestly need nothing else.\n\nThe sides are gender separate, meaning also that nudity is an option. If the sight of a 300 pound woman or 80 year old senior baring it all makes you uncomfortable, then you need more Vegas in your life.\n\nQua has numerous Roman style baths of varying depths and temperatures. The heated stone chaises are ahmaazing; while the waterfall showers are sort of weak and a bit meh. Then there's the ice room, which rains bubbles down every 15 minutes. I like moving between this room and the eucalyptus steam room. So refreshing. And if you want some dimly lit quite time, the lounge area is fairly comfortable with an ample stock of various teas and fresh fruit.\n\nGetting all primped up afterward is easy too. They have everything. Including products you didn't even think you needed until you tried them; from luster sprays to volumizing foam and dry finishers. Lots of room to spread your make up and supplies around. Great lighting. Everyone walks out of here looking fresher faced and more relaxed. \n\nThere isn't much more to say that hasn't been said by all these 5-star reviews. Vegas is hard enough on your body, so reward it once in a while by taking some time out at Qua. Once you do, it'll be so hard for you to go without. Who knew peace, quiet, and serenity could be so indulgent.
