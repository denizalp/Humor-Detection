Things started off great!\n\n but a general lack of attention to our table, poorly timed food (side dishes arriving before the entrees) and a virtually non existent server by the end of the meal left a pretty bad taste in our mouths. the food was pretty good! Im just not sure what went wrong, my suggestion is to stay away on a busy night.
