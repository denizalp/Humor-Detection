My husband and I bought a new car at Right Toyota last month. We cannot say enough wonderful things about our salesman, Jonathan Kang. He was knowledgeable, friendly, patient, and never pushy. He made the whole experience enjoyable, and I never thought that would be possible. He helped guide us through to select the best vehicle for us, without focus on what would be the best sale for him.  Thank you, Jonathan!  We love our car!
