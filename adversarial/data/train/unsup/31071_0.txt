I love the this Starbucks is Inside the hotel (Westin). It has a huge seating area. You can sit there, enjoy your cup of Coffee and people watch. I always order the skinny vanilla latte. This one was ok, the vanilla flavor was missing. Maybe they forgot to add the syrup, but I didn't feel like getting up to say anything. I much rather enjoyed my time alone while everyone else in my party slept and drank my coffee.
