Cold Stone is really worth it only if you'll be entertained by watching them put the creations together.  Their ice cream is okay, but  too rich for my taste -- I swear you can smell the extra milkfat from the sidewalk.  (This may be a perk for some, but I find it overwhelming.)  The \"creations\" are nice (my favorite is Peanut Butter Cup Perfection), but the ingredients aren't anything special.  I stop by occasionally because it's fun to watch them make it, but Dave and Andy's is orders of magnitude better, and Razzy Fresh is just around the corner and much healthier if I don't want to leave Squill.
