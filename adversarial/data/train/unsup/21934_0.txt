I've been coming here for years with my parents. It's one of the few places that there's no fighting about and we all agree upon. \n\nToday the 4 of us came with a coupon voucher, $19 for $40 worth of food. It was an excellent deal with no expiry date and we could use two of them. \n\nGot the Sashimi Boat ($25) with about 20 pieces. Fresh fish, and size was not skimped. It comes with miso soup and salad. \n\nThe Soft Shelled Crab was tasty but tasted a little fishy ($8.99)\n\nTried the grilled eggplant miso, it was good but wouldn't recommend - something you can make at home. Cooked eggplant with miso paste on it, essentially. \n\nGot the grilled Mackeral (Saba) for $8.99 and it grilled and chewy a little. \n\nThe best was the Nabasakei Udon ($10.99) with a good clean tasting broth and a half cooked egg floating in the middle. \n\nThe parents also ordered a chicken teriyaki. \n\nFor dessert we opted across the street to the Mad Italian Gelato Bar\n\nThe damage was $110 tonight for 4 people, and with the coupon an excellent deal.
