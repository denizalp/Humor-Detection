Alright, the reviews do not lie.\n\nI've been to Vegas several times, and like a tourist always have to get those stupid cups with the frozen concoction while walking around.\n\nI've been to several places, several cups, plenty of different drinks, but never went to Fat Tuesdays.. until now.\n\nBelieve the hype, if you want to get your tourist on, go here. \n\nYou definitely want to start of your Vegas trip right? Get that 190 Octane and an extra shot for only $1 more. I mean how are you going to pass up another shot for only ONE MORE DOLLAR?! Unless your a pussy--cat?\n\nAlso keep your cup, just get a refill and you save $2. \n\nI also tried the Mudslide flavor. It's more of a dessert flavor, you definitely need that extra shot in that flavor.\n\nDon't settle for anything else, you can't be walking around being tourist unless you have a Fat Tuesday cup.
