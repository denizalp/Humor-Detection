Went to a Suns game with a friend and had a blast.  The fans were all cheering for the home team and they delivered a win!  I'm not a fan of the team, but love NBA basketball, so there was no way I was going to miss the game.  The crowd was a lot of fun and didn't give opposing fans too much grief in the stands, unlike other cities.  Steve Nash is an incredible player and puts in a lot of effort pre-game to get ready to play....it's no wonder he's one of the best point guards to play the game.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/SfkPbEnDtc1EVTjuS0DDUw?select=qnf3nH3qfObznA_Koxhb0Q\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/SfkPbEnDtc1EVTjuS0DDUw?select=meT5rGbElmR9amJM8oEwKQ\n\nOverall, it was good times.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%
