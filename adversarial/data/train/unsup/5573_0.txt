Have yet to spend the night here.  Have visited the resort a few times though.  \n\nFavorite spot is Secret Pizza.  Love ordering pizza from here.  Then taking over to the chairs near the billiard tables.  Great place to eat the yummy pizza, and nice place to people watch.\n\nWhen walking along the Las Vegas Strip, make certain to stop into the Cosmopolitan!
