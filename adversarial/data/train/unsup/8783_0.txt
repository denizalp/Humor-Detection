A great Irish pub located in the heart of the downtown core, Irish Embassy does a great job at getting away from your typical pub food. \n\nHere on the menu you can find specials like: fried chicken and waffles, beer can chicken, fish and chips, and corned beef sandwich.\n\nTry the corned beef sandwich!\n\nThey have a vast selection of beers on tap, pour an okay pint of Guiness and are a great place to catch a Canadiens game, or just grab some drinks and dinner before the game. \n\nOn Canadiens game nights, you will find the Team 990 crew doing a live pre and post game feed. And as hard as it may believe because of the size and amount of seats - it does does get filled up fairly quickly on game nights.
