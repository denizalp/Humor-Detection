It's a tad hard to describe the food here since I don't really understand the language but my friend tried this place, loved it, and took us here. We started with the wrapping your own rice paper rolls with beef cooked in a hot broth, then with sausages. The giant beefball with shrimp chips was probably my favourite. There was also Pho, and beef congee, and stiry-fried dice beef. Was that 7 dishes of beef yet? \n\nThe food was great though and I wish I was more hungry and didnt have so much beef on the days before hand. Service was okay, and the place was extremely quiet. I would have thought this place would attract more customers.
