A lot of the Yelp reviews seemed to center around poor or slow service, so I sat at the bar to up my chances of getting good service.  I had a very friendly waitress who let me try 2 of their beers, since the number of choices is a little overwhelming.  The menu is pretty small and all burgers (no wraps, no salads, no appetizers), but it also works in your favor because the food arrives quickly.  I got the All-American burger with pepper jack cheese & fries.  The food is competently prepared, but nothing to get excited about.  However, if you are looking for some beer & a decent meal for less than $10, this might be your place.
