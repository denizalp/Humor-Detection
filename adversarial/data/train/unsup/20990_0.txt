I am NOT HAPPY. (If you order from here, please call to confirm your order, because they lost my pick up order... but MY time did not seem to matter to this restaurant's managers.)\nOLIVE GARDEN SHOULD TREAT ALL ORDERS THE SAME!!! I felt extremely disrespected by the managers!!! The other staff were kind and apologetic... Thank you.\nI was actually picking up a To-Go order and had to wait OVER 30 minutes. The order was placed at 6:17pm and I finally left the restaurant at 6:50pm.\nSince I was picking the order up for someone else, I guess it's OK to just tell me to cancel the order... that way another driver will come get it. But wait.. one staff member told me to cancel while the other told me 5 minutes... not good business practice. \nIt is NOT OK, I didn't cancel the order, I waited because I had already wasted my time... I was not treated with kindness. They seemed upset that I did not cancel the order?!?!\nI know if the food were for me, something would have been done to adjust for this mistake, but because I am just delivering, I guess my time is less valuable.\nI wonder if anyone there realized that, until now, I USED TO BE a loyal customer... GUESS NOT.
