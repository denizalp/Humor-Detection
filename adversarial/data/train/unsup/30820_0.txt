OMG!!! Probably the BEST BBQ I've had since we've left home. We had the beef brisket which was insanely delicious. Someone else commented on Yelp it's like meat cream. They weren't kidding. We also had the pulled pork. Very very tender. This was \"make us happy BBQ\". This place is open til 4pm or when ever they sell out. It's just a hole in the wall building with picnic tables inside and outside. Reminded me of West Texas BBQ back home. We will be returning here for sure.
