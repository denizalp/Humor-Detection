This place is a mess: What a joke. The owner (the creepy guy with he fake teeth in an all white suit - looks like Ted Knight in Caddyshack) was a complete a-hole. Our waitress was rude, the hostess was rude. Drinks were bad. We called ahead to reserve a table outside for happy hour on the patio at a table to which they said you don't need one it's first come first serve. We get there and it's only at the bar and communal table so we have to sit inside at 4:30 when the entire patio is empty. We have eaten out there for HH before. Maybe this place is fun if you're senile but the cute fountain outside isn't worth the crappy attitudes and bad drinks. Apparently the food is terrible too but I didn't wait around to find out. Don't waste your money or your time.
