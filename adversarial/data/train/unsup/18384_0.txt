Let me set the scene for you.... \n\nHere it is pouring out. You walk in drenched. You sit at one of those old school checkered booths. Depressing indie music is playing in the background. Regulars are greeted by the bartender and served up their usual drink. I felt like I was in an indie movie! \n\nSo in real time, the place has CHEAP happy hour deals! $2 Yuenglings and $4 mixed concoctions. Yesterday was the Presbyterian. It was a mix of Bourbon, Ginger Ale and Soda Water. Not my cup of tea....but maybe someones...perhaps?? \n\nThe grand jewel of the place is the mac n' cheese. I kept hearing these tales of the most delicious mac n' cheese you will ever feast on. Of course I had to get it! When it came out it looked like the real deal homemade version! Slightly burnt top layer of cheesy goodness. Inside a gooey noodly mixture of cheese, with a strong pepper flavoring. I believe when there was no more noodles to be found, there may have been some bowl licking. For real, that good! \n\nIt was sad but kinda funny because a family of four came in with some small children. They wanted to come because they had heard the \nmac n' cheese was so good. Well, it's considered a straight bar so they weren't allowed in with children under 18. The mom was like, I called earlier, it's the kids birthday! Too bad....they may have had to settle for some easy mac!
