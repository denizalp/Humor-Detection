BEST restaurant in town, especially if you are visiting like my husband and I were from Chicago . We chose this as our only fine dining restaurant for our short trip to celebrate our two year annivesary engagement. I tried making reservations online on opentable.com but when it was full, I called the restaurant and spoke to a nice lady who got me outdoor patio reservations at 8 p.m. on a Thursday night. \n\nI know it's expensive, but compared to Chicago restaurants, the prices here were worth every penny, and my husband and I thought the prices were fair for the ambiance, and great service. Our waitress had too many tables in my opinion, but she gave everyone fair attention. With a large drink list, we couldn't decide what we wanted, but with some help on flavors, my husband and I got cocktails we both enjoyed along with our dinner. \n\nWe split the corn appetizer dish and the steak taco's. They are the best steak taco's I have ever had. They came in 3, all though we could have requested 4, and a generous amount was on each perfectly cooked corn tortillas. The flavor was intense, I absolutely loved it.\n\nThe presentation and taste of our banana dessert was something I don't regret eating regardless of how many calories it had and how full I was. This restaurant seemed so popular, full of people on dates, walk-ins to bar, girls night out, or just group gatherings. I would definately go back and wish the restaurant was located in Chicago.
