Sam's Club!  There are 5 things we get from Sam's Club through the year.  And as you read this some of you will probably say yeah we get that too.  So drum roll please! \n\n1.) Diapers\n\n2.) Toilet Paper\n\n3.) Soda \n\n4.) Dog Food \n\n5.) GAS\n\nOk.  So you are all thinking that you get these main items as well.  Or the rest of you are SC haters and think that Costco is the best.  \n\nNow that the fun is over, we do get more that just these items.  Sam's club is packed full of stuff.  They are one of the few places that still have butchers cutting meat in the back.  they have the best prices on beef.  The also have kids clothes and adult clothes.  We mainly find a lot of cute outfits for my daughters here.  We always buy Coca Cola here because it is the best price.  I know that supermarkets always have sales on soda.  but these are usually on holidays.  I don't know about you but I don't like to wait for the sales.  On top of all the different bulk items you can get form Sam's Club there is the Snack Bar!  I love this place.  pretzels, hotdogs, pizza oh my!  and it's cheap! \nGo get your membership and enjoy all the products Sams has to offer! Cheers!
