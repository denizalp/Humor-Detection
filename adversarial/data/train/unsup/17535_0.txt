I remember first watching this show back in 1994 when was Vegas was kid friendly and Treasure Island had that Pirates of the Caribbean theme. Originally the show was a battle between the British and the Pirates over the island (Treasure Island) and so they would battle back and forth shooting cannons having a mock battle but as always the Pirates of Bucaneer Bay win. In the end of the show, one of the pirates would shout to the audience, \"Come inside to Treasure Island...........       and I forgot the rest of the line....   =\\    But anyways, the old show had a better storyline, great acting and good comedy. \n\nFast forward 18 years and the show has completely changed and now the show has been revamped to make it sexy and sleazy with a horrible story line.  The acting was horrible and the singing was just laughable!
