So normally I'm pretty chill especially in the morning on my day off.   But the line here was long, it moved pretty decent.   So I get to the part to order my coffee.  The picture on the wall for the Carmel macchiato iced looked amazing.  I found my drink.  \n\nThe girl seemed nice but don't let looks deceive you.   I got handed an iced Carmel macchiato with a flat lid.  No whipped cream or Carmel like the picture showed.   Really?   So I went back up and asked her where's the topping?  She said with an attitude \"take the lid off\".  So I obliged and did.  She turned around, washed her hands and put whipped cream on very sloppy and shoved a lid on and put it on the counter very angrily and turned around.  \n\nSo by this time it was about the principle and customer service.  I am huge on customer service.  So I said to her again \"excuse me but where's the Carmel?\"   She was pissed and made sure I saw it.   She grabbed my cup and dumped some Carmel on it and the lid and shoved it back to me and said with a serious attitude \"now you have a nice day!\"   \n\nIt amazes me that they can still be in business with employees treating customers that way!   Don't advertise what your product is to look like and have staff that trys to be cheap and not deliver to advertised expectations.  I'll never return.
