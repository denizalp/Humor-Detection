I almost rated this place two stars but realized part of the problem was me.  I chose to sit as far away as possible from the group of 40 or more 10-12 yo girls occupying a long seating area in the middle of the store.  \nWhere I ended up was initially a quiet spot over by the play\/gaming area that proved to be very noisy as time went on and many families with toddlers moved in around me.\n\nI was feeling cheap and in a rare mood for pizza. While not the worlds greatest pizza I sort of like the thin crispy crust that didn't fold up on me.  In six pieces I managed to try the bacon\/onion, sausage, veggie, pineapple\/ham.  I had a plate of Caesar and one of ranch salad and a bread stick.  The salads were sort of limp.  For $6.78 +tax with a medium drink I got my moneys worth.  For .99 more I could have had a soft serve cone but I was already full.\n\nThe dining area is huge!  I bet it can seat over 200.  Seating for the most part is school cafeteria with a few 4 tops and some pseudo 2 top booths.  As I mentioned there is a play\/gaming area at the back of the store, they definitely cater to families who want a meal out on a budget.
