\"Meh.\"\n\nThis place expanded, right? Same, familiar furniture which is perfectly fine but the floors have already seen better days.\n\nLunch specials are reasonable. We went here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Lunch was alright. Dinner prices will at least double for you. They have a happy hour all day thing going on for now. I ordered some sushi. I wanted to try a couple so I ordered some cheaper ones, like salmon (a classic fave for me) and a california. \n\nThe weirdest tasting sushi ever. I have never seen a more disappointed-looking salmon roll. It is literally just a teeny bit of salmon wrapped around some rice. It is.. the size of the thumb. California rolls are really ubiquitous and so you don't expect much. But this is beyond that. I couldn't taste anything. I clearly see the avocado but nothing came through. Also, if the restaurant is reading this, get rid of the sesame seeds that the rolls are rolled in. It is so overpowering. So.. if you're ordering sushi, get the more fancy\/expensive rolls.\n\nI didn't have much of an appetite so I got something small, pork belly and mushroom skewers. Don't do it. As soon as I saw it, I felt like a total idiot. It's thin cuts of pork that tasted burnt and salty and small, small mushrooms. What is the point of skewering.\n\nBoyfriend ordered an actual entree, beef teriyaki. I wished they didn't cook it so far because it kept on cooking on that sizzling plate and it got a bit tough but was still pretty good. The teriyaki sauce was good but thickened rather quickly. \n\nI know most Asian restaurants charge for extra rice, but being Asian and growing up eating nothing but it, it annoys me to pay extra for a little bowl of rice to accompany even half the size of the dinner. I'll do it, though, but I get even more annoyed (?!) when that tiny, palm sized bowl is only half full.\n\nWaitresses were OK. Not terrible. All three stood around chatting and texting so it felt like you were interrupting social time when you needed something.\n\nI promise, I'm not a terrible, mean person :) \n\nWow, long review but I won't be coming back.
