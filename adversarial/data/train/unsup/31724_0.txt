Bad massage. Poor communication. Rushed massage. Bad employees. \n\nWorst of all: they expect a minimum tip amount. I told them I was paying 20%, and they told me that I needed to pay them more. They expected a minimum of 30%. They argued that they deserved 30%, and they got angrier and angrier when I told them to include a tip of 20% and no more. They kept shouting at me that they wanted more tip. And then they said it was a required tip minimum. REQUIRED?? Are they crazy??! \n\nDisgusting. Don't go to this place. It sucks.
