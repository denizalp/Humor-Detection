PROS: Great lashes, they look so natural, they are smaller in diameter than other salon's I've experienced, and I always get a very full and glamorous look. Natalie is great!\n\nCONS: This place is pricier than others but that's ok when dealing with lashes. HOWEVER, I found this place on yelp, and based on the positive reviews I was interested in trying this place, so I texted Molly to schedule my initial apt. \n\nUsually when a business has a cancellation policy, they inform the new potential client about their policy when scheduling their initial appt. This never happened. I had two fills here, and then on my third I had to cancel the day of the appt. I was still never informed about a cancellation policy at this time either. My fourth or fifth fill the same situation had occurred. I was able to reschedule my fill a week later and still was not informed upon scheduling that I would be subject to a cancellation fee from the week prior. \n\nAfter receiving my usual fill today, literally at the end of my service, I was told to pay an additional $20 cancellation fee for my last scheduled appt. I have no problems with any cancellation policy, in fact I have a hefty fee myself when cancelled on with out 24 hour notice, however ALL of my clients are informed about my cancellation policy upon scheduling whether they are scheduling online, via email, text, or phone. \n\nWhen I contacted Molly about the surprise fee, her reaction wasn't what I had expected. She assumes all her clients would find out about her policy on their own. I have never been on their website where apparently its displayed, and to assume I would read about their cancellation policy on a sign hung somewhere in a room where my eyes are closed 90% of the time is insane! There was so many times I should have been informed about the policy. Especially when she told me my first cancellation I wasn't charged as a courtesy.\n\nWhen explaining how Yelp lured me in to try them, her response was there isn't enough characters in the description on their end to add the cancellation policy for potential clients to see, SO here it is so this doesn't happen to you too:\n\n* Your FIRST cancellation is free (please note: this is when cancelling with same day notice, I can not vouch for this in the event of a no show) \n\n* After that if you cancel on the day of your appointment you are subject to a $20 cancellation fee at your next visit. \n\n* In the event of a no call no show, you will be subject to a 50% service charge of that scheduled appointment, at your next visit. \n\n* All appointments require a 24hr cancellation notice to avoid a fee.
