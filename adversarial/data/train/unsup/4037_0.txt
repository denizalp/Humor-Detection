Well, the atmosphere is fun. I enjoy the fake foliage, fake animals, fake thunderstorm, and fake nature noises. I didn't care much for the fake friendliness of our server though. You can tell when someone is completely faking it.\n\nAfter a tedious 40 minute wait (make reservations to avoid that) we were seated. Eventually. The hostess was confused and we went for a tour of the restaurant. After winding our way through tables for awhile, she finally stopped and called on her headset for help. A minute later she finally got us to a table. \n\nI ordered a bacon cheeseburger from fake-happy-waiter. The burger was ordered medium but received well done.  It was an average burger despite being dry.\n\nIt wasn't awful but not worth a wait nor the price.
