Experience:  brought a group of friends to watch the show for my birthday. I called and worked with the manager Athenas to get a good group rate and plan the best way to get tickets. \n\nFacility:  It's a make-shift theater set up in the Erotic Heritage Museum. I have been here before when it was the old non-profit place, and I like the new decor. \nThe theater seats we got were fabulous for watching the show, but not that great for comfort. They hard folding chairs, so if you have any issues, bring a cushion.  \n\nService: there were definitely many challenges to trying to schedule the group.  I had many friends frustrated and glad they didn't give up, because the staff made it difficult. I would knock a star down for these issues, but I enjoyed the show so much, and you most likely won't bring a party of 10 people, so no need to show less than stellar review. \n\nShow: fantastic!!!!!  The comedian who opened was hilarious!!!!  Then the guys Rich and Fitchie kept the laughs going!  I loved how comfortable they were on stage in their birthdays suits and manipulating their bodies.  They were amazing and worth every penny. It's not sexual, so all you prudes, stop wincing your face!!!  It's just guys comfortable being naked making silly positions with their body parts, but hilarious at the same time. Go see it!\n\nOverall:  I honesty think I will be back with more friends. It's worth a second see and some people need a little coaching as they somehow are timid to go watch. No reason to be!  It's just good, (not sure I can say clean) fun!!!!  5 star show!
