What else is there to do when it is over 1000 degree outside? Bowling with friends at Bowlero Gilbert. \n\nI haven't gone here to hang out with friends until this place is newly remodeled. I love the new lighting, the music that they play and all the huge projectors hanging around the alley in the evening. Prices are reasonable and staffs are my friendly. I was able to find a bowling balls in one central location. My only complain is the lack of A\/C. We were hanging out right under the ventilation and yet we were still covered in sweat. Other than that, I had a blast hanging out with friends here last night.
