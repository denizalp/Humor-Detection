A local friend suggested we go to Weera Thai. It's been a place she's been wanting to try, but no one in her family ever wanted to go. \n\nLocated off The Strip and I was game to leave my safe sanctuary. It's in a typical Vegas strip mall with the requisite nail salon, vape store, and a Metro PCS. The outside signage looked well worn. \n\nInside the store is clean and bright. The menu is quite extensive, so ordering required a bit more time. \n\nWe settled on the Pork Larb and Shrimp Glass Noodles. Asked what spice level between 1-5, with 5 bringing the heat. Settled on a 2.\n\nBoth dishes were outstanding! Nice clean shrimp not over done and the larb featured fresh veggies. \n\nSatisfied upon leaving, I noticed it's been voted the Best Thai Restaurant for 2018 by Las Vegas Magazine. No wonder!
