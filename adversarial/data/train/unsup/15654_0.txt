I tend to drop my books in the bath, so I'm not a huge proprietor of fancy book stores such as this one. \n\nHaving said that, it doesn't mean I wouldn't one day LIKE to be able to drop an expensive hard cover book in the bath and not think anything of it, much like I would like to have expensive wine jellies on my toast every morning, but that ain't happening any time soon.\n\nThis is a gorgeous store filled with hard-cover books that I imagine fancy British type people have lining their shelves in their homes. In fact, the shop itself reminds me of what an old English library in a contemporary English home might look like. One that I would be refused to touch anything in. Which is sort of the case with this store......everything is so beautiful, you don't want to screw it up.\n\nWell, at least I don't.
