MATT THORPE - Internet Sales Person\n\nWe just bought a car from Matt.\n\nThe first quality you want in a car salesperson is HONESTY. Matt is honest.  An important answer he gave was \"I don't know.\" rather than try to make up something.\n\nAnother top quality is knowledge. We have owned '05 Accord, '10 Odyssey, and '13 CRV. Due to his many (7?) years as a Honda salesperson (about 4-5 years in Indiana before AZ) he knew about improvements as well as features in old Hondas that are no longer available.\n\nTHINKS AHEAD:  We'd expressed interest in a '18 CRV, and he had one (not the color we wanted) ready for us to sit in, under an awning (too keep us cool) and explained many of the features.\n\nOFFERED GOOD OPTIONS without being high pressure.  We got the \"door guards\" and are quite pleased with how they look and will protest us from \"door dings.\"\n\nRESPONSIVE:  In contrast to a sales manager at another Phoenix area Honda dealership, Matt was quick to respond while not being high pressure. We finally gave up on the non-responsive manager and went to Arrowhead Honda. We asked Matt for a White, '18, CRV w\/navigation. Matt kept on top of when the car was due at Arrowhead and let us know when we could pick it up.\n\nTEST DRIVE:  He was very patient and knowledgeable about 2018 CRV features and could explain them in succinct ways.\n\nHELPFUL:  Matt synced our I-phones to our new '18 CRV as well as actually showed us additional features that we didn't have time to cover in our test drive.\n\nand YES I'd EVEN BUY A USED CAR FROM MATT! :)
