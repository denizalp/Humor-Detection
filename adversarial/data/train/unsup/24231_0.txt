After switching CrossFits due to a move, I was anxious about finding a box I could call home.  Gayle and the rest of the staff (Emily, Jeremy, Lance, Etc.) at Full Strengh have been a godsend.  Not only are they passionate about coaching, but they genuinely care about improving the health of others.  I truly believe Gayle's programming is second to none.  It's obvious she doesn't just pick a WOD the day of...she has everything programmed weeks (maybe even months) in advance.  \n\nAlso, this group is tight and enjoys doing activites together outside of the gym (such as eating mexican food, drinking mexican beer, and dancing to mexican music). I understand new boxes can be very intimidating, but we make it a goal to be friendly and say hi to all new members\/drop-ins.\n\nPS.  This is one of the most unique boxes I have ever been to as it overlooks an ice skating rink (which has the best divebar attached).  How cool is that?
