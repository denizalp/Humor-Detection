I've gone here for lunch a few times and it's failed every time.  It's set up to be a cool lunch spot - nice decor, right on capitol square, large open seating.  But the food and service are not good.  Overpriced and bland.  I recently got a entree Cobb salad which is the size of a side salad and not good, plus it was $15... I also ordered gazpacho - a tiny cup for $5.  Flavor was way too much tomato and onion - and the tomato flavor was bland - like Roma tomatoes.  No essence of other flavors that should be in gazpacho.  Tasted like cold red spaghetti sauce from a can.. Similar experiences prior visits.  I guess I should learn my lesson.  Obviously other people know that lunch is and because the place was completely dead the entire time I was there from noon-1pm on a weekday.\n\nTwo stars because I've been for dinner with a group of people and it was decent.  Small plates to share.\n\nAlso no spicy.  Hard pass.
