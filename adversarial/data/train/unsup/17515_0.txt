Going to Medieval Times is very nostalgic for me.  I went once when I was in elementary school, during undergrad, and insisted to go for my birthday.\n\nIf you are looking to go, they are many different discounts available.  All are listed on their website, but there are also corporate deals.  \n\nEach visit is very similar to the last.  Each meal consists of:garlic bread, tomato bisque soup, roasted chicken, sweet buttered corn, herb-basted potatoes, pastry of the Castle, coffee and two rounds of select beverages.  Vegetarian options are available upon request.  There's also a full bar outside. \n\nReally the only reason I keep going back is not for the food (which is nothing too spectacular), but for the entertainment.  As cheesy as it may be, I really like how my servers pretend that we were living in the Medieval times, and for the show.  It really gives the experience that we are in the Medieval ages, except that it's more clean and I don't need to dodge people emptying chamber pots.
