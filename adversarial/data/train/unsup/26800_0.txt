In the end I do still enjoy this bar. The atmosphere is usually very friendly, and the staff is friendly as well, and they're food is good. A little sad they started charging cover for the UFC fights, but I can understand their need to cover costs - though I certainly hope the front door personnel are better the next time around.\n\nOh, and I do wish they'd go back to the old happy hour time slots...
