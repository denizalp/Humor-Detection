Brunch is what brunch is- overpriced fruity french toast and eggy things.  We all know this, we all play the game, and it's pretty rare to find a place that excels at it.  Pewter Rose....does not.  That isn't necessarily bad- the food is decent provided you know you're getting something you've had before somewhere else that was also decent but not mind-blowing.\n\nBut the service.  Oy.  There is no reason to wait an hour for food on a Sunday that isn't that busy.  Also, and I cannot stress this strongly enough, DO NOT BRING THE FOOD UNTIL THE CHILDREN'S MEALS ARE ALSO READY!@#@&^%&@*&^!!!  These are not logical beings we're dealing with.  They are hungry, egocentric little monsters who will flip the hell out when everything that isn't theirs shows up and no eggs and toast seem to be forthcoming.  And if I have to get your hostess to find you to tell you that I wasn't kidding when I asked for the check, you're probably taking a bit too long, Sparky.  \n\nI doubt I'd return- there's too varieties of pretty much the same thing in town.  If the food isn't distinctive, you damn sure better set yourself apart on service and experience.
