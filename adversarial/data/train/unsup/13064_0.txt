I have been here 6-7 times (prior to the Yelp event) and have always had super yummy food and great service. I have a couple of favorites:\nChicken and gruyere cheese crepe\nItalian Job crepe\nBanoffe sweet crepe\nRaspberry and goat cheese French toast\nAlso the Nutella milkshake is to die for I tell you.\nIf I could eat here on a daily basis I'm sure I would. Definitely a regular spot for me.
