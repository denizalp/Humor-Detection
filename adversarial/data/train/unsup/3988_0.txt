Second stop on my Toronto trip!\n\nI'm a bit of an Aquarium\/Zoo\/ Fanatic so this stop in our trip was kind of a no-brainer. \nOur visit took about an hour and a half maybe 2 hours tops (we stopped for food at the food court). The Aquarium itself is pretty big! It has two levels but it's easy to navigate. \n\nThey have some truly amazing displays. The tanks are tall and wide and gives you a gorgeous overview of plenty of different sea life roaming about. The Jelly Fish tank is illuminated by changing lights and it's one of the nicest ways I've seen of displaying jellyfish. \n\nTheir overhead tunnel where you can stand on the electric carpet that moves for you is also quite long. You can just stand still and look around you.\n\nIt does get busy so make sure to plan your visit on a good day. We went on June 30th and there were no schools or large groups so the visit was really relaxed. \n\nIt is a very kid friendly place but you can also enjoy it even if you don't have kids. They actually have a lot of crawl spaces for kids to make it look like they are in the tank and those are cool! I didn't care if they were for children though, I'm pretty small and made myself fit in there! \n\nFor some reason I never read any of the signs when I go to places that explain stuff (museums\/aquariums\/zoos) so I didn't personally learn anything during this visit but I still had a great time fish watching!\n\nThey also have an amazing gift shop!\n\nIt's a must see for anyone who loves aquariums, is visiting Toronto, has the city pass. \nI recommend doing both the CN Tower and the Aquarium on the same day (you can also squeeze in Casa Loma if your trip is short and you want to use up all your City Pass coupons.)
