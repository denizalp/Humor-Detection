So yummy! It's not badly priced, it's good, I really can't complain. This place has always been clean. I really like supporting these local businesses too. I hope this place doesnt go away like many of the other stores that have been in this shopping center. It's never crowded (I'm usually the only one in there). I always take my sister there for an after school snack. Waffle sandwhiches=yummmm
