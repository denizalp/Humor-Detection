If I didn't know any better, I'd think this food court was simply Harrah's twist on the casino buffet. You have different counters for various cuisines, none done especially well but a step better than they need to be. Prices are on par with casino cafes and unfortunately the sushi is grocery-store grade.\n\nCoffee counter offers Lavazza and subpar baked goods, sandwiches and pizza slices can be assembled or heated to order, froyo flavors are predictable, asian station is slightly above your usual food court vendors (healthier option with fresh veggies!), and the aforementioned sushi counter does offer a prepacked sashimi plate. If you're only a little bit hungry, or with a group, this area is probably an economical option to satisfy all cravings.\n\nInterestingly, the food court offerings seem to be careful not to step on the toes of other resident restaurants: this area does not offer any type of burger, instead signage reminds you that Toby Keith's is right upstairs if you simply must have one.
