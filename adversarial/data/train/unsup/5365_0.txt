Great place to purchase items from the Philippines, with Filipinos working in this facility. But, they are not very sanitary. I am standing outside of the restroom waiting for my turn to use. Unfortunately, an employee comes out of the single usage restroom without washing his hands. How would I know, the only sink in the restroom was dry as the Sahara Desert. Now mind you, on the mirror, it does state that all employees must wash their hands before returning to work. Maybe it should be in both English and tagalog.
