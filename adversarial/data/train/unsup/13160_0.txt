There's a whole street or two dedicated to the Indian and Pakistani population in Toronto and this is one of the places you will find that has some buzz. The iconic \"Rikshaw\" is parked outside the entrance and that's how you know you're at the right place. Having lived in Pakistan for a bit, I do have a good sense of good info\/Pakistani food so I was excited to try it out. The place is covered in the traditional \"shamiyana\" (which is like designed cloth or curtain like thing all around creating an enclosed space). Now if you're going to date the service you would give this place a -2 stars, but again consider the fact that customer service is not a word most Pakistani people are aware of. I had ordered the Chicken Tikka and Beef and Lamb Kabob with nan. It was all very tasty and tender and just how I had remembered it. It was definitely a great experience for me personally and very reminiscent of my trip to Pakistan back in the days.
