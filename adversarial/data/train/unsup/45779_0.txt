The namesake item, grilled cheese, was really disappointing but the tomato soup was pretty good. When it's $10 for a grilled cheese, I'm expecting thick bread with a nice crust on the outside and soft on the inside filled with plentiful ooey gooey cheese. Well this grilled cheese was none of that - very thin bread with a measly single slice of cheese half melted. It was so disappointing. The tomato soup was surprisingly good, sort of thick and chunky like a pasta sauce while still being soup.
