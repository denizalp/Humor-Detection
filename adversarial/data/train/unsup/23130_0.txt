Down the stairs to to a subterranean bar and restaurant. A cozy underworld, lit by candle light and fireplace. With no windows, time stands still. Bartender Perry served up the drinks, and some great happy hour dishes during this journey through the change in the continuum of space-time. Walking up the stairs I noticed it was dark. What happened to the sun? What happened to the last three hours? Maybe we were abducted. Maybe Perry is an alien?!\n\nTo Trisha S.  -  There are no high-chairs because this is an \"adult\" restaurant, not a Chuck E. Cheese. Get a baby sitter, and stop ruining everyone's dinner. And I know that you're going to say \"But my child is\" STOP! Your kid is an annoying, dinner disrupting troll, just like everybody else's.
