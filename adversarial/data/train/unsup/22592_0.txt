On November 5th, 2015 I went to make an exchange without a receipt and the cashier handed me a warning slip!!  I felt that this was terrible customer service!!!\n\n Macy's, Kohl's, JC Penney's, Target, Costco, Sam's Club all perform exchanges & returns without a receipt. They just swipe my card & they find my transactions!!\n\n I have NEVER received a Warning slip from any retailer before. I'm letting you know that this experience made me feel embarrassed & angry and does NOT inspire me to make future purchases with your company. I suggest you improve your customer service in this area. People watch out for Warning slips!!
