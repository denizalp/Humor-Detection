Let me start this blurb off with a sweeping statement:  I don't like pubs.  Not only that, I don't get them, I don't get their names (What the hell is a Firkin?), I hate the stinking, dank carpet they al have, and for that matter I don't particularly love beer.  \n\n That said, I do love Allen's and for all intents and purposes it is a pub.  But Allen's is different.  The large saloon style bar and hardwood floor décor harkens back to early America; the décor is like a set from a John Wayne movie - even the aging host is perfectly cast.\n\nThere is more to Allen's than it's antiquated charm...their beautiful patio.  Walking through the restaurant to the patio is like stepping out of the Old West and arriving in Paris, in July.  The patio is beautifully treed, with giant Oaks that must be at least 10 years old. \n\nOh right and the menu is quite good, untraditional pub fare with the standards --  good fries, great looking blue cheese  burger and some other fried stuff.  There is also a barbecue menu on summer evenings, which my boyfriend and I like because it comes with a ready-made salad bar.
