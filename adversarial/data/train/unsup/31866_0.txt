Stopped in for the first time today for lunch. Food is delicious-- what you would expect as far as quantity and quality for a fast casual Asian place. My noodles were actually really good-- creamy sauce and not greasy like a lot of Asian noodles are. \n\nBut as much as I liked the food, this place needs a serious remodel. Everything is shabby and kind of sad. Floors are dingy, tabletops peeling, walls are dirty and banged up. Just really tired looking. \n\nTheir soda machine was also really dirty. I used to work in food service and we had to wipe down the soda machine every night at closing. This one looks like it hasn't been cleaned in-- no exaggeration-- months. \n\nI will eat here again, but I will get takeout and a bottled drink, nothing from the fountain.
