Terrible Service.  We were late so we called and apologized and asked if we should still bother to come.  The person said that we could still come.  When we got there, the guy actually berated us for being late even though we had called before!  Then, he proceeded to be rude to us.  We asked for a particular table but the maitre d was reluctant to give it to us, even though the restaurant was almost empty.  We came close to leaving but decided to stay to avoid making it unpleasant for our children who were with us.  My husband, who had picked this restaurant to celebrate his birthday, asked for a recommendation at one point and the waiter said he could not say.  We shared two appetizers but the prawns and the kebabs were both overdone.  Our entrees were good but the naan was burnt to a crisp... and still served!  Needless to say, we would never go back.
