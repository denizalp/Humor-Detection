This is one of my favorite breakfast places. We used to go here all the time when I was a kid. I remember always getting their chocolate chip pancakes. Yum! We moved away from the area and hadnt been in a while. We drove by the other day and decided to drop in. Its just as good as I remember. Those little mini muffins that come with your breakfast are amazing and there omelets are really good. I saw that their special was pumpkin pancakes and Im going to have to come back and try those. They also have a new flavored coffee everyday. Really good. I love the decor, its just as I remember it 20 years ago. Its a cute little family owned place where they remember your name. Love it. Ill definitely be going back.
