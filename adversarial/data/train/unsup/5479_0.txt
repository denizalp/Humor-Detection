The zipline is the cheaper of the two options, and looking back...I should have gone for the zoom line.\n\nIt wasn't bad - it was just shorter than I anticipated, and no matter what I did to try and turn myself around (kicked to the right, kicked to the left, flapped my arms like a bird, politely asked the rope to turn) I was backwards for 84% of my relatively short ride.\n\nAfter having just done the set of Stratosphere rides, I felt like I was barely off the ground.  I find it was mostly worth the $20, but next time I would double down for the $40 zoom line ride.  I would also look around online...there has to be a coupon or Groupon for this somewhere.\n\nYou have a nice view of the whole area, but I went in the middle of the day (it was our last day there so I couldn't wait until the sun went down and the lights went on) and from reading other reviews...after dark is the time to do it.\n\nMiddle of the day - no lights, no lines.\nNight - lots of lights, probably a little bit of a line.\n\nConclusion:  Zoomline, at night.  Guaranteed to always face front.  No need to flap your arms like a bird.
