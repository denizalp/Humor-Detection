We had such a wonderful experience with this company! I would highly highly recommend. We actually booked by a third party agency cause their price was better than booking through Vision direct but the service of Vision was spot on! The plan with smooth and the personal was very professional. A major shout out to our driver Chuck Benson who was an absolute delight! He was so knowlegable and so friendly - he went above and beyond - just made it the most memorable trip we could have hoped for - well worth every cent we paid! If you go on this trip - ask for Chuck Benson, you won't be disappointed!!!
