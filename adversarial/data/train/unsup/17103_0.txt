This place is an undervalued gem of a hotel for the following reasons:\n\n-Check-in is a breeze.  \n\nThere's a handful of desk people, but it's only for a handful of customers.  Their clientele is varied too; it's not just your run-of-the-mill tourist.  Sitting at the bar, I noticed a huge contingent of their customer base is comprised of airline pilots and flight attendants.  Those people check in during off-peak hours, meaning less lines for you as a tourist..  \n\nAnother group of people that come through here are merchants\/salespeople\/business people.  I happened to see a Shark Tank winner check-in!  Cool huh?!\n\nIn contrast, If you've ever stayed at a behemoth like the MGM Grand before, it's like going through airport security again.  \n\n-It's quiet.\n\nYes, you might want to be near all the party action at the Wynn or the Cosmo, but don't you eventually want to go to bed?  Don't you not want to see half-naked drunk people stumbling through your hotel lobby? \n\n-The casino is an afterthought. \n\nIn case you feel like those other hotels' casinos are as complicated and maze-like as labyrinths, the Westin's casino is a tiny strip of real estate in the hotel.  I'm surprised people even go there to gamble.  Don't you want to gamble somewhere cooler than the Westin?  Maybe not.  Hard for me to say since I'm not a gambler.\n\n-The location is ideal.\n\nIt's just off the strip, but you can very easily walk there.  It's not like the Orleans Hotel where you have to pay for a shuttle to get onto the strip.  And it's not in the middle of all the chaos, so you can get away from the madness when you want to.\n\n-The rooms are spacious, clean, and updated.\n\nThe rooms look like the magazine-quality pictures.\n\n-Reasonably priced.\n\nIt's appropriately priced; it doesn't have a gimmicky Las Vegas image to maintain.  You can visit those hotels instead. :)\n\n\nIn short, the Westin is the place to be if Vegas is a place you want to see. ;)
