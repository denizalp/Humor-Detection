Kaya continues to impress. Been there for the third time now, always getting something different. This last trip was with a large group (family) so we were able to feast on several of the appetizers plus shared tastes of what each person ordered. I went with the Alligator and Pork Tacos with a side of street corn. I stuck with beer for the evening but the Sangria got rave reviews by those who indulged. Highly recommend Kaya as a Date Spot or for a large group.
