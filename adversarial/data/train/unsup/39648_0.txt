i had a chance to pop into this new Greek place for lunch. the place is clean and the service is super friendly, they are still working out the kinks with the staff but they make up for it in effort and eagerness. \nthe food arrived promptly, they bring warm pita slices and tatziki sauce which is thicker and creamier than usual the bowl of olives is a tasty treat. the meal was hot. the gyro meat was chunky, not thin sliced. the pita was warm and thick and fresh. the fries were crisp and hot and some of the better fries around. \ni wasn't able to finish the gyro because i wanted to try the baklave so opted for a slice, it was delicious, and had so much honey the top phylo was soaked through. The staff kept my tea filled and was quite polite and eager to please. Kudos for a great new place and best of luck in making it work!!! they have everything in place for success.
