I've been coming to Ajo Als for about 4 years now. The staff is so welcoming and this place has become like a little slice of home for me. I can't come in as often anymore but whenever i get the chance it's always so nice having the staff welcome me in! If you come in you have to ask for Jenny! She's the best! So sweet and personable. Love this place
