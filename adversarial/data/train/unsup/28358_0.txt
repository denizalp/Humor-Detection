Slowest and worst Subway experience ever. The workers weren't even trying to hustle (even when the line was 10+ people long at one point), and they just kept moving as slow as snails. They were so rude and kept acting like we were annoying them when we asked for a little more lettuce. While we were standing in line, one of the girls rudely said, \"You have to call ahead if you want more than 5 sandwiches\". We were all paying separately and weren't together? The girls' names were Dianne and Shayanne (sp?). Absolutely ridiculous. Never coming back.
