I'm in love with their mini cream puffs (they probably have a different name)!! It's small but most of it is the cream filling. Make sure you have a napkin when you bite into it because it will ooz out.\n\nI also really like their dark chocolate covered ginger. Huge fan of the spicy ginger aftertaste. \n\nThey have so many different types of chocolate to choose from. You can get chocolate with alphabeticals wrapped around and the flavour starting with that alphabet (for A it's almond). \n\nI have tried their macaroons in the past. I'm not crazy over them and macaroons are generally too sweet for my preference. The ones they sell here are no different.\n\nWill be revisiting this place to try out more of their chocolates and creampuffs.
