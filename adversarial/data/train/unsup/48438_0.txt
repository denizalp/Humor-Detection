I enjoy their burgers n it's close to my house so I like stopping by n grab a quick lunch time to time but, i never felt welcome in this place servers seem to hang by the counter most of the time talk to the people they seem to know each other pretty well once I got my food she never came to check on me & never got my drink refilled or anything at all...since I'm in tipping industry too I still leave 20% tip every time but, not for the service I receive for the food only! And Vegas is 24\/7 town n people work night shift don't get up til like 2p so, they should open til later closing @3p is ridiculous :(
