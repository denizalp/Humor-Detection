OK..... One good thing about Vegas is you can stay at topnotch hotels for less!  Its bargain town when it comes to 5 star accommodations.  I've stayed at quite a few posh hotels, but the Wynn set the standard.\n\nSo, like a smart budgetnista I signed up for Wynn deals via email.  And BAM the deal of a lifetime came.  Well not so much of a lifetime, but you get my point.  I digress, so going to the Wynn you can't wait to check in.  Its a Status thing.  Here I am decked out at the check-in desk.  Normally I show up in a sundress and sandals.  Long story short we get our room key.\n\nThe Wynn has the most lively colors and fresh flower displays anywhere bar-none. The Elevator bouncer greeted us, checked our room key and said \"Have a pleasant stay Ms. Sanders\".  I was feeling special.. Note: I never had to show my room key again, he remembered me AND my name.  Now that's service.\n\nEven the elevator was smooth.  Have you ever been on a janky elevator where you knew any moment the elevator was gonna plummet to the ground?  Well not here lol.\n\nThe Room was amazing.  59th floor, picture window, the most amazing bed.  Even better then the beds at the W.  For an hour I was in the bathroom trying to get ready.  Why you ask?  Because that damn TV had me distracted.  I couldn't leave... captivating programming in the tub!\n\nRoom service was.... expensive ($90 for breakfast), but when you are on vacation....vacation.  I got Watermelon Juice (my apologies to the black race).\n\nThe grounds, pool and restaurants were and are amazing.  There is no outrageous noise (which doesn't make gambling too fun).  But The Wynn showed me how I need to be treated.  Now if the Wynn could show me how to afford it!!!!!!
