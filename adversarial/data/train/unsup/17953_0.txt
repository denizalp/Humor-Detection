OK, this cafe can get very busy, very fast and stays that way. And the acoustics in this place are pretty terrible. That makes for lots of busy interactions and makes for lots of noise. \n\nThat aside, this is a wonderful little cafe located in a corner of the Safeway market lot. \n\nIf you are noise-sensitive but want to say, be sure to scope out a seat on the comfortable patio. It is near the road, but that is not overwhelming. Seriously, the outdoor seating is a huge bonus. \n\nIt's a bit crammed inside. You will find mostly two and four seater tables, but there is also some nice bar seating right up on the window. \n\nAnd I love the concept -- bagel sandwiches for all! They also have Boar's Head products, standard sandwiches and a nice selection of salads. Lots of options for breakfast. Also, I hear the potato salad is all the rave. \n\nI went with a bagel and lox. Ample serving! I was only able to eat my half for brunch, and saved the rest for a late afternoon snack. I went with the very garlic bagel. The garlic was so strong, fresh and flavorful! But if you are planning a makeout session at any other part of the day, skip this.\n\nYou can also grab an espresso drink here or roast blend. Darling little spot.
