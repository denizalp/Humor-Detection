This place is great! So cute and cozy, i sat upstairs and got great service. You order your food and then the servers bring it up to wherever you are sitting. The coffee was also great. You are able to customize your crepes however you like with the ingredients listed on the menu. I took Belgian chocolate with strawberries and bananas; definitely a great combination. Would return to this great relax environment. \n\nMy only negative point was that the music was too loud.
