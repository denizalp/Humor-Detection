If I had to work in a mall again I would kill myself i think.  If I had to work in Gerrard Square I would take people with me before I did it..  Now, to be fair I wouldnt EVER call myself a frequenter of malls (because you couldn't figure that out from the first two lines...)  That being out of the way, as far as malls go, despite their effort to clean this place up, it is still pretty drab. It is perhaps, reflective of the current mix of folks that live in the area, so I suppose it is moving along at a pace that makes sense with its surroundings.  (i remember talking\/or being told by a cashier in home depot that the gentrification of gerrard square was a sad and an unfair thing because most of the people that had always shopped there, now, were less able to shop there as there were more expensive stores opening up, etc. - it is sad, but it is what it is.) This is a bare bones place that is slowly creeping upwards - there are solid generic stores like home depot, staples, zellers, etc and some no name stores for clothes, accesories, etc., so if you know what you need it definitely serves its purpose.  If you are looking for a shopping extravaganza, a dazzling day fighting over the last avant-garde sweater on the rack, youve come to the wrong place.  For me, it comes down to convenience.  Because I live close by, i am thankful for the more utilitarian stores that are there all in one place.  So, go ahead and add a half to those two stars and there you have it.
