The service is great and the workers are incredibly friendly. It's got a cool environment on the inside and a great looking outdoor patio for when the weather is warmer. My pizza could have been cooked a little more. Toppings were still a bit cold and cheese should have been more melted. I would ask them to have your pizza well done. There is one single biggest reason as to why I won't return - the music is way too loud. I literally could not hear my husband and my five-year-old in a conversation. There were only two other parties in there while we were there. I asked a worker if he was able to turn down the music or if it was a directive from corporate (chipotle does the same thing). He was incredibly friendly and stated that corporate sets the volume but he could ask his manager. I told him not to worry about it. But I will not return because it's uncomfortably loud in there and I am an avid concert goer so I'm used to loud! It was also extremely cold in there.
