Walked in 10 minutes before they stopped serving breakfast. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and sweet. It wasn't until I heard a comment from the cook behind the window about me \"being able to order whatever I want off the menu\" that made me feel rather uncomfortable seeing as I ordered before they had finished serving breakfast and not to mention i was 1 of 3 people there, so I thought they would have appreciated my business regardless. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was cute. I may be back if I am in the neighborhood.
