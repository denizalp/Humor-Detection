Not sure why, but shooting fully automatic weapons is good clean fun. It's probably some deep seated primal thing, so don't blame me... blame evolution.\n\nThis place has all the guns you've been fantasizing about and letting them rip is as cathartic as you'd hope. On a Saturday it was crowded and we did have to spend a lot of time standing around before getting into the range. You don't shoot all by yourself, you're paired with an instructor the whole time, which felt perfectly safe to me though other people in our group were more nervous about the minimal instructions and training.\n\nThe guns weren't gleaming (our m16 jammed a bunch of times), but mostly worked as advertised. Some of the staff was super friendly while other folks were more surly. \n\nDefinitely a fun day-time activity and while not perfect or cheap this range gets the job done.
