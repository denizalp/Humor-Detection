I went here for a simple cut and style- provided by a great site- houseseats.com. First the salon is very cool. Has a great atmosphere, chocolates, teas, and a relaxing friendly staff. But this may be where the good things stop. \n\nThe stylist that I had almost seemed to not know what he was doing...no wait he did not know what he was doing! \n\nMy hair was washed in the 'hair washing' area but no towels or padding was placed on the area that your neck touches making this actually very painful. There was nothing relaxing about the wash. No scalp massage just ouch my neck is on the side of this sink!\n\nThe cut was ok but nothing to write home about. The blowout- well the only product put on my hair was a spray. No protectant for my hair for the heat coming from the hair dryer. \n\nThe drying- that was just plain painful. I have curly hair that requires a large round brush when styled straight. The hairdresser did not have a large brush and instead proceeded to pull on my hair as he dried it. I almost felt like I was 5 again and my mom was pulling out my tangles!! The flat iron went about the same way and I could hear my hair snapping in the flat iron each time he pulled it away from my head.\n\nNeedless to say when I got home I conditioned my hair and redid the style. My scalp was incredibly sore for at least a full day!!  In addition to all of this there was no styling of the hair when it was dry...it was only styled wet which by the way does not work for curly hair-especially when it is blown out straight!! \n\nEven with a free haircut this salon is off my list.
