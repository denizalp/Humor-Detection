Whoever reasoned that a bacon cheeseburger is the ultimate grease fest of a meal, apparently never graced their lips with a peanut butter bacon cheeseburger. Oh it exists, and AJ Bombers is whipping them up real good. \n\nDon't be turned away by the excessive richness of this glorious menu item. The Barrie Burger at AJ Bombers is a strange masterpiece you didn't know you needed in your life until you've had your first taste. One bite and those buds in your mouth will be confused. The unctuousness of the cheese, the heartiness of the burger and the succulence of the bacon all manage to meld in cohesion with that crunchy peanut butter. \n\nIt's as if Mary Burke and Scott Walker were to run into each other on the street. They of course acknowledge each other on good terms and carry on because that's what politicians do. This is the confrontation between the burger and the peanut butter. While there is some initial tension and wariness, both parties coexist in relative harmony. The peanut butter and the bacon cheeseburger are the same way. They meet, acknowledge their competition, and live on as two powerful flavors\/political figures. \n\nNow isn't that lovely.
