I was staying in the bellagio and the four of us were looking for a place nearby because we were on a tight schedule. One girl was a vegetarian and I noticed this place while walking back and forth from my hotel so I called down to see if they had any vegetarian options. They had 2 entrees that were vegetarian so we decided to try it out. Our service was less than adequate for this nice restaurant. He was not personable at all. He didn't make any recommendations or special. I think there was a happy hour going on that he did not tell us about. After we ordered the food he mentioned a different menu that we could additionally order from which is what we were actually looking for but it was kinda too late. It would have also been nice for him to mention the farm to table concept but it just looked like an expensive for no reason kind of restaurant at that moment. We ordered half a chicken and potatoes. My vegetarian friend ordered pasta. All of the food looked better than it tasted. The cool part about this place is that they come around with carts that have $8 items that you can try. We tried filet mignon satay which was amazing and perfect for us. We also tried a Hawaiian poke which was good also. I wish we just waited for the carts and ordered a bunch of items off of those because they were cheaper and way better tasting than what we got off of the menu. Our bill ended up being $175 and I felt like I walked away not feeling satisfied. It's not bad if your ok with paying for all of it and if your staying in the hotel, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come visit here. There are a lot of better options on the strip.
