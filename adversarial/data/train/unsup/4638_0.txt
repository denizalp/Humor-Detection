Sigh.. This restaurant may be the very reason why I never eat shrimp at a restaurant again. \n\nI went for sushi with of a couple of girlfriends last night. I'm not brave enough to eat raw fish, so I usually go for shrimp tempura. I order the appetizer, which came with 4 pieces of shrimp and mixed veggies. The food came fast and was hot. After biting into my second piece of shrimp, a long vein (poop) fell out of the shrimp remaining in my hand. I have never been so disgusted! I cut into the remaining two pieces, and poop was in abundance. At this point, I'm finding it difficult to not puke on the bar. I ate poop! We notified the waitress, and she revealed that the shrimp came already prepared. $10 for frozen shrimp tempura is pretty expensive. She took away my plate with three of my four pieces of shrimp, and offered free ice cream. We passed.. It was cold and rainy outside. My check came, and I was charged for the meal. I was kind of shocked! \n\nI called the next day to speak to a manager, and a lady named \"G\" reluctantly offered to give me my money back. She never apologized, but seemed upset that I less than thrilled about being served dirty shrimp. \n\nI would never dine here again.. Tragic experience!
