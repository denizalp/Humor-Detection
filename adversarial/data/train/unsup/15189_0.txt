Where are the girls? I went on Sunday night with a couple of out of town friends and the place was dead. There were more waitresses than girls. Don't pay for the VIP thing unless the club is packed. We sat down on the first floor for 30 min without seing anybody. We had to go to the bar to get out drinks. Pathetic for a club like that. The roof is kinda cool though with a live DJ but there is nothing really to see on the top. Dean Martin Drive is not really the best neighborhood out there. Anyway. Go somewhere else. Treasure's or Spearmint Rhino are much better. Don't waste your time and $30 to get in ($60 for VIP).
