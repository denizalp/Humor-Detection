FOOD\/DRINKS - good!\n\nAppetizer - Nachos Classic ( ~$7)\nOriginally ordered the Nachos Grande, but received the Nachos Classic instead.  The manager somehow knew we received the wrong dish, offered to re-make the correct dish, and took it off the bill. Since my date and I were first-timers here, we had no idea that we received the wrong dish, but we stuck with the Nachos Classic. It was very nice of her to take it off our bill. The nachos classic tasted very good, however, so no complaints. Portions were huge! The Nacho chips were about the size of my little hand.\n\n\nWarning: Entrees came out searingly hot! We had to wait awhile to let our dishes cool down.\n\nThe Monterrey ($15 - $16)\nPortions were immense! I'm not very familiar with Mexican food, but this dish seemed to have a bit of everything on it! My favorite part of this dish is the papas con chile - mashed potatoes basically - I couldn't get enough of it! In general, this dish contained 5 different enchiladas, a taco, the mashed potatoes, a dollop of guacamole, and beans. Overall, it's bursting with flavors and great for people with huge appetites.\n\nFajita Chimichangas ($11 - $12)\nVery spicy~! Two huge chimichangas served with a dollop of guacamole and either papas con chile or brown rice. Boyfriend was very satisfied.\n\nPina Coloda ($7.75!)\nTasted good, but way too expensive for the portions. I can get a tastier and cheaper pina coloda served in bigger portions at Red Lobster's.\n\n\nATMOSPHERE - loved!\n\n- big and clean\n- Very nicely decorated\n- Fun, lively Spanish music played in the background \n- Even though the place was busy, it didn't feel crowded or stuffy because the place is so spacious \n- Good for huge parties and families \n\n\nSERVICE\n\nDecent. He could've been a bit more friendly. He seemed slightly nervous. Our entrees came out way too quickly, however.  We were still working on our appetizer when our entrees came out in a very short time period, and as mentioned earlier, our plates were hot! It was difficult to eat without burning ourselves.
