May 4th I went in at 12:30pm for a physical and EKG appointment. I waited for 2 hours, finally got the EKG around 2:30pm and ran out of time to do my physical. I paid $125 up front and got half the service I paid for. On top of it all, Dr. Singh didn't pass me on my EKG due to having a lower resting heart rate than the average human being. The office ladies are very friendly, but all in all it's a complete waste of time and money to see this doctor. For all you other athletes that need a physical, I highly recommend you choose Dr. Snead. I know on the internet it says Dr. Voy, but unfortunately he is retired now and this now works in this office. Update: my EKG was that of a healthy athlete. Singh is just looking for that dollar sign. If I could he'd get negative stars.
