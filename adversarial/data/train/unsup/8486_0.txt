***This gift shop at South Point Hotel & Casino is your standard hotel gift shop in terms of selection (toiletries, over-the-counter medicine, snacks, souvenirs, etc.), but their prices were significantly less expensive than the gift shops I've visited in Phoenix and Las Vegas recently***\n\nI wanted to pick up a Las Vegas refrigerator magnet before heading back to Los Angeles and found a good one here that was very iconic (the Las Vegas sign); the magnet also featured hooks for key chains and such.  The magnet was $4, which was less than the $6-$8 magnets I've seen in other cities like Phoenix.\n\nI also picked up a bag of red licorice.  It was the Aussie style red licorice (a generic brand)  The licorice had that Aussie feel to it--rich, sweet and chewy.  The licorice was not stale either and it was only $2 for a decent sized bag.\n\nService was quick and friendly.\n\nGift shops (hotels, casinos, stadiums, etc.) tend to be overpriced and feature a lot of stuff you don't need.  In terms of South Point's gift shop, they definitely had a fair share of stuff you wouldn't need, but their prices were better than most, which makes this a better-than-average hotel gift shop.\n\nSouth Point Hotel & Casino has free parking (both an open lot and a structure).
