Yes it's just Subway, but I like it for what it is. It's extremely clean, the staff is well-groomed and they keep their gloves on and the food tastes fresh. \n\nSubway provides a good option when I'm on the go, want something healthy and don't feel like steering out of my comfort zone in the interim. \n\nSubway also provides a economic option for lunch goers. I can get a six inch sub, large soda and baked lays for about $5. Not bad Subway! \n\nI will end on the note that this Subway is on the Chaparral Plaza. Star right there.
