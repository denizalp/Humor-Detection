I remember the first weekend they opened - there was some hype building on the twitterz. They've kept up the good work since then, too. \n\nThe pie is delicious, but like Chris P says - you want a little more in terms of fillings. It's a comfortable and relaxing place to have a cup of tea and a slice while playing cards or something - and the staff\/owner\/mgr man is as attentive as possible without being annoying.\n\nIt's pretty far out there if you're downtown, but a good destination on a rainy weekend afternoon.\n\nThere is a really old dog that hangs outside and in. He's REALLY old. Are pets allowed in places where food is prepared? Who cares, at least it's not a cat.
