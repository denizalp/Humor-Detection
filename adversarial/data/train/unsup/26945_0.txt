We had breakfast here 5 days in a row. By the 2nd day the staff already knew our names. The service was awesome but the food was amazing!!! I swear everything they make is from scratch and I found myself snapping pics of the food. The (in-house made) Granola bowl with fresh fruit and Greek yogurt was incredible. I'd list everything I ordered but seriously it was all so good just try pretty much anything on the menu. A shout out to Fuego for taking such good care of us.
