Perhaps the most transphobic places I've ever been to.  Requested a men's haircut and was told would pay as a women.  I explained I did not identify as a woman and was requesting a men's haircut.  Then the receptionist explain to me that I wasn't really getting it \"they have men's cuts and women's cuts'.  I explained I did get it and I didn't identify as a woman and I want a men's cut like the guy sitting in the chair getting his hair and beard done for less.  The receptionist then said perhaps this is not the salon I should be at.  I requested to speak to the owner and when the receptionist came back she said in an extremely snarky way we'll charge you a men's cut.  Only to be followed by glares from the owner who choose never to talk to me and the receptionist who would no longer even make eye contact.  2016 HAPPY PRIDE.  Just wanted a fair hair cut.\n\nReminds me to always stick to my stylist at Textur Studio that did my hair with a smile.
