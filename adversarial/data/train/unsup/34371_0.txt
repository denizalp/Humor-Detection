Absolutely love this gym! Extremely welcoming and very clean. I recently signed up with Joe and Raul for regular fitness training and I've never felt more comfortable. They push me just enough where I want to cry but they encourage me to stay focused and keep going. I feel like part of the family. I've even brought my nieces to stay since they have a kids club and milana was the girl on the duty. She's very attentive and so nice! Finally a gym where I don't have to worry about people staring or if I'm doing things right. There is always someone there to help you. This gym is 5 stars without a doubt
