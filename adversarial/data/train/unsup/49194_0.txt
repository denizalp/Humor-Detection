Grab some menus and grab a seat.\n\nThis family owned establishment knows how to make some tasty burgers and sandwiches. \n\nWhen you walk in just grab a seat and start browsing the menu. I recommend trying the waikiki teriyaki burger: caramelized onions, mushrooms, grilled pineapple, Swiss cheese, mayo & teriyaki sauce.\n\nDon't forget to check out their specials for the day which is posted on a blackboard on the left side of the cafe. There can be some pretty amazing things on there.\nAnywho, I'm pretty much a regular here. Service is always good and fast. Today when we stopped in they had us try a pumpkin cinnaroll they've been experimenting with for FREEE. Deeelicious!
