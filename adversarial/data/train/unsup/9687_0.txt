THIS PLACE IS MY ABSOLUTEST SECRET, VERY NAUGHTY moderately sinful, INDULGENCE.\n\nFirst off, the place is CLEAN.  This is an obsession with me.  Second, the guys who run this place - polite to everyone - smart storekeepers.  A smile and a polite word keep people coming back.\n\nNow to the important stuff:  A huge range of chocolates from the United Kingdom ... OMG ... toffees, choccies, the works.  Some really good biscuits and good, old British \"crisps\" (Walkers).  This place is my not-so-secret indulgence ... mmmmmmmmmmmmm.  Ahhh ... yes!\n\nTheir products are very, very fresh.  They pay attention to expiry dates.  This is important - you are paying premium dollar for imported choccies and biscuits and you want them to be fresh (which they are, here).  Enjoy!\n\nP.S.   And if you're into it ... they also carry TINNED HAGGIS from Scotland.
