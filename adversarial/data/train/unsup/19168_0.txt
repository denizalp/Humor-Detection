I've been coming here over the past year, each time bringing my Colorado friends, and one word sums it all:  YUM!  \n\nThe menu is vast and the flavor is always amazing.  Seating is quite limited but that just means this place is widely-loved.  The servers are usually lovely unless it's closing time.  More than once, the lights would suddenly become blinding, the music will be switched to death metal, and the volume would go up to borderline-deafening.  That's never a good way to get customers to leave so that docks off a star.
