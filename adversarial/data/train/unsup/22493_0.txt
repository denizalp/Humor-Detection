I am so bummed L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon disappointed me so much. I was looking forward to dining here and left so sad and unfulfilled. \n\nHub and I both got the seasonal tasting menu and he had his with the premium wine pairing. \n\nI am sad to say that only one dish was good.     For the price point, I would recommend you to go to Le Cirque instead.
