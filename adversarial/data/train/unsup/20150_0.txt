Poor service, mediocre food, disorganized setup, not very clean. Won't go there again. \n\nWe really didn't find this place appealing. When we walked in, it was not overly clear whether we were supposed to order and then sit or sit and have the waitress come to take our order... There was no menu actually posted - just a white board with some specials. It's not a very good place for people unfamiliar with Hawaiian food - and the staff wasn't particularly friendly to ask questions to. They were middling-busy when we went - there were a good number of tables filled but it wasn't slammed. We ended up standing at the counter while the cashier\/order taker\/whatever ignored us for a few minutes. There was confusion about their menu. The online menu in Yelp isn't overly accurate, by the way. Neither, apparently, is their printed menu. \n\nThe food came out pretty quickly. The rice and the macaroni potato salad was pretty good. The chicken katsu was decent. Difficult to screw up steamed rice and breaded chicken, but I've seen it done before so props to them. The J.R. plate was tasty enough, according to my husband, but it left him with an upset stomach later. \n\nThe cleanliness was the biggest concern. The table we sat at was dirty. The floor was smeared and filthy. The chair I sat in was sticky, and so was the counter where we ordered our food. I couldn't see into the kitchen but I was kind of wary about eating the food. \n\nI'm really not interested in going back, and neither are my husband or our friends that were with us. Find somewhere else to eat, save yourself the disappointment.
