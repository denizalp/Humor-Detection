Hooray for $5 crepes!! \n\nThis worked out perfectly for a quick b-fast stop. They had several different kinds to choose from. I had the Banana Peanut Butter Crepe and it was absolutely wonderful. My friends both had the Strawberry Cream Cheese. We watched through the window as the guy made them.\n\nWe asked if all of the B&J's have crepes and they said no and that they are the only ones. I'm a huge crepe fan and this one was perfection. For a quick and sweet snack I recommend coming here for a treat.
