Soto is hands down amazing! My roommates and I would go every week to see him and have him make us our sushi. Without fail every week. I have recently moved out of Vegas and now live in AZ. My husband I have look everywhere for sushi like his and have been disappointed every time. Now when I go visit Vegas I will always stop and see him where ever he goes!
