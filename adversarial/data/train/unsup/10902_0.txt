Good Lord Really! Called to try and get my son's tooth extracted! Was told I needed to have a consult then have tooth extracted next Wednesday! My son is 11 in a lot of pain. I did explain I have an emergency situation. I was also told the office was busy and I could also wait for several hours and maybe Dr Fish could see my son today or maybe not! Wow! Not to mention the rude and obviously upset receptionist was having a bad day!
