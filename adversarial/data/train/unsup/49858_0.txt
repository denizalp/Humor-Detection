Came here on a cold Saturday night with my wife. Tip: Come hungry because the portions are big! The service was very prompt and friendly. Lots of great authentic Mexican menu choices to choose from. I had a combination meal with enchiladas and a burrito. Food was absolutely fantastic, tasty and rightfully spicy. If you're looking for a trendy hipster place, then this is not the place for you. This is just great Mexican food with no pretensions and at very reasonable cost. Great addition to the neighbourhood.
