Arriving at any Wimpy's no matter what the time of day, the question in my mind is always \"Do I do all day Breakfast OR the burger\"? Yes of course they have a scrumptious menu prepared to grease any spoon into submission, but for my money its either a) or b).\n\nFor those of you whom have never had the pleasure of visiting a Wimpy's (aptly named after the cheap, scheming burger Barron friend of Pop-eye), its the perfect place for a quick meal any time of day. The staff is warm, local and usually reminds me of my Mom or a cool sweetheart aunt. \n\nThe d√©cor in my mind is the tops, small malt-shop style booths with tons of quirky road, vintage coca-cola and movie signs, clutter the wall amidst 1950s memorabilia (looks like a James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis fan club had a field day in here).\n\nAesthetics and ambiance aside, lets get back to the real draw here: Foods! Ill be sure to review the breakfast menu on a follow up review some other time, but my lunch yesterday made me full, sleepy, and smiley and I must tell you all about it. \n\nI ordered the Wimpy's Famous Hamburger Combo (ordered a Coke and a Greek Salad) w\/ Bacon and Cheddar cheese on top. The burger naturally comes with all the fixin's: lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup, may, mustard, relish, but none of that matters when the burger arrives. An 8 inch long OVAL burger pattie protrudes a solid 2.5 inches on either side of the already sizeable sesame seed toasted bun. \n\nThe SEP (standard eating procedure) for these burgs is to nibble your way around the meat until you hit bun and work away from there. I've near failed at this bodacious badass burger on several occasions, but always have found the will to push through and pack it in.\n\nThe last item I wanna rap about is the unexpected value of their Greek salad. It was the first time I had ordered it, and aside from not properly preparing the iceberg lettuce (it was a tad chunky for my liking), the portion was hearty and there was so much feta cheese that my bowl looked like a feta cheese salad sundae. Delish. \n\nLastly, because Wimpy was such a cheapskate it would be a sin to make his signature meal pricey. Total meal cost was around $13 +tip (thats with adding cheese and bacon)\n\nDining here will never leave you spouting Wimpy's once famous line \"I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a Hamburger today\"\n\nNOM :)
