I'm not a poutine expert, but Poutini's definitely took care of my junk food craving. I love the squeaky cheese, the gravy was very good and the fries were tasty and did a great job of soaking up the gravy. I got the traditional, and also tasted The Works (which has bacon, sour cream and chives in addition to the cheese and gravy). I can't imagine needing mayonnaise on top of all that, but there a few mayo options as well.
