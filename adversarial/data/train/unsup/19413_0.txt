It's Subway\n\nBetter then most fast food places. The restraunt is always clean, and the service is always friendly. I enjoy the Artisan bread, with herbs\/cheese, always fresh and crisp. Always a nice selection of choices.\n\nSubway is better than most burger places. I like the option of adding tons of veg to the basic meats. The staff is friendly and the sandwiches are inexpensive.\n\nNot bad for a quick bite.
