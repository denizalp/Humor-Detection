So I called around to local shops and this place was $20 cheaper than others. I was quoted ($70 out the door) over the phone for my common size tire for mount, balance, disposal fees etc. I get there and all of a sudden \"out the door\" pricing doesn't include tax according to the salesman??? Came out to $80 out the door.... So therefor, False advertising... Yes they do give you the price before the work and if I wasn't in a bind I would of walked away but I had to get to work and this place was the closest. But other than the false prices. This place was ok.
