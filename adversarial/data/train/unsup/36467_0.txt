This was our first time trying this restaurant and will definitely be our last . I am not sure if we have ever had such mediocre food . The menu looked enticing but the pork was overcooked on some pieces raw on others . Do not get me started on the sides .. Worlds smallest portion of bland tasteless macaroni and a crab fried rice that lacked any crab , flavor or dignity . This meal made me reconsider why I enjoy eating at all . There are many great local restaurants in the same price range with much bigger portions and for the love of god flavor !! I suggest mastros city hall , cafe monarch and cowboy ciao . This is not a house I would ever like to step foot in again .
