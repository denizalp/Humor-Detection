Brads is cheap and the fish and sides are all frozen pre-breaded. I pop thru the drive thru every now and then because its cheap and easy and on my way home.\n\nThe catfish is OK. it's thin and flat? Never saw a flat catfish before. Not a lot of flavor. This is normal for Brad's trust my ex used to get the fish and fried zucchini all the time. I do like their tarter sauce it is tasty. \n\nIt's weird if you go in they have all of these display cases to sell you trinkets from Asia. But looks a little like a cafeteria. They have everything fried you can think of. Fish, shrimp, chicken, mushrooms, zucchini, onion rings, fries you get the idea. \n\nIf you want great catfish go to Honey bears on central Thursdays or Fridays only.
