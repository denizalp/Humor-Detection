I went to chiropractor's office as a referral, called The Joint - Boca Parkâ€‹. Because I know better that my neck and shoulder pain was temporary, I would never sign a one year subscription. I specifically told the front desk receptionist that I was only signing up for the one-month subscription that included 4-visits at $60 and paid this upfront. I returned for a second visit, but didn't return for the last two visits. \n\nA few months later I get letter that I have not paid for 6-months. I call to speak with the Wellness Coordinator that says that I initialed for the monthly subscription, because that's where the Veteran receptionist pointed for me to initial. I would never expect that a healthcare provider would rip me off like that.\n\nI made the call 10-minutes ago. The Wellness Coordinator said she would e-mail me the cancellation form, which she shouldn't have to because my intention was to never ever sign up for a monthly subscription. In the meantime, I still haven't received the e-mail.\n\nMy husband has 1200 friends on FB. I will be sharing this review and I will be sharing this on Yelp.\n\nAnd you best better believe, this is going to BBB!\n\nRant not over!
