I was excited to see this restaurant close to my work.  The owner was very nice and personally greeted and seated me at the \nbar.  I would give it 3.5 stars if possible. \n\nI had Sopa Verde which is a Portuguese kale\/potato\/chorizo soup.  It was very good.  I then ordered what I thought was the calamari entre with fries, and got calamari with rice.  It was ok, but IMO needed some salt and pepper as it was a tad bit flat.  \n\nI also ordered Vino Verde, which is a tart Portuguese white wine.  When the check arrived, I was invoiced for the calamari appetizer vs entre which saved some $.  A complaint was that the vino verde was 7 per glass.  That seemed very high, as this wine is tupically one that is in the 6-9$ \/ bottle range, so felt that was very excessive.  Also I yearned for bread which was not offered.  \n\nI will for sure return, as I think that some if the glitches could be attributed to it recently opening.  The menu is very interesting.
