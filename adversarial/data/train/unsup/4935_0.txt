I can't believe something actually beats Pacific Pinball Museum\/Lucky Juju in Alameda. \n\nVegas' Pinball Hall of Fame is a darkened warehouse, packed to the gills with vintage and new machines. \n\nWhile Lucky Juju is a $15\/10 cover price with all-you-can-play pinball, the Pinball Hall of Fame is entirely free to enter, much like the old arcades of yore (do kids even know what arcades are any more?), and you pay by the machine you use. Newer machines cost you a few shiny quarters. \n\nThis is the perfect place for your inner geek who's interested in gaming (but not gambling) and was probably bummed when the Star Trek Experience closed.
