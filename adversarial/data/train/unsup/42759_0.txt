The food at Bistro 19 is top quality! Every dish my husband and I had was full of flavor, they really pay attention to every detail. I've eaten at Bistro 19 two times. The first time was many years ago shortly after they opened. I remember the food being good but for some reason it didn't stick out to me. Well just the other week we decided to eat there again, pretty much the deciding factor was they had outside tables and wanted to eat outside on a nice summer evening. Well this time the food was unforgettable! Every dish we ordered was amazing! We ordered quite a few dishes. Really, it was too much food but there were so many items on the menu that sounded so good I couldn't resist. Besides, there's nothing wrong with having leftovers. :)  They really nailed it on every dish, the appetizers, the entrees and even dessert. Don't leave there without trying one of their deserts. They have some pretty creative dishes. \nI certainly won't be waiting another couple years before I eat there again...Bistro 19 will be a regular on my list now! \nThey really do deserve more than 5 stars!
