If I could give negative stars, I would. I used them as my property management company for a home I own. I don't believe they ever ran a background check on the tenant, as she pays rent late and always has some excuse. Even though Costello assured me she was a great tenant and always paid on time. She is always breaking something in the house. I also discovered that they never obtained the security deposit from her when I asked about it when she was served with a 5 day notice. They also tried to charge me for damages the tenant clearly should have been responsible for. Upon having my attorney contact them regarding this and the deposit issue, they immediately rescinded our contract and agreed to cover the costs of the damages. After obtaining a new management company, Costello proceeded to forward invoices for the replacement of the address and coach lightbulbs on the front of the house. I was quoted $30 for this and the invoices I am now having to pay are for $100!! I was never even notified of this cost and these invoices are from October\/December. I would never suggest anyone to use Costello. I have a new management company that has already done 10x better in just the short month I have had them.
