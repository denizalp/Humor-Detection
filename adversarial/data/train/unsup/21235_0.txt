If you WANT your flight to be delayed every time without a doubt, porter is your gal. A discount airline that tries to play bougie by smothering you in a mediocre, cramped lounge with offerings of free pop\/water\/hot bean water aka coffee and the random expired pretzels from bits and bites in little bowls. \n\nI'm quite unsure why our company chooses to book with porter every time when they care so much about our own employee's tardiness. I have always taken porter for my domestic flights and without a doubt, they have been delayed every time. Shocker!! Something about maintenance once (no I mean, the flight literally turned around on the runway) to just general delay 15 minutes at a time until it delayed until the boarding time was the original time I was supposed to arrive at my destination. Because of this, I missed my train AND my bus, both an hour apart and now have to take the NEXT bus which is ANOTHER hour apart - which I might not even make because the billy bishop shuttle driver to union literally abandoned his shuttle after parking it down. And literally all they keep saying is \"thank you for your patience\" - you know this doesn't ACTUALLY do shit for me right?\n\nSure the flight attendants are nice and sure they mask their horribleness with free booze but I'd rather have a united airlines experience if they can for once make my flight arrive and leave when it's supposed to. (Jk about the united crack- too soon?)\n\nPersonally I'd never book porter but if you love waiting an extra hour or two, this is your airline!
