I was fortunate enough to stay at The Westin Kierland Villas for Christmas.\n\nLet me give you a quick tour of the room:\n-Bedroom: a king size bed of super comfy mattress with a big closet and a TV. Complimentary lavender oil is provided for a good night sleep.\n-Bathroom: A tub with dual showerheads, plush robes, a hair dryer and a magnified makeup mirror with light. \n-Living room: a couch with TV and plenty of plugs for your charging needs. \n-Dining room: a round table with 4 chairs.\n-Kitchen: a fully stocked kitchen (utensils, stoves, refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave) with a coffee maker featuring Starbucks coffee.  \n-Washer & dryer in your room.\n\nOther amenities:\n-24-hour fitness facilities.\n-A golf course and tennis courts, outdoor heated pools. \n-A cafe and convenient store. \n-Movie rentals & business center.\n-Complimentary s'mores on Friday and Saturday (6-8pm)\n\nConveniently located near Kierland Commons and Scottsdale Quarter shopping centers, the Westin Kierland Villas is friendlier than its sister location, the Westin Kierland Resort & Spa. Everyone was very helpful, polite and friendly. \n\n4 stars!!
