Great food, service not so much! Let me first say that we had a large group and one server  was definitely not enough but Patrick gave it a great effort. On the other hand we did call in a reservation so perhaps a bit more preparation on their part would have been helpful so all of us might  have been served and waited upon in a more timely manner. Also, I didn't know it went against protocol to turn around and ask the bar tender whom was not busy to refill a soda. I guess it was since I was told that was my server's job and he would get it, apprarently if he was I woudn't be asking the bar, enough said.\nIt was my first time at Haus Murphy and one of the best things about going with a big group is friends share. I ordered the Kilometer sausages, with fried potatoes and sauerkraut. The sausages were Hungarian, great flavor and so big they hung off the sides of the plate. I've never liked sauerkraut growing up but theirs I liked. My food was excellent and back to the friends and sharing, we exchanged bites, sausage for schnitzel, I tried a few, and every bite was amazing! I was getting quite full but since it's quite some distance from where I lived I figured I better try dessert. Oh bread pudding would have made the evening, but unfortunately for me but probably fortunately for my waistline they had just ran out. \nI'd go back again, the food is definitely worth coming back for!
