I wonder if the previous reviews are from family, friends, or promoters of the show.  First the seating in the Kings Room at the Rio is terrible.  Very amateur show setup.  We were seated in the left side of the stage and couldn't see some ofthe dancers half the time.   \n\nOnto the performance,  the opening number gave it away that some of the ladies may either be new to the show or not professional dancers.  The other dancers seemed more like professional cheerleaders gone topless.  When all five ladies dance together they are all off on their counts and it was a little distracting. \n\nThe show is broken down into short performances to different rock songs from the past 60 years.  These were okay.\n\nThe best part of the evening was intermission when the MC did a comedy routine.   He was hilarious and I needed a tissue from tears of laughter.\n\nAll in all this show (as a straight female) was not worth the $118 for two tickets.  Even my boyfriend agreed that it was not that great.  The other men watching the show seemed to enjoy it...but is is half naked women dancing around.
