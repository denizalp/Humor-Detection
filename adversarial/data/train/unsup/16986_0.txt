Quite a breathtakingly beautiful renovation, certainly the most elegant spa I've ever visited. The staff was very helpful, and I appreciated that unlike some of the other spas on the strip, I could get access even though I wasn't a registered guest.\n\nThe layout of the spa is very disorienting. It's gigantic - 65,000 square feet, I'm told - but about half the square footage is hallways. Those hallways feel even longer when you're wearing uncomfortable spa sandals.\n\nThat being said, the Roman baths are incredible - hot, warm, and cool, with a beautiful continual shower flowing from the ceiling to rinse off after you emerge from the water. I was there on weekend and weekdays and it never felt crowded.\n\nThe dry sauna is decent and the steamroom large, deep, and - IMHO - too hot. There's also an \"inhalation room\" that's kept very humid, but not steamy. The staff recommends this room for shaving, which I was surprised to see several guys doing. Their gimmick is the Arctic Ice Room, where very small  bubbles flutter down from a blower in a blue-lit room that's kept quite cool. It's refreshing when you get out of one of the hot facilities.\n\nThe attendants here were generally a pain. Most of them kept disappearing or were glued to the football game on the television. The ones who weren't there were following guys around the spa and kept popping their heads into the sauna and steamroom; it was kind of creepy and not very relaxing.\n\nNo iced towels - big gripe for me - and you had to go to the TV room to get cold bottles of water from a small fridge. The selection of snacks wasn't as good as other properties either; Mandalay leaves Caesar's in the dust in that regard.\n\nI didn't try any of the treatments. Access to the spa alone was $45 - very steep as Strip spas go.
