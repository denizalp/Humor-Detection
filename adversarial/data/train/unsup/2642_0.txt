We have dined at many ayce sushi restaurants. They would of received 4 stars due the freshness of the fish and relatively quick service from the chefs. But to to lack of customer service, they are getting only 2.\nMy son ordered a roll, after eating the first piece realized that he did not like it. After pushing it to the side the waitress comes up and says that we have to eat it. I nicely said that my son did not like it. And instead of just taking the lost on 1 cucumber maki roll responds with, \"well why did you order it then\" and forced us to eat it. The rest of our meal we were being intensely watched by the chefs ensuring that we finish all of the items we ordered....which we always do.
