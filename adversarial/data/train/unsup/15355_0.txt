Finally got the wife's permission to buy a new TV.  Did all the on-line research and wanted to go with a 65\" Panasonic Viera VT60 Plasma.  Wanted to buy at a brick and mortar store in case it ever needed to be repaired.  Only Best Buy and Fry's carried the model I desired, Fry's was a little less expensive.  Drove down there, went and looked at the demo picture was great, asked the kid if they had a new one in stock he said yes, paid cash on the spot.  Went and rented a trailer, took it home. unboxed it, was a used TV.  Had packing tape all over the back as well has pet hair all over the screen, no remote.  Normally I wouldn't be too upset just return it, this though is a 65\" Plasma TV weighs over 160lbs.  \n\nGot it back to the store and they tried not to take it back as the serial number was ripped off, luckily one of the older salesman knew they had two serial numbers on them.  Already knew they would not give me back my $3800.00 cash was going to be a check in the mail(took 3 weeks) asked anyways.  At the point I got loud just to be a dick since they wasted my families whole day, demanded to see the store manager, berated him and his staff, felt better.\n\nDragged my wife and kid to Best Buy down the road, they only had the TV at their Magnolia Store over in PV.  Drove another 30 minutes over there, made sure the TV was brand new, they priced matched Fry's, got the 5 year in-home warranty.  Had the TV for over a year picture is BEAUTIFUL, much better than LCD or LED.
