Now named Hunan Jiu Jia. No more pots on the menu but still lots of great Hunan style food here. As vegetarians, my husband and I ordered the spicy sting beans (amazing), sweet and pungent potato (meh) and the seaweed salad (solid). If you want spicy, ask for it. \n\nAs a side note, both staff and other patrons commented on the fact that we (both white) were successfully using chopsticks. Guess they don't see a lot of that in here.
