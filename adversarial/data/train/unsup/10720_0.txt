APS CAN SUCK IT! I am sick and freaking tired of this company. I'm getting a finger in my butt from these bigots, who have zero concern for their customers. 3rd time in 1 month I have lost power, for 3 days last time! All they could do is offer me some free ice......with a receipt?! NOT TO MENTION MY BILL IS A 100 DOLLARS HIGHER VERSUS LAST YEAR, WITH THE EXACT SAME KILOWATT USAGE. Shoot me now, worst part is I am stuck with these jerks. I even bought a 400 dollar generator and 300 dollar ac unit just so I could keep my kids cool at night. I wish someone had the power to step up to these money hungry monkeys. IF A NEGATIVE STAR WAS APPLICABLE IT WOULD IT WOULD A NEGATIVE PI! -3.14..............forever! I hope the ceo chokes on a chicken bone.
