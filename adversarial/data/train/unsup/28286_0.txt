First, I would like to say that there are so many good reviews on this horrible complex because the management bribed their residents when they renewed their lease to write a good review for a visa gift card.  Since the Connor Group has taken over this complex, everything has gone down the drain and I am not even sure where to start.  First, their customer service is unacceptable.  Many people have complained about various issues and they give all of us different excuses if they even get back to us.  There have been many issues that have needed \"special parts\" and some of these parts including the AC parts are taking 2+ months.  I was promised new gym equipment, cabana style pool atmosphere, updated hallways and the list goes on.  The only thing I have gotten out of the Connor group has been no AC in the hallways (which I have complained about since 6\/4\/2016 and still to this day 7\/27\/2016, they are still waiting for a special part), not a clean pool, a trash bill that went up from $13 to $60, trash that is piled up in the parking garage (imagine the smell in the dead heat of summer), a sewer and water bill that keeps going up even though I haven't changed a thing.  I cannot wait to turn in my 60 days notice next renewal.  They did update my apartment at renewal and increased my rent $120.  They told me they would be putting in hardwood flooring.  I came home to the company doing the \"hard wood flooring\" measuring the laminate wood like flooring in the parking lot and then doing a horrible installation job.  Yup, I got laminate floor that looks like hard wood all for $120 more a month.  They told me that wouldn't upgrade my appliances because that would cost me another $150 a month.  I also have neighbors that only got a $40 rate increase.  I have lived here for 6 years and that loyalty has counted for nothing.  With all the apartment complexes going up right now, I would NEVER recommend this complex to anyone!
