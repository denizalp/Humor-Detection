Wow I'd have to say that this place is a hidden gem! Romantic ambience and authentic Thai food is the theme. I started off with a beautiful white sangria that had a flower in it. Be careful, these are dangerous! They are very sweet and go down very easily. We tried multiple tapas including the golden pouches, fried avocado, and Siamese corn fritters. My favorite of these were the corn fritters. They had a crunchy exterior with a soft stuffing including kernels of corn, pork and spices. The sauce that came with these was delicious! It was sweet and had peanuts floating in it. The golden pouches were also very tasty. I got these to try their curry sauce which was excellent. These pouches were so pretty I didn't even want to eat them! The fried avocado was also very tasty and an interesting concept. At last I tried the chocolate banana beignets. OMG these were divine. They were stuffed with a deep dark chocolate and bananas in the inside. They were then drizzled with chocolate on the outside. They came hot and freshly fried. This place serves a multitude of wines and had two beers on tap.  It did not appear that they serve any type of mixed drinks or hard liquor. This secret place is definitely a restaurant that should not be kept secret!
