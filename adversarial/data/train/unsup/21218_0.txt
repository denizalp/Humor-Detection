OK, I managed to kill off all of my cockroaches, with the help of an exterminator who actually does German cockroaches.  For anyone's future reference his name is Danny and his phone number is 702-215-1991.  \n\nApparently my neighbhors had told me they had these cockroaches as well, so I understood that the building walls will cause the creatures to cross over non-stop.  \n\nIts possible that something I did (inserting boric acid into the wall crevices behind the kitchen) actually kills whatever cockroaches try to move over to my place from theirs.  Or its possible that everything I did on my side of the wall killed em all.  \n\nBut they're gone, for me.  \n\nGiven that, I'm happy with the place.  \n\nMy landlord == so so.  I'm renting from the condo owner and she tries to charge $100 per instance of sending someone over.  So because of that I'm avoiding getting the bathroom electrical outlets fixed (seem to have burnt out from my girlfriend's hair dryer) until a few more things get messed up.  \n\nSome oddball neighbors, one of whom I can't stand and always wants to talk to me, but I guess that's going to happen anywhere.  Not that big a deal.  \n\nA few neighbors who leave their dogs on their balcony and would bark nonstop which I could hear from my apartment.  Seems to have stopped lately, or I've stopped noticing.  \n\nSometimes guests will find it annoying that there can be a long guest-line driving in (it is a gated community though you could park across the street and just walk on in with no problem, so its also kinda fake security hah).  \n\nThe one thing to look out for is at least in my apartment the AC unit is horrible.  It works well enough but you have to be fine erring on the side of too much energy use.  Its loud so when I had some phone interviews while job hunting, I'd have to turn it off.  \n\nThat said, its pretty much a 4 star place to live IMO.  Not super fancy, not too bad, especially sans the cockroaches.  But lesson learned, I definitely know to look for creepy stuff like that before I sign an apartment lease!
