PJ's is hands down the best food for the best price for Forum Shop employees. When I first started working in this mall I dreaded having to buy lunch if I didn't have time to pack one. PJ's has a special menu for mall employees, and best of all they deliver for free! They just added some new items to the menu for the summer, but my favorite thing to order is the grilled chicken sandwich with bleu cheese. It's only $7 and you get a bag of chips and a cookie too. I would give them 5-stars but there have been a couple occasions where they forgot to include things in my order, like charging me for bleu cheese but not putting any on my sandwich and forgetting to include the lettuce, tomato, and onions. All around though I'm very satisfied with the food. (Oh and the delivery girl is hot, that's always a plus)
