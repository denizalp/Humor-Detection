My boyfriend and I were wanting salad so we came across panini bread &a grill and decided to give it a try. We love it! So many great options for an unbeatable price. We liked it so much we got some to go orders for lunch and dinner the next day. Definitely our go to spot for yummy salads. Everyone was super friendly and service was also great.
