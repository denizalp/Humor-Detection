I was excited to see that Ale house was going to open up here in Vegas, since I was able to go to one on my vacation in Florida (it seems as they have one in just about every corner in Florida!) The menu is very extensive with an option for everyone. This restaurant has several TV's which makes it great for any sports fanatic to get their fix.(AKA my boyfriend!) This place is famous for it's Zinger, which are chicken tenders with your choice of sauce and flavor from mild to Mt. St. Helen, and also from  plain to loaded with fries, bacon and cheese! The wings are OK... A bit on the greasy side since I like mine with a crunch and not on the slimy soggy side!  \n\nOur server was Richard. Nicely groomed and very polite. Quick to answer and very helpful with the menu. I was craving corn on the Cobb, apparently it's not always on the menu... Richard ran back to the kitchen and within minutes, delivered news that corn on the Cobb was indeed on the menu this night. The corn on the cobb was horrible BTW. The daily specials are a great bargain for the amount of food, my bf always gets the clam chowder which he loves with the oyster crackers. We also ordered the ribs which are always juicy, tender and the meat falls right off the bone.The best part of the meal is the dessert.... Captain Jack's buried treasure! This thing is phenomenal! It's has a little bit of everything I like in a dessert. It's a huge slice of ice cream cake with a crunchy Oreo cookie crust, drizzled with caramel and it comes on a plate coated with hot fudge. \n\nWe were greeted with a smile by the hostess and seated in a very timely manner. Although it was by the door, I was happy.\n\nAll in all, this place is great for large parties, family, girlfriends who can have a cocktail with other girlfriends of boyfriends who are sports fans and I loved that it had crayons and booklets with puzzles for the kids! (let's face it, kids won't sit thru sports!)
