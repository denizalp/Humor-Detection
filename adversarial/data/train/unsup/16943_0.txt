This review is solely based from my experience going to CSN for a summer term in July. My class is at 7am and I go to the library right after to complete my assignment. Around 10 am, there are plenty of computers around. I have yet to have a bad experience with noise. The computer chairs are not the most comfortable chairs as they're just regular wooden chairs, but I can deal. It is an average sized library. It is very well maintained. I would add a star for free printing but the process takes forever because you have to sign in so it balances it out. \n\nOverall, I cannot complain, it's a library. So far in my summer term in July at early morning, there is no noise and plenty of computers. I would compare it to the library at UNLV but that would be an unfair comparison as the Lied Library is much larger and has more funding.
