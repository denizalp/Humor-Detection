Not too shabby. On business travel, I dined alone and due to the larger portion of the regular sides... I chose to have one of the Ruth's Classics (a bundled meal). The person waiting on me looked visibly disappointed that I went this route. Umm... sorry, I guess?\n\nThey asked if I'd like wine with my dinner and being a non drinker, I politely declined. The wait person looked, again, visibly disappointed. Umm... sorry, I guess?\n\nThen an assistant wait staff member came with water choices and asked if I would like still or sparkling... and I politely declined again and looking somewhat disappointed (but less than the main wait person) they said, \"Ok, here's tap water for you\", poured and walked away.\n\nI was done with my meal and they didn't bring out my dessert, but brought me my bill. No biggie, I guess no dessert (I don't need the calories), but the main wait person caught it and brought me my dessert after all, and asked if I would like coffee or a cappuccino with it. I was pushing 9pm and being somewhat sensitive to caffeine at night, I politely declined. Yup, you've guessed it... the wait person was again visibly disappointed. Umm... really sorry, I guess?\n\nIf you want a \"disappointing\" experience go to this Ruth's Chris and do what I did. It's got to be all my fault. All the other Ruth's Chris Steak Houses do table touches by the manager on duty and make their patrons feel welcomed, but not so much here at the Middleton location.\n\nWho knows, if you are a high ticket customer and go for the all out experience with wine, regular menu items, full on desserts, and coffee perhaps you will be able to please the team at this location.\n\nBest wishes and good luck. In all, I probably won't be back only because the \"medium\" steak that was ordered appeared to be boiled and not broiled nor grilled and really didn't do it for me. I will be back to Ruth's, probably just not to this one.\n\nMeh... wa~wa~... yawn... about sums it up.
