Found this salon through Groupon when looking for a decent place to get a blowout - tired of the Primp and Blow chain shops, the style never lasts and the prices keep going up. I was lucky enough to get an appointment with Julie and she is fantastic! Quick, friendly, my blow outs are amazing and last a whole week. She makes sure everything is perfect before I'm out of the chair. I've purchased a package deal with her and look forward to my future appointments. Shop is tucked away off Via de Ventura and the 101. Make sure to ask for Julie!
