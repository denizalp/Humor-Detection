In-N-Out really compliments their name 110%. The work station was straight up hustlin from the cashiers, to the cooks, to the person that calls out everybody's order (keep in mind it's usually only one person... and they are very efficient). Super fast coming in and out of this place, just like how I felt my vacation trip to Vegas was...\n\nAnyways, the burgers aren't bad. I mean what do you expect from a fast food restaurant? To find something as cheap and good as this on the strip is definitely a win-win. Single burgers are a little under 4$, while doubles are a little under 5$.\n\nThere is also a secret option that is not so secret anymore. I heard a lot of people mention \"animal style\" which is some special sauce with fried onions and cheese. You're able to add this with your burger or your fries. To be honest, I didn't think that it was all that. I was thinking gains... try it tho before you stick to the yummy basic order menu
