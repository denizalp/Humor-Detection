My boyfriend's roomie got me (us) on one since telling us about their bulgogi crepes. Initially, I'm like: GROSS! Like how the heck is Korean meat gonna taste with sweet French crepes. \n\nERRRRMAAAAHHHHGAAAAAWDDDD. It's delicious.\n\nWe got there once it opened and ordered a bulgogi crepe, chicken and creamed spinach crepe, cantaloupe ice tea with lychee jelly, and watermelon ice tea with boba.\nNote: they have stamp cards for both the crepes and drinks!\n\nIt took a while for the crepes to be made as the lady (who I think is the owner) made them. Our ice teas did us well while we waited tho; VERY refreshing in this summer heat.\n\nWhen we got our crepes, be careful --- it's steaming hot! We wound up cutting both crepes to let the insides cool down.\n\nWe ate the bulgogi crepe first and was blown away bout how savory it was. The bulgogi, onions, mushrooms, and cheese went SO Ridiculously well together :) It tasted even better with Tabasco on it. (I'm a tabasco fiend.)\nThe chicken and creamed spinach was good, too; but, THAT bulgogi crepe was winnahs!\n\n\nI've come back here twice after this (with 2 separate bunches of friends) and the owner knows us already and we've gotten 2 free crepes and ice teas already from that stamp card.\n\n\n***note: the crepes REALLY take a long time to make so, I recommend calling in the order***
