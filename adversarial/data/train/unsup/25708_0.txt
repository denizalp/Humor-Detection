Fish tacos done well, served in the sun, mist machines blowing - almost guaranteed perfection (ok, mist machines might be one of the most egregious, environmentally-unaware slights that Vegas bring us - one of the many - but when it's 100, it sure does feel like a good idea at the time)\n\nSo, misty seats, tacos, almost perfection - yeah, Border Grill delivers.  But in its delivery, a few stumbles - or at least lapses.  Service was very friendly and cheerful, but promises of 'chips n salsa on its way', 'more water', 'more iced tea', or 'your check' were either followed by a lengthy delay or just never happened. Usually forgiveable when a place is slammed, but this place was near dead and amply staffed, so there was nothing more we could attribute to it other than flakiness.\n\nBut damn those grilled fish tacos made it all worth it
