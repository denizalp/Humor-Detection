My first visit was yesterday and the food was amazing. I am a pretentious food eater and I absolutely loved what I had. Garlic knots, amazing, mixed green salad with salmon, amazing. Pizza, AMAZING. I've been in Vegas for a year and this is the best pizza I've had. Their dough is on point. Service is great and the atmosphere is awesome. Check this place out! \n\nPS. Everything on the menu all day on Wednesday is HALF off. Including alcohol! Half off!
