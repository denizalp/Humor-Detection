Here's why the El Cortez is the coolest dive in Vegas:\n\n- The real coins in the slots are kind of fun.  Clink clink clink!\n- Blackjack here pays 3 to 2 instead of 6 to 5.  Most of the big strip casinos have switched to 6 to 5, to maximize their corporate profits.  Not here.\n- Not as crowded as the big strip casinos so you will never wait in a one hour line to check in or out, or for anything else.  \n- Easy access to the other downtown casinos, so you can stay here and gamble at the more luxurious Golden Nugget quite easily.\n- Lots of oldtimers with more interesting stories than the twenty something boneheads on the strip who think it's SO COOL to drop $300 on their very own VIP table at a jerkoff nightclub where they can sit and whine about how long it takes to get an overpriced cocktail.\n- If it's your thing, there's plenty of working girls on nights Thursday through the weekend.  Very easy to spot.  Find a slot machine in a corner with a view of the main room and just keep your eyes open for 20 minutes.  But for god sakes man use a condom even for just a BJ.\n- Probly worth a visit just for the ancient sign which is the same one Bugsy Siegel had installed when he owned the place in the 40s.  A different Vegas then.  Your view of all the other casinos will be altered by a visit here.  Oh, and try to go at night, it's much better then.
