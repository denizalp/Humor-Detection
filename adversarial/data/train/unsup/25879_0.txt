We went to Border Grill on our first night in Vegas because it was located in our Hotel, however, upon our arrival my excitement from looking at the menu quickly diminished. It took several minutes to get water, which was okay because it was a busy Saturday night but once we finished our water we never got refills despite asking our waiter several times for more water.  \n\nThe carne asada quesadilla was okay, the meat was delicious and tender but the Tortilla was greasy. We only had one small basket of chips, our waiter did not even offer us more chips. \n\nBefore we ordered, we stated we would need two separate checks because 5 out of the 7 people I was with needed to expense their meal together but when we received out checks 3 people were together and everyone else had separate checks. It was apparent our waiter either forgot or was not listening to us. \n\nI gave 3 stars primarily for the Raspberry chipotle Margarita, it was delicious.
