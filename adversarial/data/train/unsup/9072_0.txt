Came all the way from Las Vegas and was planning on meeting a friend. I called the night before to be sure that they had ORGANIC JUICE as I cannot have anything else. The young lady who answered the phone said yes. I called again in the morning to be sure because the first person sounded hesitant and the lady on the phone stated they do not even sell juices. My plans had to be changed last minute and had to drive 1.5 hours to whole foods to meet a friend for juice. This was very unprofessional. They had no information about their menu. Also, the word juiced is in their name.... they should change that to only smoothie bar and train their employees better.
