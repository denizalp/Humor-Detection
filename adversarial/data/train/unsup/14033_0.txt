We came in on a whim... Opting for something semi healthy, after a night of studying. \n\nIt's a very casual place... Dine in or take out. We chose to take out. We walked up to counter and chose our rolls. I opted for th vegan burrito... No vegan \"meat\" just extra veggies. The also have the \"veggie\" option. I love this place for even catering to the vegan weirdos, like me, of the world. They were out of the vegan chipotle sauce... I just had them add an eclectic mix of three other really great vegan sauces... Two were fairly sweet... And with the added Jalepenos to my burrito... It was quite the combo. The concept it pretty amazing.... I would\nCome back and grab it again; I would just need to be in the mood for it. \n\nThe other burrito we ordered, but I couldn't eat... Was the angry tuna. It's not vegan... And from what I was told... Rather underwhelming. My friend definitely preferred my vegan burrito. \n\nBoth of us really like some crunch... And the taro chips are pretty freaking good. They are made in house... And I would totally consider having some of them crumbled into my next burrito. We also had a little side edamame, fair sized portion for the price! Our total bill came out to just over 20 dollars... Two burritos... Chips... Edamame... And a fountain ice tea. Definitely a good deal... And definitely a spot worth checking out:)
