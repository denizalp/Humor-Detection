I haven't been to Jamaica, but I have been to much of the Caribbean and hail from NYC, so I do have an appreciation for authentic Caribbean food, and this place has got it!  Spicy dishes are quite spicy (got my nose running) and sweet ones are just that.  The lady taking my order is very nice.  They play a great selection of reggae music.  In a desert of mediocre food, Caribbean Palm is an oasis.
