I don't know what else taste good over there. I was told that what I had was the only thing good in the store. \nI had this cupcake looking thing that tastes more like a molten chocolate cake. It was divine to say the least.\nThere is so much delicious chocolate in it, it tastes like cake and melts like chocolate. It's like eating brownie without the chewiness...a thick and moist cupcake without the wet texture. It's like the wetness and the richness has a delay release inside your mouth. It's timed to perfection.\nUnfortunately, I had it in a wedding, I have no idea what the actual name is for this interesting puppy.
