The happy hour time and menu selections are good. The chips and salsa were good but nothing to rave about. I had theor mini crabcakes and steak flatbreads that were really tasty. However, I cant give the place more stars b\/c the margaritas were terrible. We ordered 6 different margaritas but finished only 2. They were very syruppy and sweet. Ill probably go back to try their dinner menu but not their drinks
