I was in need a of a massage and what better place to have one from a spa and salon from the Mirage.\nI called from my room to set-up my appointment and was glad that I did not have to wait a long time for a reservation. I showed up 20 minutes early as they instructed. I checked in and went in with Mary whom showed me around and got me into my locker to get into my robe. While I waited I used their clean shower and sat down to drink my peach green tea in the peaceful sitting area.\nMary took me to the room to get my massage by Mike. Mike worked wonders on my shoulders and my other troubled stress areas. Best 50 minutes of heaven. Mike was professional and quiet.\n\nI know spa's in a hotel are going to be overpriced and I felt that this time around, it sure was way up there in price. For a 50 minute massage (and access to the sauna, steam room, jacuzzi's) you are looking at $170 and they also included the gratuity that came out to $32. You make the math.
