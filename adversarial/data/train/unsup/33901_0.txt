I just had my master bath completed with new tile and floor in the shower along with new granite countertop plus painting of existing cabinets-it looks amazing! Dion is on top of every aspect of the job. He made sure I liked everything we discussed prior to doing it and afterwards. I also had some last minute changes I wanted to make and he was willing to make the changes happen for me. Would highly recommend D&D for your next project!
