This used to be our late night Chinese spot, and by late night, I mean after Noodle Exchange across the hallway closes because the Exchange is a tastier experience. However, we stopped going because the food started to make our bellies feel a little unhappy. We could never identify why exactly, but we decided to relocate our late night Chinese adventures to Spring Mountain Road. However, last night, we happened to be booking up Flamingo and decided to give it another chance because for several months straight I had a serious Wrinkled Green Bean addiction, and I wanted to go back for another round.\n\nI knew immediately I would be ordering the Wrinkled Green Beans with some extra wrinkles, and I also ordered some basic chicken soft noodles. The service was a little slow, but friendly. Our waiter smiled when I told him I liked them \"really wrinkly.\" My husband ordered a noodle soup.\n\nThe green beans had a nice flavor, but they were pretty greasy and some of the magic flavor (described as a Chinese tarragon) was missing. The noodles were brown from soy sauce, which isn't my preference. Plus, the noodles lacked the amount of veggies that you often get in a noodle dish. A few slivers of cabbage, some hidden bean sprouts, but no carrots. And, the noodles were a bit chewy. The noodles were no comparison to the same dish at Noodle Exchange just across the way. Everything just seemed a tad too heavy, and my husband wasn't in love with his soup. He said, \"It wasn't bad.\"\n\nI may be willing to go back for dim sum, as I have yet to try that, but for other times, I am afraid last night reminded me why we had stopped visiting.
