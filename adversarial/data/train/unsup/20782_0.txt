Nestled close to downtown, this place is a hidden gem in Mesa and definitely worth discovering! Although small inside & a slightly limited menu, containing empanadas savory and sweet (some gluten free, wheat, and vegetarian choices) a few appetizers, platters, a couple sides, soup and salads, Republica Empanada was big on flavor! Beverages consist of RC products on tap, bottles of fully loaded Pepsi, Coke, Jarritos in several fruity flavors, canned soda, lemonade and tea. I ordered the Greek empanada filled with saut√©ed spinach, creamy feta, and kalamata olive, thanks to the suggestion of our awesome server Heidi, and that day's special, the Jalapeno popper empanada with cream cheese, ham, and roasted jalapenos, both melt in your mouth savory perfection! Oh and the jalapeno cilantro ranch is amazing, so great I could put it on both and could have finished it with a spoon! My daughter had the buffalo chicken which she wanted me to say that it was soooo good and from the one bite she was sweet enough to share I agree, it was soooo good! Only wished the empanadas were bigger but for my waistline's sake glad they're not because I want to try them all! Dinner isn't complete without dessert, so we ordered \"the King\" an empanada stuffed with peanut butter & banana. Little Miss loved it and by the last bite was saying thank you, thank you very much! (LL) I had melt in your mouth sweet perfection, fig and caramel empanada made with fig, mozzarella cheese, & South American dulce de leche, a definite must try! Great food, prices and service will definitely keep me coming back for more!
