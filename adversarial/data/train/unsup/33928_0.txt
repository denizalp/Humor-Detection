Chilli's is always a tasty spot to be, this location specifically was not too bad.  We walked in and sat at the bar, I'd say at least two employees seen us and no one said anything.  Which is cool, I understand that restaurants get busy and all but some type of acknowledgement would have been nice.  Other than that, the taco were very good and hit the spot before an event I had to attend.
