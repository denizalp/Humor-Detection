On a calm, quite Friday night, I decided to head to Higher Ground to escape from \"life\". I didn't want to socalize with anyone this night but still wanted to be out in public with a good book and an upbeat vibe...and I found it at Higher Ground! I grabbed a nice warm americano, a delcious cookie, a seat by the window, and got knee deep in a good book. The place was about 80% full and exactly what I needed that night. \n\nI read that this place does speciality themed nights such as vegan and vegetarian dinners, plus they have live music. Both of these ideas sound very interesting to me so I can't wait to try them out!\n\nThere is literally nothing to complain about at Higher Ground. It's like a sancturary of peace! Actually ok, only one complaint...the bathroom was a tad... icky... but I looked past it!
