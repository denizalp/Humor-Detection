Kona Grill in Boca Park, Summerlin\n\nWhat a great place for happy hour! Its delicious dishes and drinks, especially its friendly and efficient staff make customers happy and keep them coming back; no wonder it is always crowded with repeat customers!\n\nKona Grill has a variety of great drinks, including Sake Bomber! Its sushi and calamari dishes, among others are absolutely delicious! If you like sushi for happy hour, Kona's the place to go. Its patio is beautiful and spacious, wrapping around the building, quite romantic and inviting with the torch lamps on in cool evenings! The sushi bar is charming and relaxing with its two large gorgeous aquaria on each side of the TV.\n\nOK, here's my honest confession! Kona Grill is located only a few store spaces away from Gordon Biersch Brewery. Both establishments are hopping at happy hours - and for a good reason. Gordon Biersch has its famous German Brews and a nice bar menu, too. I am actually a loyal customer of both Kona Grill and Gordon Biersch for happy hours. Each establishment has its own unique charm which will keep you coming back! I usually take turns going to both. My taste is obviously not at all unique, as I frequently see familiar faces showing up in both places.\n\nNote: \n- Parking is at a premium in front of Kona Grill and Gordon Biersch. But, one can always find a parking space in the upper lot above the underground parking, a distance shorter than a football field away. Walking a little before and after the happy hours is pretty good for digestions anyway. There's also valet parking closed by the establishments. By the way, if you drive after your happy hour on Alta by Sun Coast, beware of the Metro Cop on motobikes - the speed limit is 35mph on Alta.\n\nPeterskis\nVegas, 12\/18\/11\n--
