This is one of the best places to get sit down Chinese food in the Madison area! I have so many fantastic memories of dining here throughout the years. My heart just warms up and my stomach start growling when someone mentions Imperial Garden. \n\nImperial Garden has a large dining hall, yet when you are seated you feel extremely cozy. The menu is giant in the sense that is very extensive and very big literally. Thankfully, they divided the menu into different sections like beef, chicken, vegetarian, and lunch! \n\nThe only downfall is that they don't do delivery, but they do pick up!\n\nThe garlic green beans are spectacular, and every time I think of them my mouth waters. All the fried rices are phenomenal. \n\nIn addition to the delicious foods, the service is amazing and attentive. They are prompt, and your water glass will hardly ever be empty! When you are seated, they get to you in a timely matter and will get you started with anything you want! \n\nWith those things, there is a reason why I've been dining here for numerous years.
