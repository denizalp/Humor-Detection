We were on our way to the Cosmo Pool for Lorde and wanted a quick small meal, so we decided to give their happy hour a try.\n\nI arrived first before my friends, and when I approached the hostess stand, I was \"greeted\" by a very bitchy hostess. I told her there were two more people coming, and we were there for happy hour, so she leads me to the bar area and gives me one menu (not even the happy hour menu) and promptly leaves. I sat for a good 10 minutes before someone even came over (the place was dead) my friends arrive and someone finally makes it around. We place our orders, I went with Salmon Tartare and Steamed Broccoli with Calamansi Soy. The salmon was so salty, it wasn't edible, I ended up eating the taro chips it came with and the broccoli was all dried out. For 2 items and 2 drinks, my bill (with tip) was $40. Sorry Social House, this is \"not so happy hour\". Won't be coming back.
