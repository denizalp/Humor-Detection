I should've listened to the reviews about the bad service and avoided this place all together. My boyfriend and I walked in to no one standing at the hostess stand except for a miserable waitress who just rolled her eyes when my boyfriend said hello to her. We proceeded to the bar only to be disappointed once again by a bartender who didn't have time to properly greet or acknowledge us. Long story short we decided this place was not worth our time or money and left. It's too bad because it seemed like this place had potential.
