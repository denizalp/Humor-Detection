Well, I haven't experienced better because it's the only time I have gone wedding dress shopping, but I am thankful that I was not expecting a fairytale type day dress shopping here at David's. I found a few options online and made an appointment to come in to try some on. I was not greeted when I entered the store. Finally after flagging someone down I waited another 5 mins for my coordinator to meet me. The wifi was so bad that I could not pull up the dresses I had bookmarked on my phone. With the hep of my coordinator I was able to try on about 6 dresses and I was able to say yes to the dress. In the dressing room area there was a groom-to-be with the rest of the bridal party\/family and it was very awkward as the curtains are not very heavy and don't make a complete seal so it would have been very easy for him to get a peek of all the other ladies getting changing, plus just having his voice and presence a few feet away from me was very strange. Please wait out in the lobby, right?\nI found the dress I wanted, but it wasn't in my size and they said that it was discontinued but they could try and call other stores for my size 4,but they would have to wait 5 days until they could start the search. I was very confused by all this and just left the store. \nI went home, looked up the dress on David's Bridal website, found my size, got a 40$ discount and the dress was delivered in less than a week. \nI made another appointment to have it fitted and a month later it was ready. When I went to go try it on there was no one to help me zip it up and the seamstress didn't come examine the work or ask if I was satisfied. \nIf you are ok with a do it yourself kind of experience and you don't expect to feel pampered then give DB a try- otherwise keep looking.
