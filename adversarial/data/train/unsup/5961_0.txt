A great, family owned Italian bistro with friendly service and incredible home made food at very reasonable prices.\n\nThe bruschetta is excellent and a refreshing start to the meal.  Loaded with fresh vine ripened tomatoes, EVOO, and a touch of sea salt on perfectly toasted bread.  Perfect start.\n\nAny pasta is incredible.  Pastas are always perfectly cooked and finished (the pasta is tossed with the sauce over heat not just poured over).  The veal bolognese is a standout (animal lovers please don't hate me).  A rich tomato sauce, velvety veal, hint of garlic, finished with a drizzle of EVOO and perfectly cooked pasta is so hard to pass up.\n\nPrices are very low.  Expect to pay less than $20 per person.\n\nWell worth the try.
