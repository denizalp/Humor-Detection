This location is not as good as the others however I enjoy their ribs too much to give a poor review. I find their ribs fall off the bone much easier than anywhere else and the sauce is quality. I also like the seasoning on the fries although it is a bit salty and the rice is okay. Service was slow on a non-busy weeknight. Would go again but prefer other locations.
