Big Daddy's is one of the first oyster bars I've been to in Toronto. For $26 or $36, you can get a really great 3 course meal. I had the mussels for appetizer, some sort of seafood pasta for the entree and a tart for dessert. We also ordered oysters to share. The chowder also looked pretty good too. I think I would try that next time I'm there. \n\nIt's not too fancy and the ambiance is casual. There is a bar and a dining room. During the summer, they also have a small patio outside. For seafood in Toronto, Big Daddy's is a great deal.
