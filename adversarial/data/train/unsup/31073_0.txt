This place has a pool with a clear floor. AMAZING. You can see straight down to the... parking entrance. Hilarious. The pool is pretty tiny - entirely for relaxing, no exercise here. \n\nThe usual Westin bed, Westin service (even for we F1 fans, not staff) were excellent.    Mandatory valet parking with excellently quick service and attentive desk staff. Pristine bathrooms and arranged essentials.
