URGH SO GOOD. SOOOO GOOD.\n\nI was first introduced to these cookies by a co-worker (who I still remember very fondly to this day). They are the most addicting things ever!!! Super soft and gooey, melt in your mouth, sweet pieces of delight that will send you to heaven with every bite. I am drooling just thinking of them. Ahhhhh....\n\nOn a more coherent note, the cookies are small so you can sample a greater variety in one sitting. And there is quite a bit of variety in the flavors they have! All delicious, of course. Packaging looks great as well - so if you decide to bring them into the office, you can take the honor of being the next most treasured colleague of the year. xD
