This is a College for students to study hairstyling, manicure, pedicure and massage, plus as a student you can practise on walk in clients as well as on Marvel diehards.  My mother is one of them and she is in fact the person who first introduced me to this salon, she said it was a convenient and affordable place to get a haircut.  \n\nI found the staff to be noticeably excited about me as a client, perhaps it was the prospect of having a new head to practise on.  But as inexpensive as it is to get services there, be prepared for a very long session.  You are being cut by a student and audited by the teachers walking through their student's haircut on you.  Also be prepared for not getting what you initially wanted in the first place, the idea is there but it is always short in manifestation.  Remember the students are still learning.\n\nMy mother was convincing me that MC was the be all and end all, but I couldn't help be distracted by the new hair coloring she had just received there.  Is that actually a color? I thought to myself, and did she really go out in public with that.\n\nIf you don't mind all the attention, want to pay next to nothing and like surprises then by all means, go there.  If what you want is a good quality haircut and don't mind paying 30 dollars, go to Shear Synergy Salon at the Dragon City Mall instead, I assure you, you will get your moneys worth and more.
