I probably would have never gone here if it weren't for the ladies that happened to come to my office offering a special where students do the treatments.  Laser hair removal can be expensive and even though I've already had 12 treatments with great results, a girl still needs some upkeep.  So if I can find a deal I take it.\n\nI've been here twice now.  Each visit I found all the girls at the front desk to be super sweet.  My first visit was with just the tech and myself.  I can't remember her name, but she was very nice and professional.  The second visit was myself, an instructor whose name I also can't remember and three students.  All of them were very nice and personable.  The instructor made sure I was comfortable throughout the time I was there.  I realize some people may be put off with the fact that its students doing the service or that they are there with people gawking at them, but for me it was totally fine.  The instructor constantly checked to make sure I was comfortable and okay.  I don't think I could have had a better experience.  The instructor also did a good job of taking my mind off things by making casual conversation and one of the students was very engaging as well.  All three students had a go at me so to speak and the instructor was right there to shadow them the whole time.\n\nI can't speak for any other treatments besides the laser hair removal, but based off my experience so far I'd be willing to try some of their other services.  I will definitely be back and would recommend.
