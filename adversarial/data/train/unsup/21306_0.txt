Doors at 7:00, show whenever Cher feels like showing up. 8:00? Nope. 8:10? Nope. 8:20? Nope. 8:30? Nope. Starting more than 30 minutes late is just disrespectful to your audience. \n\nI'm going to cut Cher some slack since she is 71, but regardless, if you are going to charge $150-500 per ticket your audience still expects a great performance. As many other reviewers mentioned, Cher looks incredible for her age. Unfortunately her voice has has not kept up with her looks which is obvious during the concert. She sings almost quietly with the backup singers and music drowning her out. \n\nIt felt like most of the show was her changing outfits, stage sets and showing videos of her career. I almost found myself bored at times which is disappointing. Too many other options in town to recommend.
