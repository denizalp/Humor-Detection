I love Vintner Grill.  I have been there many times, and always had great food and great service.  I love the look of the place, the clientele, the seating, and the pear martini is the best.  I am going there again next Friday for lunch and I can't wait.  I must admit I have only been there one time for dinner, and the other times have been lunch, but it doesn't matter.  In my experience, the food, service and ambiance are first rate!
