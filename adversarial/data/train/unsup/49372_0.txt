Went to the Yellow Griffin for lunch on Sunday. We were one of the first customers there that day and it wasn't busy, so our server was very attentive.\n\nI ordered the beef hickory stick (hickory smoked bbq sauce, caramelized onions, and melted mozzarella and cheddar) with onion rings for the side. I'm usually very picky when it comes to burgers, because I can make pretty good burgers at home, but this one was really good. The beef patty was pretty big and taste really good. The onion rings are really big too, they have good batter for it as well; they're kind of like A&W's onion ring's batter, except better.\n\nMy friend ordered the Big Jerk (Jerk seasoning, fried plantain, sour cream, and a couple of roasted Jalapeno peppers) with salad for the side. He said he enjoyed it and it wasn't too spicy (although they looked spicy to me and he really likes spicy food). The salad looks standard...\n\nMy other friend ordered the Ploughman's burger (sliced pickles, melted white cheddar, tomato, balsamic onions). She ordered the sweet potato fries for the side. I tried the sweet potato and it was good. The burger looked messy to eat.\n\nWe didn't ordered any alcoholic bevies, because we were all still pretty much hungover from the night before.\n\nFor the price that you're paying, the quality of food and service are really good. I would totally recommend this place. Would love to come back at night when the pub is more alive.
