If this establishment were located anywhere else it would die the death it so much deserves.  We waited for over an hour to be seated only to be served the worse bar food we have ever encountered, it's hard to screw up chicken wings but mcfaddens did a fine job in doing so. Not only was the food bad but we were offered plastic dinner ware because they ran out of the metal forks and knives.\nThere are to many other choices in the area to try,stay away from this place at all cost you'll be glad you did.
