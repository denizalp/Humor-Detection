I'm thoroughly annoyed.  I signed up for one of their timeshare presentations to stay a couple nights at the Luxor (where the room was disgusting by the way), and I don't exactly know why I did that because I get free rooms in Vegas all the time.\n\nAnyway, I wasted five hours of my time on the presentation that they put you through where they harass you to purchase from them.  That was fine - I was holding up my end of the deal.  Needless to say, I didn't buy.  Smartest decision I've ever made.\n\nBUT, these people are liars and cheats.  They charged me $124 to hold the reservation back in June, and lo and behold weeks after I was there, they have not refunded me.  Today, the guest services at the Grandview hung up on me twice, transferred me a total of seven times and FINALLY after all that gave me their customer service number.  Why couldn't they have given it to me the first time?\n\nBetter question - WHY DIDN'T YOU REFUND MY MONEY?\n\nThe Grandview 'concierge' gave me some speech about how they're open 24\/7 to help their guests... but oh yeah, they can't help me.\n\nTheir \"customer service\" department is open M-F for a total of 6.5 hours.  Are you serious??  What kind of legitimate business is not open 8 hours a day???\n\n930a-1230p and 130pm-5pm - ridiculous.  So basically, if you want any kind of service, look elsewhere.  They're there 24\/7 if you want to give them money.  If you need any kind of help, forget it.\n\nAnd their location is way off the strip.  Waste of money.\n\nWhat a joke.  I'll be complaining to the better business bureau after giving them a piece of my mind tomorrow.  What a bunch of scam artists.
