My personal pledge to reserve Vegas buffet outings for out of town guests only went out the door this past Friday as the Husband and I \nchecked out Green Valley Ranch Casino's Feast Buffet.\n\nFriday and Saturday nights are Surf and Turf nights from 3:30 pm to 10 pm, which ultimately means AYCE crab legs and whole roasted pigs.  It's normally $21.99\/pp or $19.99\/pp with a Stations Boarding Pass.  But for the month of November, an additional $3 is discounted - making dinner $16.99\/pp!  (And with my coupon in the mail for BOGO free buffet - that meant $16.99 for two people!  What a deal!)\n\nThe line was already long when we approached the restaurant a bit after 4 pm.  It didn't take too long for the line to get moving though.  \n\nThere were hoardes of people in line for the crab - specifically the steamed crab legs.  But then there was this other line - you can have them stir-fry your crab legs however you'd like.  Ultimately, you grab your crab legs (or other food items), and then tell them what sauce you like and how spicy.  You can skip the wait and get cold crab legs and it's all the same.  This is what everyone swears by and the reason the Feast Buffet at GVR does well!  \n\nOther unique items at this buffet worth mentioning were the clams on the half shell, something I couldn't indulge in sadly enough.  \n\nBut they do have milkshakes to order, which I was more than happy to help myself to! \n\nOther useful buffet info:\n\nBreakfast:\nMonday - Friday: 8am - 11am\n$7.99 per person or $6.99 with Boarding Pass Card\n\nBrunch:\nSaturday - Sunday: 8am - 3:30pm\n$20.99 per person or $18.99 with Boarding Pass Card\nAYCE crab legs\n\nLunch:\nMonday - Friday: 11am - 2:30pm\n$10.99 per person or $9.99 with Boarding Pass Card\n\nDinner:\nSunday - Thursday: 3:30pm - 10pm\n$20.99 per person or $18.99 with Boarding Pass Card\nAYCE crab legs
