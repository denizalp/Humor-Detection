Wow what a let down. For a day of fun, as Las Vegas locals, we valet'd at Paris and walked over to Pink's - there was no line and nobody eating at all. I ordered a veggie dog (maybe that was my mistake) and chili fries. The fries were the best part of the meal - I hate, I mean I hate gray, boiled looking hot dogs -- gosh I wish it was grilled I guess I should've asked but being from L.A. this place is suppose to be the best so I figured I'd leave it all in their hands....it was a let down and I won't be going back.
