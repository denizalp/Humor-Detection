Be smart and Dont let those fake positive reviews from ghost accts fooled you.   American West have taken down many of my neighbors reviews and put up FAKE positive reviews.  Only read the ones posted by real yelper who actually have friends on Yelp. \n\n\nAmerican West took our deposit PLUS upgrades because stupid DAVID MEEKS showed me the wrong price sheet at the model home.  But he was sneaky enough to email my husband the wrong contact with $42000 more.  We lost almost $10000 because of it.  American West wont talk to us, talk our phone calls, or return our emails.  Except Blaming us for leaving HONEST reviews and taking down all my neighbors reviews.  We have 2 American West home already, so we have a lot of neighbors.   \n\nDon't think they will respond when you have problems with your home either.  You are pretty much on your own as soon as you give them the money.   I have purchased 20 houses in my life and this is the scariest and most disgusting experience.  We walked with the money because we can't imagine to own a home from American West any more.
