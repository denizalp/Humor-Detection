I remember drunkenly looking at the first sandwich I got from here, and telling my friend, \"hey dude, I think I have your sandwich...I didn't order fries with mine\".\n\n\"Nah man, they all come with fries\".\n\nThat fact exemplifies the absurdly delicious sandwiches they serve.  Cheesesteak, chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, bacon...it's all there.  I've got to say, though, that they may win the prize for best drunk-ass food on campus.  It is a bit more expensive than other options, and you'd probably need a heart transplant if you went here twice in one weekend (er...which is what I just did...), but it's undeniable drunk bliss.\n\nMy only real complaint is that it also takes a while to get the food out.  Kind of makes sense when you realize all the different components they need to fry to make any of their sandwiches, but the long wait is made more painful when you're wasted and just want something to eat.
