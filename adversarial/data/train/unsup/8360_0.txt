As a self-proclaimed yoga noob (Like, I did some of the free classes at hart house in undergrad) I've always been interested in yoga, but way too shy to attend classes in a fancy studio - everyone always seems so fit and well dressed (lol Like, I don't own yoga pants! Do i have to buy a pair in order to join the club?)\n\nAfter trying a few classes around the city, I've finally settled on union yoga, a non-pretentious, beautifully decorated, yoga space. Everyone is so welcoming. it's right there on the website that the place is for everyone, yoga noobs and experienced practitioners alike and it's totally accurate in my experience. The teachers are great and know how to push you to your limit, while encouraging you to breathe and work at your own pace. And nobody cares that I wear pants made for running to yoga. \n\nUm, they have really great massage therapy options too. :)
