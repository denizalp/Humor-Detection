This place is a factory. Not a nice modern factory that makes iPhones, more like s seedy factory you might find in the back streets of India employing children working in sub-human conditions. \n\nI called to make an appointment and she started a spiel about having a great deal on braces. No thanks, not interested in braces. But it's a great deal. NO! Do you have anyone in your household who might be interested in braces? FFS! No! I just was to make an appointment!\n\nShe then takes all my information and asks if it's ok to call and remind me about my appointment. I say no, do not call me to remind me, I'm quite capable of making it to a dentist appointment. Well guess who receives not one, but three reminder phone calls? Yep, that would be me. \n\nI really want to work with professionals who listen to my problems and treat me with dignity and respect. None of that here.
