I recommend this place based on the quality of the food and service. 1455 offers juicy burgers, friendly service and an industrial interior design. \nThe ingredients are definitely high quality. I had a burger, my wife had a tri-tip. We were both pleased. Most the seating is made up of 4-seater booths (in the restaurant section and pub tables in the bar section. We sat at the booths. 1455 has televisions displaying sports but the booths, walls are high and the tvs are situated so that you really need to sit near the bar to comfortably see them any way. There was an outdoor section that overlooked the parking-lot. The prices for some of the food, like our parmesan fries, were a little high for the quantity provided.\nThe wait, for their grand opening, was worth it but I probably won't be able to frequent this place as often (based on the price.) This will be more of a weekend restaurant than a cheaper weekday restaurant. \n\n****Update****\nI have not, yet, been back for another try but I did just get a tip from another yelper.\n\n\"They now have a lunch menu that will beat any other prices as well! Check out their Facebook page for the menu. I'm sure you will be pleased with the prices and the food.\"\n\nSo I will check out their lunch menu and see what we see.
