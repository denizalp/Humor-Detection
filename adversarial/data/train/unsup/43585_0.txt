When I first started taking my dog to the Pet Salon a year ago, I loved it and they did great work. Over the past year I think the quality of my dog's haircuts has declined slightly, but my dog is very small and scares easily, and she loves going to the Pet Salon so I continue to stick with them. The quality of their work is a 3 star, but they make my dog feel comfortable, which is worth much more to me.
