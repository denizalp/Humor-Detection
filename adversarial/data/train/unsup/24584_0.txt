Why cant you give zero stars??? Worst place ever! They had an all you can drink margharita special, which got us in the door. What we learned is that they made them absurdly salty so that people cant drink more than 1, maybe 2, with lots of water. We asked for them to be less salty but thwy said they are \"premade\". \nSince im a stubborn guy, I insisted in drinking them. Once id had 5 they said that was the max! I told them that they advertize \"all you can drink\". Their response was that 5 is enough and no one drinka that many. Not surprising given the fact that they sabotage them.with ridiculous amounts of salt.\nThis place is just a scam. In a city with so many great restaurants and bars, this one should be avoided. Or better yet, closed down for good.
