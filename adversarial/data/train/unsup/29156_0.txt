Took the family, from Seattle, to the Mac King Show on April 2.  Their were 12 of us and we all laughed our heads off!   My son and daughter in law were on stage and really saw the magic up close.  My son just retired from the Army,and his friend will retire in a few years. Both of them needed a good clean family outing.  They especially liked the meet and greet. The younger kids said he doesn't act like a famous person, and I asked why and they said, because he talked to us.  Mac takes time to meet and greet everybody and makes everybody laugh and feel good!   We will be back!  Best Family outing in Vegas!
