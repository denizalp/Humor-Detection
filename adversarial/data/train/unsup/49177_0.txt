If you love meatballs, you have to try this restaurant. It is one of the best restaurants in PGH & certainly downtown.\n\nYou choose your meat, sauce & how you want to eat your meatballs, e.g. Panini, in a bowl, a slider, etc. the beef and chorizo specialty were the best. I've loved the pesto and red sauce the best. \n\nThe tomato risotto is absolutely delicious. It melts in your mouth and a side is only $5. It pairs perfectly with the meatballs with red sauce.\n\nWe also love the poutine appetizer with tater tots & gravy. Not authentic, but to die for.
