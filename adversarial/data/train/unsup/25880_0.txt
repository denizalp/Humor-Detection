First time in for dinner tonight w\/ the fam.  My husband and I ordered the octopus seafood cocktail and the shrimp fajitas for two.  The seafood cocktail sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce w\/ a weird red oily sauce on top, not really feeling it.  The shrimp fajitas were ok but had too much of a spicy tomato based sauce going on, thank goodness for the side of guacamole to help mask the flavor.  The worst was the rice and beans that come w\/ the fajitas, just terrible.  The rice literally tasted like instant rice, like Spanish Rice-a-Roni or Knorr.  The rice was too dry and the flavor just wasn't there for the rice or the beans.  My son ordered the cheeseburger on the kid's menu and part of his bun came out really hard, kinda like when you try & microwave a frozen piece of bread for too long.  I know its a Mexican restaurant so I should of known better than to order him a cheeseburger but he's 4 and was dead set on getting a burger.  Our bill was just under $80 (including drinks & tip).  Service was good but the food was a no go for us to visit again.
