**Casino Only**\n\nCame to Encore from Wynn just to see it. Never stayed at Encore but have been to one of their nightclubs one night too.\n\nThe walk way between the two casinos is very nice.\n\nIt is very a very pretty & classy casino\/Hotel.\n\nWhen playing in the casino you will get free drinks, I have to say the drinks are good here they do not use cheap liquor in your drinks, They are very good.\n\nDid not have any luck while playing here compared to playing at Wynn. They are not as busy here as Wynn's.\n\nI love walking into the hotels and casinos to see the theme of each place.\n\nThis place was decorated very nice.. I would love to come back and stay sometime.
