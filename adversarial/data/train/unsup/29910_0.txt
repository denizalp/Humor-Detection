Let me start by saying that if you are someone who, like me, has a fear of being under anesthesia it's likely that nothing a review says will make that fear subside.  \n\nWhat I can do is tell you how professional, thorough, and caring Dr. Bond and his staff are at South Park oral surgery for people who are in fearful and anxious situations. I went in for a very basic procedure: a wisdom tooth extraction; the tooth had begun to cause pain.  Not a big deal at all right?  I was sent to their office by my dentist (Dr. Linch at Solace) specifically because of Dr. Bond's bedside manner.  Both Dr. Linch and her wonderful hygienist Angela told me that Dr. Bond was the right person to visit because he could put me at ease, talk me through the procedure, and explain how very straightforward and simple everything will be. They were right! Now I can't say that the night before and even the morning of I wasn't a bag of nerves - but that's my problem not theirs!  \n\nDr. Bond's staff and Dr. Bond explained very patiently that patients who have a fear of anesthesia is commonplace.  Dr. Bond asked what I was afraid would occur; he does take time to figure things out with the people he works with.  They offer multiple forms of anesthesia so that the patient has various options for their own experience. My discussions with Dr. Bond and staff helped me to choose the right avenue for my own experience for a very simple procedure, but one I knew shouldn't be handled while I personally was awake, and I am extremely pleased. I'm writing this review after three hours after returning home. I know that the coming days will tell the true story of swelling, pain, etc. At four hours and two ibuprofen - zero swelling and zero pain. Also, I felt none of the silliness you often hear about when coming out of general anesthesia. \n\nTo those who are most concerned with anxiety or fear, please give Dr. Bond and his team a chance to work with you and you may be a bit more at ease than you expected.
