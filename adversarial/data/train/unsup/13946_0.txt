I had a super lackluster experience with my family here in March 2016 but since this is my nearest Friday's, I relented and decided to give the place another try before heading to the movies at the Orleans. Bad idea : the same female bartender with red hair was there with her strange, rude attitude. \n\nDespite seeing her, I and my boyfriend sit at the bar and chat while waiting for the bartender to stop staring at her cellphone. Then she proceeded to polish things behind the bar despite our attempts to get her attention. 15 minutes later she walks over to us after I finally get her to look up and asks for my ID immediately before greeting us or introducing us. \n\nAs someone who has worked in restaurants in NYC since the age of 16, I was stunned. I gave her my ID, then my order, which she makes a face at for some weird reason. She then took my boyfriend's order. We get our drinks placed in front of us and she walks away with an attitude. I guess she was taking her hate for her job on us? Not sure but it was weird.\n\nShe comes back out of nowhere and asks my boyfriend if he's from Chile and he says yes. Then she smiles at him coyly and gives me a dirty look - not sure why. So now she's rude & weird to boot- bless her heart. I can only imagine what her problem was but she was nasty for the rest of the night, especially after my man got weirded out by her flirting with him. \n\nService was angry and slow, to say the least. Do yourself a favor and order from the restaurant if not another location altogether.
