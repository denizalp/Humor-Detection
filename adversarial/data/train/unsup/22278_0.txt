During our recent visit to Madison, WI we decided to meet up with some friends. Merchant came highly recommended for their craft cocktails and \"farm to table\" menu. The inside was pretty packed and chaotic, made even more claustrophobic by large shelves of varying wine and liquor for sale. \nTheir cocktail menu is vast and can get a bit overwhelming so start by narrowing it down to the type of poison you'd like to imbibe on that particular evening. I chose gin; I wanted something lighter and refreshing. My cocktail was \"Aviation\" - Gin, Lemon Juice, Luxardo Maraschino,\nCreme de violette--Served Up \"Regarded as the prince of cocktails. A very bright cocktail with floral and gin botanical notes\" $10 It was potent enough so after two I was feeling a nice buzz without feeling loopy.\n\nFor dinner we opted for Buttermilk Salad ($8) off their \"small plates\" portion of the menu. It really was very delicious and fresh. The salad was described as \"Vitruvian Farm field greens, heirloom carrot, radish, Roth Kase blue cheese, house-made buttermilk ranch*. Our  \"large plate\" option consisted of Braised Pork Belly ($22) - \"Marr's Valley View Farms' bacon & Alsum sweet corn fritters, Elderberry Hill Farm's red frilly mustards with  house-made tomato jam.\" The pork belly was cooked perfectly and everything on the plate with it was extremely tasty and well prepared balanced to perfection. \n\nThe dud of the evening was Beef Carpaccio ($11) - \"shaved tenderloin, kale, kuri squash, roasted shiitake, pickled mustard seed, SarVecchio tuile, black garlic vinaigrette.\" It sounds a lot better than it tasted. I found it bland and chose to indulge in the salad over this dish. \nOverall, the quality and freshness of the ingredients was apparent and made for a unique dining experience. For those planning a visit, or residing in the area they do have Happy Hour 3-6pm every day featuring $2 off Classic Cocktails, Drafts, and Lawnmower Beers.\n\nI would highly recommend giving this place a try. Grab a craft cocktail and an item off the \"snacks\" or \"small plates\" portion of the menu and enjoy!
