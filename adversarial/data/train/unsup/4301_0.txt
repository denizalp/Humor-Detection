This place is amazing! I came in looking for a suit or tux for a cruise I will be going on next week. That didn't leave much time or wiggle room, but I wanted to give it a try. \n\nPenny helped get me all set up even though it was very last minute and on Saturday. She found exactly what I was looking for, made great suggestions on colors and styles, and made sure I had options while I am away to make the outfit work great. \n\nStephanie made alterations to my pants, jacket, and even got everything sized and made sure it fit perfectly before I was out the door. Overall, it only took about 20 minutes and they even made sure to press and iron everything first. During the process they even asked me about it and genuinely want to know about what I did and what I needed the tux for.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for anything they offer. They price was very fair, especially for last minute, and their wonderful service and attention to detail really made the experience great.
