This is the best place I have found in my 2yr search.  Lee who had done my mother's and my Mani\/pedi for over 10 yrs was working there! We were so excited to see her again.  The place was friendly, clean with a great atmosphere.  It was worth the 15 - 20 min drive. I would definitely recommend this place.
