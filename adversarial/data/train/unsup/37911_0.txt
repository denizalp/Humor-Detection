We had a great experience at AJ's today with ever employee we encountered being very friendly and helpful...from the meat counter to the deli to the checkout.  All fabulous folks that clearly understand what awesome service looks like!  I don't shop here often because it's well out of our way, but when I do I'm never disappointed.
