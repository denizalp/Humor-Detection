I used to go to Robert Cromean back in San Diego and this salon location is great!\nMy hairdresser Rachel Loria is really talented! I lived here in Vegas for 3 years and tried out multiple people and she is the only one who gets it right every time ! I have followed her from previous salons and this place is deserving of her talent . You have to book with her at this fabulous salon!
