I wish that I had read the reviews prior to using this service. DS Waters is, if not the worst, one of the worst service companies I have ever dealt with. They have the most unprofessional phone systems - several times their system is down. On the phone typical wait times are anywhere from 30min to an hour before you speak with anyone. There is a communication gap between the phone reps and their field guys - I have had multiple orders that weren't delivered when agreed to or the number of bottles delivered were not what was ordered. I cannot say how many times that I have had to have my account adjusted due to a miscommunication within their organization - however, more times in dealing with them than not. And I always dread calling because I know that there will be a long wait time.\nMy last order I tried using their online system to order 4 bottles of water - had two delivered - the delivery ticket showed three. So here I am calling them again to make sure that they've got it right - frustrating. If I could describe their service and customer support - 'frustrating' would work.\nI have used their delivery service for almost three years. After complaining to their phone reps I was told once by one rep that she would have an executive contact me to hear my complaints - no one ever called. I'm truly amazed that this company is still in business.\nTODAY I AM CANCELING. I realized that there are other water delivery services out there, and I am going to them. Truly, they can't be any worse.\nI do not usually put out my advice online, but on this occasion, here is my advice, 'Do NOT use this water delivery service'. You will save yourself much frustration and time. And maybe, just maybe, if enough people stop using their service, they will take notice and change their practice.
