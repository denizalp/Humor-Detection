I went there because I read some of the reviews on here an I have to admit that I thought that there was no way an express place.could be what the reviews where claiming. When I first walked n the menu on the wall was in a really small font. So I asked for another menu, right away someone asked if I had ever been there before. Clearly I said no an he was super energetic an told me about the specials they had going on. I placed my order in within five mins I had my food. I figured since it was made so quickly it would taste horrible, it wasn't. I really enjoyed the fast an pleasant staff n amazingly high quality fast food!!!
