I was in Vegas for a trade show and popped into Chica for a drink and an app at the bar. I ended up ordering the grilled octopus and the arepas with braised short rib on top. Both were SO good. The octopus was crunchy because of the quinoa and the peppers had a great bite. The arepas were delicious and the short rib on top was sweet and juicy. \n\nI loved the meal so much that I ended up making a reservation for the following night for a group dinner. Yet again AMAZING. Everyone at the table said it was the best meal they had had in Vegas. We started with the empanadas (I would actually skip on these next time) and the grilled octopus. Next we each got a different entree, but everything looked amazing. Since I loved the arepas from the night before so much, I ordered the braised short rib. One of the best meals I've ever had! It has raw sugar in it so it's a little sweet and it has slightly crispy edges. It's on top three different sauces that I honestly am not sure what they are, but they're great!! \n\nThe cocktails were just as good as the food and we finished it off with lemon donuts. I will recommend this restaurant to anyone going to Vegas!
