Aji Sai is a large \"resto lounge\" offering menu and all you can eat sushi.  The bathrooms are not accessible and most of the menu is not vegan with a little bit of vegetarian sprinkled in.  Their lunch all you can eat is $12, which is very competitive for the area.\n\nI came by towards the end of the lunch service, which I wasn't hungry enough to order.  Their were many people finishing up who looked like they were enjoying themselves.  The food was coming out quickly and regularly.  \n\nI was seated immediately and ordered some tea and edamame.  I ended up having a couple of bowls of soup before filing up.  All of my food was delicious and warm.  It came out quickly.  I was also provided with the wifi password.  \n\nI'm not a huge fan of AYCE ordering, but I like AYCE places 'cause you can often order a bunch of stuff off the menu at reasonable prices.  Aji Sai was no exception.  I plan on returning.
