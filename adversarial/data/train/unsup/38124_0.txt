I wouldn't have given this place any stars! 2 1\/2 hour wait....then to be yelled at that i didn't address my cancer diagnosis for over 2 years! Well this is why.  I came in 30 minutes prior to my appointment time and they couldn't even have the consideration or decency to seem in a timely fashion. Sorry, if i have cancer and my days are limited, this means my time is valuable! And it won't be spent sitting in awaiting room so that the doctor can see me. Don't waste your time. Then after all that, the doctor wants to start from square one?! She was inconsiderate and rude and couldn't answer a single question i asked her until she got my biopsies results back which had already been completed, but not by her. Absurd!!! Never ever go there. Completely rude and selfish staff and doctors.
