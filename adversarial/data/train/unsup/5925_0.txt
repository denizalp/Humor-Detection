I arrived at Whitey's after a friend's recommendation and not knowing what to expect. I walked in the door and said out loud to myself, \"Where is all their f#%*ing merchandise?\"\n\nWell one of their helpful employees must have overheard me because she came up from behind me and just said, \"Camouflage.\"\n\nI was confused what she meant until the extremely helpful staff taught me how to adjust my eyes and what to look for.  I felt like I was walking point in 'Nam on a third tour and could see all their beautiful gear like being able to spot Chalie in the trees from 3 klicks out.\n\nThey had all of the military gear, camo, boots, tshirts, militaria, cold weather, camping, and Carhartt gear I could ask for. Maybe they even had TOO much (no no, it's the perfect amount). This is the perfect store for hunting, Halloween, camping, hunting, and even for preppers. I was able to purchase a set of custom dog tags WITH MY NAME ON THEM. THEY MADE THEM FOR ME IN THE STORE. Beat that, internet.\n\nI bought a bunch of Camo and decided to pull a prank on my wife and kids. It's been 5 days and they still can't find me and I haven't even left the house. I've had time to make a lanyard out of paracord I purchased there for my sweet custom dog tags while they've been looking for me. I've left trails of M.R.E. wrappers as clues but they just called the police, who couldn't find me. Sure I hear my family crying every night thinking I left them and my kids are asking my wife when they'll meet their new daddy, but I'm positive that I can pull this off for a full week.\n\nTHANK YOU, WHITEY'S!
