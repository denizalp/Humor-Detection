The food is a 5.  The atmosphere, less important, is a 3.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if we could do half stars.\n\nAs others have pointed out, it's tough to find, and yes, very little of the staff is actually Japanese.\n\nBut, we're going for the sushi, right?  And oh, what great sushi it is.\n\nThe sashimi is great.  I have yet to have a piece of sashimi at Shuhei that was less than a great representation of the fish.  Fresh, the right temperature, generous cuts, well-presented.\n\nShuhei's futomaki is really wonderful, and I have not found anything better anywhere in the country.  As good, yes... in Chicago and NY.  Better?  I really and truly don't think so.  The anniversary roll is, to me, their signature roll, and is overwhelming, but in a good way.  I am a big guy and I have a big mouth (ask my colleagues), so most rolls, even the futomaki, I can do in one bite per piece.  However, with the anniversary roll, I will only do this when I'm with people who will not judge me for the squirrel-cheeked display of gluttony that occurs.\n\nI will say that I'm not a big sake fan, so I can't pass judgment there.  To me, the perfect match to a platter of sushi is a Sapporo or Kirin.\n\nUnlike Sushi Rock, this is not a place where you go to be seen.  Nor is it a place where you go to consume as much rice and fish as possible for the money.  This is a place where you go to appreciate absolutely top quality fish, perfectly cooked and seasoned rice (the foundation of a great roll or nigiri), and expert craftsmanship and presentation.\n\nOn those counts, Shuhei is a winner.  There is no better sushi in Cleveland.  Pacific East is an honorable second place.  I feel dirty even having mentioned Sushi Rock in this review.  We are talking about the difference between Lopez and the microwave burritos from the freezer section at the grocery store.
