Babystacks Cafe, located in the Buffalo and Smoke Ranch area is superb.  I would give it 5 stars but on some days I'm fighting with flies to eat my food.\n\nYou can order pretty much anything and what you read on the menu is what you'll be served with.  I enjoyed everything I have ordered so far and if I were to order an omelet dish I would get a special short stack than the plain ones for an extra small fee.  I find it funny how an infused Filipino dish get mixed in next to items like the Red Velvet Pancakes.  But they work.\n\nThey have TVs in there but if you see a line outside please be courteous and get moving.  We want yummies in our stomach too!
