I love love love Canteen. I love the decor, the vibe, and the food! I'd say they are a pretty vegetarian friendly place and have great margaritas.\n\nI ordered the Mexican Street Corn, Sweet Potato Dorados, and a Spicy Margarita. The Mexican Street Corn was very well balanced in flavors with the cheese, creamy  mayonnaise, spice, and I believe they put a little bit of the Tajin spice. The Sweet Potato Dorados were beautifully served with a sweet and tart red sauce. It also came with a side of Mexican style rice with beans, corn, and a seasoning for flavor on the rice. The Spicy Margarita wasn't really spicy but it was delicious. The rim of the cup was dipped in the Tajin spice that paired very well with the margarita. \n\nI recommend this place for a romantic chill date, for people who are visiting from out of town, and\/or people who enjoy some good Mexican style food. Service was great as well.
