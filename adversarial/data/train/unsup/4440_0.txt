This is a Cleveland institution - kitschy at its finest.  Come hungry, leave happy.   Going through the cafeteria line, be sure to try the pierogies as a side dish.  When ordering an entree, you get two sides and they will allow you to pick pierogies for both.  My favorite entree is the chicken Paprikash.  It's hard to go wrong, though.
