Bad experience.\n\nPro's:\n- The noodles are freshly made and they give you a choice of the type and size. \n- The broth is good with the noodle soups.\n\nCon's:\n- The noodle maker is constantly pounding the dough however with such a small space the banging sound just shakes everyone up. My friend jumped out of her seat a few times. Heard a few screams in the background.\n- The staff are quite rude. I saw the dishwashing guy confront his female cook and accidentally cut her with the cleaver. He was yelling at her... of course in mandarin.\n- It was quite busy that they were rushing people out. I still had one more dish coming and since they forgot about it they slapped the bill to us. We told them we weren't done. \n- They ask if i wanted spicy and I said yes. They came with the noodle soup and a mountain of chilli oil in it. It was waaaayyy too much and i had to scoop it out. I guess that is subjective.\n\nOverall:\nI'd only go back for the noodles. Not the staff. This place is good for those who have not experienced chinese pulled noodles. But other than that, there's nothing there for me to hold on to. \n\nI wish them all the best but they won't survive.
