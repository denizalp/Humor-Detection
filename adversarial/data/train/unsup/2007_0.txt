This coffee shop pays great attention to detail with their early 1900s theme. It starts with their huge antique door to greet you. There is no sign outside, but it's right next to Hobak Korean BBQ. The environment can be your grand tranquility with a massive greenhouse at the center of it all, soothing music in the background and with rustic-antique furniture alike (minus the coffee and tea addicts enjoying and conversing with one another).\n\nI was immediately greeted by their friendly staff. You order and pay at the counter and you'll be given a number for when your order is ready. They will bring your order to you. We ordered the following:\n\n-Smoked Gouda turkey croissant\n-Chocolate croissant\n-Green tea bun with red beans\n-Vanilla Chai Latte \n-Iced blended matcha green tea \n\nThe Smoked Gouda Turkey Croissant was a decent sandwich and comes with salad. I like the smoked gouda for a change, but $13 for a plain sandwich on a non-flaky croissant? I'll pass on this sandwich next visit. The chocolate croissant had the same non-flakiness. It was more on the spongy side rather than flaky. The green tea bun had a generous amount of red beans without being too sweet and sticky. The dough was good with a hint of green tea flavor. I would probably order this again. \n\nI really enjoyed my vanilla chai latte. It was earthy and had subtle flavors of chai and a very rustic look with it's foamy milk. I absolutely love this drink! The iced blended matcha green tea has its deep beautiful green color that's dusted on top to make this drink even richer. I love this matcha drink!\n\nI can't wait to come back and try their desserts since it's only available after 3pm. This is my ideal coffee shop where you can sip, eat, kick back, and relax!
