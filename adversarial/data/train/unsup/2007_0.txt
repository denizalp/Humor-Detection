Okay, so... I'm all about a wood fire, crispy, while densely chewy, with a hint-of-sweetness bagel, but I think the balance was just not there.\n\nI had the Lox & Cream cheese on a Sesame bagel, and cinnamon raisin to-go. Overall, the bagels were way too tough making the sandwich very difficult to eat. I felt like the sweetness of the dough actually enhanced more of a floury taste which overpowered the flavors as a whole. \n\nI did appreciated the side salad that came with the sandwich, though.
