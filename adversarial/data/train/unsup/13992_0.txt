During my one visit (before a big rock concert), Ri Ra'swas crowded and loud while we were there.  They were doing trivia in the back of the place, which was fine, but a little distracting if you weren't involved in the game.  Also, we put our name on a wait list and were never called . . . ever.  Ending up eating at the bar.  Speaking of the bar - the drinks were pretty weak.  I literally wondered if I was drinking watered down bourbon because I didn't taste a tone of ginger OR bourbon in my bourbon and ginger.  The highlight was the food, at least mine.  I got the brisket sandwich and fries.  The brisket was very tender and everything had good flavor.  I asked for a side of the curry sauce and I do not kid or exaggerate to say it is out of this world good.  If they had sold it in to go containers, I would have bought some to take home.  My friends both got the Reuben and described it as somewhat chewy.  I don't think I've ever had a \"chewy\" Reuben, so that wasn't very promising.  So, in any case, \"a-ok\".  I'd go back and give it a second shot when in Charlotte.
