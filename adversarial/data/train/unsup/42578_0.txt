This review is based on one visit for bubble tea. If (when) I return, I will update this with information on food, but I'm not in the area often and I want to sing their praises. \n\nTo start with, the woman working was absolutely lovely. She was welcoming, helpful with suggestions after asking if it was our first visit, and attentive. We were very impressed and that alone makes me want to support this place. \n\nThe bubble tea was also fabulous. I chose the Thai Tea milk tea with boba and loved it. My sister (who loves bubble tea and will drive distances to try new places) had her usual order of a Taro Smoothie (which is dairy based, vs a slushee which is juice based) with boba. Both were excellent. \n\nThe menu was expansive with milk tea, smoothie, slushee, different toppings (like jellies), and a selection of other options that looked interesting (though perhaps too adventurous for me). The sandwiches all looked (and smelled) good. She said the most popular one was the grilled pork, so I'll try that on my next visit. I highly recommend trying this place!
