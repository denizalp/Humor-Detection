just had food from here this morning, last night, earlier in the day yesterday, just after a first breakfast yesterday morning and im hoping to polish off the remnants over the next couple of days.\n\nhows that for committed?\n\nlike all great middle eastern places, i only have them when i am north of eglinton.  this is not a frequent occurrence, for good reason.  however, when im there, i delight in their robust falafel balls that crunch on the outside and warm your mouth with the softness of a pillow on the inside.   this holds true even when they are cold - except for the crunchy part, but NEVER are they dry like virtually all falafel places south of there.  \n\nthe salads are fresh, tasty, albeit a little oily - but i cant resist the eggplant salad even though its bathing in oil.  the pita is the only kind i enjoy - a big circular pocket thats fluffy and fresh.  the hummous and tehina are perfect in their consistency, and spice.\n\nthe only thing that i dont like from this place, is when you go inside and order a falafel sandwich...its gargantuan...so much so that you have no idea how to approach it...and you want to approach it...its like a hot sexy big assed, big breasted, big lipped woman.\n\n(not quite sure if that metaphor worked but, i gave it a go at least.)
