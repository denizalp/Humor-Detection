Wow!! 5 Star Average!!\n\nWe're fans of Bahama Bucks, especially during the summer.  Ordering can get a little overwhelming because of the amount of flavors and possible combinations.  What makes Bahama Buck's so good is the amount of flavors they have, the creamy texture of their shave ice, and the great customer service.  I'm a wuss and my body can't handle too much sweets & ice cream. So, I keep it clean and simple.  My order is usually a baby size Thin Ice Birthday Cake & Vanilla with their sugar-free Vanilla ice cream.  All Thin Ice flavors are calorie free and their sugar-free vanilla ice cream has only 100 calories. This is perfect for me, especially when I'm cutting down my calories and have a sweet craving for something cold.  \n\n2017 Yelp Review #43
