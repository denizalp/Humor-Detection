Harrah's looks like an old casino that you may not feel has any wow factor.  While it is a bit dated, the Piano Bar is worth a visit.  \n\nFirst, for those who have not been in a dueling piano bar before, a bit of a background.  Two large piano's are in the middle of the bar, with two talented players who can also sing.  They go head to head and vie for the audiences approval.  They play all your favorite songs from the 60's to Present day. Typically they add a musical twist, remixing the song a bit, and are able to transition from song to song without any breaks.  \n\nThe atmosphere at this bar is great.  Lots of audience participation in suggesting songs and even dancing up on the stage.  My friend at the beckon call of a bachelorettes party, did a dance and mini strip show (shirtless) for 4 ladies on stage.  Vegas Baby!\n\nNo cover and it's super casual. Drop by if you've never been in a dueling piano bar before.
