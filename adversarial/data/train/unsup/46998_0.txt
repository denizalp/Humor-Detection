Came here for lunch during the work week. The Girl that was making my sandwich behind the counter was nice and pretty speedy.\n\nI ordered a salad and asked for all spinach. I like the way they mix the salad and break it up into small pieces. The lady that was making my salad was generous with the toppings as well and I appreciate it when I don't have to ask for more. The salad was really yummy and I was surprised at how much I liked it b\/c the last time I had a salad from Subway was years ago and it wasn't nearly as tasty. That could very well have been my fault, but irregardless, I'll be back for a healthy lunch on the go.\n\nI do wish they had some patio seating here, but Panda Express is 2 doors down and they have a large outside eating area out front if you care to venture outdoors.
