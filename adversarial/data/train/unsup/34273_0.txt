This rating is only for the groomer, Angela. I arrived to pick up my dog early because I had an emergency situation I had to get to and wanted to see if I could get my dog early. She acted annoyed that I was there early and I told her the situation and asked if she could get my dog ready :30 minutes earlier than expected. Her response was 'if you leave me alone maybe I can'. I stayed and waited outside where my dog nor Angela could see me. I heard her being abusive to my small scared dog calling him names including telling  him to shut up and calling him a mother f**** a******. She never finished on time which was ok, I just wish she would have told me she couldn't cut :30 minutes out of the time as I would have made other arrangements. I don't understand why she is a groomer if she obviously doesn't enjoy dogs. I don't know why Pet Club is associated with such a person.
