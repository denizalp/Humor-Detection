Just like visiting the local deli in lower Manhattan! Their sandwiches are loaded with meat and delicious. They will even make a lettuce wrap sandwich for your low carb diet. Sandwiches range from $10-$12. Try the New York Sky High on rye for a treat. Fountain and bottled drinks are available as well as side dishes and a variety of chips. Plenty of available seating \"outside\" which gives you the feeling of dining on a New York sidewalk.
