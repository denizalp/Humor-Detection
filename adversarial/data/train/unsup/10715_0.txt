Great food, nasty employees.\nThere were a couple girls, and a guy working in the kitchen when we came by.  One girl greeted us, and the other girl came up to the counter....looked at us...picked her nose...and walked off.  I'm not sure if this is some inside joke that the people working there have, or just a really bad habit (another reviewer has mentioned a nose-picking employee), but I am NOT a fan.\nI kind of wanted to leave at that point, but we already bought the groupon, so we placed an order anyway.  The food was actually really good.  The pizza had a thin crust, and tons of fresh toppings.  I really loved their hot wings. They're baked, and they don't have that nasty super thick fat skin on them.  It would be nice if the prices were a little lower (especially since this place has absolutely no ambiance), but meh.\nI will probably come back here, because I really liked the food, but  I would feel a lot better about it if the employees kept their snot off my pizza.
