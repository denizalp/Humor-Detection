Best breakfast place in Montreal, very close from the Sheraton hotel. The food portions are huge but it is so delicious, i'll guarantee there will be no left overs. I had a crepe filled with fruits and nutella cream, by far the best crepe i had...we went back the next day, and food was still delicious but the service seemed extremely slow, i guess they must have been busy. Also, if you don't want to wait to be seated, try arriving between 9 and 10 in the morning, after 10:30, there is a line out the door.
