The service is excellent. The staff is friendly and accommodating. On this evening I came in for a late supper before a meeting. I chose to have the French Onion Soup and steak and bleu half a salad. The soup was wonderful. Full of flavor and not skimpy at all on the onions. More cheese would have been great, but that's okay. That's salad was okay. The steak was sparse and kind of fatty, but the dressing was nice as was the chunks of bleu cheese. As always the coffee is good. I like this location head and shoulders above the others in the valley. I guess that's why I keep coming back here.
