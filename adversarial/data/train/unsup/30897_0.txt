If you're looking for great food and atmosphere in downtown Phoenix, look no further. Even better, if you have an event to attend at either Comerica Theater or Talking Stick Resort, you can valet park your car right out front for $12 (they're attached to the Hilton Garden Inn), then dine and walk to your event. So easy! First off, we were greeted with warm friendly smiles and seated and served right away. The food, incredible...the personal size pizzas were generous in size and delicious, but...the crust is the real stand out here! I'll go so far as to say the best pizza I've ever had (see photos). The martinis were smooth, the Espresso perfect, and home-made Limoncello not to be missed. Bravo Nook Kitchen!!!
