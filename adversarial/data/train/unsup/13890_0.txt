I always wondered what's so awesome with In And Out.. Finally here on the other side of the country! Certainly, hopping and lively..\n\nThe menu isn't that long and apparently there's some sort of secret menu that I couldn't quite understand. It's fast food, so what's the deal? My coworker said this ain't fast food; but I beg to differ!\n\nI ordered a hamburg and fries. It's suppose to be cooked to order so which explained why it took some time for our order to be ready. \n\nMy first impression from the first bite - wow, this bun is soft and moist! Second bite - yes, this bun is amazing. Third bite - the best fast food bun ever!
