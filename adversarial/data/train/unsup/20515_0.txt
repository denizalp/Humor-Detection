Just left another amazing experience at Fire Rock but I have to say it was my favorite one so far , my night started with joking with John who not only has an amazing smile but awesome sense of humor .. after he had to go take care of customers I was able to be served by Mike who also is super sweet with yet another face that is easy on the eyes ..\n\nNot only did he make me a custom drink he was awesome at engaging in conversation and making sure I felt special plus he recommended the prime dip which is so so good ....\n\nWhen my friend showed up we ended up having a debate about DC films and Ace came to the rescue even though he didn't have my section and yet another awesome on the eyes with nice accent guy \n\nSo any ladies i definitely recommend you sit at the bar .. even tho the waitresses seem nice !\n\nI also go to speak to some of the other staff before my friend arrived and sadly I didn't get their names but they were great!\n\nAwesome experience and good food!\n\nThis place has a great happy hour!
