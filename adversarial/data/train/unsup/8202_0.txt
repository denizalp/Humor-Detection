I have had capriotti's a few times however this time the man behind the counter just rubbed me the wrong way.  I was ordering to go and my friend has a specific order which the man who was taking my order was confused by.  We were ordering a turkey sub just not the way they make their traditional turkey. I didn't think it was too hard of a concept but he seemed to have thought so.  For it only being me in there I would expect better service.  I will steer clear of this location the next time I'm craving Capriotti's!
