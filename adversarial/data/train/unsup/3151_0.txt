I definitely give this gym 5 stars!!! I have read the other reviews and most people complained about old trainers leaving. I don't think that is such a big deal. If people want to make a change in their career then they should be able to do so. Plus I met some incredibly new trainers at this gym like Jeremy and Lesmi. They have some awesome new classes like the matrix class. I think it is awesome that they are bringing in new ideas. The new management Taylor is pretty amazing too! Very down to earth guy and easy to talk to. I didn't feel pressured at all to buy a gym membership, not like other gyms where they give you a bad attitude if you don't join. In comparison to other MMA type gyms this gym is pretty clean and DOES NOT SMELL like a boy's locker room! AWESOME! You burn tons of calories in one class. I would say definitely go check it out, plus your first class is free. The location is awesome, easy to get to, right on Blue Diamond by the Target shopping area. Anyhow, I can't rave enough about how I LOVE LOVE LOVE this gym!
