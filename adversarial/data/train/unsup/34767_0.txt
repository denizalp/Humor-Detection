I've always wanted to come here but never had a reason to buy a whole cake for myself, but Father's Day and a friends birthday came up and I remembered to come here... definitely did not disappoint!! I came here as my workplace was 10 minutes away. I bought a chocolate mousse cheesecake and the assorted  cheesecake (8 slices each) for about 42$ total. The bigger\/full sized cakes were $40 something each. The cheesecakes were frozen but defrosted within 4\/5 hrs or less. Tasted exactly like the ones from the factory but better (one of the factors being because of the awesome service; go see my last review of the Cheesecake Factory in Buffalo). \n\nThe lady was very friendly and knowledgeable of the selections of cakes and helped out. \n\nShe gave me a sample of a macaron which was surprisingly tasty considering most small business' don't do that well. They had a wide selection of flavors and they were all so moist and crunchy. Pretty comparable to other individual caterers like sugar tiers. \n\nI bought a dozen assorted macarons and I trusted the lady to help me pick. She asked me what kinds of flavor I like, I suggested fruity \n\nMy most favorite were watermelon(seasonal), strawberry, salted caramel, mango. \n\nI would definitely come back again and be a proud supporter of this small business.
