I tried Salon 3121 with a Living Social deal for 6 pedicures.  It's a clean salon, uses organic products.  I have had mixed success with different nail technicians - one great, one kind of sloppy.  My biggest issue is scheduling - it is practically impossible to get a pedicure appointment in less than 3 weeks!!! It's getting to be ridiculous and I wish I was done with my Living Social deal so I can just go back to my normal salon where I can walk in and be seen in minutes.  Missing my callous removal as well... not a complete disappointment, but probably won't be coming back after my deal is up
