So rude!!!! I hate them\nI wanted to call in my order so it I can just go in pay and pick up dinner. Well I was on the phone on hold the entire time while driving there. And then I was still on the hold when I arrived at the restaurant up until I was actually in front of them ready to give them my order. I said \"well I can probably hang up now that I am here since you placed me on hold this entire time.\" I said it with a smile while looking directly at her. \"You don't seem to concern about the customers on the phone do you?\" She even answered the phone while I was there and placed them on hold as well. Cashier's response, \"Uuuh, so what can I get for you?. There was like maybe two more couples in this place so it was not like they were bombarded with orders. This person was not even apologetic what so ever.  She asked other girl \"hey did you put some one on hold\". Response: Yeah, I don't know. CLUELESS. The entire staff does not have ANY customer service skills. And then when I got my order, I check to see if it was all there and I opened the box, this chick NOT EVEN LOOKING , put the packets of sauce in the my BOX!!!!!!!! while I was inspecting. Seriously!!!!!
