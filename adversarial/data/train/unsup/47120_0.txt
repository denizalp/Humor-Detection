This was our second time at this property. While the hotel itself is in good repair and we enjoy the managers reception and breakfast, we have had some bad experiences which lead to seeking different lodging in the future. \n\nDespite doing online check-in 24 hours before our scheduled check-in and registering for digital key for the room we chose, our room was not available early or even close to on time. We had to wait 45 minutes beyond the promised 4:00 check-in time. We were given a voucher to use in the restaurant but nobody called us. It was only after we returned to the front desk at 4:45 that we were told our room was now ready. \n\nThe kids wanted to swim but they were driven out after just 5 minutes by a very loud, inconsiderate family from Pittsburg who managed to simultaneously neglect and antagonize their own children who in turn jumped directly on other kids, splashed people trying to relax in the hot tub and shouted non-stop. When my kids tried to swim after dinner the same people were there being rude and obnoxious. We were disappointed that no rules or basic courtesy was required by the staff at this property. \n\nWhen it came time to turn down the hide-a-bed sofa we discovered a lack of blankets and pillows. There was just one blanket and no pillows. When we called the front desk to request some, we were told we could come down ourselves but the girl was not sure if she had any or not. Really??\n\nBetween the late check-in, rude patrons and lack of standards we will seek lodging elsewhere in the future. One star for clean rooms, one star for basic ES amenities. Their managers reception spread was one of the nicest I've seen with tons of fresh veggies, popcorn, chips and a tomato salad.
