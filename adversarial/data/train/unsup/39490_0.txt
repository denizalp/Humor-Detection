I tried this restaurant for the first time tonight. And the food was horrible. There was absolutely no flavor in the chicken. We got the Mongolian beef and it wasn't spicy at all. Then we also found a metal shaving from a metal bristle brush that they probably use to clean something with. I had to check my kids foods to ensure that there was no other metal particles. Their service was awesome and they did not miss a beat. Delivery was on time.
