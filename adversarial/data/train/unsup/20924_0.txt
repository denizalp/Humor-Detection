Worst casino ever ! They are stealing money from customers and letting in minors. A man stole money from me in the casino and they caught the man never called the police at all. This is just the start next of all we were there doing charity work for cancer and they full out know what happened and never did one thing. One employee told me that a group of workers stole my money!
