If you go with a group of 14 people, they can all fit in here. Food was great, lots of choices, representative of the Korean cuisine. I noticed there were a lot of Koreans coming here to eat! That MUST mean something right??? It's like a Vietnamese going to a pho restaurant to eat pho! Their kimchi is less spicy I think, so it's perfect for those who want to try kimchi but are too scared to try spicy food. But if you eat to much, it will get hot in there!!!
