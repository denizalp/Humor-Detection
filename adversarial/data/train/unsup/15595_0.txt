I wish I had something funny to say about this place, but honestly, it's nice, the food is usually really good, and the drinks are pretty awesome.  \n\nI could eat 1,000 Cuban Sandwiches, and it's close enough for us to walk to.\n\nAlma - thumbs up.\n\nBut that's dull, so I'm going to write about the chicken that lives in the pet store right next to Alma.\n\nWe named him Captain bocKirk after some brainstorming, and some passionate arguments. He's white, and he seems nice.  One day, we went to get cat litter, and Captain bocKirk was gone.  He had been sent to a \"farm\" they said.\n\nI pondered a moment, considering the transience of my own life...\n\nI hope that he really was sent to a farm and that he's having the best damn time of his life.\n\nSeriously, go to Alma.
