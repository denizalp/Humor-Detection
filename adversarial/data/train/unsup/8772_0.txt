Don't judge a book by its cover.\n\n\nI guess the saying must be true \"You can't judge a book by its cover\".  The  exterior at Alfonso's is unassuming, the restaurant is very clean, the service is efficient, and I cannot say enough about the food.  Alfonso's Mexican Food is a delicious surprise.  \n\nAlfonso's offers a large variety of great menu choices. Alfonso's does not have table service, so you order your entr√©e  at the counter, pick up your food, and take it to your table.  The food is not what you would call \"fast\" food but carefully prepared food would be a better choice of words.\n\nOn this visit I had the shredded beef and ground beef tacos and both were really very good and seasoned perfectly. My lunch companion had the Carne Asada Burrito and he said it was the best he's ever had. The burritos at Alfonso's are huge, inexpensive, and most important, delicious. \n\nIf your ever in the area stop by Alfonso's. The food is authentic and will not disappoint.
