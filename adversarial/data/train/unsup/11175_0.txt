I have a love\/hate relationship with them.  Initially (15 yrs ago), I used them for service contract with fair pricing.  At that time, I received good service.  So 7 yrs ago, I had to replace one complete system and used them.  Their pricing was high - maybe 40% above the competition.  The install crew was great - professional and did great work.  I also bought the 10 yr warranty coverage.  Then their service began to slip.  Two years ago, I had to replace the entire upstairs system.  Super expensive - maybe 60% higher than the competition.  The installation crew was incompetent and installed the system incorrectly.  Had to have the inspector make them replace and reinstall the system.  Again bought the 10 yr warranty.\n\nService continues to suck.  For the last 3-4 years, they are either late or no-shows for semiannual service calls, probably 80% of the time.  The last 4\/5 times this has happened.  Today it happened again for the second time in 3 days!\n\nAnd they either lie or have stupid people working in customer service.  They tell you one thing and then claim no knowledge.  One person gives you an appointment window and when they are late, they tell you that there is no such appointment window.\n\nBut now, I am stuck with their stupid service due to my warranty contract periods!!\n\nWhat a freaking nightmare!  Don't do business with these guys!
