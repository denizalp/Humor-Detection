At lot of attitude and bad food? No thanks.\n\nThere's a vicious cycle when it comes to making assumptions about your patrons. You think, 'they look young and they ordered tap water. I bet they aren't going to spend much money here. I am going to ignore them.\" Well you know what happens when you never see your waiter again and have to order through managers all night? You get a bad tip.\n\nWe ordered some sangria, the red, which was alright but not great. Then we ordered a few plates of tapas, to get us started. We had the risotto which was just terrible and a few other things as well. The only good thing was the ceviche, but I've certainly had better. It was a tiny bit of food for a lot of money and a lot more attitude.\n\nThere are much better options out there. I will not be back.
