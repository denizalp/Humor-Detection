My son was stung by a scorpion this past weekend in our living room, so of course I saw this as an act of terrorism and now it's personal. I've declared war. Like with any war, I needed weaponry and lots of it. I visit Bug & Weed Mart because it came highly recommend by a coworker. He knew what he was talking about. \n\nThe gentleman who helped me explained everything in great detail. I was confident that I could win the war on terrorism or at least make them go somewhere else. I'd be happy with them going anywhere other than my house. I have no clue what the other people are talking about when they didn't get greeted. This guy was friendly and beyond knowledgeable in all things bug and that makes him A-ok in my book. People need thicker skin. \n\nThe weaponry was all that I could have hoped for. The granules that I sprinkled worked like a charm. They were my mini grenades of awesome destruction. I have a blacklight that I take with me nightly outside to go toe to stinger with them. They think my back wall is like a five star resort. Instead of me rolling out the red carpet, I show them my flyswatter. So after I sprinkled the granules, I honestly saw just one and that jerk was in an area that I might not have sprinkled as I should have. \n\nAll in all, they sell quality weapons to battle terrorist bugs. I hate doing it myself but in the end it saves you a ton of money and you get the satisfaction of knowing your making your casa a safer place. Use these guys next time! You won't be sorry!
