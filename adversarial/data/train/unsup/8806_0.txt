We live in the area and have always loved ZuZU. So great happy hour goes til 7:00 during the week, and Valley Ho is just a neat place. They've recently changed things up. Only \"parts\" of the patio are eligible for happy hour, the happy hour food menu has been drastically cut back. The beer selections on HH were cut back.  Wine is red or white. Pick one. The food is always good, but just let down by the recent changes. Not enough to draw us to HH there any more.
