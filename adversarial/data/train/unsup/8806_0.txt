You get what you pay for in Las Vegas . . . (And other places, too.)  The Days Inn on West Tropicana is not expensive, and will certainly not ever be confused with the Bellagio.\n\nThe room was fair to middlin' OK.  No coffee maker BOO, Denny's downstairs YAY.  The king bed was pretty comfy, but I am not that picky.  The staff changes the linens daily, but if you hang up your towels, they will not provide new ones.  It takes about 10 seconds for a towel to completely dry out in this climate.\n\nThe room had a wall-mount A\/C that sounded like an idling diesel locomotive.  But dang, that thing blew cold air !!  Daytime temp was 105, but the room was kept nice and frigid.\n\nThe pool and spa were nice, although it was a splashing pool not a lap pool.  So forget about trying to work off all that alcohol.  No complaints, the staff was quite nice, really.  Next time, we're going to stay at that place with the big fountains, though.  It was A-OK here, given the price (about $40\/night).
