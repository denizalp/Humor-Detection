So I'm not an avid runner. I spend more time on the elliptical than pounding the pavement, but I thought I'd mix some running into my workout routine. I had an old worn-out pair of Asics (Kayanos) purchased from a sporting goods store. This time, I wanted to get some expert advice for my shoe purchase.\n\nI went through the Shoe Dog analysis and found the process to be very informative. They have you run barefoot on a treadmill and film your movement. Then an associate helps you analyze your stride and find where you need extra support. You get a paper slip with the details and an email summarizing everything (which I never received sadly).\n\nI always thought I overpronated on both feet, and the Asic Kayanos I had were ultra stabilizing shoes. Overpronation = when your foot rolls inward more than 15% after the initial strike and comes off the ground near the big toe. This means you can't absorb shock as well and need a stabilizing shoe. The film showed me I only overponated slightly on one foot, and thus needed a stability shoe. The associate pulled a few shoes that fit the bill, and I settled on a comfortable pair of Asics (on sale, too!).\n\nThey fit every customer who goes through the process for custom insoles and then you can try them in each shoe. They are pricy at around $73, but are supposed to last longer than normal insoles. I ended up purchasing them because it really made my shoes more comfortable, but after running a few times in the insoles, they caused extra strain on my calves. Thankfully, RoadRunner has a great return policy: 30 days for custom insoles, 90 days for the shoes.\n\nOverall, I am very satisfied with my shoes and the RoadRunner brand apparel (their shirts fit well, and have little features like a place for your keys). We joined the VIP club because we were buying two new pairs of shoes and some apparel. If you expect to make some big purchases or need new running shoes quite often, it makes a lot of sense.
