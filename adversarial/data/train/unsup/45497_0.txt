Came here on a Sunday and found out they don't have the lunch combo . \nSo I ordered one order of egg roll (4 pcs for close to $7!) , and crispy chicken with Thai basil . My friend ordered chicken with cashew .\n\nEgg roll was good . Freshly fried and crispy.\n\nthere is no crispness to my chicken . Could barely taste or see the basil . The plate is full with unnecessary crispy noodle . \n\nNot completely convinced I will come back .
