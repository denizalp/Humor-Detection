I am rating this on the \"airport food\" curve where 5 stars is Tortas Fronteras at ORD and 1 star is the Hearth at YYZ. If you're at the far end of Concourse C, you have few choices including Burger King, Nathans Famous and a few other fast food places. If you're actually looking for table service, Jose Cuervo's \"Tequileria\" is it. \n\nWhat is a \"Tequileria\", exactly? Is it a place inside of an airport that serves very overpriced margaritas that are mostly mix and Taco Bell quality food? Must be so, because that's what you're getting here.\n\nSeating is \"seat yourself\". In a \"Tequileria\" setting that means grab an open table, which will probably be dirty and watch the staff desperately try not to make eye contact with you for a good 10 minutes. Eventually (maybe), one of them will make a mistake, accidentally acknowledge you and as a punishment, have to take your order. You might be worried about missing your flight but no fear, your food will come out INSTANTLY. No, it's not tequila infused ninjas in the back preparing your dish at lightning speed, everything is premade and thrown on a plate. \n\nMy chicken tacos ($12) were literally indistinguishable from Taco Bell's Chicken Soft Tacos. Same cheap iceberg lettuce and \"shredded cheese\" toppings. Some Fire Sauce would have been appreciated because these mofos are bland. I'd say skip the food but honestly, there's really not much better in this concourse.\n\nTwo stars - one for being the only sit down place in C, the seconds because my dinner did not result in The Troubles on my 3.5 hour flight home. \n\nAlso, note to self - rent a space in the airport, buy a bunch of Taco Bell meal kits and call myself a \"tequileria\" = PROFIT.
