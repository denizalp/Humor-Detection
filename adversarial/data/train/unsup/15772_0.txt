I came here about a year ago and the food was much better... service was great but the quality has gone down hill.... canned cheese on the nachos and dried out fish tacos.... bleh.... up side we did see 2 drunk chicks dry hump a guy at the bar in front of a family of 4.... the kids got an education of how to do boob shots and twerk... 6-8 year olds need that....
