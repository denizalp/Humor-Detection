Well this was a disappointment!   More like \"Ickle\" Barrel than Pickle Barrel!\n\nWe have had some good evening and lunch meals in the past at this location.\nWe really enjoyed when Rose Reisman re-did the menu.\nThose days are gone!\nOn this occasion we went for brunch\/breakfast before a movie matinee.\n\nWe both ordered the standard breakfast (3 eggs with very crispy bacon).  We had a choice of potatoes or latkes (we both ordered latkes) and toast.\n\nFrankly - it was awful -- I can say without a doubt that it was the worst restaurant breakfast I have ever had in all my 15 years in Toronto.\n\nI ordered tea - and they brought me a pot of hot water.  When i went to put the tea bag in, there were paper strips from some other food floating in it.\nI told the waitress and she replaced it and apologized (but yuk!!)\nI wonder if she even brought a new pot.  Goodness knows where that stuff came from.\n\nThen the meal came - what a disappointment - 3 eggs swimming in water -- odd for over easy (utterly tasteless and undercooked -- the white was still runny).  I got 2 small rashers of bacon barely cooked, and two latkes.  No sour cream or applesauce for the latkes (does anyone else think this is odd?)  The latkes were actually the only decent thing on the menu.\n\nMy husband made out better than me -- he actually got 4 rashers of bacon - although not crispy.  \n\nThe waitress was careful not to ask if we enjoyed our food -- it had to be obvious we were not thrilled, and lots of food left on plates - but that was even worse in some ways -- she didn't even care enough to ask -- so the servers don't care and the restaurant doesn't care that you are satisfied!\n\nThe bill came to over $27.  For this!!!???  - We will not be back.\nShame on you Pickle Barrel!!!  I have had $5.99 breakfasts that were tastier and no issues on cleanliness and quality of food.
