This is the best bike shop in Cleveland.  I have been a customer for year and am always impressed by their quick service.  I showed up a little early this week for their great shop ride and inquired as to whether they had a rear cog in stock for my Felt roadie.  Not only did they have it, but they said they could install it in the ten minutes before the ride's departure.   I think it only took Brian five minutes to put it on.  \n\nThey are friendly and very professional.  Yes, they look like \"hipsters\" but that does not diminish their service.  If you need service or are looking to buy a quality ride, this is the place to visit.
