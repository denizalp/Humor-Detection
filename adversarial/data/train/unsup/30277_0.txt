Ashleigh is great - always easy to schedule an appointment at various times, great quality haircuts and better prices than anywhere else.  I will only go to her from now on!  She can do men, women, and children's hair and all of my friends who go there agree that she does a great job as well.  She has a new location that is nicer than before with a better layout.
