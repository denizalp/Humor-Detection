Premium Outlets just down the road seems to get all the attention and nods, but HTC has been here longer and offers just as much but you can't walk to every store as it's spread over several blocks.  Some noteworthy names include H&M, Geoxx, Roots, and some Canadian store outlets like Le Chateau, Garage, Dynamite, Harry Rosen, and Reitmans.  I don't always find interesting merchandise, but always have fun just browsing.  You can easily spend an entire day going through the shops.
