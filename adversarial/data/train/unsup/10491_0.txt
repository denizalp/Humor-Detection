First rule of California Sandwiches, \"You don't talk about the horrible geographical locations where they place their franchises.\" Seriously, all three CS locations that I know of in Toronto are in the middle of nowhere and not easily accessible. \n\nThis location is as nondescript as they come. It is in front of a high school and it is smack in the middle of a residential neighbourhood. Almost as if a ninja sneaked into Toronto's city planning office and changed the zoning of the block just to piss off the older crowd who seat on their porches for sport across the street and simply watch you go in... and out. Mumbling something among themselves as you walk by. \n\nAs far as the quality of the sandwiches, they are orgasmically delicious.  They are juicy, spicy and tasty and although the health benefits or its aorta blocking powers can at times be questionable or concerning, your taste buds will try their best to distract your brain away from such thoughts. Just  eat somewhat fast because there is a soggy half-life with these sandwiches. \n\nGenerally I get a chicken or veal sandwiches --no, I do not feel guilty about it, okay? It is now closer to God's loving embrace. :P\nAnd they have yet to disappoint.\n\nEven though the sandwiches are quite large, by the end of a meal, you come out feeling good and full, unlike McDonald's or other fast food joints where you come out feeling gross and dirty. \n\nSo if you haven't had a California Sandwich, then it is not too late. Have one. You won't regret it.
