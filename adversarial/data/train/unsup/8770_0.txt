I preface this review my noting that I do not gamble, nor have I stayed at Green Valley Ranch Resort & Spa. I have come on a number of occasions for the purpose of dining, watching movies and to enjoy some libations in the bars on property. \n\nI don't frequent GVR mostly because I do not live in the area, but when I do visit, I'm reminded by how much I actually like this property. It's on the smaller side, which makes it more intimate and easy to navigate. It's clean and organized and the staff that I have encountered have always gone above and beyond to help direct me towards venues I'm trying to locate.
