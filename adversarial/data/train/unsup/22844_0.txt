I don't know what all the fuss is about! Seoul Chako way surpassed my expectations.\n\nThe meat was absolutely delicious, so juicy and tender and the selection is amazing! The ox tongue is my favourite for anyone daring enough to try (one thing however is that I kept ordering the octopus and it never showed up both times I've been there, perhaps they should take this off the menu)\n\nOn top of the meats they offer to BBQ yourself, there is also a good selection of delicious sushi, grill-able vegetables and Korean appetizers to choose from. \n\nFor dessert definitely try a round of strawberry forzen yogurt with vanilla icecream. And then get their mango pudding.
