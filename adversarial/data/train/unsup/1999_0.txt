This is such a wonderful new neighborhood bar. They have happy hour until 8pm everyday--need I say more!?!?!\n\nIf you've ever been to the Wining Pig or The Pig's Meow, Rott n' Grapes has a similar small and trendy neighborhood bar feel. However, Rott n' Grapes is much better. It opens up to a cute patio area which allows the small space to feel cozy without being claustrophobic. \n\nThey have a large wine, beer and cider selection. And the bar tenders were really helpful when it came to making suggestions.\n\nA couple of months ago, the owners had a wine tasting at my apartment complex. They did a great job making the event fun and informative.
