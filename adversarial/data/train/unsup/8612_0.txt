I can't believe I've never stopped in here to have lunch before. This restaurant is family owned, laid back, and the owner personally serves you. \nBut let's talk about the food. I ordered the chicken pita for $7.95 and when my friend told me the portion was generous- she was not kidding!  We shared the entree and there was still enough left over for me to take home for another meal!  \nThe chicken breast cubed were tender and full of flavor. Look at the photos- you will not be disappointed by the food served here. And the lunch specials come with a side salad and a drink. All for $7.95!  \nI will definitely be back again. And again and again!  Hidden gem!!!
