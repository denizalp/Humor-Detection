The best! Booked my first outside-of-Boston tattoo here because my favorite and trusted tattooers in Boston told me to. \n\nThe building that this shop is in is soooo beautiful - I know that doesn't matter, but it also doesn't hurt. What DOES matter is the talent of the artists, and that's where Made to Last really stands out.\n\nChris tattooed me last night and I was one of those obnoxious clients who has a vague idea of what I want, wants to add on to something I already have, and is just generally unclear about the details. Somehow Chris managed to read my mind and figure out exactly what I wanted before I even knew exactly what I wanted. He was also honest - wasn't just trying to please my ignorant ass, but actually used his expertise to let me know what aspects of my imagined-tattoo just wouldn't work. \n\nOn top of all that, he created a perfect tattoo that is unbelievably detailed, perfectly sized, and will only look better with time. I can't believe how beautiful it is. \n\nOne hesitation that I had about Made to Last was that it was going to be prohibitively expensive. They are so well-known and respected that I assumed the hourly rates would be sky-high. They weren't. The cost of my tattoo last night was beyond reasonable, and I hope I tipped well enough to show my appreciation. \n\nSo glad to have such an exceptional shop here in my new city.
