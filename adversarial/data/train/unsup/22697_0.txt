3.5 Star\n\nBig Jack's Burger is the newest Burger Joint in town.  Seems like \"gourmet\" burger is the thing now in the area.\n\n5oz AAA Certified Angus Brisket, Ground Fresh Daily on Site\n\nA basic burger for $5.99 is on the pricey side as a combo will be another $4.49 on top. The Big One is $13.99 with double patties, double bacon and egg...\n\nSmell of meat can be intoxicating inside on a hot day, I smelled like meat while waiting for my burger to be ready. Luckily there is some outside seating for me to enjoy my lunch.\n\nBasic Burger ($5.99) & Fries ($2.49)  \n- The patty was really good with a good texture and I can in fact taste the beef itself\n- Choice of whole wheat and white bun\n- Standard toppings aside from sauted onion and you pick when you place your order\n- I finished my burger and I just comfortably full, so if you are a bigger appetite, Double Burger and extra meat toppings （bacon, peameal, pulled pork, egg）maybe the way to go\n\nService is friendly but expect a longer wait time during lunch rush.
