Went here for brunch this morning (Sunday) and there were a few things that diminished the experience for me:\n* You claim New Mexican grub and then you charge for chips and salsa or sopapillas which are standard complements to any New Mexican restaurant meal.\n* At $3, the coffee is  a rip off! Seriously? We're not talking cappuccino, people and you're selling build-your-own Bloody Marys for the same price!\n* The carne adovada was tender but not very spicy.\n\nThat said:\n* The green salsa was really good.\n* I'm so desperate for carne adovada, I'll settle. (besides, $9 is more than a fair price for 3 eggs, black beans and carne adovada in a bowl on a flour tortilla - even if it was more beans than pork.)\n* There are several options for $5; and, if they are all like the eggs benedict, they are generous portions.\n* The patio is nice and the bar area feels like a neighborhood pub (not a cave, but that's not got to be a bad thing!)
