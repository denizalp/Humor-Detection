I tried to book a hotel in a different area however due to some local events the hotels were booked. So i searched in the IHG (Holiday Inn Group) of hotels so that I could accrue some rewards points for my stay.\n\nI lucked out when I found this Staybridge. It had recently opened and the pricing was better than otherd in the area. Maybe to get some new customers in the door..who knows but they got me!\n\nIt was super easy to find. It was just a bit off of McKee Road. Not too far from Buffalo Wild Wings. They have a small parking lot.  \n\nOnce I went inside, I was impressed. This hotel is new! Only been open for three weeks.\n\nWe were greeted by a super friendly staff. The lobby was clean and inviting with a fireplace.\n\nThe lobby lounge area is nice. The breakfast bar is located right by the sitting area. Off to the left side near the elevators is a small theater! This hotel also has a indoor swimming pool, an small outdoor basket ball court, a gym and an outdoor seating area with a firepit.\n\nNot bad amenities!! Itd almost like a staycation to be a guest here.\n\nNear the front desk is a snack\/sundrie area..in case you need some food or other personal items. I liked it since they had several local craft beers and wine!\n\nThe room was clean and nice. We stayed in a suite with a full suzed fridge, stove, kitchenwsre for cooking, dish soap, microwave, and the bathroom area even had a laundry basket.\n\nI would stay here again!
