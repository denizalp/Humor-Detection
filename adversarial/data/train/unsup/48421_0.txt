Good relaxed environment, food is good, drinks are quaffable. After dinner rush, the crowd is late 20's to mid 30's. Great place to have an drink and a conversation. Only reason I have it 3 stars is because drinks are priced as premium but don't reflect the quality. Example I ordered a whiskey sour and got margarita mix and bourbon that was around $8. Had I know I would have stuck to the beer.
