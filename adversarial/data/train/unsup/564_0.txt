THIS INVOLVES BOTH BALLANTYNE  AND WEDDINGTON LOCATIONS\n\nWho kicks out a family of 4 on EASTER SUNDAY from service??????? Who....ELEVATION CHURCH....that's who!!!\n\nI just moved to Charlotte a few months ago with my husband and our 2.5 year old and 10 month old. We are looking for a church to become our home and heard good things about Elevation, so we decided to check it out on Easter Sunday. We attempted to visit the Ballantyne location, but after arriving, we were redirected to the the Weddington location because there wasn't any room.\n\nAs soon as we pulled up, we were greeted with a kind hello. All 4 of us made our way out of the car and headed toward the building. Before we got in, someone approached us right away to see if we wanted to leave our infant and baby toddler with them. We smiled and said no...we would like for our babies to enjoy the message and Easter Holiday Service with us. Plus, we have never been there before, and we just moved to the state a few months ago. We made our way into the auditorium and they gave us 2 seats for 4 people. We also had a baby carseat with us, diaper bag, heavy blanket, and everyone was wearing a coat, so we had to hold the babies and all of our belongings in our laps. \n\nAbout 7 minutes into the service, another person approached us in the dark and whispered \"would you like me to take your child?\" My husband kindly said \"NO\" again. At this time, I began to feel uncomfortable. Our children were not being disruptive. My 2.5 year old was almost asleep on my chest, and my 10 month old wasn't making a peep! No crying or anything!!! \n\nWe sat for about 35 minutes before another person came up to us and said \"I need to take your children\". My husband said, \"I already told the other person that our children will be staying with us\". Then the guy said, \"I'm going to have to ask you to leave\"!!!! I COULD NOT BELIEVE THIS!! THEY WERE ACTUALLY KICKING US OUT OF CHURCH BECAUSE WE WANTED TO KEEP OUR BABIES WITH US!!!! Again, I will be the first person to admit if my children were being fussy, or disruptive, but THEY WEREN'T!!!! If anything, they were the ones being disruptive by continuing to bother us during the service. I could not believe and STILL CAN'T believe that we were kicked out of CHURCH on EASTER Sunday!!!!\n\nWe quickly grabbed all of our belongings and hauled tailed out of that place! WE WILL NEVER STEP FOOT IN ANY ELEVATION CHURCH AGAIN AND WANT TO WARN ANY FAMILIES WITH YOUNG KIDS TO STAY AWAY unless you like going to 2 locations, just to be turned away from 1, and kicked out of the other!!!!!
