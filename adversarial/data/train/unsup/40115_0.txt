Creative, high quality, deliciously homemade ice pop treats. If it isn't too hot out, they have a patio you can enjoy your ice pop on. Their flavors range from traditional to quite unique.m- chocolate, cucumber lemonade, pina colada, etc. Reasonable prices. My 3 year old loves picking out his ice pop. They also offered samples for those of you who are like me and cannot decide. What a sweet little local business. Will surely return
