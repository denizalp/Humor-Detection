New dumpling resturant, not sure if anyone else can recommend other dumpling resturants but this is very delicious. \n\nI brought my friends from LA here and they enjoyed it too!\n\nThe decorations are red and flowers as seen in pictures. They have private rooms: party size and large.\n\nMust order: lamb dumplings!! You can't go wrong with it!\n\nParking is a bit limited but there is some in the back.\n\nLocal mom and pop resturant! I support local restaurants!
