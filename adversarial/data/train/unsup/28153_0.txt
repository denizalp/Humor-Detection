The stars say it all, \"As good as it gets!\" I love this Ventinary clinic and have been taking my fur babies here since 2005. I live in Mountains Edge and drive the distance because it is well worth it. Dr. Ulitchney and his wife are both vets here with exceptional knowlege. I've had on the spot developed xrays done for my yorkie for reasonable prices. I truly believe Dr. U cares about the health of our pets and doesn't try to upsell anything, as a matter of fact he suggested to wait on a cleaning until they have their summer specials when I was willing to do it at full price. Don't let the older building structure fool you, it's a spectacular clinic. Older yes, but that just proves they've been around a long time, stable, reliable, consistant and shows they probably invest their capital in their high tech equipment and resources. Have I mentioned I LOVE THIS CLINIC! ? Oh, and I've used their boarding services during the holidays for my other dog and he comes home with a bath and doesn't seem traumatized. \n\nOffice visits are free with vaccincations but range from $10-$25 for checkups. \n\nRabies canine vaccines for 3yr are $35 \nBordetella canine $35 \nInfluenza $24\n\nFeline average three vaccines are $75\nRabies\nFeline Lukemia\nFCRP \n\nBoarding starts at $15\/day for small\/med dogs\n*Pricing is from my recent experiences*
