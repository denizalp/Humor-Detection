I had my first pool built by Dolphin and aside from typical problems over the years it was a good pool. I tried to have them design a pool for my new house so I filled out the online information and received a call with in about an hour to ask me who referred me to them and I told the lady that I did since they had built my last pool, she said great and she would get a designer on the phone then came back on and said that the designer was on the phone and she would have him call me back, which after about 6 weeks I am now convinced that it will never happen. I have talked to other companies since who have followed through and are very interested in having my business so I will no longer be even interested in getting a quote.
