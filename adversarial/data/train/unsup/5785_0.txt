I have lived down the street from this place for ELEVEN YEARS, but never went in until yesterday. I needed a tuxedo for a weird sort of lesbo-chic photo shoot, where I would be wearing a purple 80s bridesmaid dress and another female model would be wearing a tux. The other model was too busy to go to the tux place, so the photographer asked me to do it.\n\nA SUPER-friendly, helpful kid named Zach helped me try on all kindsa creepy mini-tuxedos that must have been designed for teenage boys or something, because they fit me perfectly. Then he helped me find the right shade of purple for the bowtie\/cummerbund....and this was going off a shitty cell phone pic I had of the dress.\n\nThe photo shoot isn't until the end of the month, but I'll be sure to post a pic here... so you can see Zach's fabuous work. The rental is going to be $100 for the day...not bad at all!\n\nThis shop was clean, well-lit, and VERY well staffed! Check it out!
