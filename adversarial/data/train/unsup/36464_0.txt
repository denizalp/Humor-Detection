Clean and inviting dining room, fresh ingredients, nice staff. I had a DIY burrito for $10. They offer plenty of protein, I had ahi tuna, salmon, and spicy tuna with a ton of veggies, and a delicious spicy mayo. They also offered free infused water, today it was like and mint. I don't get to Henderson that often, but I will remember this place when I am in the neighborhood. I frequent other sushi burrito shops in town that are a couple dollars less per burrito than this shop, but here they give generous scoops of protein, and you can choose 3 different types per burrito, so I think it is worth it!
