Been to this Jewish Bakery twice in the last 2 months, and they have delicious selections. \n\nIt's a nice family run Bakery that offers bagels, donuts, russian chocolate babka, challah, round cheesecakes, white & black cookies, all of which are to die for.\n\nI've been here early in morning and early afternoons, and both times there was a line that moves quickly, as they have 3 people working.\n\nThere are plenty to choose from. Everything we got was delicious and inexpensive. It's a must try.
