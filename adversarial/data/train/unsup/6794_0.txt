Horrible food, horrible service! We found  a hair in the rice!  And the owner would not even discount the dinner after we sent it back.  They are understaffed, and who does work there can't even speak or understand English! If your looking for true Cuban food I would PASS on this dump!!!!!! Dirty too no hand soap in the bathrooms so how are the workers washing there hands after they go to the restroom?!  I wish I could give this a Minus star, doesn't deserve a forth of one!
