DO NOT GO TO THIS HOSPITAL!!!! \nI have never had to write a bad review like this in my life... or such a novel! I am completely disgusted by this hospital! \n\nIf you don't feel like reading the whole thing scroll down to the bottom to the last few parts. \n\nMy dad was having chest pressure, so he was rushed him to Sunrise last week. \n\nMy dad spent 5 hours in the ER until a room became available. \nThe OOU was great, a real bathroom, nice nurses (Jennifer is the best nurse they have, the only reason I would give them any stars!) that knew that they are doing and came seconds after called, great communication with staff, and a comfortable bed. \n\n12 hours later he was moved to the CMU.\n\nToilet comes out of a cabinet, no privacy, \nUncomfortable bed. \n\nMy dad was unable to sleep for almost 50 hours, had one small meal before being put on a 20 hour fast because the procedure he had to have done was delayed for six hours. He was on the verge of fainting and all the nurses could do was say \"sorry.\" He was suffering! No one cared. \n\nSome of the night nurses are the most unfriendly people I have ever met. They also take forever to come and complain about their job. They use the excuse that because they are on \"graveyard\" shift they're unable to perform their tasks up to standards because they are tired.\n\nOne of my dads 3 IV's was defective and his hand swelled up with blood thinner (imagine taking a latex gloves and filling it with water... it was huge!) The nurse came in and she tried to put an IV in my dad's other arm (which he did not need because he had an extra available since only two of the three were being used) which she couldn't do, so she left my dad with blood going down his arm for 30 minutes to go find another nurse. When I asked one of the nurses sitting at the desk in the hallway if she knew where the nurse was after 20 minutes she gave me attitude and said why don't you just call her... which I had been doing. \nAnd the nurse finally came back with the other nurse. It took an hour to fix my dads IV, when the second nurse put the new IV into my dad's other arm he screamed because it was so painful. \n\nThe second nurse racially profiled my dad for being middle eastern... That was probably the most uncomfortable part. \n\nI complained to the head nurse that morning, and told her not to assign them to my dad again. \n\nMy dad had a procedure done in the Cath Lab. I sat in the lobby for 3 hours, Doctor never came to talk to me. When I called the lab which I was told to do, I had a rude nurse on the phone who wouldn't tell me anything.\n\nAfter his procedure he was not allowed to do anything other than lie flat for 6 hours and he wasn't able to go to sleep. I had to keep him awake (after he had already been awake almost 50 hours at this point) and watch him, because none of the nurses did that. He was allowed to eat, but because he was lying flat there was no way for him to eat solid food, so I had to go and get him a smoothie in order for him to have some kind of nourishment at this point. \n\nHe was absolutely miserable. \nWhen he was finally able to eat, it was food that he should've been given for a \"heart healthy meal.\"\n\nThe next day my dad sat around and waited for the Doctor, who finally showed up to tell my dad he needed another procedure, because the one that they did didn't show enough. (Even though we had spoken to the doctor about the fact that the procedure would not work because of my dads past quadruple bypass)\n\n\nAt this point my dad had had it! He was able to get discharged after speaking to his cardiologist. Which took the entire day he didn't get released until 6 PM last Thursday. \n\nThe part that probably upset both of us the most was the fact that the doctor never told my dad what was wrong with him. A few hours before being discharged the nurse told us he had a heart attack... no one said that to him in the entire time he had been at the hospital. According to his cardiologist that was incorrect, he did not have a heart attack. \n\nI have never seen such abuse, neglect, and lack of empathy in my life!\nThey don't listen, they don't care, and they don't think. \nMy family and I never want to step foot in this hospital ever again!\n\nIt has been four days since we have left the hospital, currently my dad has strep throat, a fever, and an ear infection. Which he did not have when he got there... \n\nAnd I have an eye infection! All I did there was take care of my dad. \n\nBefore you choose to go to Sunrise Hospital look at the other reviews! I've seen some that have similar situations to what happened to my dad!
