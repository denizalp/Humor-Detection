Wow, remember when this was the go-to place for ribs and chicken??? Went yesterday, the ribs were so skinny, like from a starving cow....nothing but none and sauce! What the heck....? Service was polite and prompt. Chicken was fine, fried....frozen variety. For 25.00 plus tax for bones and sauce? Save your money, the once iconic establishment has found a way to cut product and raise price. Actually, the prices are not the issue.....the quality....shameful.
