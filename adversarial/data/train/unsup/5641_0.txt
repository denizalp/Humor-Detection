Eva B, can we be besties for the resties? Your hippy dippy cool reminds me of what I want\/ed to be like in circa before mister baby (when I had more time.) \n\nAs you walk in there's someone stationed by the door to greet you\/answer any questions\/ check bags (I was traveling with a backpack and needed to leave it as I shopped.) Immediately the music playing seemed to make googly eyes with me then I saw a disco ball and my heart wasn't guarded. Don't worry though, my heart was not broken. For less than $85 I got 2 incredible winter coats which I could hardly tell if they've been worn before or not and seen similar styles for sale in a Free People catalog upwards of $300! Also,  2 scarves, dress, and a rad shawl were on the cheap ticket.\n\nDownstairs has a groovy cafe and porch with goods of plenty to explore. Upstairs, don't miss the enormous retro costumes and inspiring deck to hangout on.
