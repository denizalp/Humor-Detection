Jollibee, jolliebee, jolli-jolli-jollibee! If you dont me, that's my chant for when we are on our way to Jollibee. If you get the chance you must ask me to hear the tune! Now, all kidding aside, this place is worth the wait! When I originally showed up the line was about a 20 minute wait. They take your order in the line while you wait and then when you get into the restaurant they just punch it in. Heads up, there is a $60 max per person.\n\nI ordered the spicy chicken bucket, spaghetti combo, Yumburger and vermicelli noodles. My husband and I took it to go and we ate it at home. The chicken was delicious! It wasn't greasy on your hands as you ate it. The seasoning was perfect! My fav things were the spaghetti and Yumburger. The Yumburger was so yummy like later gator to the McDonald's cheeseburger! It's a must try. Whatever sauce is on it is what makes it. Spaghetti is super yummy, and was the one dish I was looking forward to trying. It was a nice balance of sweetness in the sauce and the noodles were not bad.  My husband said the vermicelli noodles were very good as well. \n\nIn short, everything was delicious and I don't even have a bad thing to say because everything was worth the wait and I will be going back shortly for some delicious goodness and i suggest you should to!
