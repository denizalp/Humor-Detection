I left my house on a nail polish mission today - I actually said to myself \"I refuse to go home until I've hunted down China Glaze Heli-Yum, dammit!\" And since CG polishes appear to be quite elusive in Toronto, or even Canada, I dreaded a day of traipsing through the city and coming home empty handed. \n\nAdmittedly Toronto Barber & Beauty wouldn't be the first to come to mind while on the hunt for nail polish, but they delivered. They sell lots of OPI ($8.99), Essie (I think $6) and China Glaze ($6.49) here. They also have the oft-mentioned on beauty blogs\/YouTube Seche Vite and Nail Tek (I picked up II and III conditioners, and they had gift sets of these for $11 that contained all three). Queen Helene in a tube is also available here for $6. \n\nMost of their hair products seemed fairly priced, but don't come here looking for deals on these - you'd be much better off checking out Shoppers, Winners or Beauty Supply Outlet (or that place on Yonge south of Wellesley that I can never remember the name of) for sub-$10 salon shampoos and styling products. CHI in particular was grossly overpriced - a bottle of Silk Infusion was $39.99, which I can buy at Winners or Shoppers a quarter of the price ($10-15). \n\nThere are also a bunch of hair dryers and flat irons here and they're all plugged in so you can actually test them out, but I didn't check the prices. If you dye your hair at home (don't), you can find every type of corrector, lifter and accelerator here, plus all the clips, bobby pins, rollers, gloves and other accessories needed to go along with it. \n\nStaff seemed catty.
