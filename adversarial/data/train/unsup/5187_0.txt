This dealership is wonderful (sarcasm) I would absolutely recommend this location to anyone who enjoys getting screwed over. The initial experience here starts out decent. Salesman is polite and of course whenever you plan a visit to a car dealership to buy a car you're expecting to be there for a couple hours right? Wrong. When planning a visit to Riverview Toyota (which I strongly recommend you DO NOT) expect your car buying process to take a minimum of 5 hours. \n\nAlso be prepared to have your first visit there for 5k \"maintenance\" (really only a tire rotation which I had drove over an hour for) be the absolute longest tire rotation of your life. I had waited nearly an hour for only a simple tire rotation which shouldn't have taken more than 10 minutes. This so called salesman promised to both my wife and I that we would receive oil changes every 5,000 miles for the first 2 years of owning the vehicle and shortly after greeting the service advisor we are told that only at 10,000 miles is when we will get the oil changed. \n\nI even asked to speak with the salesman who sold us the car and they had no idea who I was talking about like he never even worked there. I then asked to speak to a manager, \"Scott\" and even he was very rude and wouldn't even consider going through the paperwork to find where our salesman had written down that we would receive oil changes every 5k. Once again very unpleasant experience. Do yourself a favor and save yourself the time and energy and make your future purchases at literally any Nissan dealership. I know I won't be purchasing another Toyota at least not from Brent berg Riverview Toyota ever again. Nissan will always have lower apr and also better prices on their new cars even used cars. \n\nI DO NOT recommend anyone purchase a car from Riverview Toyota. Please please please save yourself the headache and precious time and STAY AWAY from this god forsaken place.
