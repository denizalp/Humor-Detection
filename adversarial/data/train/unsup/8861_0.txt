Owner has a real attitude issue and doesn't give a damn about customer satisfaction.  Out and out called me a lair on the phone when I complained about the poor quality of his class.  Very smug man - seemed to think because he has been in biz 10 years he'll be in biz another 10.  Not with this attitude towards his clients.  I say don't even consider dance lessons there.
