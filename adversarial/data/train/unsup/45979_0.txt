I went to Emily to have my shih-tzu Mila groomed at the east side location and I am IN LOVE with her haircut. She did such a great job and my dog felt very comfortable with her. I also took my chihuahua Lily to get her nails trimmed and she did great as well!! Usually she wont let me touch her feet but she sat great for Emily! I will definitely be taking my dogs back to her and this place! Highly recommend! :)
