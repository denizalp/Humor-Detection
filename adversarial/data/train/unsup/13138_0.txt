We decided to come here on a warm day in February to spend some time by the lake.  Unfortunately, as soon as we arrived we noticed a flock of seagulls swarming above the outdoor bar.  We tried to ignore them but a gull swooped down near my head and knocked a glass of water all over my lap.  Oh well, we laughed it off and kept drinking.  About 30 minutes later another gull pooped on my coat.  Hahaha, oh man, this place sure does have a lot of birds.  About 5 minutes later another gull pooped on my father-in-law's hat, my hair and my shirt. \n\nMoral of the story, spill my drink once- shame on me.  Shit on me once- shame on you.  Shit on me twice-we're getting the flock outta here.  \n\nThankfully, they were very nice and got us our bill quickly and gave us our food for free.  Don't know if we'd ever come back to enjoy the outdoor bar unless they do something about all the seagulls.
