I liked the Hash Kitchen - but, I do think the presentation looks better than the taste. Not that I'm saying the food was bad, but it wasn't spectacular and when I got my plate, it looked spectacular so I was expecting just that.\n\nHubby ordered the Mexicana scrambler and I ordered the Herb Chicken Waffle. They do not skimp on the chicken, but I thought it was slightly bland without the syrup. \n\nWe came on a Tuesday afternoon so the place was quiet and calm, but our waitress said that the place is packed on the weekends. They have a Bloody Mary bar and I really liked how open and bright the restaurant was during the day.\n\nOverall, I don't plan to come back because I'm rarely around this part of town but really glad I tried it. Total of Bill: a little over $24
