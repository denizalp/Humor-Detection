I was super excited to try this please out, mainly because I always get a crack outta the name (yes I am immature.) ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯ \n\nSUPER CHEAP prices and the portions don't reflect their price at all because they give you more than enough. I decided to get the noodle soup with the white meat fried chicken with a side of roti. SO HEARTY; I originally wanted the dark meat fried chicken, but they were currently out, but the white meat fried chicken was still so good. The noodle soup was MASSIVE, but I enk nded up finishing it all because the broth was tasty and comforting for the cold weather. I also tried their salt and pepper chicken wings--YOU HAVE TO TRY IT OUT. I honestly can say they are the best chicken wings in town. ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯ \n\nThe service was awesome, our waiter was attentive and friendly.\n\nFriendly note: the plaza that it's located in is always super packed, so parking is a bitch to find~\n\nI am so looking forward to my next visit to Big Wong!
