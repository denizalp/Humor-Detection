Came here for both brunch and another day for dinner. I like their fried chicken. I had chicken and waffles for brunch and then just the Fried chicken for dinner. there batter is a bit strong. You can sometimes taste garam masala or whole ground \n black pepper in the batter and the gravy. I enjoyed their cookie and ice cream dessert.  Great coleslaw too. Small but cute space. Not too busy. Open very late so that's a plus.
