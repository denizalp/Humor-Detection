I am surprised to see that I have not yet Yelped this TJ's.\nThis is quite close to me and I have been going here for years.\nI always love it . \nIt is clean,and well laid out. They are always there to help you find what you are looking for. Fruit is great, although sometimes you cannot always get what you want. I think they go more for what is in season. You cannot complain about that.\nI have tried a many item here. Some are amazily fantastic. Like the Italian finger cookies we got there once. That is the best Finger cookies that I have ever found in the Valley.\nI even got some the last time I was in San Diego, they could not compare.\nMy sister even shops here all the time.\nThey seem to always have some type of sample for something going on most days.\nParking can be tricky, so you have to watch the cars around you when pulling out.\nStore is clean and well stocked.\nBut, as I have been told, read the labels.
