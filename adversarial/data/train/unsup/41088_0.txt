The Living Room is a great little place in Chandler.  It is not as busy as it once was, which isn't really a bad thing when you are trying to get a seat at the bar.  \nIt is a cool place to watch the monsoons roll in.\nThe new menu has some nice additions ( lettuce wraps are amazing).  I am not sure what happened to weekend breakfast service, everything on the breakfast menu was outstanding.  Maybe it will come back in fall (hint hint).\nIt is a great place for a date, or happy hour.  It is definitely worth a try!
