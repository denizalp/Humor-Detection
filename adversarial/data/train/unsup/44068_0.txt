the food was good and fresh and wait staff pleasant. i didn't Gush over anything Enough to make me have to go back and the prices I think in my opinion included the ambience which is kind of a \"Lalala\" feeling. $$$ for the price i expected to\nbe wowed more not so in my case. this was a one and one for me.
