(Lyrics - The Cranberries - Linger)\n\nIf you, if you could return, don't let it wait, don't let it fade\nI'm sure you're not being rude, and it's just your atmosphere,\nIt's teasing me to stay, I want to try everything.\n\nI ate, I ate and it was good, and cocktails, oh yes so good.\nSo why am I holding back? Is that the way I stand?\n\nI'm Bo Biting all the time, Yelp is just a game to me\nBut I'm in so deep. You know I'm such a fool for you.\nYou got me wrapped around your finger fries, ha, ha.\n\nDo I have to go to Linger? Do I have to, do I have to,\nDo I have to let it Linger (Longer Lounge)\n\n\nSpinning DJ, board game hoorahs, local draft beers, and cocktail specials; the linger indeed I shall and a littler longer as I lounge!  I finally made my way to this little gem.  At first the appearance of the place didn't seem to be happening and a little sketchy, but once I came in I realize this was definitely a spot I could relax and enjoy and few with some friends and be fine.\n\nI ordered a draft IPA and shared the Prosciutto Grilled Cheese with fried zucchini with a friend.  A gal pal of mines went for the loaded fries which was all shared with the table.  The prosciutto grilled cheese was perfectly cooked; crunchy bread with warm melting cheese within, while the prosciutto provided a subtle saltiness to the sandwich.  The zucchini fries came along with ketchup and I believe to be a chipotle mayo.  I didn't care for it at all since I couldn't really taste the zucchini, but instead a crunchy mess.  The loaded fries were the star of the night.  Thick cut fries with jalapeno queso, bacon, chorizo, scallions, sour cream, and an over-easy egg.  What's not good with bacon and cheese!  With a hint of heat provided by the jalapeno and chorizo; boy my love handles are hating me, but damn it was good!\n\nIn the end, Linger Longer Lounge is a nice local bar with some lively pop to my surprise.  I rather enjoy the small town feel, but big town crowd.  The food is a hit or miss, but definitely not the loaded fries! - Enjoy!
