I'm a fan of dive bars and good pizza. Put them together and you have a winner winner drunk pizza dinner! Naked Pizza is open until 3am. My friend and I got there around 1:30am, sat up at the bar and played video poker while our pizza was being made. \n\nPizza dough is thick but light, not too doughy and did a good job absorbing some of the alcohol so we could keep drinking. There was a good amount of cheese and toppings on it. As other Yelpers have mentioned this place is a dive so bring your expectations down a notch and you'll be fine. Bonus: our bartender, Leo, was super cool and made us a drink to go (we cabbed it).
