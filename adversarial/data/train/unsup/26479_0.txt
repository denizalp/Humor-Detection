I came to eggs and I on a Sunday morning. Their staff was very attentive and my meal which was a Florentine eggs Benedict was cooked perfectly. Our coffee and water cups were constantly refilled and our waitress was very friendly. However I wasn't very fond of the endless country music they played. Overall they serve a delicious breakfast at a very reasonable price. I will definitely come back and bring my dogs with me next time since they have a dog friendly patio.
