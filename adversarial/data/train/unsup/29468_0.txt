I literally fly from San Francisco to go to Dreamworx to get my tattoos done. Initially it was because of the amazing artist, Lu, who helped bring my vision to life, but I will return because of the whole team here who made my feel comfortable and welcomed (despite keeping them open quite late because the tattoo was taking way longer than anticipated - my fault). They are no bull shop that's clean, up to date with latest tech, and will share there expertise with you - even if you may not like what they have to say. I'd rather an artist tell me the unfiltered opinion based on their experience rather than someone who will let me get a tattoo that may not age well (for example). \n\nAfter having been to several tattoo shops and over 30 hours tattoos getting done, I will continue to plan trips to work on my big pieces here and with Lu.
