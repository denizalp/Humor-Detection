Lawrenceville is already pretty dog-friendly but this dog park is a fantastic addition to the area, down by Three Rivers Heritage trail near the 40th street bridge. There's separate areas for medium\/big dogs and small\/infirm dogs. I really like that the big area has a small forested area that the pups can explore, rather than having cleared out all the natural foliage.\n\nSo far, the dogs and owners have been well-behaved when we've visited. Everyone's pleasant and it's great to talk dog-shop with other owners while the boys and girls socialize (ie, sniff various body parts).
