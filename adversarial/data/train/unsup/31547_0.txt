This place was the bomb! Hand-down the greatest place we ate at during my trip to Vegas!\n\nBooking was done easily through Open Table. FYI if you make a reservation, give yourself some time as the location is a bit hard to find in the maze of it all the other shops.\n\nFood was amazing. I was really blown away by some of the dishes we had.\n\nJAPANESE A5 WAGYU BEEF GYOZA 10\/10\nGet this!!! To this day, I still crave this wagyu dish. All of the elements of this the dumplings worked extremely well together with the sweet puree cutting through the juiciness of the beef. My friend loved this so much so ordered her own dish so she didn't have to share with me (lol)! When she finished, she ordered another one! Highly recommend!\n\nASEVICHADO 9\/10\nThis roll was delicious, there were little bits of truffle on top of the roll which was unique and gave it a really good flavour. It has different pieces of fish on top so there was variety in between each bite. \n\nUNI NIGIRI 10\/10\nFresh uni with the perfect ratio of uni to rice. I loved this!\n\nHAMACHI NIGIRI 10\/10\nExtremely fresh and very sweet fish on top of the rice. \n\nSASA HANDROLL 4\/10\nI felt like I ordered this because a lot of yelp-ers recommended it. It was OK to me. I couldn't finish it, the price doesn't justify what you get which is mostly quinoa. I would not order this again. \n\nCRISPY TAQUITOS - A5 WAGYU 6\/10 (FREE!)\nThis was complimentary. Because we raved about the waygu gyozas, the host or manager went out of his way so that we could also try these mini tacos. We were pleasantly surprised and impressed with the service.\nThey were good, but nothing to write home about. Get the gyozas!\n\nSCALLOP DISH 7\/10 (FREE!)\nThis was complimentary. I enjoyed this. Again, extremely fresh seafood and very unique seasoning. My preference though is that simple is best, and I do prefer my scallops more plain. \n\nService was top-notch. The manager came by several times to ask us how we liked the food. He knew we came from Canada and made good conversation. I loved the food. I would return for the gyozas and the nigiri. I'd love to try more nigiri and the grilled fish skewers!
