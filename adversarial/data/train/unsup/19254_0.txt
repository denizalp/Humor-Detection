I work in the auto industry, and I came to DC Auto Luxury Window Tinting instead of using the in-house tint shop we have. \n\nI knew they would pay more attention to my windows and the tint job, and they did just that! \n\nI have a 2 door vehicle and it's a fact it's hard to get in and out of the back seats. These guys did an amazing job and I would definitely come here again for my next car. I recommend this place to anyone that wants a quality tint job for a good price and a quick and easy process. \n\nHow it all went:\n\n1. I called and set up an appointment\n2. Walked in DC Auto Luxury Window Tinting for my appointment \n3. Greeted by my first name from a friendly smile behind the receptionist desk. \n4. Told me about my 3 to 4 options on tint quality and the differences. Once tint quality was narrowed down she then showed me the 3 to 4 different shades that I could pick from. (great experience from the norm up-selling side of the road tint shops) \n5. Picked my tint, and then waited for about 4 hours. (left and came back when they called me) \n6. Picked up my car and it looked great!\n\nSo far its been about 3 months and there are no bubbles or smudges but if there were, the people at DC said they would re-do it for no charge! \n\nGreat job, great people, great deal....what else could you ask for? \n\nMaybe a popcorn machine in the waiting room... Yes that's what's missing!!
