Las vegas pest control is great and gets rid of all my nasty critters. One monthly fee and they come out whenever we need them. Our bug guy is Zack (or might be spelled zach) and he is amazing! Alway right on time, quick, and very friendly. Even takes the time to stop and say hi to my kids! Great service all around!
