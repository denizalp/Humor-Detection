Don't be fooled!  Biggest scam ever!  The condo was great and we got an awesome deal thru RCI for only $149 for the whole week - BUT.....\nWe've been to many timeshare presentation and were determined not to waste our time. The lady at the front desk offered us show tickets or $80 cash and 2 breakfast buffets. We told her we don't have time to waste on a presentation. She assured us multiple times in writing that there \"no time commitment , no presentation or video\". She even gave it to us in writing and circled \"no time commitment\" -  well 3 1\/2 hours later we were still being held captive and told we could not leave. \nThis was the biggest waste of our time ever and they would not take no for an answer and passed us off from one rep to another hoping one could convince us to buy\nIn the end our \"punishment\" was to wait in a big room to receive our gift where there was already about 10 other couples waiting to be called\nThe final insult was when we requested a late checkout due the presentation that started at 8:30 and they were going to charge us a fee!!\nHorrible experience- the condos are nice if you can stay clear of any sales reps no matter what they promise! Don't believe anything they say!
