This place is solid.  Not amazing, but solid.  Its actually owned by a Korean family and not a Japanese family - and you'll notice it in the details but overall we had a good experience here.   We ordered a lot of things which ranged in flavor and quality.  Here is the skinny...\nRice:fish ratio (sushi only) - perfect\nFish quality - ok to excellent; salmon and yellowtail were ok - yellowtail belly, large scallops and  mirugai were excellent.  \nRolls were ok  - we had two specialty rolls; most of them come as \"spicy\" which I personally don't enjoy. \nTempura veggies:  excellent.\n\nThe service was great.  The restaurant was clean...will most likely become our new neighborhood sushi joint.  Glad to have found this place with the help of my fellow yelpers.
