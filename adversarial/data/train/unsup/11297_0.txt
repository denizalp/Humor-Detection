We love this pool, my man gets down before it gets too busy, 10 am, and grabs a couple prime of chairs in the sun.\nthe morning starts off chill and quite, by the time late afternoon rolls around, it is a loud, rocking party. We always make friends and enjoy ourselves wayyyy to much .....and that's a good thing !\nWaitress and bar staff are very good, a few 24 oz Pacifico's and we were feeling no pain.\nPlease don't get made at the staff when you show up at 1:00 pm and there are no chairs open... This is a very popular pool and it will fill up fast. \nJust lay back in the shallow water and enjoy the view :)
