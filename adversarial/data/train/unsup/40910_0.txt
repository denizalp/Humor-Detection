Similar vibe and menu selection as Honey Salt, which is why we chose it. Our waiter was the owner\/founder - very kind, friendly, and attentive - conversation with him was the cherry on top of a great meal. Great drink and appetizer selection, above all. Highly recommend the pesto gnocchi. Calm, open, friendly ambiance.
