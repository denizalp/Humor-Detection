Broestl and Wallis is the best jewelry store around. I am highly allergic to gold (no, gold is NOT hypoallergenic), palladium, cobalt, nickel and a number of other metals that are mixed with fine jewelry pieces to harden the metal. Needless to say I needed a real jeweler who knows what he's doing to reset my wedding rings with specific metals. Not only did Jeff Broestl reset my rings they look 500% better than they did when I first got them. He's a true artist! Not only that but I traded in all my other gold pieces (since I can't wear them) and got incredible prices and turned it in for credit toward my resetting. \nAnyways, my rings are spectacular, everyone there was incredible throughout the process and they have the best customer service. I also liked that when I went in and told them my situation they didn't immediately try to sell me something or upgrade my rings (all the other jewelry stores did just that and I hate that). They understood my issue and did the necessary research to ensure that I wouldn't have a reaction to the recast. Not only that but their prices are extremely reasonable. \nAfter I had such an incredible experience my mom went there and custom designed her new engagement and wedding rings. They came out absolutely beautiful - there's actually no words to describe how truly amazing the rings are that he's designed\/redesigned for us. \nI would recommend that any and everyone go here. They'll work with you and create the jewelry of your dreams at an affordable price!
