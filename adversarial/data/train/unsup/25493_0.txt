Our first waitress Page was great and the prices for happy Hour are really impressive, but the food did not match the prices. All drinks were half price, which made my 22oz beer only $7. They had about five food specials and those were either $5 or ten bucks. On the $10 side, we all had different sliders. The beef sliders came out incorrect and also undercooked, so back they went. The end result for those was just very average sliders. The crispy chicken and buffalo chicken sliders had mixed results. The chicken was a bit fatty for the crispy sliders, but the buffalo version was deemed good. Other dishes were the $5 hummus (decent) and the free order of brussels sprouts (Yelp check-in).  They also have all the baseball games available if you can find someone to change the station.\n   On a second visit, we had to walk out as the bartender was a straight-up cocky fool, refusing to change the TV station and asking us if we had been there before. That question should not be asked unless your at a place that is different or exciting, not just a normal restaurant where I look at a menu and order food and drinks.\n   Oh yeah at HH, watch out because the waitress asks what kind of fries you want with the sliders, but she doesn't tell you they cost about $5 extra. Luckily the manager took those fries off the bill.
