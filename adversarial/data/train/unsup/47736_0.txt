I chose Allegiant because they were new to Raleigh NC and wanted to save some money. As mentioned in most of the reviews the planes are older but the seats are comfortable but tight. The airline will charge you $2 for a drink and have snack options up to $10. The flight crew and pilots for both flights from Raleigh and New Orleans were polite and professional. \n\nAfter my experience with the ground staffing, I would recommend some training. Our flight leaving Raleigh was running late and there was no one at the gate to give any updates on when it was arriving. Many of the passengers were asking each other if they heard anything. It wasn't until the arrival time updated on my cell app that the board at the terminal also changed. It would have been nice to have someone there to pass on that information. \n\nLeaving New Orleans there was no one at the ticket counter for almost an hour. The line grew from 6 to over 30 while we all patiently waited for someone to show. There wasn't a sign or any information for when someone would start checking people in. All the other airlines had representatives at the desk checking in guests but I assume that Allegiant doesn't staff that position until 2 hours prior to flight. When the agent finally came out she walked very very slow and everyone could tell she was not happy to be there.\n\nIn the end I saved $250 on a family of 4, compared to Southwest. Next time, I will spend the extra money on a pleasant flight with a crew that WANTS you to be there.
