I'm always in search of pizza nirvana, and I had read about this place here on YELP.  Pizza lovers rejoice!  I'm happy to report that this pizza is 'the real deal'!  Freshly prepared and wood fired in front of your eyes (in just a few short minutes), it tastes like a proper pizza should - fresh and flavorful!  This pizza uniquely tastes like a cross between the best New York style and oven fired. The crust is just the right thickness, while crunchy on the outside (but not burnt) and fluffy and airy on the inside.  The cheese and tomato sauce are of the highest quality.   My only minor suggestion would be to offer 2 types of tomato sauce, since the one they use now is like a 'Marguerita' sauce, with actual fairly large chunks of tomato.  I would prefer the same tomato sauce, but with the largest chunks taken out (which I did), for those like me that don't like that chunky style of sauce.  Lastly, I ordered the plain cheese and tomato pizza because i'm a firm believer that when tasting a new pizza, it's best to first taste a plain pie, since a properly made pizza should stand on it's own just plain, with no toppings to alter the taste.  'Sauced' is now in my Top 5 pizza places for all of NE Ohio!
