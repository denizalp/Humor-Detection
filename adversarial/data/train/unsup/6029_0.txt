I like seafood. I like pizza. So I ordered the seafood pizza. Big mistake. I had been waiting about 20 minutes for it when the waitress informed me that it didn't look good, and she'd asked the cook to start over. It didn't look good? What does that mean? Sounded like she was looking out for me, though, so I didn't complain. Well, I don't know what the first one looked like, but it couldn't have been good if it looked worse than the second one, which arriving another 20 minutes later, kind of looked like... soup! Seafood pizza soup. The sauce (1 part tomato sauce \/ 3 parts water?) was actually dripping off the plate. I tried to pull out a slice and all I got was soggy crust, because all the toppings, cheese included, slid right off and landed with a splash. The shrimp were mushy, like little bad bananas. The squid (I think it was squid, but I don't know that for sure) tasted like pencil erasers. Really Gross (that's right, that's no typo, that's Gross with a capital 'G').
