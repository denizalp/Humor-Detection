I want to clarify, it's 5 stars if you don't eat at the restaurant. \n\nOur ears popped in the elevator to the 112th floor  my fiance, our reverend, photographer and my fiances friends\/ our witnesses looked at each other excitedly not knowing what kind of wedding this would be. Stratosphere was clearly designed with a nature to excite wonder and astonishment and having my wedding here truly embodied the Vegas wedding experience. \n\nService was prompt and punctual. The reverend and photographer showed up on time with a bottle of champagne for us to enjoy and our vouchers to a thrill ride of our choice. \n\nWe got to the 112th floor where our ceremony was to be held and I gasped in amazement. \"HOLY SH**!!!!!!\" I seriously yelled that when I saw the city of sin beneath us from such high altitude. Hell never looked so gorgeous! It was even more perfect that we exchanged vows so high up in the clouds that I actually felt like we were being wed right under God just high enough from Hell but still with the thrill of getting married in the sinful decadence that is the Vegas desert. \n\nThe reverend said such beautiful vows for us and made us laugh the entire time and it was one of the most memorable experiences I've ever had in my life. \n\nOur experience was topped off with a thrill ride that was scary enough to send me to the hospital and a meal of mediocrity at the restaurant, which is probably one of the weaker aspects of the stratosphere. \n\nOur first meal as a married couple was at the Stratosphere restaurant. The view was there but the food was lacking. Like I said: a meal of mediocrity. We ordered two filet mignon and when they finally arrived it was the source of all jokes. My husbands friends looked at our plates and laughed. Here is the string of jokes that followed: \n\n \"Well, when it said petite filet mignon I wasn't expecting MEDALLION\" \n\n\"The only way this would be acceptable is if it was wrapped with bacon\"\n\n\"This is literally bite sized\" I said, then proved it as I put the ENTIRE THING IN MY MOUTH and chewed through it. Our table erupted in laughter either shocked the steak was that small or my mouth was that big. \n\nI wanted to order dessert but decided if dessert was anything like the meal I'd be better off ...
