Not a huge fan of this chain (AKA Safeway in CA) for grocery shopping, but they're awesome for lunch- either picking up a variety of things to take to work or stopping in for a meal. Many options, fresh and flavorful.\n\nWhen you first walk in, there's an awkward food-court-style Panda Express. Ignore it.\nThere's a soup bar with delicious options- the tomato basil and potato are flavors I like, and their clam chowder is surprisingly legit, too.\nThere's a sandwich counter making quality subs, none of that Subway shit here! And also a fried chicken counter with sides and other options like corndogs and sometimes pizza.\n\nIf you want healthier options, head to the produce section. The refrigerated case has tons of salad bowl options, with and without protein. My favorites include the crab louie and the southwest. Calories are reasonable but each comes with a full size dressing packet that is way too much for the portion of salad. \n\nThe bakery has a lot of fresh and higher-end dessert options, especially compared to other grocery stores- pick up something to end your meal on a sweet note.
