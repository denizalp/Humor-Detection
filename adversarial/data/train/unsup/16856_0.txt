The menu is small but the drinks, food,  and service are grand! \n\n We ordered a mixer, BLL, nacho burger, cheeseburger,  and fries all for $25 plus tip. \n\nThe bartender\/cook was very accommodating with the mixer drink order seeing as we didn't know what we wanted,  he made a delicious and visually appealing drink in the fly.  They also have 4 beers on tap (Leiney, Bud light,  Miller, and Spotted cow).\n\nWe watched the Brewers game on one of five big screen TV s as well as our cook making our burgers with fresh,  raw ground beef that he molds with his hands before slapping it onto the sizzling grill. \n\nThe burgers come with chips and a pickle,  or you can upgrade to fries for $2.25. We chose to order basket of (krinkle) fries for $4.\n\nThe burgers were mountainous heaps of deli fresh soft buns,  lettuce and tomatoes (optional), cheese, and fixings.  \n\nI've never heard of nacho burgers before and now I wonder why no one else has them.  It came with black olives,  jalapenos,  warm nacho cheese, and bi-colored nacho chips! Simply phenomenal!  An explosion of flavors in your mouth.  We both commented on how juicy and flavorful the beef patties were.  \n\nThe bar and grill had decent amount of people on a Saturday night with more traffic arriving and only two staff.  They held their own and still delivered friendly and attentive service.\n\nI say, skip the chains in Greenway Station and presumptuous food on Parmenter St and saddle up at the Game Tome Bar & Grill!
