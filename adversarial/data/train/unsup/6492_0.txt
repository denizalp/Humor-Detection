I heard about this place for years! The location is a little of putting! but you get past that relatively quickly. THe 1920's style speakeasy knocks the ball out of the park! Starting with the Doormen, dressed to the nine's! We rented the back hidden room! For my sisters 50th birthday party! Which you needed a secret code word to get in.\n\nThe entertainment, atmosphere and outdoor patio were all incredible. The appetizers were well appointed and refreshed throughout the evening. \n\nThe bartender and bar back were dressed for the 1920's era. The drinks were great albeit expensive.\n\nCleveland you have really done a incredible job with this establishment, to the owners great job! Can't wait to visit again!
