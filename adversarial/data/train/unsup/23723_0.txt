This place is my fav to get a cheap steak dinner in Vegas. \n\nI passed this little Casino so many times and I never knew there was a  restaurant inside. I am so glad my friend told me about it 'cause I would have never known. When you walk in it is really smoky and there is a small bar to the right w\/ some shady characters, but they are harmless. A typical locals Casino with  people gambling & drinking during the day.  \n\nThe restaurant is small but looks like it has been recently remodeled. Compared to the rest of the Casino, the restaurant is suprisingly clean. They have 3 plasma TV's which makes the wait more bearable. That would be my only \"complaint\", the wait was a little long (there was only 1 other table) but it is worth it. The prices are so reasonable and if you are part of the players club you get a discount.\n\n\nThey have a 1\/3lb. steak special for 5.99. It comes with a roll, ear of corn, and baked potato or FF. It was so delicious, and cooked the way I ordered--med\/rare.\n\nIt's worth the trip.
