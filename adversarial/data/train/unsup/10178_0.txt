Based on one visit with friends, I found the food and service at this PF Chang's to be consistent with other PF Chang's restaurants.\n\nMy favorites are the \"Double Pan-Fried Noodles,\" Sweet and Sour Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and the Spare Ribs.\n\nPlate prices are generally less than $15 each. Portions are average sized.\n\nService was very friendly.
