Great place for a large group! Made reservations for a very large group (nearly 30) and needed to have separate checks, and they were very accommodating. The large open area near the bar fit us easily and the tables were set up thoughtfully to allow us to be together in a group but in such a way that it was easy to get up and move around. Food was excellent, and the servers were right on top of things all the way around from getting drinks served to bringing out everyone's food at the same time, and efficiently handling the separate checks without any of the confusion that so often accompanies dining in large groups. Well done!!!
