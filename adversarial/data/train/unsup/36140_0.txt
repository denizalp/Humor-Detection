The food was good, but the service was awful. First, they need a hostess because we walked in and stood around waiting awkwardly for someone to seat us. \n\nAfter we sat down it took 15 minutes before we were greeted. We literally had our order ready and waiting. Anyways, the food was great but the service was sloppy: I was served wine before my girlfriend, they did not bring a chiller for the bottle, and our server was MIA until the check came. \n\nThey can definitely be a legit spot, but they just need to clean up there act.
