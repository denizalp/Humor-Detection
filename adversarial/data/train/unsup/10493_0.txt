Went here for lunch on a Friday.  We walked in the right side, not realizing that was the cafe area.  Not one of the people who worked there, who were just standing around looking bored behind the counter, thought to dispel our confusion and point us the way to the hostess stand.  \n\nWe sat on the front patio, which was nice, aside from the street person harassing us for money.  I had the turkey club, which was okay.  The fries were pretty good.  My bf had the burger with no bun and the salad with no croutons.  Unfortunately his plate came out with the bun and with the croutons.  Not a big deal though.  \n\nThe service was just forehead-slapping terrible.  I could tell our server was a nice person and meant well, but it was like she was perma-stoned.  Just really oblivious and forgetful about stuff we had to ask for: silverware, salt\/pepper, giving us our check, picking our check back up, giving us boxes for leftovers.  \n\nOverall, pretty disappointing for all the hype I've been hearing.  Maybe I'll go back and avoid that server by sitting at the bar, but I'll have to find someone else to go with me bc my bf is disgusted with this place.
