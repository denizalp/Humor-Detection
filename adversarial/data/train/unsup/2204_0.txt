I haven't been at their new location since they've moved out of their original location, but the service and quality of food I received still leaves quite the impression. What really stood out to me was the personalized service from one of the owners, his name escapes me now. After ordering our two sandwiches (Egg for me and Patty Melt for my husband) and enjoying them outside, while laughing at how we were eating delicious food while sitting down facing the outside of a strip club and Las Vegas Blvd, the owner came and checked in on us. We had brought our own water bottle to share, but since it was a hot day, he handed us a cold water bottle from the back and told us a little bit about himself and the shop's story. I told him before having the Goodwich, I thought there were no great sandwich places in Vegas because I was used to all the good ones in the Bay Area, while Vegas seemed to just has Jimmy John's (he laughed - he said he still loved Jimmy John's since he grew up with it). He let us know their plans to expand and I'm glad to see that plan has come into fruition. I really need to make it out here again and see the new digs! Just looking at the Yelp photos is giving me hunger pangs!
