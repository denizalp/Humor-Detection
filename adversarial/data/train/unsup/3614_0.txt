Thrillist ranked Distill's Cure burger among the top 15 in the nation for 2014, describing it as \"a combo of beef AND pork, [that hits] so many flavor notes with Fontina, spicy-sweet jalape√±o jelly, a hot mayo, and crisp-fried parsnips layered on with a heavy hand.\"  \n\nThat burger completely fulfilled my burger desires and then some. It amazes me that this bar and this particular burger are not more popular, as it is a fantastic amalgamation of all the best flavors a burger should have: savory, cheesy, just a bit of spice. It's stuffed and juicy without falling apart, and every ingredient successfully harmonizes with the others. It's a hefty patty, and when assembled with all the fixings it's so tall it's difficult to bite into, and you will make a mess. But it will be worth it, because this is a damn good burger. And a unique one, at that!\n\nI am going to make a bold statement and declare this THE best burger in Las Vegas... for now. It's a competitive city for this title, but the Cure comes out on top.\n\nExcuse the god-awful blurry photos, my haste to devour this amazing meal apparently affected my picture-taking abilities. You'll have to see (and taste!) it for yourself.\n\nLink to original article:\nhttp:\/\/www.thrillist.com\/eat\/nation\/thrillist-s-best-new-burgers-2014
