This French cafe is run by French speaking staff, and is conveniently located near Central Tech.  I ordered the quiche and had an Americano to go.  Staff is courteous and knowledgeable about their products, which include packaged jams and cookies imported from France, as well as a wide variety of charcuterie and cheeses.\n\nEasily the best spot to grab a quick bite in this neighbourhood.
