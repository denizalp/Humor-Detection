While having a family dinner here tonight attempting to celebrate a birthday, an older gentleman came over to our table and threatened our family and small children out of nowhere. He kept trying to move himself closer to the children at the table and became aggressive when we wouldn't permit it. I wouldn't have thought any wrong doing from the restaurant except for the manager's response when he eventually came out to the ruckus. He explained to us that this man was a regular customer and was not right in the head. Dismissed us and when back to his office. I am concerned that this is a kid friendly restaurant where management isn't concerned with the safety of the small children or other paying customers.  We didn't even receive an apology. \nBe aware this is not a safe environment and this was an intense\/scary situation that I would not like to see happen to anyone else. Since again, this man is a regular customer and will be back. Police were called by my family, not the restaurant and I hope this man gets the help that he needs.
