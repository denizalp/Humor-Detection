I'm back at it again with the yummie Bonito.. I really like this place with the happy hour and the drinks are great. I love coming here it reminds me of the real deal LA food. I've been to other Mexican restaurants but this one just makes me want to come back for more. \n\nThe service is great. When we go there we try to go during happy hour. I always have to order the Ceviche, Street tacos (carne asada, carnitas and pastor), sopitos and Toreados con chorizo. The hubs just shares with me but like to order the guacamole and chips. But the drinks oh man I get the Paloma and margarita.  The hubs get the beer. The tacos are delish, reminds me of LA taco trucks. Love the home made sopitos.  It is made in house which is amazing. The Treados con chorizo is good but I think I would rather just have cheese but then that would be called Chili Relleno. Good stuff this place has. With great happy hour price can't beat that for Mexican food.
