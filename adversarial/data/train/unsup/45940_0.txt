I was skeptical after having issues with this Cleveland Clinic location in the past (questionable billing, difficulty getting appointments), but I took my 1 year old to the lab to get his blood drawn and it was a surprisingly good experience.  The two people on duty were professional and had experience dealing with very young children.  They called us back immediately even though others were waiting, and the whole process took less than 2 minutes.
