Went on a Saturday night to celebrate a friends birthday. The wait was understandable. Was asked for drinks promptly upon seating. Waitress did not return with the beverages until 15 or so minutes had passed. Another 10 minutes for the waitress to take our order. It was some time (another 25 minutes) until we actually got our food. The food was sub par for the price. Fries were room temperature. Chicken Alfredo was dry and not creamy. Spent more time waiting than eating. Bathroom was also a mess. Water on the counters, water on the floor. Thrash overflowing. This was our first time to this establishment and will definitely be the last. Would not recommend this place at all.
