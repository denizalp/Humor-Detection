With all of the hamburger and hot dog places clustered in Tempe, it takes a lot to stand out.\n\nDetroit Coney Grill has that special something.  The patties in their burgers are thin, but they offer a \"quint\" or five patty burger that is like a double burger elsewhere.  Absolutely fresh, delicious, and juicy.  Order it any way you like and you'll get it to your table quick and with a smile.\n\nWant more food?  You can get more patties--order 18 if you like and eat 'em if you can.  ASU students please take note--wanna do your own \"Man vs. Food?\"  Here's a delicious spot to do it!  Fries are fresh cut and tasty, and drinks are bottomless.  \n\nOne of the top burgers in Tempe--TRY IT.
