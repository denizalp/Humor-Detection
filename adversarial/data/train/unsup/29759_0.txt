I'm a big fan of the Keung's at Midland and Finch so it was only a matter of time before I gave this place a try as well.\n\nPros:\nVery good congee\nportions are very good\n\nCons:\nNot as big as the other Keung's\n\nCame here on a Sunday morning for breakfast.  We were originally going to go to a HK style cafe in the same plaza but all of them were super busy and we didn't want to wait for a table.  We were the first customers of the day so we had our choice on where to sit.  This Keung's is definitely not as big as the one I frequent at Finch and Midland.  After about 15 minutes, the place was basically full and anyone else coming in would have to wait.  The turnover time here is not as fast as a HK style cafe so it could be a wait depending on busy it is.  \n\nOn to the food.  The menu is the same one as the other Keung's so you'll know your way around if you already frequent that one.  I had the special salted pork bone congee which was on sale at the time.  My GF got the pork chop noodle.  We ordered some dough fritters for the congee as well.  My GF's noodle was pretty good.  She noted that they give you a lot of noodle.  The bowl is not the biggest, but they pack as much as they can.  \n\nOn to the congee. I'd have to say this was one of the best congee's I've ever had.  The salted pork bones they use give the congee a great bast taste.  The mustard greens give a contrast to the salty nature of the congee.  The pork bones themselves were a higher quality cut then you're garden variety ones you can find in a Chinese super market.  I'm not a fan of the preserved egg, but the congee was so good I didn't mind.  We ordered the super bowl size and for $8.99, it was worth every penny.\n\nAll in all, it was a nice experience.  It was a blessing in disguise that all the HK style cafe's were full and we ended up here.  I will definitely be back for the congee again when I'm craving it!
