If I could give this place zero stars I would. Steer clear of Mr Vac & Sew if you're looking to trade in an old vacuum for one of theirs. His inofrmation about trade ins is very misleading. I brought in a one year old vacuum to trade in on another and was told up front (I'll give the owner this much) that the trade values could range from $0 to $100. I found four vacuums that I was interested in and the owner told me that a trade in was not available...for any of them. Come on....FOUR DIFFERENT VACUUMS - FOUR DIFFERENT MODELS and no trade in allowance? When I asked why, the owner (a condescending, pompous, jerk) went off on a tangent about how low his prices were and that I'd never find a lower price vacuum. Um, that wasn't the question...my question was why won't you take my almost new trade in? Still no answer and continued to ATTEMPT to brow beat me as I'm walking out of his store with my vacuum ready to take it to another store that WILL HONOR trade ins. Oh, and by the way...your prices aren't that great. I found cheaper prices on the Shark's at Target.
