I guess I'm a little like Darren W.  I love CDs and books too.  I don't think there's anything wrong with ipods or ipads, etc.  But ya know what?  I'm old fashioned that way.  I actually like having a comprehensive music collection.  I like to actually sit and listen to a CD.  I like to have it in my hands to hold.  Besides what good is your itunes collection if something crashes?  \n\nWell with that in mind, I have over 300 CDs in my collection, spanning Alternative, Grunge, Folk\/Americana, Country & Western, New Wave\/80s, and Classic Rock.  And in the past ten years or so, you know how many I've bought new?  Almost zero!  Yeah, I've bought some from Amazon, but I love going to places like this and just simply browsing.  \n\nSo yesterday my friend Marla, my cousin Cindy, and I wandered down to Carson Street.  I can't speak for the other two babes, but I didn't know exactly what I was looking for.   But isn't that the great thing about used CD buying or vintage clothes shopping?  And you know something?  You can't get that joy of finding a rare import on your MP3 player!\n\nI found \"Here Comes the New Folk Underground\" by David Baerwald.  Now as you musicphiles know, David Baerwald was 1\/2 of the famous 80s one-hit-wonder David & David.  (David & David's hit was one of my favorite songs, \"Welcome to the Boomtown\").  I also found \"Train a Comin\" by Steve Earle, another one of my favorite artists.  And in a shout-out to a certain Yelp Yes fan from the Chicago area, I bought \"90125\" from Yes.  Cindy bought \"Yes Songs\".  Marla played it a little safer with a Doobie Brothers \"Greatest Hits\" collection.\n\nThis is a great place for a music fan.   Downloading should never replace the true joy of music shopping.  Oh yeah, they also sell concert tix here for local venues like Club Cafe.
