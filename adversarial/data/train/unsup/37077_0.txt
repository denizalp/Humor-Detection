I worked for tri-west for over a year and witnessed a ton of unethical behavior in the department that I worked. The company itself is not all bad, but they don't value hard work, raises were not given this past year even though the company opened several new offices. They care more about making a splash and looking good for the VA contract, then supporting The backbone of who makes that possible :their employees.\n\nThere was a new person who started that became very close to the supervisor of the department I worked in. Very quickly they developed a friendship and started hanging out outside of work and it became very clear that that person was going to be given special privileges to go into the supervisors office be on their cell phone which is against company policy, chat about personal life and sex life and boyfriends all of which could be heard even through a closed door and to get overtime win the rest of the staff was barely managing to have work to do during slow periods. It was unbelievable the amount of unethical behavior that took place between these two individuals, and later as I left the company found out with even more. This supervisor had personal friendships with people on the staff, which there is nothing wrong with, however she would share personal information such as white people were fired, with the people that were her \"friends \"this kind of behavior was brought up to HR and nothing was done. This woman still retains her job, and as far as I know to this point no disciplinary measures have been enacted. \n\nIt's unfortunate, because the department and the company was a great place to work until this individual came and got to start running the department and soon after, lo and behold, along with all the other special privileges, was given a promotion, and was given the only open leadership position that had come about in a years time.  \n\nWatch out for tri-west, because it is clear that if you make your concerns known, even as unethical as this is, it is very likely that it will get swept under the rug and nothing will be done about it.
