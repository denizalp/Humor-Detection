Earl of Sandwich is the epitome of the sandwich song.\n\nLet's refresh:\nSandwiches are beautiful,\nSandwiches are fine.\nI like sandwiches, I eat them all the time;\nI eat them for my supper and I eat them for my lunch;\nIf I had a hundred sandwiches, I'd eat them all at once.\n\nEarl of Sandwich is open 24\/7 serving up $6 sandwiches. That's a steal in Vegas. Yeah, sure it's not as stacked as Carnegie's or Greenberg's Deli...but it's still plenty delicious any time of day. I thoroughly enjoyed my Pastrami Reuben (my go-to at any sandwich spot). The bread was crisp and the filling was savory and delicious. I really can't complain.
