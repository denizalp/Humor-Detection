One of my absolute favorite bars! Sometimes a girl has had a stressful week, and needs to drink her body weight in liquor (easy to do if you're a basic bitch like me and get the actual punch bowl for just yourself). \n\nIt's ALWAYS busy here, but the bar tenders mean business. Your drinks come out fresh, fast, and delicious (and superrr strong- you get what you pay for!). \n\nThis is a multilevel bar WITH a bowling alley! I love hanging out upstairs because there's more of a chill vibe and less people judging you as you drink out of your bowl with a straw. Lol
