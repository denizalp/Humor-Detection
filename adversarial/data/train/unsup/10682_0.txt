After the fam had been here for my b-day celebration, K & I decided to stop by again for HH.\nWe stopped in on a Saturday while C's current play was in it's 4th performance. Finding HH on Saturdays is pretty tough but HTSB has one that runs till 6:30.\nK ordered a Coffee Bean Martini ($7) and I ordered a G&T ($5). Both drinks were tasty and our bartender was very personable.  Hanging at the bar with a complete view of the dining room was great. We watched as the bartenders created yummy looking drinks and the \"shucker\" built beautiful clam & mussel trays. Presentation is an art and it was obvious there were a few artists in the house.\nK & I ordered Steamed Mussels ($10 HH) & Calamari ($8 HH). The Mussels were steamed with white wine, garlic, shallots & tomato. Yummy! The Bread was fine but nothing special which is a bummer because the broth is soooo good.\nThe Calamari was beautifully fried and served with a very nice lemon aioli and a tomato cream sauce. Both were very good dipping sauces.\nGood drinks, great steamed mussels, great calamari, good bread, ok prices, great staff. 4 Stars.
