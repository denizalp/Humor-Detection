I am currently going to Dr. Racanelli for invisalign.  I have been extremely impressed how fast they get from the waiting room to seeing the dentist.  I wish most places would keep you in the waiting room so short.  They seem to go to great lengths to make you comfortable once in the exam chair.  They put ESPN on a flat screen in front of me while they worked.  Dr. Racanelli has good bedside manor and explains everything in great detail. The lady that cleaned my teeth did an amazing job enough to make my fiance think i was whitening.  All an all i came for invisalign but will come here for preventive dental care in the future.
