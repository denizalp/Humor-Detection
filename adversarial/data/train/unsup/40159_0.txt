Been here twice so far and the food is very good - definitely going to be a go to spot of mine for as long as they keep pumping out quality food. Had to give it 4 stars instead of 5 though because the fried chicken seemed to be cooked in old oil, and while the chicken itself was moist and tender - probably still the best chicken i've had in Toronto - the skin had a very mild burnt aftertaste.\n\nIt probably sounds petty and maybe it is but that's something that's well within their control so for them to not do it, makes this a 4 star experience. The fried chicken is a winner - the Mac and cheese is my girlfriends favourite and she never finishes so I'm the lucky guy who gets to share those creamy leftovers with her later in the evening. Really want to try everything on the menu because it's all so delicious.
