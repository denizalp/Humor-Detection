2017\nIt's probably been a year since I last had an appointment. I posted a glowing review. Owners are great. Passionate of their craft. \n\nWhy haven't I returned?\n\n1. No way to call and speak to someone. \n     -I was frustrated trying to reschedule an appointment. It was back and forth with emails. Would have been easier to do over the phone but that is not an option here.    \n\n2. Hard to get appointments within a week or two.\n    -I wanted to get a cut for a special occasion for the following week but that was not possible. No exceptions made. Not cool after coming here for awhile. I decided to not even bother with this appt. system and went to another salon a few days later instead.\n\n3. Visit can take 2+ hours\n   -I can never get a Saturday or evening appointment due to stylist availability. I work full-time, work far, and live far from the salon and had to take time off to make a weekday appointment. Yes, shampoo and head massage is great. I just could not keep taking time off for cut and color.\n\n4. Stylist Turnover\n   -The stylist on my first visit was awesome. I returned for the second appt. and told another stylist would be taking care of me. It was okay. By my 4th or 5th visit I was once again given a new stylist. Each stylist had their own interpretation and method of doing what I wanted. I could not handle the haircut and color variations anymore.\n\n5. Pricing\n  -My first cut and color was great and affordable. The next few visits the pricing was so much more and fluctuated with each visit. I get that there are stylist levels  and varying pricing scales for each level, but I could not deal with paying $200 each visit. I did not pay that much in Chicago!\n\nI really wanted to keep going here and love it despite some inconveniences, but it was just no longer worth it in the end.
