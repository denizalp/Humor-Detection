Happy Birthday Dinner Spot!\n\nWarning! You need to be hungry when you come to this place!\n\nSpecial recognition to Sirina our excellent server and Chad the super friendly meat man for going above and beyond the call of duty! Actually everything and everyone was great.\n\nThe salad bar is rather exceptional, it is filled with actually great tasting items. Just be careful not to eat too many or you won't be able to eat any meat!\n\nExcellently cooked meats, a great rotating selection brought to you at your table sliced out onto your plate for your enjoyment.\n\nThe non-alcoholic limeade drinks were really good! Especially the coconut mango strawberry cream one, it was outstanding.\n\nI really like the banana appetizers. They are wonderfully flavored and absolutely delicious!\n\nThe water is fresh cold and wet.\n\nThe service was friendly and professional. Our water never ran low, and the food always was overflowing from our plate.\n\nAll in all this is a nice restaurant for a date or even a business meeting. Stop by and give them a chance the food is excellent.\n\nPS: if you are planning to come on Friday or Saturday you need to call ahead and make reservations. Otherwise you will get here and they will say it's a three hour wait and that will be a little bit more than discouraging.
