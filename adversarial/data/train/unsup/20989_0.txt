I rarely write reviews - good or bad - but I felt compelled to provide a warning to curly\/thick haired women considering this salon. I decided to go to Ernesto on the basis of all the great reviews on yelp and google to have him fix a poor haircut I recently got here in Toronto. What a colossal mistake!! I had beautiful, thick curly hair before I entered this salon. HAD!! After hearing my story, seeing the pictures of my hair before my poor haircut and what I actually wanted (just a trim really to fix the shape), along with instructions from my former hairdresser (to which he responded \"no instructions!\"), Ernesto brought out a pair of 80s style thinning shears and proceeded to start 2 inches from my roots and pull the shears through my entire head from top to bottom layer, telling me the whole time that my hair was too thick and his technique would give me the look I wanted. When he was finished there was more hair on the floor than there was on my head. For this, he charged me $125 plus tax. I went home horrified, tried to salvage it myself with different styles but it is so thin, straggly and lifeless nothing can be done. I simply have to wait out the year or two that it will take to grow back the thinned pieces. When I called the salon to get a refund Ernesto admitted he \"pushed it, but it was only because I had so much hair.\" Isn't thick hair the goal? If it isn't and you want to look like an old woman with alopecia, Ernesto is your guy. The only reason this salon gets one star is because I got my money back.
