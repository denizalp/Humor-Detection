Asked and was confirmed for a female masseur and was given a male masseur who I didn't want to offend by declining the massage. \n\nHe massaged with a very soft grip and pressure which was very awkward because his hand skin was very dry and hard.\n\nAbout the facilities: Outside light penetrating in the room. Some showers had all he lotions necessary, some didn't even have the bare minimum like shampoo and conditioner. The gym was very basic and while I could use it while waiting for my friends who were forgotten about,  it wasn't properly equipped for free-weight training.\n\nThis place sucks if you want to relax. I had a coupon for a special deal but it still wasn't worth it.
