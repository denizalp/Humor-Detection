I have consistently been coming to this location for the last 2 years. Once before the Shrimp were spoiled and I called and let them know. No Problem they rectified the problem. Yesterday I ordered egg foo young. The food was practically swimming in oil. I tried my best to blot it off but it was no use, it tasted like grease and the rice tasted old. I called to let them know and I was told that I complain too much. Please note that I only called once before about the spoiled shrimp. There Has been plenty of times that the food is \"off\" but if it would be fine so I would eat it. However if something is so \"off\" that I can't consume it that's when I have a priblem. I would like to think that if something isn't right they would like to know especially when I have patronized this place consistently. She Also told me that if I don't like it don't order it, hmm if I didn't like it I wouldn't order it, its just the fact that I don't like it swimming in oil. I will simply not be going back. The food Quality is inconsistent and I really didn't appreciate her tone with me. Never again!
