Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  This was so delicious.  Both hubby and I had the sorbet bars.  So refreshing and the chocolate was so rich and indulgent.  The pineapple with milk was delicious but next time I'd try the dark with sea salt.  Our friend choose a crepe and it looked out of this world good.  This place is already so popular with lines out the door and it will continue to be because it hits dessert out of the park!  The Belgium chocolate is decadent, rich and not at all waxy.  The pineapple sorbet bar was tart and refreshing.  It's a very small shop without much table space or outdoor seating and it was tricky to get out the door with our treats when the line through the doors was so long. Hopefully they can come up with a better flow of traffic.  \n\nIf you're looking for something unique and for delicious chocolate, this is your place!  I can't wait to go back.
