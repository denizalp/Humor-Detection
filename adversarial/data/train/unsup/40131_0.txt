I just returned from 4 nights at the Silverton. It was another great trip. I can't say anything negative about this hotel casino. Rooms were once again spotless and comfortable. Jill from Sales is amazing. She could not be more accommodating. Very sweet girl and professional. I look forward to my next trip to Vegas. I will certainly be returning. Thank you Silverton for another enjoyable trip.
