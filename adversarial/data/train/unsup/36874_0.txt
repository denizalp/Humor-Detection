So Good I Forgot to Chew!\n\nBeing new residents of Old Town Scottsdale, it took my wife and me too long to get to House Brasserie. We sat on their shady, quiet patio on a perfect day for what turned out to be a perfect lunch--better than any lunch we can remember. \n\nMy wife had a moaning-good chickpea salad that was beautifully presented. I had the lamb cavatelli with green olives and San Marzano tomatoes. We judged both meals to be practically perfect. The chef, to show the kinds of foods he serves his guests at home, created every item on the menu. (How could we get an invitation there?)   \n\nThen for dessert we shared the chocolate cake, unlike any chocolate cake we have seen or tasted. As we were eating dessert, my wife said she had just picked the place she wants to go for dinner on her next birthday! So that's a date! \n\nWe failed to get the name of our waitress\/hostess, but the management of House Brasserie should know because we learned she is from Pinetop, Arizona, of Italian and Spanish heritage. She was just superb--welcoming, friendly, informative, and with a delightful sense of humor. \n\nThe House Brasserie is an easy walk from anywhere within Old Town Scottsdale. Take a hot tip from us: Go there as soon as you can. It's among the finest places to eat that we have found in a very long time.
