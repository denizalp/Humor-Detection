Kenneth at the passport desk is probably the BEST postal worker that I have ever dealt with and that is saying a lot when it comes to government offices. \nMake an appointment, have Ken take your picture and bring in your old passport with you required documents along with a debit card for payment.\nKenneth was friendly, fast and efficient. \nYES, I am describing someone that works at the post office. My renewal was done in less than 10 minutes total!\nWhere am I travelling to?\n Nowhere.
