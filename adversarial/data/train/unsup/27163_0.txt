Your better off going to Outback! While customer service is great, the food is below par based on the price you'd be spending. We ordered a midori sour and we got straight midori (clearly the bartender was new), the waitress took care of the issue right away. My wife's water was in a broken glass, maybe it's just me but when you go to an upscale restaurant you expect there be attention to detail - if it was a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, he'd have a shit! Then our steaks came and they tasted like rubber. It was our anniversary and at the end of dinner they presented us with a $25 gift card (that expired a month prior!)... Again, service and the people were nice but the experience and food just sucked.
