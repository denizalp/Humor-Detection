Atmosphere and service is good....food...not so much.  They are known for their steaks and mine was not edible!  My steak very tough to chew and my boyfriend's steak was overpowered by the peppercorn sauce.  He ate his but I sent mine back and ordered an appetizer instead.  The manager came over, apologized and did not charge for my meal, even though I ate the side.  He also did not charge for my appetizer.
