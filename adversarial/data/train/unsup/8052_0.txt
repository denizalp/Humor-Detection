This is not a bad place to stay! Sure, it's not on the strip, but I'm past the point where I need to be in the middle of all that madness. When you're in super high heels, even walking across the street is a daunting task. So if you're going to cab it anyway, you might as well save some money and stay at Rumor.\n\nFirst of all, I love how short the taxi ride is from McCarran here. It's like $13 including tip, and I think my cab driver still took me slightly out of the way. The bad news is, it's really close to the airport. The air traffic noise can be deafening. That is probably my biggest complaint.\n\nMy next biggest complaint is that not all of the rooms come with the huge soaker tubs that are highlighted on their website. Not a huge deal, but if you book a room looking for one of these, keep in mind that you will need to request it.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the stuff that's important to me, and how Rumor fared:\n\nWater pressure: 5 stars\nWater hardness: 2 stars\nSink area for spreading out my stuff: 3 stars\nTowel softness: 3 stars\nSheet softness and overall bed comfort: 4 stars\nSmelly hotel air factor: 4 stars (including 1 star for windows that open)\nClimate control: 2 stars (swamp cooler thing was loud and sort of obnoxious, and ideal temp was hard to reach)\nBathroom amenities: 3 stars (why does everyone have a better hair dryer than me??)\n\nOne thing I will note, is that while the sinks are stylish bowl-style with fancy hardware, the water pressure is nothing short of AGGRESSIVE and will leave you with a wet floor if you turn it on too fast.\n\nGreat value for the money, good service, and although cabs don't come by very often, the guys at the valet counter are more than happy to flag one down for you.
