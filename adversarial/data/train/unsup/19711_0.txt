I really wanted to go to Ronald's Donuts, but instead, we went to the Hoover Dam and by the time we made our way back to Vegas, Ronald's Donuts was closed. We ended up at Friendly Donut House and got a sample of some classic donuts - French glazed, French chocolate, old fashioned, and an apple fritter. The old fashioned donut was okay, but I was really craving the Ronald's Donuts version, where as this one kind of had the flavoring of a Chinese donut you would get in a dim sum restaurant. My husband really enjoyed the apple fritter, which was a huge portion - one week later, we still have some remnants of it in our kitchen. I like their take on the French donuts and didn't find them too oily. This place is cash only, so be prepared. A bit out of the way so probably won't be coming back, but a great place to stop into if you're in the area.
