We used Tru Cab for our first cab ride to the PHX airport and we are so glad we did.  The night before we needed the cab, I made a booking online and even got to use a coupon linked from their facebook page.  About 10 minutes later, I received a call from Tru Cab confirming the time and location of my pick-up.\n\n30 minutes before the cab was scheduled to arrive, I received a call to let me know that the cab driver was on her way and to confirm how many donuts and coffee we wanted.  (You get donuts and coffee for bookings before 9am.)\n\nShe was there on time and we had a pleasant conversation en route to the airport, which ended up being just under $20.  We were able to pay and tip with our credit card easily through their Square set-up.  So great not to have to use cash.  :)\n\nHowever, two notes:\n- The FAQ page does not work on either my computer or phone (http:\/\/www.trucab.com\/faqs\/).\n- I downloaded the Tru Cab iPhone app, but it didn't seem to work at all.  Hopefully this is something they're working on.\n\nI will definitely use them again!  It would be cool if they could link up with the existing Taxi Magic app or improve their own app for more seamless booking.
