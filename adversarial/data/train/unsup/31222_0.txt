This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas....and yes, it can get very pricey.  In my opinion, well worth it.\nFirst you can start at the fresh fish stand to choose your particular fish, if you so choose.  The specimens my husband and I have seen over the course of about ten visits (between lunch and dinner) have always had clear eyes and a clean smell (not like old stagnant fish).  Coming from the landlocked Midwest, we appreciate the ability to have fresh options that are flown in from distant places and served as fresh as possible.  \nThe Three Course Lunch Pre Fixe is a favorite of ours.  The price is reasonable for what is offered.  The menu does not change that dramatically for this part, so we have tried most of the dishes.  Portions are not huge for lunch, but we have never left unsatiated after having three courses with bread to start.\nService has been excellent each time we have visited, well-choreographed, and we were never left wanting.  My husband and I brought another couple for dinner last week and had yet another wonderful experience.  We shared the salt encrusted fish which was way too much food for four people, as we chose a fish that was about 5 pounds.  \nThe decor is comfortable yet elegant and there is plenty of space between parties, which is important to me as I don't like feeling crowded.\nThis is a place I would recommend for special occasion dinner, lunch pre fixe, or any time you'd like to have some fantastic Mediterranean food in Las Vegas.
