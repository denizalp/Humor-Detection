Do not expect much from Luxor. Overall cleanness I give 3. It has no Microwave, no coffee maker no fridge. \n\nInternet speed is low and I could not use my cellphone as hotspot. I guess  they use a personal hotspot blocker.\n\nThe worst thing I experience was the last night of my stay. It was around 4 AM and I was in a deep sleep when there was a loud siren in all rooms and a message saying that there is an alert and everybody needs to be ready for further notice!\n\nI was scared and just ran into hallway and downstairs. The siren got switched off after 15 minutes. I asked one of their employees at front desk registration and he said they suspect there was a fire but not sure. \n\nI was walking for 5 minutes before going back to my room and noticed two hotel security were talking to each other saying that there is an issue in their system that this happens every week!\n\nNext day I woke up with a really bad migraine and had to drive over 10 hours to get back home!
