Finally i came to this restaurant. The menu is limited, just tacos. When i arrived there were not guacamole anymore, so i tried 3 tacoscostila, carnitas, barbacoa.. three of them were very delicious. Carnitas was a little bit oily for me. Barbacoa was very very spicy that i couldnt feel my lips after eating it  i had margarita with food. I give 4 out of 5 for tacos, 3 out of 5 for margarita..
