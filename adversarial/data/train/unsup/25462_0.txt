I came to have brunch with a couple of friends. Be aware that seating is limited, especially in the winter because it's too cold and the outdoor seating is gone. \n\nWifi = Solid. It looks like a lot of people come here to work on stuff and enjoy a nice brew. \n\nFood: get the granola. The yogurt is covered in honey and fresh blueberries and strawberries. The pastry I had this time was a vanilla swirl. It was not too sweet and a perfect amount of soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. \n\nBrews: I got a mocha with almond milk. It was the perfect amount of chocolate and the almond milk was heated at the right temp. Be aware it's an extra $0.50 for soy or almond milk. :) they have a variety of hot teas to choose from and it seemed popular when I was there. I'll have to try it out next time. \n\nOrder up front and you get a number. It's a great place to meet up with friends but don't take too much time because of the limited seating.
