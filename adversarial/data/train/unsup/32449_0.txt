I went to the buffet at MGM over Labor weekend, and they were running an open bar special along with the dinner menu. I would've gotten my money's worth if I drank, but I don't, so my view may be a little skewed based on this. I really enjoyed the butcher and seafood stations, because I'm a huge fan of both meat and seafood. The dessert table was pretty tasty (fun shortcakes, cupcakes, cookies, etc). There was also seasonal ice cream flavors like lychee and island coffee. The rest of the food tables were pretty lackluster and nothing to write home about. Service was efficient. It was convenient to where I was staying but probably would not visit again.
