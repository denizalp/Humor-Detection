We were not impressed with the service we got, in terms of attentive, personalised service. The steak were certainly good. One came out beyond well done but once highlighted to mgmt a new steak came right fast and they deducted the steak from the bill.\nWith services overall being disappointed the value for money is somewhat disappointing
