The set up truly makes me feel like I'm in a town in Paris and I just love those Paris cups full of margarita!  There's also a bakery shop inside the casino that has amazing tasty crepes and nice stores to go shopping if you feel like splurging or win big and and wanna go on a shopping spree. Staying here can be a bit pricey but you definitely get what you pay for.  One of my favorite hotels for sure.  \n\nOne day I wanna get a room here but until then I'll enjoy the amazing atmosphere this hotel brings!
