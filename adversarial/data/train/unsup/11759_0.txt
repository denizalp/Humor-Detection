Order the cinnamon biscuits!  Soooo my friend called to ask if they serve alcohol because that's a must for us for brunch and they didn't, but they said we could bring our own, jackpot!\n\nWe ordered the cinnamon biscuits which came with a berry compote that was so amazing the tables on either side of us ordered them after they saw our reaction.  My simple eggs were great and my friend ordered a stack of pancakes which were amazing, eggs Benedict which he crushed and turkey sausage which was very very good.  \n\nGreat experience, very cool wait staff, and a nice break from the overpriced Las Vegas strip which lacks the hipster character of this place.\n\nIt's on my list next time I'm in Vegas.
