They should get 5 stars for STUPID!!! I've seen stupid before but not like this. I ordered 4 sandwiches thru Bite Squad online service. Except for the Chicken Caesar wrap, they blew them all. It specifically states these include mayonnaise, purple onions, etc....I got 3 empty sandwiches!! When I called a girl who sounded 12 replied there were no extras on the Caesar wrap so she figured I didn't want sandwiches with any taste to them..Can you say STUPID?? No manager on staff either.A 3rd call and they claimed he was on his way in to call me..He never did. Girl should be fired!! The Bite Squad has claimed to reverse the order charge. If not I will of course call my credit company and dispute this. Imagine ordering a sandwich in a restaurant. It says that it comes with all these normal items..Then they bring you a sandwich that's as plain as bread and meat..You tell them bring it back.Then a waitress explains \"Well you didn't order any extras on your other sandwich so I thought you wanted nothing on all the others\"...I will never order from them again...This is what happens when 10 yr olds work for you...
