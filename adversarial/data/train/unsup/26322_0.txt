I visited Kelly's for a second time a few weeks ago while I was in town. Just like last time, I really liked it. The decor is great, which red leather  booths and low light. The music that was playing that night was fantastic. I'm not sure if it was someone's ipod mix or the jukebox, but there was old school Michael Jackson, Dave Brubeck, Dick Dale, and other treats. I ordered the grilled houlumi and olives, which I had also had last time and fell in love. I also had a salad with cranberries and goat cheese and a delicious lemony vinegarette. So tasty. \n\nWe were there on a Thursday night, probably from 7:30 until 9 or so. I was never super busy, but always people there. Our server was very attentive and helpful. I would absolutely go the Kelly's on my next trip to Pittsburgh.
