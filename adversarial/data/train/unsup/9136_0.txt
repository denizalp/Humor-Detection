Let me start by saying my Wife and I have been here over 12 times in the last year. With that said let me tell you the last time we went.  I do mean the last time too.  :(\n\nMy wife ordered their Perch and a glass of wine. I ordered the soup of the day Lobster Bisque for the appetizer and had the dinner special (Strip steak). I know why would you order a steak at a place known for Fish.  Common it was the special of the night so I figured I would get it.  \n\nNow let's list the missteps or issues.\n1.  My appetizer showed up after I asked about it. Oh yea it was served to me after my dinner was served to me.  Waitress forgot. No longer an appetizer had to choose what to eat hot my dinner or the appetizer.  \n2. I ordered my strip steak med-well which means slight pink center.  It was undercooked by a mile. Told waitress's that it was undercooked,  she said they would fire another for me.  \n3. My same steak showed up.  I know this to be mine as it was in the same three prices I gave it back to them. They didn't re-fire another steak ok snob fracture aside,  they put the steak in the microwave until it was a bad, with no flavor very well done cut of meat. I could not eat it had them take it off my bill. Trust me I can eat a bad steak but not this one. :(\nGood thing I had that cup of Bisque...\n4. The waitress seemed to blame it on the cook (no kidding). \n\nGood news\nMy wife had a nice Perch dinner. \n***My first one star on yep. :(
