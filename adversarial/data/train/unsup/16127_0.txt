Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #156 - #365\n\nIt was my last night at the Orleans and I wanted to have some cheap before going back to the room. Walking around the casino, I saw TGIF, figured it's just like any other Fridays.\n\nThere was no wait so I just quickly walked in and sat in the bar area. Service was quick and I ordered a glass of beer and some chicken wings. Food was on par like with any other Friday's franchise and the wings were tasty with mild wings sauce. \n\nLucky for me I was able to charge it to my room so I cab earn some points for my stay.
