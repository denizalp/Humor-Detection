A friend mentioned this to me, after telling me about \"creepy\" stairs at the Phoenix Sky Harbor parking. She said Blue Sky meets and drops you at your car. Yes indeed they do! \n\nReservations were easy - all online. It was cheaper than the airport. It was cheaper for me, at least, than getting a Lyft\/Uber. \n\nThe morning I arrived, I am an idiot and did not follow directions well and got turned around. GPS told me incorrectly but I should have just used common sense - duh. \n\nThe person greeted me and said what to keep for later.  A shuttle came within 30 seconds as I unloaded the car. Another group of people boarded, and off we went, to the airport within 7 minutes. \n\nAfter arriving to airport after my flight, the shuttle was there almost immediately. The drivers were quiet but friendly. Clean shuttles. \n\nI did not get any cookies like people are mentioning. \n\nCheck out was easy. I was there when employees were still there. They needed my receipts from the printout I had.
