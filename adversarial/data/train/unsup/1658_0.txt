I thought this place was Ok until I recieved a buffalo chicken pizza without any buffalo sauce on it. I spoke with the guy who \"personally cut my pizza\" and said I was wrong. Then offered extra sauce on my next order. Nothing was offered to get me to order again. When I order a specialty pizza I expect it to be correct.
