Is there anything more simple and beautiful than a perfectly poached egg for brunch? I think not. Merci's Eggs Benedict was exactly what I wanted for a lazy sunday brunch. My better half enjoyed her modern updated Croque Madame, and the absolutely adorable ambiance here couldn't be anymore perfect than it was. Duc is quite possibly one of the most gracious business owners in the Scottsdale area, and this small mom and pop establishment is the kind of place that makes eating out memorable and great, as opposed to some routine habit to sustain our bodies. What our society needs is to slow down and work on sustaining our souls. This is the place to do so. The idea of going into another chain automaton after enjoying an afternoon at Merci is impossible and shameful. The staff here are well appointed, classy, accommodating and friendly. The only warning is that their splendid pastry case will be staring at you, and beckoning you to finish your meal quicker, every step of the way. We shared a Chocolate Raspberry Mogador, which was also, like the rest of the experience, perfect; silky smooth chocolate mousse, with a raspberry topping which was the ideal touch of sweetness. Picture included...don't be jealous, just go get your own.
