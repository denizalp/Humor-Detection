I got takeout from this place once.  It was not great but not horrible.  It was however very expensive.  It seems like its kind of a touristy place so they jack up the price.  Not sure.  All I know is that Rincon Criollo http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/rincon-criollo-las-vegas up the street is much, much better and maybe half the price..
