The two things I have experienced at Ellis Island are pretty incongruous: salad and cheap beer. It may seem impossible that a place that serves up cheap, house-brewed beer can also serve up a quality salad, but Ellis Island does just that.\n\nYes, Ellis Island is known for loose slots, BBQ, karaoke and interesting characters, but I can't comment on all of those. I have cleaned my plate of their apple-pecan salad however, and it is good. It has real mixed greens which is notable because lately I have been going to restaurants that say mixed greens or garden greens on the menu and serve iceberg. This makes me angry. Here, they throw in apples, cranberries, candied pecans and a tangerine dressing. Clearly, you have a delicious green creation. It might not be hard, but plenty of places get it wrong. Plus, you get to enjoy it in a very vintage atmosphere. People don't mention it as much, but the restaurant has the heavy upholstered, red booths that make you feel like you could be dining in the 70s. I would say it is a pretty classic Vegas atmosphere, but not fancy for sure. It is old school in its own way.\n\nAs for the beer, 20 ounces for $1.75 and it is microbrewed right there. How can you complain? The El Wheat (their hef) is refreshing and an easy drink. They also brew their own root beer. \n\nI need to head back to try the BBQ when I am up for a meat fest, but for now, I consider it a Vegas institution, and given the unexpected salad find, I consider myself a fan.
