This is a review about my fellow yelpers as much as anything else, but people are vultures!!  It was unfortunate that whatever food was brought out was consistently placed on the same tables in front of the same people in the same inaccessible areas to most folks, which caused crowding like a pack of dogs at feeding time.  So if you sat in front of one of these spots, it was a non stop parade, otherwise you had to fight for scraps.  \n\nPeople would follow the serves, like a pack of wolves hunting their injured prey and devour whatever was placed down.  It was too early on a Sunday to participate in a combat sport.\n\nAnyways, I just couldn't do it but did manage to score two spoons of something.\n\nDrinks were great.  The facility seemed really nice.  It was nice to see my sister show up back in T.O. (Mel F.) after two years of being on the left coast.\n\n The post party though was a blast!
