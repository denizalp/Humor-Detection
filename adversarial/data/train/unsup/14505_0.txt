This place used to be Kaze, but I guess they changed name and management. The interior looks the same, exactly the same. The things that have changed are the plates and soy sauce dish (I think) lol!\n\nComing here tonight made me realize I have another pet peeve - soy sauce dishes with 3 legs. Boy was I pissed tonight.. I thought their slow service was bad already, but the dish totally pissed me to a whole new level. I have never had a dish with 3 legs. The balance of the dish totally blows. I dip my sushi in it and it tips to one side. I spilled the sauce couple times and it was only the beginning of the night - annoyed beyond all measure. As for service, it was unbelievably slow. I would understand if I was at a 5 star restaurant because they need to cook my food to perfection. But it's AYCE, they're not perfecting anything except for stuffing customers faces! If I were running this place, the first thing I would work on is the speed. Perhaps I should endow on them the Speed Force LOL.\n\nOn a positive note, the food was decent. Quality isn't the priority I look for in a AYCE place, so I won't be hard on them for this. Food was passable for sure, not great. If you're looking to stuff your face, feel free to come in a group! It'll be better to have friends with you to keep you company since it's so slow.\n\nTook off 3 stars for slow service and ridiculous choice of soy sauce dish. I would rather have a practical dish over something flashy.
