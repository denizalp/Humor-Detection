First and last time here.\n\nWe were not greeted by our waitress for at least 10 minutes after sitting down.  Service went down hill from there.\n\nOne order came out wrong.\n\nChicken on nachos was dried out.  Nachos were below average.\n\nWaitress disappeared for almost our entire visit.\n\nThere is a short hair blonde female manager that walks around the place but never talks to customers.  She walks and walks and walks.   \n\nMusic was way too loud. It made it hard to have a conversation.\n\nFor me, this was a hugh disappointment.
