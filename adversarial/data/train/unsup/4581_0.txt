Came here on a busy Friday night. Atmosphere was great as a lot of people were in their 'Friday Night' mood. I sat at the bar and it took a while before my order was taken, for my food to come out, and for the check to make its way to me. Bartender didn't look friendly. I think she needed help. Wings were colder than usual, too. I didn't say anything because I was starving and didn't want to wait for another batch to come out. They're usually solid here. Positive are that they have free wifi and the fries were delicious.
