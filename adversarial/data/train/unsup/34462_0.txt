Went in for weekday lunch. There are a lot of options. I got a half sandwich (the Americana ciabatta?? That's what I thought I ordered but the website tells me there's nothing called that...) and was a little weary of the $5.50 price - however, when it arrived, it was the size of a full sandwich with lots of meat and toppings. Also, the sodas have free refills. \nSome drawbacks was the parking - there's no where close and it's all pay - and the tables were really sticky. I didn't see anyone wiping them down so who knows how dirty they were?
