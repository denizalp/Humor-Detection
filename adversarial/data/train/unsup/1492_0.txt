Convenient, lots of stock, great sales.  Customer service is friendly, but their computer systems are many times slow.  Receipts after purchase come with a paper string of coupons for certain departments i.e. furniture, clothing.\n\nIdeal location with plenty of parking.  In same plaza as Trader Joe's and around the parking lot from U-swirl and Cinnamon's.  Across the street from Lowe's and McDonald's.  I hope they survive the current state of what's going on with Kmarts.\n\nBedding, bath, and health and beauty isles appear to have good selections and availability.  Many store items are marked on sale every time I stroll through.  Some products did not have a price on the shelf or price was for another item.\n\nI'm always able to find general needs: cat food, laundry liquids, candles, shampoo \/ conditioners.  Prices are comparable.  Competitors: Wal-Mart and Big Lots.  This location has a pharmacy.  So far they are still an active open store location.
