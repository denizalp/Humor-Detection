You just got back from the Bellagio in Vegas? \n\n\"So what, I just got back from the Villagio.\" \n\nContrary to popular belief, the Village is NOT an expensive gym.\n\nIt's more like a cheap Country Club.  That's really what it is minus the golf course.  I've been a member for a long time and love it.  \n\nGreat classes with Great teachers. Even the yoga teachers are top notch, which is unusual  for a \"gym\". \nTons of tennis if you are into that. The backdrop of Camelback mountain is amazing. \nThe weight room is adequate. There are certainly bigger and better ones. If you are a body builder, probably not for you. \nA couple of pools, BB court\/ racquetball and a great cafe. \n\nEasy 5 stars.
