I decided to check out this spin studio because it's right next to my work and it's cheaper than a lot of other spin studios. When I walked in the girl was friendly and asked me if it was my first time, I explained to her that I take spin classes regularly but it's my first time at their studio. She told me to wait for her and she would show me how to use the bike so I told her again I've taken spin classes but it's like it went in one ear and out the other. She took me into the spin room and showed me how to use the bike (by now I had told her 3 times I already knew what I was doing) there were only a few other people in the class. I'm used to taking high energy spin classes and this was the complete opposite. The instructors bike is at the front of the room facing away from everyone so I literally could not tell what she was doing, it just looked like she did the exact same thing the whole class, the music was TERRIBLE, and every few minutes the instructor would turn on a black light for a minute and then turn it back off. There were a few times she actually took breaks and the lights came on and everyone stopped what they were doing, I've NEVER been to a spin class where people stop in the middle of the class. Also, the entire class you are supposed to stand... which makes no sense to me, it gets very repetitive and it's not good for you. I ended up just doing my own thing until the class was over, 2 of the other people in the class even left early. I do not recommend this place and will not be back here. I'll stick to taking classes at The Madison, I would rather pay more for a fun high energy class!
