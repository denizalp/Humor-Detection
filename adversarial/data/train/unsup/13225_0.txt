PF Changs was one of the first restaurant I enjoyed when I first moved here in the valley.  So, for old time sakes...I go.\n\nNever had bad service nor bad food at this location.  They were the only ones to accomodate a big group (24) in Old Town Scottsdale without having to book with an event planner.  We also ordered from the regular menu instead of choosing between chicken or fish, beef or pork, etc.  We love the calamari, walnut shrimp, honey scallops and chicken lettuce wrap.  Their banana lumpia dessert satisfied the sweet toofers .  It's all good,  don't come here for authenticity, coz it ain't.
