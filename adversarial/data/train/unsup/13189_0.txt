I like that this bar is really spacious. Lots of comfy seating.  I'd feel comfortable coming here for a couple drinks and not get worried that we couldn't find a place to sit or that we'd be crammed in like sardines.\n\nActually getting drinks were another story.  As far as I could tell, there was only one bartender.  When I first got there, the bar back refused to make drinks.  But after a while, he had to or there would have been a riot.  \n\nI was there with a group that had drink tickets.  The bartender and bar back didn't set up a system beforehand apparently.  They were just making it up as they went along.  $9 drink, 2 tickets.  $10, 1 ticket + $2.  It was totally weird.  \n\nHappy hour is from 5-7pm, according to the menu, but I wasn't quite clear what happy hour was.  Asking would have invited controversy, as they were slammed enough without having to answer questions. I didn't see any cocktail servers.  It took about 15 minutes to get my first drink and the bartender completely forgot about my second drink.  They were completely overwhelmed.\n\nIt does get a little smoky in here.  I couldn't stop sneezing.  But that probably was just the patrons that particular night.  \n\nBeware of the parking lot!  It doesn't have clearly painted lines. When I parked, it wasn't too crowded.  But when I got out, OMG, cars were just parked whereever, creating a slalom course just to get out.  I'm lucky someone didn't box me in.  People in Vegas do not know how to drive and it is now clear that they also do not know how to park a car.  Geez, people.  Park a block away and walk your fat, lazy asses.\n\nBack to the bar.  Nice venue but I'm concerned about the staffing.  The bartender and bar back did their best.  The specialty cocktails, mostly vodka or whiskey-based, didn't do much for me.  I might be back for the comfy seating and a beer.  But I was a little disappointed by my first experience here.  It's just A-OK for me.
