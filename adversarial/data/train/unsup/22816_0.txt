I've been taking my little one here for gymnastics. The teacher is great. She's brand new to the area but she does a lot with these tots in the 30 minutes. The best part about this place is the price. You cannot beat the price. When you have kids that are 2-3 and you want them to try something out this is the best place. They start off with the basics but they also have fun at the same time.  \n\nOverall, if you can find a great teacher like we did here then it is well worth it. 30 minutes is plenty of time for a tot! The cost is great and it may just be well worth the time.
