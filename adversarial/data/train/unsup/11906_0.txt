Sometimes GoodLife gyms feel like the Target of gyms, other times they feel more like Wal-Mart...this one's definitely a Wal-Mart.\n\nFirst of all, the club is simply cramped beyond belief.  They don't have a place to store anything, so it all sits on top of the tiny stretching area.  I think you could move from machine to machine without even needing to set foot on the ground.\n\nThe cardio machines at least are not very nice.  Many of them had maintenance issues or were just old and gross.  The weight machines are in somewhat better shape, but did not especially impress me relative to their other clubs.  \n\nThe atmosphere is poor.  It's so cramped with such low ceilings that I found myself not wanting to be there.  The staff seemed to be non-existent.  The clientele for this location also tends towards the geriatric set, which means really long waits for machines as they tend to occupy a given machine for quite a while and shuffle between machines.  This client population also lends itself to lots of expectorating and coughing up of phlegm in the shower area, which I found disgusting.  \n\nFinally, the pool.  Seems like a cool idea...uh, not.  There are 5 lanes each with a limit of 20 minutes for laps.  I think most poorly funded high schools have nicer pools than this.  It's short, and there was a line of 5 people at an off hour.  I can't imagine coming in and sitting around for 30 minutes just waiting to swim.  \n\nNo more visits to this GoodLife for me!
