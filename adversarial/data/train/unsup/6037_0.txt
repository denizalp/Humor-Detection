As we painfully window-shopped our way down 1st Ave. to Pattie's I couln't help but wonder how this rumored \"cool\" dive bar could be hidden amongst kachina dolls and leather-engraved belt shops...\n\nA little smokey, gritty, hidden diamond in the rough that is Pattie's sticks out of Old Town Scottsdale like an '89 Honda Accord valet parked at Suede Lounge.\n\nThe bar is tucked away amongst Scottsdale's awful \"3 C's\"... cougars, country western attire and bad cowboy art. Upon walking into the bar, I was really surprised -- the crowd of people was plucked from every category - grunge kids, frat idiots, musician wannabe's, tommy bahama shirts, and the occasional Scottsdale douche. We ended up staying there all night, and I danced with a nice, (but hilariously nasty) retired couple with palm trees on their shirts!! This place is literaly a melting pot of drunk peeps. \n\nThey are a little slow on service, but I don't blame them on St. Paddy's it was packed! They serve their drinks pretty stiff (thats what she said) and I think I would definitely hit up this spot again!
