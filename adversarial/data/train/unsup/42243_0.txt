2.5 stars.\n\nAh, yelp, you caused me to have high expectations for this place.  I was left feeling disappointed.  The nigiri sushi isn't that fresh.  I've had a lot better--maybe because I'm spoiled with good sushi in Los Angeles.  This place is more for \"Americanized\" rolls, which aren't too bad, and they have interesting combos, so I'll bump it up a 1\/2 star for creativity.  Prices are very reasonable, but if you're looking for traditional sushi, this isn't the place for you.
