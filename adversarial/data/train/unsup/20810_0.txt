Yesterday I got another haircut and this time had a shave and beard trim as well (see pic).. you know Gq just keeps getting better. It was the most relaxing time having my face shaved by someone who knows exactly what they were doing. When he was done I was floored how awesome I looked. If you want to feel awesome about yourself just get a haircut from Gq, they f-ing rock!
