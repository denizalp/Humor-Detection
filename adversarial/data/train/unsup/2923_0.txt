We came here on my Birthday. It was truly a special experience. After we studied the menu we couldn't make up our mind, so we decided to order the 44 Ounce, Pepper Crusted,Grilled Prime Ribeye Tomahawk for Two. At $165.00, it may seem at little steep, but it includes huge portions of Roasted Bone Marrow, Seasonal Vegetables (Ours were Carrots, Mushrooms, Sweet Potatoes, Onions and Asparagus), Lobster Mac & Cheese and a Red Wine Sauce. This really is a great value. If we had ordered everything separately, it would have been way more expensive.\n\nNot only is it a great deal, but everything tasted wonderful. The Flintstone sized Steak was so perfectly cooked and seasoned that it didn't really even need the Red Wine Sauce. the Bone Marrow was Rich and Decadent. the Lobster Mac and Cheese had so much of the Crustacean that it could have qualified as an entree by itself. The vegetables were perfectly cooked and offered at least a little break from the richness of the rest of our meal. The presentation of our food was so impressive that several people actually stopped by and asked us what we had ordered.\n\nWe finished everything on the platter, except for a few veggies and a little Macaroni. We did not order dessert, but the kitchen sent out a Creme Brulee' and a slice of Cheesecake for us. We were so full that we joked about exploding if we finished them, but, to our surprise, we finished them both and are still here!\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, service was superb.Our server was friendly and knowledgeable and the Sommelier matched our food and wine perfectly! If you looking for a special place to celebrate while you are in Vegas, you cannot do better than N9ne! I have said it before, but thank you to Chef Barry and the rest of the staff at N9ne for an amazing night!
