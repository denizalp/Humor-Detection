This was the worst spa experience I have ever had.  I wanted to try this spa and when I received a living social deal email, I bought it.  I should have known better.  My appointment was at 3:30 and I was told to arrive at 3:15 for the relaxation room.  The relaxation room is the lobby though they did serve champagne but it is not like a spa where you don a robe and relax.   At 3:40, now ten minutes after my appointment time, I was told the employee was stuck in traffic and it would be at least another 10 minutes. If you are like me, i work, have kids and have a schedule so there went any relaxation right out the window. The employee had called at 3 pm and said there was traffic but they still let me sit there 10 minutes after my scheduled time before i was told it would be even longer.   I was asked if I want to reschedule.  Seriously? I want to drive another 20 minutes each way after a bad experience.  They couldn't refund my money since it was that voucher but they did mark it as being used already. They have no manager or owner available to talk with or anyone with accountability for this poor experience.  I would not go here, I would not recommend it to anyone that wants a nice, client centric spa.\n\nWhen I drove back home, I pulled the traffic report and nothing out of the ordinary was being reported.
