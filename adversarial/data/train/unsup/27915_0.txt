Drinks are cheap. Unlike a lot of places I go to with cheap drinks, the service doesn't suck.\nI'm on a weird mimosa kick right now, so the $4 mimosa is right up my alley. \nI've been coming here for years and it's my \"Well I want good food and drinks and just want to hang out with friends\".\nThankfully it's a big enough place so I never end up feeling cramped and antsy to leave.\nThe food is cheap but doesn't taste like it. I normally go for the perogies; but the brie and avocado sandwich is awesome.
