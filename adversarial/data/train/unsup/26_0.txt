Delicious ramen with a rich broth: I have had the tonkontsu and miso and both are delicious. My friend had the fire and ice and he said it was amazing. pork belly buns are rich and scrumptious. They also have delicious Brussel sprouts and their beet salad is a must order with candied dates. Their green tea honey ice cream is smooth and refreshing. Servers are really nice but be warned it's crowded and there might be a long wait even on weekdays. I usually get takeout.
