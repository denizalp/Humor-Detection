I walked into the restaurant and noticed young hipsters everywhere so much disappointment was expected. I ended up being apathetic towards the place. The salad is terrible and the miso soup standard fare. The spicy sushi set I ordered was alright. It wasn't very spicy but the portions were large enough and it was well presented.and well made. The taste wasn't bad, but it just wasn't as present as I like it to be. Service seemed decently quick and the server was very friendly. One word of caution: if you don't want to be able to touch a stranger just by stretching your arms, do NOT opt for the patio.
