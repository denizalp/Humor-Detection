I went to the Aspen location for my first Brazilian. The store was girly and had a lot of cute accessories. All of the staff were very friendly and knowledgable. The process was very fast and a lot less painful than expected. Though it's a little pricey, I was very pleased with the end results. I'll be going back for sure.
