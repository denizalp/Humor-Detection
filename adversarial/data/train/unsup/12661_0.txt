I finally got the chance to stop by this place after so long. My family was in town and we decided to hit up freemont street because it is a tourist stop. We stopped to eat here before doing the walk.\n\nIt wasn't too busy the restaurant seemed like it was pretty full but we were able to be seated right away and this was during dinner hour. Got our waters quickly. Ordered calamari first. It was pretty good. Nothing too crazy, they had a marinara sauce and some spicy aioli type of sauce. It had a good kick. \n\n\nWe decided to share the New Yorker. It had sausage and pepperoni and chunks of ricotta cheese on top which was amazing. But other than the ricotta cheese the pizza itself wasn't anything special. I really thought it was going to be amazing. Maybe next time I will get a different pizza. The New Yorker was a award winning pizza though but I didn't feel like it was.
