Even in Las Vegas my parents still only want to eat Chinese food.  So we end up eating dinner here at least one night pretty much everytime we go to Vegas as a family.  This place is located in the \"chinatown\" that's off Spring Mountain Road.  It's that street that's next to Treasure Island and  the Fashion Show mall.  It's away from the strip, so you'd need to take a taxi here.  The food is okay and typical of a Chinese restaurant.  I think they overcharge for many things here, but is a bargain compared to the 25 dollar fried rice you'd get at the Mirage's chinese restaurant.  I never come here when I'm with friends.  I think the place is okay if you want Chinese food when you're in Vegas, but if that's what you want, I need to ask you why would you want more Chinese food in Vegas when theres so much of it back home?!  I'd rather try something else.
