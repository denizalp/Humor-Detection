I've been to Fred's not here a few times with friends and family. My last visit was pretty good. It's got a nice scenery there, great place to go right before you hit the Mirvish Theatre across the street. I ordered the steak as my main course and loved it, it had flavour and was cooked the way I wanted: medium rare. I had a food coma right after with the amount of delicious food I had lol.
