I have lived in the Carlyle apartments for 7 months and my experience so far has been as such: as far as the leasing staff they are VERY nice and accommodating. I have never experienced anything but great customer service. from the day we signed our lease with Santana (who is no longer working at Carlyle which sucks because he was the ABSOLUTE BEST and needs to come back) to the repair guys, have all provided great service. I have had a few maintenance issues of which were taken care of very quickly by their maintenance team. The only reason I am unable to give a five star, is that I have had my car broken into while parked in my carport. Also, because of the pools being accessible 24 hours a day and the fact that my unit is right next to 1 of the 4 pools I have been woken up by loud groups of people who tend to think that just because they can be used at 2am, they can be loud and obnoxious (most often times drunk) at 2am as well with no regard to their neighbors who have small children, like myself.  I try to take this with a grain of salt as I understand the noise can be something that comes with renting in a apartment community, how  ever with my experience of renting in many different complexes I notice the pools open 24\/7 allow a lot more noise at odd hours than others I have lived at. \n\nI do plan on staying in the Carlyle community after our lease expires but I do think I will consider moving to the townehome side where it seems to be much more family oriented and quiet where they offer attached garages:)
