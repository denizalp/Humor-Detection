When a couple of friends from work told me they were going to jump off the Stratosphere, I was all over joining in!\n\nI called to make a reservation weeks ahead and paid the $99.99 necessary to keep your spot.  They told me I could get a package including a dvd and photo for only $30 extra.  I didn't want to pay for it ahead of time but they said it was fine to decide when I got there.\n\nIn the weeks before our jump, I watched a couple of YouTube videos of people's jumps, shot by friends watching from the ground, and thought eh - it looks like such a slow fall...and seriously considered canceling.  \n\nIt just didn't look scary enough!\n\nJoining in with my friends won out though, and when we arrived a half hour before our appointment times, I was glad I hadn't canceled.  But I still wasn't super excited about the jump itself.\n\nThey checked us in and told us we could watch our dvds and see our pictures after our jump and decide whether we wanted to buy them then.  Which we thought was super cool!\n\nThey had us put our stuff in a locker then suited and harnessed us up and took us up the elevator to the top of the tower.  \n\nWhen we got off the elevator, this huge view of Vegas from panoramic-view windows 855 feet off the ground (108 floors up), started to get me excited...because it finally DID feel scary!\n\nWe waited our turns from right inside a door that was next to the jumping platform.  Watching from that close looked even SCARIER - and now my legs felt a little wobbly and I got giddy!\n\nI went first - they checked my harness, took a couple of pics, pointed out the camera, and had me stand at the edge for a count of 3.\n\nAnd then I jumped!!!!!\n\nIt was faster falling than I thought, windy, my hair was blowing all over the place, and the whole city leaped up at me!!  \n\nAaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!\n\nI landed softly on my feet about 10-15 seconds later, and got out of my suit and harness fast enough to be ready to take pics of my friends coming down.  \n\nWoooohoooo!!!  The rush lasted a while for me, and I talked and joked with the people watching around the landing platform.  It was a super fun place to be - and there were even lounge chaises for people to lie on and watch the jumpers.\n\nYaaaaay!!!!  Fuuuuuuun!!!!!!\n\nWe were checking out and watching our videos when we had a little damper on the funzies.  They told us that the dvd would be $27.03 and the pics would be $21.61.\n\nWhat happened to the package deal? - we asked.  They said \"oh, you can't upgrade *after* you jump\".\n\nWe had never been told that, so there was some grumbling about it.  Even though we were about to pay the higher fee, Kim was nice enough to let us upgrade to the $30 dvd+photo package.  And then she even corrected the spelling of my friend's name on her jump certificate without her asking - which we thought was super nice.\n\nThis is likely not something I need to do again, but I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't done it before.  Just make sure you get the dvd+photo upgrade - you WILL want them!
