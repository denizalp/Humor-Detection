Our party ordered 3 burgers, two medium, one well. All came well done. They were all very dry and bland. Not one of us enjoyed the meal. Service was slow and no apologies given for the slow service and sub par food. We had to ask for Mayo 3 times before it came to our table to help mask the dryness of their $20 burger.
