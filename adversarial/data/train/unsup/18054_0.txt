Just to set the record straight, an inventory of the Mascot's seating situation shows: three wooden tables for two, two tall stools at the ornate antique bar, a low chesterfield (that I wouldn't dare sit on), and a rocking horse (that I would). While it's easy to disdain the lack of seating here (and fun too), it seems the Mascot is about straight-up chililn' with a fresh espresso in their sunbathed and airy exercise in negative space. The antique espresso machine is a beautiful artefact that presses coffee at its own deliberate pace (be warned), but the results are flavourful and solid. (And reasonably priced too.)\n\nThere is soy milk on the counter, lactards.\n\nIt's actually refreshing to enjoy a space that emphasizes relaxation and decompression over work. As someone guilty of being a W\/O (wifi\/outlet) addict, I welcome the Mascot's reminder to sloo o o  o  o   w  down, close your laptop, and relax.\n\n(But they also have wifi here, so take from that what you will.)\n\nObligatory Title Pun: Kicks some serious MASS.\n\nMenu Readability: Beautiful script lettering on a chalk board.\n\nNeed to mention: Their washroom is a must-try. It's beautiful. Also, keep an eye out for a well-hidden Gary Taxali piece.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: To unplug once in a while.
