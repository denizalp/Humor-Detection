I asked for my pedicure nails to be square, they are round. The girl sat in front of me and talk to others in the salon the entire time , not in english...so rude!! The normally relaxing foot rub barely existed, it was like a put out for her....I'll never return. I'd rather pay an American owned salon where they appreciate my business
