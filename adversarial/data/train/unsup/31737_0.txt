Stores are great - but seriously, who was the architect that thought it would be a good idea to line the entire outside perimeter with spots for compact cars? \nNumber one, this is the south - there are more trucks here than anywhere else.\nNumber two, this is an outlet Center. I come with my big car so I can buy lots of things and fit them in the car.\nso many people are trying to park their oversized cars and trucks in those spots - so if you don't have a compact car - get there early.
