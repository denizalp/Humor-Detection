I developed an unhealthy fixation with trying frozen kefir after stumbling across deKEFIR on Yelp. Frozen yogurt is one of my favourite foods, so I was excited by the prospect of trying its more exotic, probiotic laden cousin. My sister was weirded out by the number of times she would find me hunched over the computer looking at the deKEFIR website, and so agreed to accompany me to live out my frozen kefir dreams, even in the dead of winter.\n\nWe meandered through the PATH and finally found the storefront. It was quiet, so we had the full attention of the employees, who offered us samples and explanations (rendered unnecessary by my in-depth research). I ordered a frozen kefir with granola and my sister, a frozen kefir with shredded coconut. Then we sat and ate them.\n\nI loved the taste and consistency of the frozen kefir, and while the granola was respectable, I would almost have preferred the frozen kefir on its own, or with a less toothsome topping. I'm all for textural contrasts, but the chewy and hearty granola interfered with the smooth and slightly sweet and just-the-right-amount-of-tangy frozen kefir in a way that I did not truly enjoy. I would have liked to try the crackle, but I wasn't quite sure what it looked like, and quickly tired of the guessing game where I would point at each individual topping and ask what it was only to be given a short, painfully obvious answer like, \"that's All-Bran Buds.\" I guess an alternative would have been to just ask if they had the crackle, but clearly I was high on life.\n\nI'll miss you while I'm on the other coast, deKEFIR. Until we meet again!
