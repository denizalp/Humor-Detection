There's not much to be said overall.\n\nWe ordered two combination dinners so we could try almost all of their entrees.  Flavor's were bland.  Some of the food was lukewarm.  I hate to do direct restaurant comparisons, but Abay serves more flavorful heated food and is also like a buck or two cheaper.\n\nPro's?  You won't have a hard time trying to get a table here.
