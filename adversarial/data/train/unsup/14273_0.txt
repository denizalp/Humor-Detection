A sushi burrito place on my side of town? oh yes! and they offer poke bowl options too? oh yes yes yes! but a second time back? no no no!\n\nSushi burrito to me is slowly losing it's excitement i mean I still think it's an uncut sushi roll and we've had jaburrito\/soho around to establish their dominance as the sushi burrito spot, nonetheless sushi burritos are still tasty. \n\nSetting: Interesting how lots of sushi derivatives are forming around gyms (poke express\/eos, tail&fin\/24 hour). The restaurant size is normal, maybe a little bit bigger than the old soho location. Interior is clean with plenty of places to sit. \n\nFirst impressions: I noticed a lot of people who look like they worked at a night club, shaking hands with the owner, and taking selfies all over the restaurant. I asked the worker if she noticed the same thing and told me that the partner is an omnia promoter so go figure lol which coincide with a lot of positive reviews on this place but hey that's expected. \n\nFood: The burrito is small compared to the likes of it's predecessors. I got the crabby bastard which was nice but not mind blowing. The crispiness of the crab was good and the pomegranate seeds added a nice sweet accent. \n\nOverall: Convenience of course is great but I wouldn't mind driving a few extra miles for food that is more substantial and tasty. Nobu executive chef turned sushi burrito chef? hmm... doesn't make sense to me.
