First and foremost- thank you to my wonderful husband who gave me the world's most perfect ring! \n\nI had looked for months for the perfect wedding band to match my antique reproduction engagement ring with an oval diamond (which was purchased from a nightmare of an on-line jeweler by my now husband) and was having trouble finding something that matched and that I loved. In our jewelry store search we just happen to stop in at Gemsetter & Company in Chandler. I had a vague idea of what I wanted and found it difficult to describe and Eric took the time to listen and even was able to do a quick drawing of a curved band that carried over some of the antique elements in my engagement ring.  We were considering on purchasing a mold of the custom wedding band to have the option of a curved band on either side of my engagement ring in the future, but Eric gave us a great deal (2 rings for the price of what other jewelers were quoting us for one).  He is an experienced and passionate jeweler and showed how much he cared about what he does by offering to the wax mold and cast the rings in white gold without a deposit because he was excited about the possibilities with such a unique ring set.  The end result turned out better that I could have ever imagined.  The rings are just beautiful and I would recommend Gemsetter & Company in Chandler to anyone.
