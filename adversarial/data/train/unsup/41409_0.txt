It's been awhile since I've stayed her. Needs updating but it's clean. Some staff are attentive and others (guy w Australian accent) will see that you're in line waiting to be helped then return to his gossip of the day. The shuttle is a nice amenity although be sure to call the hotel when you need to be picked up. The card you are given with an extension goes to an ignored voicemail. Oh yes, I guess the don't refresh your room each day.if you stay more than one day. I'll let mgt know. I left for the day just to allow housekeeping to do their thing. Go figure. Breakfast was good. Going to try the one on Dobson next. It's newer.
