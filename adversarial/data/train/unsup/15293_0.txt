So many breakfast spots, so little time.\n\nThe Phoenix breakfast scene kills it and I love this neighborhood spot. \n\nIf you want to pretend like you live in a small town where everybody knows your name, have breakfast on Duza's patio. Walking up to this place, I feel like Lorelai visiting Luke's Diner ... and I've been one time.\n\nThe omelets are perfect for those wanting a healthy brunch. Sometimes, I order a \"table pancake\" at other breakfast spots. It's literally a pancake I make everyone at the table share so that I can indulge, but in a sensible way. Of course, we all still get our own breakfasts, so it's not too sensible. Actually, it's more like, let's all be fat together. Yay, carbs! But when I don't want to do that, this is the spot. The omelet is delicious enough on it's own. Not that you can't indulge here, because you most certainly can. Crispy breakfast naan bread anyone?
