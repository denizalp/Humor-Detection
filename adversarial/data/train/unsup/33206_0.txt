I have gotten in the habit of getting Jitters once a week for the past year. This place has excellent coffee, great music, and very friendly service. They remember returning customers and seem to have many loyal fans. There is 1 woman barista who is consistently unfriendly and sometimes rude, but I don't see her often as she usually works evenings. I wish there was more space to sit and work for a few hours, but that doesn't stop me from going for the coffee. Great neighborhood place!
