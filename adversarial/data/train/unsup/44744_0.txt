I contacted Carpet Monkey a few days ago about having my daughters carpet and upholstery cleaned as a gift.   Lynn emailed me back immediately with a great quote and was able to schedule a day and time that best fit my daughters needs.\n\nTechnician Joe called ahead of the scheduled appointment and even showed up 5 minutes early.  He was very polite, professional and thorough.  He took his time to make sure the carpet and steps were spotless and her off white suede sectional looks like new and it is 10 years old.  We did not think that would ever be possible!\n\nWe would highly recommend this company to anyone and will definitely use them again!\n\nThank you Lynn, Joe and Carpet Monkey, definitely one of the best companies we've dealt with!
