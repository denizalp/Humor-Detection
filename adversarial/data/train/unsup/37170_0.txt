DO NOT COME HERE!! WILL DAMAGE YOUR PHONE TO THE POINT OF NO RETURN!\n\nThe only reason I came here was because my LCD broke and the person who worked at verizon told me about this place. What I should have done was research more repair shops than this place. \n\nI paid $235 to repair the LCD on my galaxyS4. It worked for a few weeks with no problem. Then all of a sudden my phone wouldn't charge at all and wouldn't even turn on. I went to verizon wireless and they got it to turn on and as soon as they started charging it for me, my phone became burning hot to the point I couldn't even hold it in my hands. My phone shut off automatically due to the heat and I couldn't get it to turn on again. \n\nI took it to a different repair shop that's been recommended by many people. They took apart my phone to see what was going on, and the guy asked me if I replaced my LCD on my phone before. He said that the people that replaced the LCD did something with the electrical wiring that's causing short circuits in the phone and basically will be hard to fix. \n\nSo this repair place basically F'd up my phone. I paid $235 to these scam artists for them to only break my phone to the point of no return. I lost everything in my phone. All my contacts, photos! Everything! \n\nDO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT THESE PEOPLE TO DAMAGE YOUR PHONE!
