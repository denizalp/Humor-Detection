I have driven by Changing Hands Book Store a million times and have never stopped by, so during my lunch hour I was set to check it out!\n\nI went prepared with a list of books I wanted to check on to see if they had it and pick up some today.\n\nI have been to the other big 2nd hand bookstore in Mesa tons of times, and have been looking for a few books from Paulo Coelho, trying to build up my collection and they didn't have them so I thought I would try Changing Hands and see if I could get lucky there. \n\nWhen I walked in I went right to the book information desk where I met Brittany, who by the way is extremely helpful, she was wearing a Wuthering Heights t-shirt and 1st thing I said was wow I like your shirt, it was one of my favorite books growing up, she then said oh I have a book you need to check out, so off we went to check out this book, and along the journey she had forgotten she was wearing Wurthering Heights and thought it was Pride and Prejudice which is another favorite of mine and told me if I liked P&P that I should check out Austenland, which I most definitely will now! Then after some small talk about Colin Firth and how dreamy he is, I then quickly refocused to the reason why I was there and showed her my list and off we went!  \n\nI found the books I was looking for, had excellent customer service, and got to check out a new bookstore to me.  Now I just need to go back to Changing Hands when I have more time to explore.
