I used to stay here 15 or 20 years ago and stopped because it got so bad.  Now it is under new ownership and the operations have really improved.  The people are more helpful and very service oriented.  Some areas a little tired, but rooms have been done over very nicely, new equipment and comfortable beds.\n\nHowever, in the restaurant (The Market Garden) the people hate working there and take it out on you.  The MOST unfriendly service I have had in any restaurant in any hotel.  On October 26:  There was one very friendly lady there.  But the cooks\/servers were just ignorant.  Especially the guy making the pizza's.  I just had to walk away.  I would NEVER eat there in the future.
