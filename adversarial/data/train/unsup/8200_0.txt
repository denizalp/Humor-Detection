Can I get some Adriana? Or maybe a bit of Miranda? How about some Alessandra?\n\nIt's as if I walk in as average me and walk out straight onto the Victoria's Secret runway with bombshell hair. I kid you not, Modern Salon does some black magic behind its closed doors. 3 times out of 5 visits, I have been stopped in the streets about my new 'do. Keep talking, I'm listening.\n\nI've never been high maintenance about my haircut, but I've also never walked out of a salon in the past 23 years of my life thinking DANG, I look fabulous. Until Modern. In the five visits I've made, I've never stuck with one stylist (commitment phobe would be an understatement), yet each time the haircut has been consistently extraordinary, even with the gamut of stylists ranging in age, gender, and personal style. Modern must be forcing all of their stylists through some intense hairstyling bootcamp to create the results that they do.  Without fail, they turn my thick, unmanageable hair into long layered tresses of soft waves and swish-able volume. \n\nIf only I could recreate the blowout after the first wash, but that's why no one is paying me to do hair. It's okay, I can live with having Candice Swanepoel's fashion show hair once every three months.
