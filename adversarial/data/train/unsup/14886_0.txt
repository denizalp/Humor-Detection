My office backs up to the daycare playground.\nA few months ago, I came out of my office and kids were throwing large rocks at my car. I told them to knock it off and immediately moved my car. I went over to the front office and I was told that they didn't know why kids were throwing rocks... Well probably because they're unsupervised.\n\nI went outside a few days ago and I heard a boy telling another boy he was going to kill him. He was shouting it at the boy from the top of a slide. Maybe he's just \"playing\", but wth? I kept waiting for a teacher to say something to him to make him stop being so awful, and no one ever piped up so finally I shouted \"YOU DONT SAY THAT! You never, ever say that to someone\"\n\nYesterday and today when I was arriving at work I heard a teacher screaming at the kids on the playground. \n\nI have a kid and there is NO WAY I would ever trust these people to \"watch\" them (watch in parentheses because I don't know what they're actually doing).
