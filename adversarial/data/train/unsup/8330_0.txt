My co-workers and I decided to try this place for lunch.  I was slightly skeptical to begin with being the carnivore that I am, but I figured I'd branch out beyond my typical lunch spots.  The ambience was as I expected a vegetarian\/vegan cafe would be with a spiritual\/yogi vibe.  When we got there, a few people were seated and it was far from what I would consider busy.  We placed our orders and took a seat while we waited for our food...and waited...and waited.  My colleagues ordered smoothies and a salad and I got the portabello cheese steak sandwich with a cup of the spicy roasted tomato vegetable soup.  All items that you would think could be put together and be in customer's hands within 10 - 15 minutes tops.  From placing our order to having food in hand, this quick 'to-go' lunch stop ended up taking almost 40 minutes! \n\nAlthough I thought my food was flavorful, my sandwich did not stay in sandwich form for long.  With every bite, more and more of the sandwich kept spilling out the sides.  At the same time, my soup was more of the consistency of chunky mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately for my co-workers, their salad left a lot to be desired and they resorted to tossing it out.  For the time our adventure took and the price (forgot to mention that you should probably be ready for some sticker shock), I probably won't give this place another attempt.
