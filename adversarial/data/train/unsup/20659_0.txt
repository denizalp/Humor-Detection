What a great place for a churrasco a rodizio (rotisserie barbeque) experience. The restaurant is spacious and we were promptly seated. After our server explained the concept and the menu items, we were off to the salad bar which had an impressive array of dishes: different prepared salads as well as separate salad components and dressings, ceviche, regular crispy as well as candied bacon, feijoada (Brazilian rice and beans, the national dish of the country), olives, pickles and more.  There are also a variety of sauces; don't forget to take a small bowl of chimichurri back to your table because it's the perfect accompaniment for the grilled meats. \nAt the table, the servers brought the skewers of grilled meats - every one of them really good, my favorite being the picanha or grilled top sirloin. We were also provided little trays of side dishes which were a nice touch, especially the bananas fritas which provided a sweet palate cleanser in between the grilled meat entrees. I'm also glad they serve grilled pineapple, not only because it tastes good but also because pineapple contains bromelain, a powerful protein-digesting enzyme and hence really appropriate for a meal that included an abundance of meat items. In all, it was a very flavorful and satisfying feast, and priced right for the quality and quantity of the food we enjoyed.
