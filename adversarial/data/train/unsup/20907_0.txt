YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(154\/365) \"Duck, Duck, Goose...I Mean Pork Belly!\"\n\nBetter late than never,right? After an afternoon of ingredient shopping for Panang Curry across the street at 168 Market, I was tired, hot, and hungry. Rather than just grab something at the 168 Deli, I wanted to try a different spot.\n\nI pulled up the Yelp App on my phone and Asian BBQ was one of the choices and was just across the street. I've never been there, and heard nothing but good things from Yelpers. I saw the first picture and looked no further. I said to myself \"Self, that's what I want, and that's what I'm gonna get!\"\n\nIt looks like nothing from the outside but when you enter, this place is packed with people getting their grub on. Right away, I order the 2 choice BBQ Plate Special ($7.99) of their Roast Duck and Roast Pork. As I peruse the menu, I see Hainan Chicken, and I contemplate on getting a third choice($10.99) The lady taking my order starts giggling because she can see my \"eyes getting bigger than my stomach\" look, and at the same time, I hear R. Kelly...R. KELLY!?!? Yes, R.Kelly, and he's singing (as in the Bump and Grind intro) \"Your mind's telling you NOOOOOO.......But your stomach, your stomach's telling you YESSSSSSSS!\"(Its a BIG sign of hunger when you start hearing things!) I block it all out and stick to my order, and I'm so glad I did because their take out portions are HUMANGOUS!\n\nI get in my car, and it smells SO GOOD, I gotta just have one bite...which turned into another bite, and another one,  and another one! I finally pulled myself together,  turned up the A\/C and headed home.  The duck was very juicy and that liquid Elixir of duck love that they pour over the duck and rice is pretty bomb. The pork was crispy with just enough fat and tasty meat too. I ate half the plate for lunch and the rest for dinner.\n\nCan't wait to come back and try their noodle selections which they also have many choices for! Fast, cheap, and delicious, seriously one of the best deals in town.   ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  5\n\nCASH ONLY and closed on Fridays FYI....
