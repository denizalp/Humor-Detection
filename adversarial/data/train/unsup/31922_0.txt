The food is delicious and the long line went quickly.  However..... no excuse for poor treatment.  We went to the EggSlut in Vegas at The Cosmopolitian.\n\nMost of the seating is far from where the food comes out.  You have to listen for your name.  When our order came up (signature slut) my name was called but the other half of meal was not ready.  They wanted me to take what was ready and keep coming back to check on rest of order.  \n\nI explained I would just wait for both food items so we could eat together.  Weird.... I guess I was considered a problem person for ask for this because others got their bacon sandwiches before me!  I waited patiently 5 min to get 2 items so my husband and I could eat TOGETHER.  :(
