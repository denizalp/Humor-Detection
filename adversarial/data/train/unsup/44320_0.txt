I always enjoy Earl of Sandwich whenever I visit Las Vegas. However, this is the first time I've been to the one at the Caesars food court. I don't know if they do something differently here, but the food was very bland. I shouldn't have to put a bunch of pepper and\/or dressing on my food to make it taste better.\n\nThe buffalo chicken wrap had a very minimal amount of chicken, and had an absurd amount of lettuce, cucumbers, and buffalo sauce. The first bite was just dripping with sauce that made it messy until I was finished. The side of mac and cheese was very bland and had almost no distinct cheesy flavor, despite it being drowned in cheese.\n\nIf you want to go to Earl of Sandwich, I highly recommend the one in the Miracle Mile (Planet Hollywood).
