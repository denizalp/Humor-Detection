I must say as many times as we've ordered from here the food and service is usually amazing. Disappointed today! I was told the order would be ready in 15 mins arrived at the 15 mins only to wait 30 mins for our order. The amount of fish on the crust cod tacos was just sad. I've seen bigger fish sticks.
