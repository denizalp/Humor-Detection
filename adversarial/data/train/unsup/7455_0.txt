Mike D was raving about this place. He said it was his new favorite milk tea joint. When I arrived, there was a short line. The girl that took the orders was friendly an knowledgeable. Free add-on with Yelp check-in, woohoo!\n\nI've been a lavender kick so I ordered the lavender milk tea with raindrop pearls (aka crystal boba at other places). The milk tea comes in a fat container - I get it, it's a sumo theme - short and fat. It's a cool idea but not very functional if you're ordering it to go - it won't fit in most stock cup holders. It's not something that's easy to hold while you're drinking either. I guess you could buy one of their loyalty bottle for $3.00 and save 10% on each drink when you bring the clean loyalty bottle in.\n\nOn to my actual drink - I didn't taste any lavender or tea in the milk tea. It was more like a very sweetened milk. Also, I didn't see very many raindrop pearls all. Maybe an off day? IDK. \n\nFor a $4.50 drink, I wasn't thrilled with it at all.
