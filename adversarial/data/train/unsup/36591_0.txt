Don't get me wrong, the store is neat, clean and new with a helpful staff... but the fact they DO NOT allow you to ship UPS with your own account is rediculous. I Have a business account with UPS and was not able to use it to ship at this location. The only option is to pay from their shipping account.  I am happy to pay for copies, buy tape, boxes and other supplies but I am not happy I can't use my own account. It is UPS, right?
