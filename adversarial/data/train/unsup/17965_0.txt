When researching an economical yet comfortable place to stay in Phoenix, we settled on the Radisson. \n\n\nI will give it kudos on being quiet. The lobby, restaurant, hallways and rooms were nicely appointed, and not at all tacky. It looks like a remodel had been done recently.\n\nI have a scale for judging hotels that Hubs lovingly refers to as \"The 3 ts\": Thread count, Towels, and T.P.\n\nThe Radisson passed the first T...the sheets were soft, and the down pillows meant I didn't have to bring my own from home (a plus in my book)\n\nBut, the other 2 T's were a complete fail.\n\nNow, it was Valentine's Day weekend, and I didn't want to be a killjoy, but I found myself complaining about the towels the moment I got out of the shower....they were tiny, not at all absorbent, and dingy....I know that chlorine is a big environmental no-no....but, when I'm using a towel that Lord-only-knows where it's been...I like to know that a level of disinfecting (aka bleach) has ensued. I quickly caught myself, and told Hubs I was channeling my mother for a moment, but there was really nothing wrong. \n\nThen he took a shower and came out saying \"I don't think I've been in a gym in the country that had worse towels. I've stayed in flea-dives that had better towels\"....so, I was NOT imagining things. I was afraid to use the wash cloth.\n\nMy opinion of the hotel might be hindered by the fact that Herbalife was hosting some sort of weekend seminar there, and there were Herba-low-lifes crawling all over the place. I actually saw a man wearing a paisley tie with a MATCHING BASEBALL HAT....\n\nAnd the 3rd T? Let's just say that, by the end of the 3rd night I had some serious chaffing issues.....sandpaper is softer than their toilet paper!\n\nWould I stay there again? Possibly....you couldn't beat our Hotel-dot-com rate ($80\/night).... but I'd have to bring my own towels\/TP.
