My son and I had a very nice walk here on Saturday morning at 10am - though 9am would've been smarter with the heat!  The park was relatively clean but still had some trash so I took the opportunity to give a lesson about littering.  I didn't know my kid would be so into it! - the rest of our walk was a sanitation scavenger hunt!\n\nWe saw tons of dragonflies in blue, green, red, and yellow, flowering cacti, birds galore - cranes, sandpipers and hummingbirds and their nests in the trees & saguaro.  We saw little fish, and jumping fish, a couple of turtles, and a little rabbit that my son tried to chase - without much luck.  We even searched for fossils & tracked a dino!  I would've liked a few more kid features though, and a little playground wouldn't hurt.\n\nIt was a serene, lovely sanctuary in the midst of urban sprawl and I look forward to visiting again, definitely earlier in the morning or in the milder spring & fall.
