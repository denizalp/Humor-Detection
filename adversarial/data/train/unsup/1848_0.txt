I'm digging SoHo. As a resident of the Fitch, I am always excited to see a new restaurant open. Located in the former Cousins Subs, the food cart opened this fast casual restaurant. The menu is limited and is what I would consider Asian fusion. I opted for the chicken curry. Flavor wise, it was delicious. Not as sweet as a Thai curry. I would consider it a hybrid between Thai and Indian with a decent amount of spice. The only thing holding this back is the lack of protein. Ordered with chicken, it was big on flavor but light on yardbird. While the price point is relatively low ($8.50), I sill expected more. \nI will definitely return as it a perfect place for when you don't want to cook but you also don't want to waste an hour plus at a sit down restaurant.  Welcome to the neighborhood, SoHo!
