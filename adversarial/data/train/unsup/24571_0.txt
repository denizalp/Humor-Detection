Theses guys don't know how to do anything but a simple oil change and tire installation they're not worth more... super dissatisfied!!! Oh and by the way worst customer service ever, fake empathy was not needed by the idiot David behind the computer!!! Took the car in thinking they could fix a leak and engine light and spent over $800  but instead just have coolant flush and oil change!!! Con artist they're fake mechanics biggest mistake ever should of taken my car to a real mechanic
