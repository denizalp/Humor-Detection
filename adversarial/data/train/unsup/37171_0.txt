It makes me sad that the Harrah's buffet received such low reviews! I personally think the selection was great and the value was top notch! Additionally, there was a $5 off coupon that they didn't prohibit the use of... so imagine, 20 people saving $5 each... that's some good stuff! \n\nThey were able to accomodate a party of 20+, in which they should received an award for in itself. Not many Vegas buffets have the ability to do that... :) \n\nAnyway, among my favorites include: Bagel and Lox \/ Unlimited Shrimp (already peeled) \/ Prime Rib. They also had a chocolate fondue fountain with only the best Rice Crispie treats ever!!!
