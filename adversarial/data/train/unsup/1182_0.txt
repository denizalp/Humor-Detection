I am so glad I read the review of the day today!!  It reminded me of the sheer joy that I felt after a session at Eden.  The massage I had there was worth the 5 stars for the sheer fact that I was 8 months pregnant and they had one of those belly-cut-out tables that enables you to lay on your stomach for the massage.  That, my friends, is worth any price when you are a stomach sleeper and haven't been able to lay in that position for 6 months (can I get a \"what what\" from my prego friends out there?!).  They made me feel very very comfortable, and that's kind of a big deal when you look like someone inflated you with a tire hose.  It was so relaxing and calming and absolutely the best thing I could have ever imagined.  I left with an all-over great feeling, and you just can't argue with that.\n\n***don't read the following statement if you are a dude***\nA tip... if you're a short person, the \"cutouts\" for your lady humps don't always match up with where the belly is, you might want to ask for some extra pillows.  Just keepin' it real, here.  You'll thank me later.
