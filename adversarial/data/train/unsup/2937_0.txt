In my search for the best boba spot in Las Vegas, I found myself at Lollicup. It's a franchise that has many locations in SoCal. This Lollicup is located in the middle of Town Square. It is in one of those little kiosks that are along the pathway near the kid's play area. \n\nWatermelon Slush-- AMAZING! The flavor was perfect, not artificial tasting at all which was suprising. I got a large size with boba and it hit the spot in 115 degree weather. Can't go wrong with watermelon anything!\n\nMilky Way-- It's a milk tea with caramel, pudding, and boba. It's sweet, but not overwhelmingly sweet. Not too sure if I would get this again.\n\nThese two large drinks together was about $11. Which is a little pricey, but then again it is on Las Vegas Blvd. The only downfall is that parking at Town Square can be difficult to find on a weekend night.
