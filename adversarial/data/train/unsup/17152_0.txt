I was attending the Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins concert when I finally got the chance to try out The Maine Lobster Lady food truck.\n\nFor my maiden voyage I went for the lobster roll which was as fresh as it will ever get in a land locked state ;)  and worth every penny. The meat was tender and I was very surprised that I liked their mayonnaise based sauce which I had them put in the side along with the customary lemon wedge.\n\nMy only suggestion is maybe they could add a Lobster Boil option where you pay a little extra to get a boiled corn cob and potato along with the bag of Lays chips that comes with.\n\nFrom what other loyal customers in line told me TMLL also offers a mean lobster bisque.\n\nIf I can catch up with their truck before they leave for the season this is a definite must try.\n\nFor dessert the whoopie pie was out of this world!! I could not believe how good it was. The flavor was delicate and not cloyingly sweet like other pies I've tasted. Hurrrrmmmmmmm I wonder if she would sell me the recipe????\n\nUnfortunately, I was so hungry I forgot to get a picture of the lobster rolls but next time I will fix that mistake!
