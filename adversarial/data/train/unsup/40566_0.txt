Once again, if I could give a \"zero\" review I would.  The system stopped working out of the blue.  I have spent over FIVE hours on hold trying to get a technical support person on the phone.  They have tried to close my \"ticket\" twice by email because of MY lack of response.  Are you KIDDING ME?!?!?!  All I asked for was a call back.  Nothing.  Their hours are absurd, if you have a security product you should have technical support around the clock - people are counting on these cameras to work.\n\nI can't get a person on the phone, I can't get a call back.  I can't get an email that isn't from a robot.  I will state, once again, how strongly I feel that NO ONE should buy products from this company unless you want to become an expert and handle all problems on your own.  I've even paid an outside computer company to help me figure this out.  Even they can't help because the setup is SO jumbled and confusing.  So now I'm out that money too.  Worst customer service I've still experienced to date.  DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!!!!
