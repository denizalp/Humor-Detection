this place has saved my butt more times than i can count. i often start projects that i think i can do and then run into show stopping issues. my husband loves this about me, really he does.  yesterday, for instance, i realized the standing water under my kitchen sink was caused by a leaky garbage disposal. so i bought a new one at the home depot and trotted home to install it. i opened the box and realized the fittings weren't the same as my current disposal. called home depot (they're on speed dial on my blackberry) and explained the situation. staffer told me to head back up there and he'd have the part waiting for me. sure enough, i arrive 20 minutes after my phone call and the garbage disposal expert is waiting for me in the garbage disposal aisle with the part i needed and a few helpful hints on how to install the beastly disposal. 3 hours later i had a brand-spanking new garbage disposal installed, a VERY impressed husband and quite a sense of personal satisfaction - i completed my first plumbing project thanks to the home depot!
