This is by far my favorite casino in Vegas! I love everything about it. \n\nIt's only a block behind the strip -- a quick 5 minute walk from Bally's. They consistently have $5 tables no matter what time or day it is. \n\nWhat really makes this casino stand out is it's amazing dealers. All of them are awesome and the best dealers that you will find anywhere. They are all friendly and super engaged with the table. They make playing there a lot of fun. \n\nThis casino might turn you away if you are looking for something upscale and fancy. It's definitely a while in the wall where you will find the locals. It has a lot of character. \n\nThe saddest part about it is that they are doing a bunch of renovations right now and trying to make it hipster. They are heavily advertising for the \"front yard\" which I'm sure will drive up prices and ruin the casino for everyone that loves it now. \n\nUntil then, you'll still find me here everytime I'm in Vegas.
