My wife and I drove out at 4:00 on Valentine's Day. We assumed we wouldn't be seated right away because this place is always busy, but when we went to the bar to wait, we saw at least 50% of the tables unoccupied. The bar tender was cranky, but my wife liked the lemon drop martini he made for her. Once we did get seated, we were provided their Valentine's Day menu. Upon ordering the main entree from that menu, we were told it was unavailable... At 5:00. However, the waitress less us know we could order all those same items, we just couldn't get the special price. I have no idea why they even gave us that menu. Anyway, we ordered the shrimp cocktail for two with Old Bay and it was very good. I ordered two pounds of king crab legs to which the waitress said she'd put in the second pound when I was ready. When I told her I was ready, she forgot about it and we didn't feel like waiting, so we paid and left. Overall, the atmosphere is fun and the food isn't bad... They just need to get their stuff together as a whole. My wife's family is from the east coast where the seafood is amazing, so when we go back to Pickle Bill's, it will be for cocktails and appetizers... Just someplace to hang out.
