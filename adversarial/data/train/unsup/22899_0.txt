I really enjoyed their Royale burger with cheese along with a side of onion rings. The burgers was packed with flavor and prepped just right. Truly hit the spot. The onion rings were prepped to perfection. No greasy. Perfectly cooked being crispy on the inside and soft and chewy on the inside. I really enjoyed my meal and loved they had some Stewart Black Cherry to accompany my meal.\n\nService was quick and friendly, price-tag was good considering the location.\n\nMy only gripe was the old fashioned I ordered for happy hour, it was way too strong and I opted to limit alcohol just there.\n\nLoved this place, would be back for sure.
