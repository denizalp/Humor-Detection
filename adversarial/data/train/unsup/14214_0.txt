Who doesn't love a good bakery?  I happened to pass by Les Co'Pains D'Abord while out and about in the Plateau one day and I thought I would stroll in.  It's a really small bakery with only a handful of tables and it feels a little cramped but sometimes good things come in small packages.  The prices are fair, the service is incredibly friendly and the food is delicious.\n\nTheir food selection is awesome.  I picked up a loaf of multigrain bread for my toast in the mornings and a baguette for a wine and cheese that I was hosting.  Both were super fresh and really soft and chewy.  I also couldn't resist trying some of their sweeter offerings so I got a Pain de Jesuite to eat right then.  This particular pastry consisted of croissant dough and chocolate and it was so delicious.  It was flaky and buttery and thinking of it makes my mouth water.\n\nI'm definitely going to be coming here more often when I'm in the area.  It was a fantastic find and I can't wait to come back.
