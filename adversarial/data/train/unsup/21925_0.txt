Not the Flag Waving Co. You Thought!\n\nJust got my jeans. I was disgusted to see that i just bought Duluth jean that were made in Vietnam. You give the impression that your home grown USA from Wisc., WRONG! I will buy from a company that has Made in the USA clothing. One, you should post where your clothes are made, not just saying \"imported\" (which I didn't notice until my wife went back to the site to re-read the info). As a decorated Vietnam Veteran I would NEVER had purchased these. Vietnam, a country we were at war with and lost 57,000 young men. A Country that is still Communist and we are supporting them with OUR money for clothing you order from them. Duluth Trading will NEVER get another penny from me. I was excited about your line of work pants until I read the label. I will definitely post this on our website Vietnam272nd.com and other military sites that cater to veterans that you do not support USA produce (except for a small handful). \n\nYour site says, and I quote \"Wave it loud & proud. USA made jeans (1 pair), shirts, belts, work boots & shoes let you work in comfort - and tell the world Made In America matters\". How can Duluth stand there and make believe they are a flag waving company? \n\nI will pay the return fee of $6.95 gladly just not to wear a pair of pants made in a country that I fought against and lost friends to. Maybe you should solicit Jane Fonda as your company spokes person.\n\nAn angry and disappointed ex-customer,\nRon
