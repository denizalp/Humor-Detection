A very good, if not superb, but not yet exceptional lunch buffet here in Vegas. After experiencing the well reviewed Bellagio lunch buffet we decided to  try the Mirage Crave for lunch. The ambience is good although not as \"luxurious\" or upscale as the bellagio. However that seems to be the only thing the bellagio has on the Mirage buffet. 1. Food selection is better. 2. The food quality is better. 3. Dessert has a wider selection and tastes better overall. 4. The price is better, especially if you buy the discount coupon for $2   at Tix4Tonight which drops the price from $24 to $18 per person, a much better deal than the Bellagio buffet. Finally, servers are also very gregarious, more so than most places. I think you'll like it.
