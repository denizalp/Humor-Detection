What a scam!  I purchased tickets to see Calvin Harris perform for me and a friend only to find out that the line was 3 blocks long.  When I asked where the line was for people who have already purchased tickets, the bouncer said, \"Unfortunately you're looking at it.\"  He obviously has had to tell many others the same thing and was very nice, but it doesn't make up for the fact that I paid for tickets to something I never got to see.  My idea of a good time is not standing in line for 3 hours to get in.  \n\nInitially I thought that maybe I went on a bad or busy weekend but my co-worker went last weekend and had the exact same experience.  Two thumbs way down for the lack of organization.  The one star goes to the professionalism and politeness of the bouncer because the club doesn't deserve it.
