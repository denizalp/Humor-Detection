All I wanted were some deep-fried foods.  Spring rolls, crab rangoon, maybe some rice to go with.\n\nThe rangoon might have been passable even without crab, but it was soggy along the bottom.  The spring rolls were crisp, but I don't think I even have words for what was wrong with the flavor.\n\nNever again.
