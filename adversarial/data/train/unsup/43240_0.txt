Is this place older? Yes. Does it need updating? Yes. Do my gel\/acrylic nails last longer after getting them done here? YES. Tammy is amazing. She's a perfectionist. You will walk out with picture perfect nails. Everyone is super nice and has a smile on their face. I haven't had a bad encounter yet and I am so thankful! Only downfall, 5 dollars more than other salons for acrylic and gel.
