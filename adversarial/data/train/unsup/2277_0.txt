Sorry Daddy, but you are Nacho my type.\n\nI have dined at the downtown Nacho Daddy location and I also attended a Yelp Elite event at this location.  I returned to this location shortly before 6 pm on a Tuesday with a friend who had never been to Nacho Daddy. \n\nDespite it being happy hour, there was not very many people dining and we were quickly taken to a large and comfortable booth to wait for our server. Personally, I felt like service was a little slow considering how empty the place was, but our waitress was very friendly.\n\nWe started out with margaritas which were excellent. No complimentary chips and salsa here, Daddy's a stingy one. \n\nSince there was a taco Tuesday special (3 for $5), we decided to share a plate of the avocado tacos that I thought were the standout item served at the Elite event. Sadly, these were not as light and crispy as I remembered and they were served drenched in salsa.  \n\nI had never ordered nachos from either of the Nacho Daddy locations I had been to, so it seemed fitting that we share some and we decided on the Filet Mignon Nachos. While the nachos are quite large and easily enough for two people to share, I found the ingredients to not be well dispersed and the ranchero sauce overpowered the other flavors on the plate. \n\nTotal damage for 2 margaritas, the tacos which were on special and a plate of nachos to share was over $50, pretip. While this is by no means overboard for a dinner on the Strip, I do think it was a bit high for what we actually received. \n\nI will keep Nacho Daddy in mind for the rare occasions I need a vegan-friendly spot to take guests for a meal. Personally, I don't foresee myself coming back for more than a margarita.
