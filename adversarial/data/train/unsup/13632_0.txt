Oh, my goodness!  I really love the extraordinary service here at Saks.  Everyone is so warm and friendly and so helpful.  Claudette in the Jo Malone dept. was very helpful, she helped me pick out the best scented candle and carefully wrapped it up for me in that special Jo Malone way complete with black grosgrain ribbon and black tissue paper.  Another highlight of the store for me was the handbags dept.  Oh my.  So many wonderful styles and brands.  I could spend hours there just touching and feeling the merchandise.  Oh, and the David Yurman jewelery is amazing.  I love this store!
