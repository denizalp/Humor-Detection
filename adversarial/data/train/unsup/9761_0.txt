I don't normally leave reviews for company I don't hire, but that is what makes Josh and his company all the more impressive! Before driving out he asked me to send him some pictures of the areas I was concerned about. He told me it is impossible to tell without seeing it in person but that he felt very confident it was in fact mold eating away the drywall by our shower. He gave me some awesome tips for how to go about it myself without investing so much money into this smaller project. He then went on to email me other contacts and info for me later in the evening to make sure I had all of the info. Great guy and extremely impressive service! I would feel confident you are in good hands with him and his team.
