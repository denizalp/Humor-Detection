I just LIVE next door to a Terra West property and hate them.  I have tried on numerous occasions to get them to stop a water situation that is ruining items\non my property.  It seems they only have a machine to answer calls, but not a \nreal person to bother to actually answer the phone.  Thank goodness I found\nout about them before we put our property over to a management company.
