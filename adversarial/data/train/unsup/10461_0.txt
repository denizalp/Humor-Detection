Went here for lunch today. It's disappointing they don't have any kind of lunch menu or any option for smaller portions. It's impossible for 2 diners to polish off a full order of the steamed buns + anything else. -1 star for that. \n\nSteamed juicy Pork buns were great, but honestly not the best I've ever had or anything. Next time I'll try pan fried!\n\nThe beef roll was awesome! BBQ typed sliced beef with cliantro rolled up in a yummy pancake. Loved it. \n\nOn a side note, being the idiot that I am, I assumed the big jar of dark liquid was soy sauce and poured it all over my plate (LOVE soy sauce). Welll it was black vinegar and was repulsive. The soy sauce (actually didn't quite taste like soy...) was in a tiny black bottle. This seemed out of the ordinary to me, but be warned... do NOT make the mistake I did and pour vinegar all over your plate.
