We had fun, but the food was horrible. My husband had burger that was lifeless with cold fries. I had a chicken ceasar salad (the blackened chicken is yummy) but it wasn't good enough to make us go back. I appreciate having a good time, and the hilarious hat they made my husband wear but there are so many food choices in Vegas, the food has to be good. Not to be mean, but the egg mcmuffin I had that morning from the food court was better and fresher.
