Not the best service. I arrived for happy hour at 5:20 PM and there were four open tables yet they weren't going to seat us because they had reservations starting IN AN HOUR. I was told I had an hour to eat. When I told them that was unacceptable they finally sat us, without a time limit, but the joke was still on me... My boyfriend and I both got sick that night from eating the items on their happy hour menu. \n\nThis was my second time there and I do not plan on going back.
