Not the best library,  or part of town.  Nice children's section but A LOT of homeless ppl around. Make sure you double lock your bike too! & as far as using the wifi forget it. If you are able to find a place to sit you will most likely be harassed but will definitely be ready to pass out from toxic homeless people fumes. I eould drive the extra few miles to another location if at all possible
