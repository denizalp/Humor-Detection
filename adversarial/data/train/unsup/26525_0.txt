I was initially happy with my service. I received a new set of lashes on Saturday 8\/12. Amy was not my lash technician, to be honest I'm unsure of the young lady's name that did mine. On Wednesday afternoon I sent a text message to Amy explaining to her how my right eye has less then 1\/2 the lashes of my left eye, due to the loss of lashes I had experienced over the past 4 days. I was actually experiencing the issue on day 2, but because of the fact I'm a night shift nurse my work\/sleep schedule didn't allow me to call sooner. \n\nI was extremely shocked and disappointed by Amy's response to my text. I was basically told that I could come back in and pay $50 for her to fix my lashes. May I remind you it has only been FOUR days since the application of my full set. Needless to say I feel the customer service is extremely unacceptable and I will not be a returning customer. It's extremely unfortunate, due to the fact I had told quite a few co-workers about Bell Lash since they had the pleasure of seeing their work within the first 3 days of me having my lashes done.
