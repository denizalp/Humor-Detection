From the first encounter at the host stand to the very end of the meal, we had a wonderful experience here. Our waiters Keenan and Elijah went above and beyond to make our evening great. They kept up with our jokes, were very personable, polite and professional. Get the Caesar to start FORSURE, they make it table-side and it is such amazing flavors combined. I went with the chicken dish and was amazed at the portion and the extreme flavors that was presented in the dish.  My parents went with the waygoo filets and said it was the best they have had. We finished the dinner with the lemon tart and tiramisu....so decadent. I would highly recommend.
