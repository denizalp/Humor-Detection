Doug was awesome. Looked like he had 9 tables and was still as attentive as possible. As a proprietor maybe you should read all the complaints and staff more. Hostess was awesome the food was A+ and the Rose was refilled as much as possible. Thank god we had a good server or I'm guessing the service would have been very slow.
