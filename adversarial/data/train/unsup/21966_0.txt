Over the years, I've fascinatingly listened to many longtime Phoenix residents fondly reflect on how great Metrocenter used to be. A place where practically everyone would flock to on the weekends to spend money, window shop, or simply just to hang out - a pastime that has become lost in recent years.\n\nIf you search for old pictures of the mall, you'll see that Metro's decline is truly fascinating. I mean, what the hell happened? Unfortunately, bigger and better malls have been built in surrounding areas, making Metro more or less irrelevant in our current consumer culture. The surrounding neighborhood, which isn't the safest based on reputation, only further fuels Metro's decline.\n\nGoing here in present day, the mall reminds me of the perfect setting for George Romero's Dawn of the Dead. In fact, while walking through the practically empty corridors, there's an eerie feeling that sweeps over you. I'm half expected to turn a corner and encounter a group of zombies all moaning in unison while simultaneously pounding on the windows of some off-brand clothing store that no one has ever heard of. \n\nThe store is currently anchored by Sears, which has been on life support for about a decade, despite no one willing to pull the plug. After Macy's skedaddled, we're left with a Dilliard's clearance store, which smells and looks as if it hasn't been updated since the 70s.\n\nFun fact: If you're curious about seeing the mall during its heyday, check out Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure - as portions of the film were shot on location.\n\nI guess there's still a bit of convenience for people who like Hot Topic or sneakerheads (e.g. Footlocker, Champs). But why bother? In fact, Metro's quiet descent into obscurity often has me wondering why the hipsters haven't taken it over in recent years. \n\nHey, maybe I'm onto something here!
