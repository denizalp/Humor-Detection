This food court is really sad, though I appreciate the fact they have a diverse range of food to pick from.  The big thing that got to me was when I got sick from the crab sandwich I had here one night.  And since then, I've avoided this place every time I've been back .  Prices here aren't too bad, but you're better off going somewhere else to pick something up for around the same prices.  2 Stars, sorry!!
