Power properties recently took my company Get a Life Cleaners on as a cleaning vendor and I love how organized their work orders are, their quick response time and obvious high level of managing skills.   Communication is very important when it comes to being a busy property managing company and I enjoy helping them with their cleaning needs as they want a fast turn over on their places being top notch for their clients.  \nGreat job and great services.
