(TL;DR:\n- Bun Bo Hue (Vietnamese spicy beef noodle soup) - Good (meats are not that great, but the broth (a little on the oily side) will satisfy)\n\n- Bun Rieu (Vietnamese crab and tomato noodle soup) - Terrible (very watery and the crab was weak and straight from the can)\n\n- Nem Nuong Cuon (Pork Patty Spring Rolls) they're alright, not amazing, just average. The rice paper wrapper was pretty dense and chewy, plus there's no crispy eggroll inside, but the sauce and the (dry)meat had good flavor)\n\n\nThorough version: \nKinh Do saved my life a few nights ago. I was feeling all of the sickly icky cold symptoms: body aches, stuffy nose\/ runny nose, sneeze attacks, & utter contamination. The only thing that could get me out of bed was the thought of hot and comforting noodle soup - \n\nBun Bo Hue (Vietnamese spicy beef noodle soup) - It came out just as I dreamed, scalding hot! It was a huge portion - lots of noodles, brisket cuts, ham hock, coagulated pig blood (don't be scuuured), pretty much all of the typical fixin's. The meats weren't the best, they were dry and sad. The ham hock was all fat and no real meat bits, and the pig blood tasted frozen; but the broth was super hot, flavorful, and had a nice slight spicy kick to it (don't worry, it's not that spicy.) I also requested extra chili garlic sate sauce on the side to add to the soup and it definitely turned up the spice and the flavors quite nicely. I'd recommend trying that if you enjoy bold flavors and spices like I do. Also make sure to add the plate of veggies (bean sprouts, cabbage mix, herbs, lime\/lemon), it really helps add great crisp texture and brightens the flavors. (Disclaimer: this might be the best place to get bun bo hue in Vegas, but it's definitely not as good as CA or homemade.) Flavor Rating: 4\/5\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Bun Rieu (Vietnamese crab and tomato noodle soup) - It was so watery! It seriously tasted like boiled water and a tomato tossed in it. There was no real layering of flavor that we're used to. Also, they barely gave us any crab - the mixture was straight from a can and the fried tofu was dried out and rock hard. Did we come on the wrong day or what? Coming from a Vietnamese chick - I wouldn't recommend ordering this dish here, it's really a disgrace to the real bun rieu. Flavor Rating: 1\/5\n\nWe also tried the nem nuong cuon. They were alright, the meat was a little dry but I liked the flavor and also the dipping sauce was tasty. My issue was the spring roll wrapper was dense and chewy, I spit out a lot of the wrapper towards the end of the roll. Flavor Rating: 3\/5
