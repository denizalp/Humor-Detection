Emailed them because we have heard scratching noises in a wall in our house.  They called back, asked for my zip code, then told me that they don't come out for rats.  I asked him how he knew they were rats without looking.  He attempted to make assumptions.  I clarified that they would not come out to look, even though I have seen their trucks in my neighborhood.  He stated that they only come out for gophers.  What an intellectual conversation!
