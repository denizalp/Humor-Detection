What a great little spot for daytime noshing.  I am a super big fan of crepes, especially savory ones.  I had the Lean Machine and it was delish!  I would get it sans tzaziki sauce as a re-order (not very \"lean\" and didn't add much flavor IMO).  In addition to their menu of sweet and savory crepes, you can build your own with a ton of creative filling options.  In addition to the crepes, there are really great locally-roasted coffees and about thirty teas.  I had a jasmine tea iced and they brewed it fresh in this cute little pot and then poured it over ice in a small pitcher table. Delicious and refreshing on a hot summer day.  Last but not least, all our communications with staff were friendly and helpful.  Can't wait to make it here for a second visit!
