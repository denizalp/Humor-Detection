If you are an avid Scrapbooker or Crafter, then you are better off going to your closest Hobby Lobby, at least you can get stuff at 30-50% off with non-existent service anyways.\n\nLocated in a strip mall, it could be easily missed. It is pretty large inside. The layout of the store is alittle bizarre. \n\nCrappy service. I've been in this place twice and the service...well, what service? One employee was quite snobbish and obviously didn't want to be there. Other employees were hanging out in the corral (class room area) and were very slow about getting up to ring up customers.\n\nThe merchandise was ok, looked a bit outdated. Not very many product samples.\n\nSkip this place, even though it's been around for a while (and it shows), there are other choices in the East Valley to spend your money for Scrapbook stuff.
