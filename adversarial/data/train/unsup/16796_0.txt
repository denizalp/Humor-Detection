Kiku was so effing good I took one bite and then accidentally punched my friend in the shoulder w my excitement while saying, \"This is so effing good!\"\n\nWhy do I ALWAYS forget about Kiku?  \n\nYou must understand, I love sushi and it's not because I love drinking a whole bunch of sake before I eat the sushi, during, and after.  I go for the sashimi bc I'm not effing around w the rice.  If I'm dining w friends who say they like sushi but won't stray beyond a tuna roll, then I'll just eat regular nigiri w the rice but...bring me raw fish, on a wooden boat, and I'm a happy girl brandishing chopsticks.\n\nI am SO very tired of people talking about Umi.  Umi is spectacular and I love it, but there is other sushi to be had.  I've DONE Chaya and Sushi Too and Sushi Kim and Ginza (RIP) and Kotobuki and Ooshi Bento...  But I always forget about Kiku, and I think it's because its tucked away in station square.\n\nNewly rediscovered, I recommend you dine here.  Its beautiful inside.  They have one of the most sushi restaurant expansive menus in Pittsburgh.  Will sushi make your friend gag?  Bring them here anyway, there is so much to choose from, sushi or otherwise.\n\nThe pricing is reasonable.  The place does not smell like fish.  You'll leave full, and happy, and you wont feel like your wallet has just been raped.\n\nThere is a reason that Kiku has been around for so long, and that it has been nothing but consistent.  Good service, great food, & good atmosphere.  If you haven't been to Kiku in awhile, pay them a visit.\n\nNow I'm craving sushi and I just had some....
