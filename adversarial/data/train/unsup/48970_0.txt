Had a very great experience here! I walked in and was immediately greeted by my consultant Sabrina. She took me back to my area with my family and everyone went out of their way to make sure there was enough room and chairs because I had about 8 people with me. Sabrina then consulted to see the things that I liked and she really took the time to listen. I had told her that I wanted to try on completely different dresses, styles and fabrics. Also I had her pull a gown that I loved from the Disney collection. She went to pull gowns came back and brought exactly what I asked for. All of them were so pretty but we narrowed it down quickly. After  I came to a decision about the dress I was going to order she took the time to find the perfect veil and tiara I probably tried on every veil in the store. Overall great service and would recommend!
