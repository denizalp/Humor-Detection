Mlife has brought me here repeatedly and I always enjoy my stay!\n\nAria is a modern and gorgeous hotel with the friendliest staff!  Known for being the greenest hotel on The Strip, Aria is truly a great place the stay at --- my preferred place to stay at!  The rooms are clean, the beds are inviting, and it's very modern and chic.  Everything is controlled by a bedside tablet and it's convenient.  I love how the tub and shower are connected so you can splash around [be it single or with a partner] and not have to worry about making a mess.  ;)  Jean Phillippe Patisserie is right downstairs and they have some truly delicious sweet treats.  The Buffet at Aria is also pretty spectacular and they have a 24-hr cafe to cure your drunken cravings.  And being a short-walk to Monte Carlo's monorail is definitely a plus.  It's connected to Crystals after all!  \n\nHey, a girl loves to shop.\n\nAnyways, while The Cosmopolitan has definitely stolen some of the lime light, I prefer the friendlier Aria staff and people compared to the snobby Cosmo staff.  The guests here are generally not as snooty too.  Only downside is there's not much to offer entertainment-wise.  Oh well.  That's why you visit Vegas, right?  Walk The Strip and be seen!
