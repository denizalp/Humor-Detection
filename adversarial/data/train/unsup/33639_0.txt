I love this place. No one should love a convenient store\/postal outlet this much. The staff (older lady) is such a sweet heart. Line ups get long but you see them all hustling. They never keep any customer waiting too long. Despite how busy and chaotic it gets she always great me with a smile and asks where I've been!
