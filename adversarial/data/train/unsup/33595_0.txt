3rd visit for me since last Fall.  Very friendly wait staff and the food is very good.  Music in bar can sometimes be too loud in the main dining room.  Went last Thurs night and was by the front windows and the live music was fine and actually nice to hear vs. previous visits.  Had the veg. minestrone soup, which was very good and the Chicken Parm., very good as well.   Kind of pricey but worth it every once in a while.\n\nWill definitely come back but it is a 1\/2 hour drive for me so not always on the short list of nearby restaurants.
