To start off, this place is alright. I ordered a large milk tea and a popcorn chicken to go. The drinks are a little pricy but they do have afternoon specials where your drinks could be half off. My drink cost about $6 and same with the popcorn chicken. To be honest with $6 I could get a much better milk tea with tapioca elsewhere. Nevertheless, the popcorn chicken was really good, but it's not worth the drive.
