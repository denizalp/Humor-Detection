Its possible I may vomit tonight. I just ate a slice of Barro pizza and it was HORRIBLE. I then ate a few disgusting wings and waaa laaa I want to puke. \n\nSo listen up. You want the worst pizza on earth followed with the wings made probably from bats? Order here.\n\nI warned you so if you die your family can say that you were just an ignorant fool to eat here. \n\nTry the hawaiian pizza. It gets delivered ice cold and soggy to the point you think its stuffing.
