For anyone looking to introduce themselves to Bootcamp Bikram, the most intensive of all the yoga classes available in Toronto, they *must* make their start here.\n\nBikram Beaches may not be the spa-like yoga sanctuary you spoiled yogis have come to expect from your privileged lifestyle-like studios. At Bikram Beaches they'll even tell mortified faces that a water bottle is a luxury. No straps, blocks, bolsters will touch the studio boundaries with a ten-foot pole (I know, I was disappointed, too). If you're looking to relax, Bikram isn't the place. If you're looking for stress-relief, better luck elsewhere (I liked YogaSpace http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/yogaspace-toronto#hrid:eLUu21XzZ8_WoygLpEOyXw). Bikram is for those who have the endurance to last through 90 minutes of sweaty, intensive hell, so proceed with caution. 'Hell now, heaven later', as I prefer to tell myself during class as you'll likely get as much benefit as a 3-hour cardio session. \n\nI prefer this studio for an entry as they seem to be a little more welcoming to beginners than other Bikram locations in the GTA, Bikram Yoga Canada (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/bikram-yoga-canada-richmond-hill#hrid:ChngwGFfN239zqaDRhDzkg) is also good for beginners. This studio was almost full on an early Sunday morning, and it's spacious, as was the practice room. \n\nGive it a shot, if you dare. You might really love it!
