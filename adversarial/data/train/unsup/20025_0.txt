My friend and I went to this bar to watch Ohio State vs. Michigan State game. As I am an Ohio State fan, I fully expected heckling. However, as we approached the establishment, my friend and I were physically assaulted by both patrons and employees. This place is about to feel the legal wrath of their ways.
