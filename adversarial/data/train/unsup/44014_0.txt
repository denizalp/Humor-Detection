We had the absolute best car buying experience with Frenchy at Right Toyota!!!  He was patient with our millions of questions, gave us excellent pricing without haggling, completed the process quickly and painlessly. French made sure we knew all our options in features, financing and ensured that we purchased the best car for our needs.  He was so refreshing to work with, very thorough and not a typical car salesperson.  Our experience in finance was quick and we were out of the finance office in just a few minutes.  Overall, it was the best experience we have ever had.
