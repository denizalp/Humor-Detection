I highly recommend the veal sandwich and basic cheese\/pepperoni panzerotti here! The veal is tender and flavourful with just the right amount of sauce in a soft ciabatta bun. The panzerotti was also cheesy and packed with pepperoni, though it was more in the middle. The homemade marinara sauce that comes on the side with the panzerotti was delicious too! Prices were reasonable (about $7 for each of these, plus tax) for the quality that you get!
