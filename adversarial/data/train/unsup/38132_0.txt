This is our second visit.  Nice decor and good service. First time we went for lunch and the menu didn't have the Paella that we thought of getting until dinner.  So we came back.  We started out with the grilled Romaine salad which was tasty but I wouldn't order it again. We ordered the seafood paella which was more than enough for 2 to share.  It was flavorful with a nice selection of fish and seafood but the rice was a bit dry and it was black and crusted on the bottom of the pan. Other items on the menu looked interesting but not sure we will go for a third time.
