The menu looks great, so I had high hopes for this place.  But after trying it twice, I don't think I'll be back.  I have tried several menus items and they are all just okay.  On this latest visit, I tried the chicken and biscuit (sliders basically).  They didn't come with the house pickles as I see in pictures from other Yelpers, so it looks like they have taken those away.  The disappointing thing is that they weren't chicken breast, like most good chicken biscuits.  One was breast and one was thigh.  Ugh, I wish they would say that in advance.   At $14 for two, it is just way overpriced for what you get.  Cocktails are good, but they should be at $14.  The big miss on my first visit was the shrimp and grits - probably the worst I have ever tasted.  The fried chicken is serviceable, but I wished it was better. There is just too much good food in Vegas to go back here.
