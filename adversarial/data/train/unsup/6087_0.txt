I'm slightly embarrassed to admit I've been buying cookies from the Red Velvet Café for years. My girlfriend, too. We're both health-conscious people, and we were attracted to the cookies' low calorie count. \n\n\"Red Velvet Café's Famous Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies: Approximately 27 cookies & 1 gram of fat per cookie!!!,\" read the sign--look for yourself. \n\nThat equates to 162 calories per six-cookie box. The more I thought about it, the more it seemed too good to be true.\n\nAnd it was; a food chemical breakdown test, conducted by the Pacific Coast Analytical Services, showed that Red Velvet Café's cookies actually contain 157 calories each. So when I thought I as eating a 162-calorie box of your cookies, I was actually eating a 942-calorie box.\n\nI learned about this last week, in the Review-Journal. And a couple weeks before that, I began to grow suspicious myself, so I snapped the picture shown above. I also took a secret video of a Café employee walking me through the BS calorie counts of the various baked goods. Then a guy--I believe he's the bakery's co-owner--assured me that the cookies had been tested after baking, and the calorie count was 160. \n\nA total lie.\n\nA week ago I went to the Café to ask for my money back. I gave my info to the assistant manager, who assured me I'd hear back by Tuesday. Tuesday came and I never heard back. So I'm suing.\n\nAm I crazy for wanting my money back? The way I see it, I didn't get the food item for which I bargained. \n\nAm I crazy for thinking Red Velvet Café needs to be punished (through punitive damages) for its outrageous, egregious untruth? I don't care whether they were willfully deceiving or just reckless with the truth; I just care that these people are punished for all the years they made money on a total lie. \n\nI'm suing them in Clark County's Small Claims Court now.
