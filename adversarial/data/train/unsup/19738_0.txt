Had I known better this was the hill billy hotel of Las Vegas I would've paid an extra bill to stay at the aria or venetian where I was last trip. internet doesnt work, pool was closed due to a \"biohazrd\" (a nice way of saying someone took a dump) and renovation is done half ass. Stay away from this place if you dont like hill billies and feces i'm swimming pools.
