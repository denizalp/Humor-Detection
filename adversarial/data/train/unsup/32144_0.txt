Amazing gym.  I travel all over the country and frequently use drop-ins, and this gym is the best I have ever come across.  They just opened a new location and it's impressive.  All of the equipment is high quality and kept in great condition. \nSome of the highlights for me:\n-Plenty of squat rack and Olympic lift stations\n-turf with sleds and kettlebells\n-TRX and pull-up stations\n-assortment of standard and cable machines\n-dumbbells up to 150lbs if I'm not mistaken \n-high quality cardio machines including 5+ stair masters\n-CLEAN\nWe have also been doing their Tribe Fit, small group fitness classes a few days a week and I've noticed an vast improvement in my performance and losing body fat. Well worth the money.\nHowever, they do offer classes included in the membership, including Spin and Yoga (for the time being), and that's very unusual to find in a gym membership without paying extra.  \nStaff is all excellent, you can tell they really take pride in the gym.  Highly recommend.
