a great trendy eatery. food is great. cookies are great. drinks are great. \ndetracted a star because there was no water (all that was offered was a fountain and $4 bottles), there was absolutely nowhere to sit anywhere (literally anywhere), and the price is literally exorbitant. order a fairfax with added avocado and bacon and an orange juice... almost $21. \nin addition the first couple days they were open they were out of at least 5 things on the menu but hey you're popular.
