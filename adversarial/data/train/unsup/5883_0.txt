I visit this theater at least once a week. I keep going back because it's clean \nand the popcorn is good \nand the staff is friendly \nand the pricing is good \nand the seats are comfy \nand ...\n\nI like movies. \n\nParking here can be a pain. Maybe because it's summer and everyone is at the theater & I think they share that lot with some of the surrounding businesses.\n\nAnyway, it's not enough of an issue to make me go somewhere else.\n\nAll that good stuff at the first bit, though? Yeah.
