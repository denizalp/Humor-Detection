This shop has great prices and really nice supply! They have everything from Starbuzz, Khalil Mamoon, to Fumari shisha! They have a wide variety of coals as well. For the hookah's itself it's great as well. They have Khalil Mamoons to Starbuzz hookahs! Oh and if you break your vase for your KM, guess what? They have back up vases that are sold separately too! I go to basically any shop I run into but I love coming here for little stuff like that. I haven't seen any other shop sell separate vases. They even have multiple different kinds of burners so you can heat up your coals. I love that they have D hoses (dream) but on top of that, they have the 2.0 ones as well (my favorite style)! I They have nice bowls for hookah as well. My favorite are the Sahara Smoke ones. It works best with our lotus. I love their customer service too. The guys don't actually look miserable for once and speak english haha. Anyway, all in all this is becoming one of my favorite shops!
