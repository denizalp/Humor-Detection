I'm keeping this short, due to the fact that  all I had was a carne asada burrito.\n-rice was ok, pretty bland\n-beans were good, just salty\n-carne asada was good, also salty. \n\nI would have ordered again from this restaurant since it's close to work, and they deliver until.....\nI got food poisoning!!! Unfortunately I still haven't fully recovered and feel nauseous everytime I eat something. I wish I could give negative stars, instead I'll NEVER eat here again, and would urge the same to anyone reading unless you'd like to lose 5-10 lbs in a week.
