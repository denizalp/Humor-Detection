My I just start out by saying if you have an exotic pet that is in need of true TLC This is NOT the place to take them!! 6am I went to check on my hedgehog before work and her eye was bloody and swollen. Panic stuck I called the first vet I found online, horrible idea, I got a hold of\nAnimal Emergency Center\n 3340 E Patrick Ln, Las Vegas,NV 89120\n(702) 457-8050\nI explained the situation to the receptionist and she said yes we can help come on in. We get there and the \"vet\" took two seconds to look at her and said her eye wasn't savable and they were about to close and couldn't help! WHY tell me to come in then?!? \nThe \"vet was so rude and mean no concern for my little one! like I said took 2 seconds to look at her then said coldly,\" Well that eye is done for. You'll have to have it removed! We're about to close so we can't help\" After my bf asked is there really nothing you can do, why were we told to come right in? the man called him a Jerk! REAL PROFESSIONAL, NOT!  he needs to go sell cars or something, there's no way he CARES for any animal that comes in there! I was sick to my stomach the way they talked to and treated us!\n\nDO NOT GO HERE^ GO to FLAMINGO PET CLINIC INSTEAD! It's right down the street and MUCH better choice!\n\nWe took our little baby to the Flamingo Pet Clinic at 7:30. They weren't open untill 8 but I saw one of the techs arrive, Jason, and explained the situation. As soon he opened the clinic, he got us in a room and gave her something for pain!The doctor arrived shortly after. Dr. Williams is beyond fantastic! This staff is definitely here for the animals! He spent time with her and even said it wasn't necessarily a total loss for the eye. They sent us home with an ointment to help the swelling of the eyelid, antibiotics and pain medicine. He needs the swelling to go down to see the eye and source of the problem. Thank God for people like Jason and Dr. Williams who truly care about the animals. It was about 40 mins from home but after the care we received today I would do it everyday if necessary! 110% A++++++
