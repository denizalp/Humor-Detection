Unfortunately, I've never been at Slots A Fun in its previous incarnation.  Other reviews will tell you, it was and appeared to be the anti-establishment casino.  The defiant dive in the face of the ever growing mega casinos being built around it.  This year, I was going to Vegas for the first time.  I've heard Slots A Fun had changed, I've heard its absurd footlong meat-like product had been replaced with simply an elongated Nathan's.  I was still going to check it out, and I held out hope that the massive baloney tube was still there.\n\nI couldn't imagine, after expecting the things it didn't have, that it was worse than I could hope for.  It is simply just a smoking room with slot machines.  That's it.  With no doors or areas to shield you from the crippling dry heat in early August, it wasn't even a safe haven from the outside world on the strip.\n\nAs Krusty the Clown had suggested about his fast food restaurant on an unmanned oil rig, \"Ah, close the damn thing down.\"
