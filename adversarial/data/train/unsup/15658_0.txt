Don't eat here. Didn't even get our water right when seating us. Inexperienced servers. Terrible, tasteless food. I ordered a side of bacon with my eggs Benedict. This bacon looked like one slice of bacon sliced into 3 , see through, and each piece skinier than my pinky finger, on a bare, full sized plate. They got my girls order wrong and argued with her about it. When asking how our food was the waitress continued walking past us before we could respond. The hash browns were basically instant potatoes smashed flat and fried. It was crap. The food, the service, all of it. I wouldn't eat here if it was free. Dennys is a five star classy restaurant compared to this place. I'm actually upset I can't give less than one star here.
