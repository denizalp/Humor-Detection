I know this is a fast food place but how much is it to ask to have then keep it somewhat clean. This is the only place around where I live that I can go to enjoy my once in a while Taco Bell fix. I use to be in Ontario and they have tonnes there but here not so much.\nThe place is dirty, the drink machine is always down so if this happens when you go you get a warm can of Pepsi. The wait is beyond unbelievable and after waiting so long you get your order and 7\/10 the order is wrong.
