Omg, their chicken sandwich was bomb! I am so glad I decided to try it rather than getting their burger. I have had their cheeseburger before, and to me there wasn't anything really special about it. It was good, but not the best I've had. However there isn't a shake shack back home, so when in Vegas, we had to stop.\nBack to what I was saying... The chicken sandwich was amazing! Definitely a top contender, and a must try. The chicken breast used was super juicy and had a good flavor. The breading is their own recipe and they make it there in the restaurant. It was very good and the seasoning was on point. I usually like to add hot sauce to my chicken sandwiches, but it was good without, and I didn't want to take away from the good flavor. (My mouth is watering as I'm just thinking about it) I ordered the cheese fries and I don't think there was anything special about them. \nThe place was busy, the line was long, but it moved fairly quickly. The prices were average, and the place was pretty large inside with many tables inside and out. If you are in the area and want a quick good bite to eat, check out their chicken sandwich. It won't disappoint.
