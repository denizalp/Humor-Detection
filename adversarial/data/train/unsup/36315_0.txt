This was a fun experience.. although sitting in the dark gets old pretty quickly.  I expected that the food was going to be amazing but it was just ok, nothing fabulous.   For the price we paid I expected higher end cuisine. They say you eat with your eyes and I now wonder if not having the visual of the food was part of the food tasting a bit bland for me!?! It's an interesting experience to eat in complete darkness wondering what the room looks like or what your food looks like. At some point most people end up eating with their hands. (You can't see where or what's on your plate).
