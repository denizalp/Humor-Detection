I seriously love buffets. While my friends wanted to go to vegas for partying and drinking, all i cared about was getting myself to the buffet. I was told to try out the ARIA Buffet. This was our last stop before hitting the road and heading back to LA. The buffet has lots of options and I made sure to try a bit of everything during lunch hour. \n\nOnly thing I was disappointed with are the Egg Rolls, they're terrible! I loved the seafood. However, they don't have a sushi selection. I saw one type of sushi and it looked like california rolls. It actaully looks like their menu changes periodically, so I won't comment on what I ate. \n\nTheir waiter did a great job waiting on us. Kept our drinks filled, which was quite important for a group of hungover guys. \n\nI thought the lunch buffet price was decent, considering how much I ate. I definitely ate more than what I paid for. No joke.
