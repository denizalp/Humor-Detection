I always enjoy a good dumpling Chinese dumplings with little steamers this place has good portions and service is good, my bench seat was ripped cleanliness could have been better we also had the noodle with lamb tasted really good but the noodle was kind of soft it's one of those knife noodle type with very fat noodle but the longer  in the soup the more soggy it became but overall it was good portions for the price
