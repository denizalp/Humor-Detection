Ate here for the first time recently and won't choose to go back. We were seated quickly, but everything after that was SLOW. The place was full but not packed out by any means. We ordered guac for an appetizer ($9) and that came out a good 10 minutes after we ordered it. My buddy ordered the steak fajitas, two of us ordered chicken chimichangas, and another ordered enchiladas. I should have timed the wait, but it was to the point where we all asked ourselves twice where the food was. I saw tons of plates sitting in front of the kitchen not moving for long periods of time. Finally we saw sizzling fajitas coming our way, but they were given to a table that was sat long after us.\nTurns out these were our fajitas and the ticket was labeled wrong. The person bringing our the food was visibly pissed off as they were throwing a mini tantrum in front of the kitchen about the error. The rest of our food came out a few minutes later, and we waited another 10 minutes for new fajitas. My chimichanga ended up being a burrito, as it was not fried. They took half the cost off the fajitas and comped a beer. The waitress was nice. The kitchen seems to be lacking severely. There are countless other Mexican places to get better food and better service.
