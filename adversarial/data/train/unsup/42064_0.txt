I get my laundry done here all the time.\nThe service is very fast and affordable.\nFor the laundry service it works by weight, you drop off your laundry and they text you when it's done. You could also stay there and do your laundry yourself. \nI have never once had an issue with damaged or lost clothing, the staff are super nice and they use very good quality soaps and detergents :)
