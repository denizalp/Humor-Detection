I happened to be nearby and found out that they do dairy free, so I decided to ruin my dinner and give it a whirl!  They had 2 flavors of dairy free to offer, vanilla and chocolate. There is a menu board with a bunch of suggested flavor pairings, and I decided to do the one with Fruity Pebbles (I forget the name already, doh!) and banana in chocolate ice cream, and I asked if they'd toss in a smidge of peanut butter, which they said sure!   It was bomb! I got the small serving, which was pricey, but it was a lot of ice cream.  And what's better than chocolate, banana, and peanut butter in ice cream with fruity pebbles?  Note, much like other made to order ice cream shops, this place gets a line and it takes a few minutes to create each order, so be prepared to wait up to 20 minutes.
