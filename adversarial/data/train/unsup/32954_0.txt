I recently rejoined YMCA because the price is affordable, the equipment is just what I need and I love how non judgmental this place feels. No makeup\/selfie taking girls, and no guys huffing and puffing over at the weights. The building itself is sorta outdated and could use some work but in December they got new equipment (treadmills, bikes, etc) and it's a nice update.
