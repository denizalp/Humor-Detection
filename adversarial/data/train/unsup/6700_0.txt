This is a pretty good water park, and a great substitute for the beach. The wave pool is probably the highlight for me, since it's real fun and relaxing to be carried away by the waves. However, the slides fall into two categories:\n1. Anal cleansing \n2. Floatie slide\nI think it's definitely worth it with the half off discount ($14 per person). Even with the discount though, we could've driven to a real beach with all the money we spent today! But, it's nice if it's a lazy summer day and you've got nothin' to do. But, I'm glad I went, it was totally worth it!
