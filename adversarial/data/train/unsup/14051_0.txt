My wife and I came here for dinner last night. Never heard of this place and I always drive passed this place all the time. \n\nI really love this restaurant; the house is very impressive and rich in history, and the interior decor is grand and stunning to say the least. One of the best French decor in the city. \n\nAwesome experience here. The waiter was professional and the service was top notch!  \n\nMy wife ordered Caesar Salad and I ordered Escargot for starters. They make the Caesars in front of you which was a cool experience. My wife said the Caesar was creamy and a hint of vinegar just like how she wants it. My escargot was tender and was bathed in butter and garlic; super tender and delicious!  They also flambé the escargot in front you. What an experience!!!\n\nFor the mains, my wife ordered the Duckling a l'Orange Grand Marnier and I went with Peppercorn Steak - medium rare. The duck came first and it looks absolutely delicious. My wife said the duck was crispy, deboned and the orange sauce really complimented the duck; well balanced, not too too sweet. Finally our waiter pulled the flambé station over and cooked the peppercorn sauce. When it was ready, he poured it on top of the steak and hand it over. I cut the steak and it felt like I was cutting butter. Medium rare to perfection!  They got it right!  \n\nWe end the night sharing the tiramisu. Oh my god, the tiramisu was heavenly, possibly the best that I've had anywhere. Yelpers, this is a definite must try!\n\nWith all of my restaurant reviews, I always ask will we come back?  Oh yes, most definitely. I've never tip a restaurant 25% but this place deserves it. \n\nFood:  5\/5\nAmbience:  5\/5\nService:  5\/5\nCleanliness:  5\/5
