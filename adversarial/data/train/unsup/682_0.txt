i always forgot about this little joint by my house. it's inside a local casino called eureka, and they started off with a food truck n now they're a popping fusion restaurant.\n\ntheir baos are their starter signiture. their pork belly and short ribs are braised n marinated for 24 hrs which made them so tender, juicy and just pure awesome.\n\nthe fatchoi burger is one of the best gourmet burger i have ever eaten. with a nice thick juicy patty, fried egg, cheese, and shredded short rib... it is a flavor orgy in your mouth!\n\nif you like ducks, they actually cooked their duck legs right! so tender it will fall of the bone, not gamey, and crispy on the outside but melt in your mouth juicy on the inside.\n\nfor breakfast, they have their fusion eggs benedict, not with ham or canadian bacon, those are for the weak hearted! theirs are paired with a nice thick cut of pork belly!!!\n\nSo if you haven't been here? you have not lived your life fully!
