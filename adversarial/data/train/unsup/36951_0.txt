I have been going to sport cuts for around a year but cannot get a good fade no matter who cuts my hair.  Stopped in and got a cut from Ashley.  She gave me a great cut and was pretty cool.  A barber in the back of the shop had some violent trap music playing and I did not like that at all. It was offensive to me.  That's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.
