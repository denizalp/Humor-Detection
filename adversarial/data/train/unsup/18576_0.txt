Gelato Messina is located in downtown Summerlin. It is large, open, and has communal seating. The cases are full of delicious, handmade, creamy gelato and sorbets. There is some funky cartoon art on the high ceilings that is rather eye catching and cute. They also have displays on the wall of their cakes with names and pricing... Yumm. \n\nThe staff is super friendly, Knowledgable about their product, and eager to hand out samples. They have an entire case +1 of vegan sorbets! It's like heaven. I was expecting the fruitier flavors like mango and raspberry to be overly sweet and saturated with sugar. Nope!!! Everything tasted natural and exactly like it should have! Our favorites were the coconut pandan, salted coconut mango, regular mango, and dark chocolate! We chose the coconut pandan and mango... Amazing! Seriously, dairy free, vegan and delicious! \n\nThe pricing... Well... Let's just say that I couldn't of been more impressed with how fair their prices are. Two scoops cost about half of what Amarino costs in the outlets... 5.50 versus 9.25... Hm... And their products and quality... Twice as good. They aren't ripping off their customers and I can feel good about supporting this business. I think I found my new summer gelato spot!
