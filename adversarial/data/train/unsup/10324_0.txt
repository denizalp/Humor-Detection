Cupcakes are often overrated. Not these ones. \n\nYou can get the mini (so the mini versions of cupcakes that are already the mini versions of cakes themselves) or the regular ones. Good idea to taste a bit more of what they have. \n\nYou get the regular chocolate \/ vanilla \/ and so on. And a few seasonal recipes all the time. \n\nThey look and taste great. The strawberry\/champagne was yummy. And totally fresh. \n\nThey do make coffee, my espresso was a real one. Which is a good point. \n\nThey also bake amazing looking cakes for special occasions. Some of them are on display and I have the feeling they taste as great as they look.
