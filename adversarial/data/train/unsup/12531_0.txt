Came here for lunch with my mom couple of weeks ago.   We were seated right away.  They looked very busy and slightly under staffed.  \n\nOur waitress was Ashley E.  She was very welcoming, attentive and helpful.  \n\nWe ordered two cups of egg drop soup, Mongolian beef and Garlic Noodles.  It was the perfect amount to be shared by two.\n\nEverything was delicious and with a little Sriracha sauce on the side, it was perfect!\n\nI do miss the hot sauce, mustard and vinegar that they use to put on the table prior to getting the food.  But the fact that they will bring it to you, it helps.
