Out here tonight to drive through the Gift of Lights.  This is usually in Sunset park, but there were problems with the site this year, so they moved it out to the speedway.  \n\nIt's a drive to get here, then they have it set up way in the back, but once you get in, they utilized the stands of the race track, the surrounding areas and the drive was nicely spread out and tastefully done.\n\nThere were plenty of lights and delights, if you tuned into 101.5 FM, there were holiday tunes to put you in the mood, and since tonight was \"Port of Sub\" night, we got two chocolate chip cookies to enjoy on the way.\n\nEven though the drive was nice, there was something magical about it at Sunset park.  I missed the trees and the feeling I got winding through the park.  The price this year was a little high too, but it's all going to a good cause.  I love the holidays!
