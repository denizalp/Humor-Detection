I've put off reviewing Disgraceland for a while, because I couldn't settle on an appropriate amount of stars. My problem, essentially, is that I have very few standards. If a place has good music and decent beer, I'm usually pretty content (incidentally, this is why I spend so much time at home, where I can provide myself a surplus of both of those things). I become blind to any downside.\n\nAnd Disgraceland really nails the music and the beer, which makes me want to slap 5 stars on it and call it a day. I also recognize, however, that it's not without its flaws, and I'd hate to sacrifice my integrity as a Yelp reviewer and overlook them entirely. So:\n\n-- The brunch. I've ordered three or four different things off the brunch menu and haven't ever really left thinking \"Wow, that was great.\" Usually it's \"Eh, that was okay.\" I think there are better options in the area.\n-- The service. Sometimes very good. Sometimes spotty. During one brunch visit, I sat for an hour at a table that hadn't been wiped clean after the last group left. If it weren't for my aforementioned lack of standards, I DEFINITELY would've been turned off by this. Nonetheless, objectively I recognize the problem here.\n-- The beer selection. Not 100% sure, but it seems like on some nights there are fewer beers on tap. The last time I went there were only three -- 50, PBR, and a third that I don't recall. Would be nice to have a few more options consistently (for others' sake, I mean -- all I need is 50).\n\nWhen it comes down to it though, Disgraceland's flaws aren't enough to ruin the fact that I LOVE IT THERE. Great vibe, great music, affordable drinks, and appropriate volume\/lighting levels (this should be easy but so many bars inexplicably get it wrong). Also: the hot dog with brie and pears on it is amazing. I don't care what any of my friends say.
