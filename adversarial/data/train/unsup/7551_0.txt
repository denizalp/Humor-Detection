What a fabulous little clothing store! So many great finds. \n\nI found great deals, & beautiful clothes. My friend's 15 year old daughter found cute school clothes too. There's just something g for everyone. \n\nThey even have a nice selection of plus size clothes, if you're looking. \n\nThe sales were phenomenal, & I had a Groupon. Do yourself a favor & make the drive here.
