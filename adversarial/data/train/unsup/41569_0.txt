Food is delicious. Fantastic idea to have special delivery menu to Irene's. Make sure to ask for utensils and napkins as it can be messy and Irene's won't have anything. Ordered more traditional, papa verde dilla would be great with an egg for breakfast. Excited to try their more adventurous options.
