Great place to take the kids and even for adults. Even a good date spot.. we go every once in a while and paint soup bowls and we're building up a great collection of them. My kids usually paint on canvas which they also offer. Only gripe is I wish they stayed open till 8 on Fridays. I work late on Friday and we would go way more often if they stayed later than 6. Otherwise, solid place.
