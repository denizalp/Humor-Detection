Love this bar! They allow you to bring your dogs, and it has a very large patio with a huge TV screen in front. They have live music on the weekends, and it's normally the same band which is not the greatest in my opinion. They have great deals on mimosa buckets on Saturdays and Sundays. Really like this place! Only gave 4 stars because sometimes the waitresses are not very attentive. Overall, one of my favorite places to go and it has a nice laid back vibe.
