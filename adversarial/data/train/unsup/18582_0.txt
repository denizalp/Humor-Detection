Went here to try their winterlicous meal. The services was impeccable. I was also really impressed how comfortably they handled the changes in reservations. I originally called for a table of 8, then called again to change it to 10, and then ONCE AGAIN (I'm the worst) to ask if we could get a table for 14. They handled the changes with grace and charm. (Note, if you want a table for more than 10, you have to sign a contract with your visa number in case you don't show, or your numbers change. Just something to keep in mind.)\n\nThe food was really excellent. I ordered the Ahi tuna appetizer, which was probably my least favourite of the three dishes. It was good, but small, and the soy slightly overpowered the delicate fish. \n\nI had the short ribs main. There were so good I ALMOST CRIED. I kid you not. They were beautiful. The heavens sang. The angels cried (because I finished it all and saved nothing for them).\n\nMy friend and I split the chocolate pot de crème and the ice cream sandwich desserts. Both were delicious. The pot de crème had pop rocks on it which was interesting for sure, but I'm not sure it added to the desert besides the fun\/surprise factor.\n\nWinterlicious menu with two glasses of their wine for $85 with tax and tip.\n\nJust do it.
