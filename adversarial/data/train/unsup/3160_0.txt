I dislike Caesar's to begin with..so..so..SO much! Then you throw in a s*** show like Rao's and you might as well go home. \n\nWe were a large party (17) and called in advance for reservations. They indicated that they had to split us into 2 groups because they couldn't seat 17 together. Not great, but ok. What they failed to mention is that they would seat us 45 minutes apart (even though the restaurant was 1\/2 empty! \n\nThe food was a whole different pile! It was obvious that everything was pre cooked and sitting under heat lamps before being sauced and served.  All of the meats were dry and tough, pastas over cooked and nearly mushy. No one was able to make it past 1\/2 their plate before just giving up in disgust.\n\nWith so much great food in Vegas, DON'T waste any time here!
