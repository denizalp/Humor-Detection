Traveled through LAs Vegas yesterday. I travel a lot through many different airports and this takes the cake. \nFor the last six or eight months i have sailed through TSA with my liquids in a makeup bag and left in my travel bag. Everything is under three oz. and I have been able to get through without any problem. \nNot in Las Vegas. She pulled me to the side, pulled out all my bottles, and put them into a baggie I happened to have with me for something else and then sent it through the machine again and says I can go.\nIn case you didnt understand what happened, all she did was move my bottles from one place to another. WTH? She didnt take anything away from me ,I didnt have anything too large, she just needed a power trip that day and decided that she wanted to rearrange my items.\nI dont have a problem with rules but if you are going to have rules then they should be the same at every airport. This was the most ridiculous display of our TSA at work.
