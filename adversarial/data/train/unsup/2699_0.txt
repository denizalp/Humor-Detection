STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL.  My family and I visited this hotel today and experienced the worst.  I escalated it in-person to the Assistant Front Office Manager but no immediate action.  Filed a formal complaint and addressed it to the General Manager and Front Office Manager for immediate action and attention. \n\nDetails:\n1.  My wife and 2.5-year-old daughter were waiting for me in the lobby of your property right in front of your Front Office this afternoon around 3:45 pm to 4:15 pm, August 23, 2017 (Wednesday) (Attached is the picture I took.  My wife and daughter were sitting near the corner where the green pillow is.). We were planning to eat at the in-house restaurant.  \n2.  While waiting for me, they were playing with the point-and-shoot camera and was trying to take a selfie.  My toddler daughter was looking at the mirror (Behind) while my wife was trying to take the picture.  They were giggling and having fun.  \n3.  Suddenly, both of them heard a loud commanding voice right across the counter from your Front Office Staff.  Treovor H. shouted at my wife and daughter telling them not to touch the mirror since they might break it.  There were around 8-14 people in the area who heard the loud voice.  My wife being very timid didn't say a word and my daughter was terrified and in the state of shock.  \n4.  A few minutes after, I arrived and saw that something was wrong.  My wife was almost in tears from the public humiliation and aggressive behavior of Treovor H.  I listened to my wife and tried to calm her down.  After which, I lined up patiently to speak with a Manager.  The first person I spoke with was Sheena Y.  I told her what happened.  \n5.  My wife, daughter, and I walked to the in-house restaurant.  My wife was almost in tears and my daughter in a state of shock.  This is the first time that someone shouted at them and humiliated them publicly.
