This place is super cool! They have over 22 beers on tap, 100 different bottles of beer, and lots to beer infused food. If you food and beer this is the place to be! The servers and chefs are so also very knowledgeable about the menu they have whether it's food or beer or pairings. They also have a patio on the side of the building. It does get much sun because it's between the two big buildings, but it's still nice. We order a Belgium beer with white sauce mussels and also a pulled pork burger. It was so delicious !
