Ricci's is a great lunch time spot. They have a nice sit down area but the majority of my orders have been delivery.\n\nI've tried a few pastas, a panzo and a sandwich which have all been great.\nThe only item I would not recommend is the grilled veggie wrap. I've ordered this thinking it was a \"healthy option\" however the wrap was soaked in oil. Yuck! \n\nGreat portions, fresh ingredients and fair prices. I would recommend Ricci's to anyone for a quick but delicious italian meal.
