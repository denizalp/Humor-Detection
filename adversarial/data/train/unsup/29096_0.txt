Really excellent food. Tartar is one of the best i ever had, worth 21$. Great pizzas and sandwiches of course. Excellent fresh caesar salad. Chopped salad ok. Very good homemade chicken noodle soup. Ate here for a few days and it was consistently on point. Solid service. Open 24 hrs too! Side note, those potato chips everyone writes about are not that great, though unique, they are very heavy handed, blue-cheese completely overpowers truffle flavor, they are just sauced chips in the end. French-fries are also not spectacular, but side salads are perfect.
