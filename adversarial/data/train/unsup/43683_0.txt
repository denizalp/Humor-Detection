If I could give 0 stars, I would.  \n\nThis restaurant is absolutely horrible.  The food generally isn't horrible, but the pizza is and there are some dishes that are just absolute junk.  Their portions are also barely anything and all of the food is way overpriced.  You get no value for your money.  The worst part is the service is always SLOW AS CAN BE.  Today we (2 people) dined in and our meals were delivered almost 15 minutes apart.  How does it take so long to make some tacos?  My drink (ice water) also sat empty for 15 minutes.  Meanwhile both waitresses leaned on the wall behind the bar, texting on their cell phones, not tending to any guests.  The owner and\/or his staff clearly does NOT care!  The food ALWAYS takes forever to be delivered, but to have our meals delivered 15 minutes apart... come on!  Then the waitress doesn't even apologize for the ridiculous delay!  The restaurant wasn't even busy, but still you can't somehow figure out to ACT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY.  These people to not care about their guests.  To the owner, you need all new staff, or perhaps simply a manager who knows what s\/he's doing.  Highly recommend AGAINST ever patronizing this restaurant.
