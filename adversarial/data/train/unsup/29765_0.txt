I want to preface this by saying this is a review only of the piercing services at No Regrets. I've seen some really beautiful tattoo work come out of here but haven't had any done here myself so I can't comment on it.  \n\nI got my nipples pierced here on a whim in February and boy do I regret it. Both my regular piercer in Chicago and my dermatologist who specializes in scarring have confirmed that the two women who did the piercing not only used the wrong gauge, but also placed the piercings at the wrong depth. It not only made the piercings very painful to heal, but also made them heal very badly. I also got my nose pierced here in college and was told by another piercer that they used the wrong gauge for that too, so this seems to be a pattern with their piercers. I had to pay to have my nose re-pierced (it healed beautifully with the larger gauge) and will have to pay to have the scarring treated from my most recent piercings. My piercer and doctor told me I should never go here again for a piercing, and I'd recommend you don't either. Just shell out the extra money and go somewhere with a really good piercing rep.
