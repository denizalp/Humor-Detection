YYC is a pretty decent airport for its size. There are okay amenities, it's clean, the folks are fairly nice, and did I mention it's clean? And flying out on a weekday afternoon everything is nice and mellow. But there are a few gripes I have with this airport that I can't just let fly.\n\n1. No free Wifi! This sucks. There's \"free\" wifi if you are willing to sign up for something or if Rogers can text you a code... something that's decidedly not free if you have a US cell phone and simply turning that sucker on in Rogers cell range will cost me the cash equivalent of a black-market kidney. 30-minutes of slow, ad-driven service is not \"free\" either. Boo on that. \n\n2. US Preclearance is slow. Super slow. When I rolled through there were two employees on, and it took me a good 30 mins to get through preclearance... and this was for a fairly short line. Maybe 12-15 people in front of me. Glad I was super early for my flight!\n\nOther than these two complaints (minus a star for each), YYC is a quality place to spend a couple of hours.
