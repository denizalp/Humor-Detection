Place is pretty awesome.  You can find anything from a Boyz II Men cassette single to a carburetor for a '93 LeSabre.  People with oxygen tanks smoking and more mullets than you can count.  Many vendors.  Like, 80 tables last time I was there.  Took my daughter and I over an hour to see them all!  Only a 1.00 to get in and it's worth it.  Snack stands around for coffee and roller dogs if ya want.  There is a lot of gems to be found here.  Not the type of gems \"vintage\" stores have and you pay through the nose for.  This is the type of place they come to sort the good from the bad and find the hidden goodies.  Make them get a real job and find the goodies for yourself...
