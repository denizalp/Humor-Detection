Ate here the night of 4th of July, our party was large, had reservations, took up half the restaurant, they weren't ready for us so they scrambled to set up more tables and chairs. We didn't wait too long for drinks but our food took awhile to get, our party organizer said she told them to have food ready for us at 6:30 when we arrived but it wasn't. Then when food started coming out, there was no room on the table, there was so much, some tables hardly got anything so we shared as much as we could. The staff was polite and apologetic and tried their best to keep us happy. The food was good, I felt like the pork and steak were the way to go, chicken was dry. House Margarita's were good too.\nI would go back and give it a try on our own if given the opportunity.
