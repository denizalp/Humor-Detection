Elevated comfort food with excellent service! Great decor. The atmosphere was fun but hard to enjoy because the restaurant is so incredibly loud you can barely hear the person next to you. Four people dined for $116, which was less than I had anticipated. I'll be back. Next time I'll try some dessert. \n\n\nNow for the food. We had fried green tomatoes, bone marrow, biscuits, cornbread, chicken and waffles and mac and cheese. The fried green tomatoes were decent. They looked better than they tasted. The bone marrow was the best I've ever had. Smokey and delightful. The only complaint is that they serve 3 giant pieces of marrow with 4 tiny squares of bread. The biscuits are fantastic and that apple butter is on point! The cornbread was edible but my least favorite dish. The chicken was juicy and delicious. Definitely some of the best chicken I've had, but $26 for chicken and waffles is kind of obscene. The mac and cheese was good but not the best I've ever had.
