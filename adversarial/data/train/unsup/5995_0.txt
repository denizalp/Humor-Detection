Came for a coffee per the reviews. The experience itself was good. The baristas seemed friendly and nice. They were a little slow as they like to have conversations with others. The set up is kind of strange- it looks like a bar with seating all around except one side with the creamers\/sugars\/etc. That made it difficult to order because you don't know where to stand to get someone's attention. The coffee was just that- coffee. We got the cone press\/drip coffee so I thought it would taste fresh and vibrant but it almost tasted like old\/strong coffee. I'm not sure if the beans weren't roasted properly or if they were old themselves but I really couldn't drink the coffee- I ended up tossing it. I wouldn't come here again- I just expect a more unique (not run of the mill) coffee joint to taste better.
