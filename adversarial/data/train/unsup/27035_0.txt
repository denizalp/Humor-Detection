Can't imagine shopping anywhere else. Tom and Tim are true pros and have continued a long history of quality service in the jewelry industry in Phoenix. My wife is always thrilled to see the Schmitt \"blue bag\" come home. The guidance and suggestions (in any price range) from the staff is outstanding and they never disappoint. A great example of what an excellent locally owned business looks like.
