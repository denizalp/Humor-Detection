After having brunch at nearby Crepe Expectations, even though we were completely stuffed, Allison S. and I couldn't resist stopping by Popped to get some munchies for later. \n\nPopped is located in a fairly busy shopping center with ample parking. I found the actual store to be a bit on the small side and it was hot and humid inside, I am unsure if they were having issues with their air conditioning perhaps?\n\nA friendly female employee welcomed us and offered us samples of all sorts of delicious popcorn. In fact even after we had made our purchases, she was still offering up more samples. \n\nI ended up with 3 small bags of popcorn:\n\nJalapeno - For my husband. I didn't care much for it, but I don't do jalapeno flavored anything. \n\nChili Limon - From the special menu, the only thing I didn't get to sample. I knew my husband would love it based only on the name and I was right. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it as well\n\nPink'Adelic - I knew as soon as I read the description I wanted it. White chocolate, raspberry, pop rocks AND nerds?! Count me in. \n\nWith the 15% Off Yelp offer, my total was just over $10. My husband and I munched on our popcorn all weekend, it's delicious and super addictive. I will certainly be \"popping\" into Popped in the future for more delicious sweet and salty snacks!
