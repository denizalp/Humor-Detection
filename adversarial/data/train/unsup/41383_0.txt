Okay, I've been in this town nearly 30 years... and I've always had cats.. and I've always needed a good vet.  I thought I had a good vet until I met the people and doctors at Bonanza Cat Hospital.  There are no finer people to care for your cat.  They truly are more concerned about the well being and health of your cat than the money in their pocket.  They are wonderful!  When my old vet would have charged me over $800 to save the life of my elderly kitty, BCH only charged me waay less.  I can absolutely afford to take my kitties to the vet now that I've found Bonanza Cat Hospital.  The POPPY FOUNDATON at the Bonanza Cat Hospital too, is a beautiful place.  If you're feeling stressed, just stop in for some kitty loving.  Nothing calms the nerves like spending some time in a roomful of warm fuzzy love.  I couldn't recommend them more!  Thank you Dr. Steelman and Dr. Lemon for all you do
