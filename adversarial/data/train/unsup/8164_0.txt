Okay, so I am rather new to town and have been to very famous and not so famous soul food restaurants around the world, and this one is to me, only decent.  I decided to try this restaurant out today after visiting an historical church for Sunday service, that is right across the street.  \n\nAs I walked over to the restaurant, I got giddy inside thinking that I would be welcomed by absolutely amazing down home soul food that I have experienced in Harlem, Houston, St. Louis, New Jersey, and even Philly, but I was not.  I knew that the ambiance was not going to be upscale, which is fine with me, but the food is not as exciting as the previous reviewers make it seem.  Maybe my taste buds are a little too snobby, but like I said I have had amazing soul food in other places, not just the South. \n\nMoving on, I had the fried chicken, mac n cheese, black eyed peas, cabbage, and corn bread.  I must say that the black eyed peas and corn bread were pretty good, but the cabbage lacked lots of flavor, and so did the fried chicken.  Also the fried chicken was very salty, but lacked flavor, which to me is a little oxymoronic. \n\nThe waitress\/waiter were very nice.  I will not go back because I do not feel like the meal was worth the $13.00 plus tax.\n\nI will go over and try Lo-Los Chicken and Waffles soon and hopefully there, I will find delicious soul food that I left behind on the East Coast in New Jersey, NY, and Philly!
