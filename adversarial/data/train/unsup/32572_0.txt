My husband and I call this place our \"clubhouse\", equating it to the special places in the gated communities where some choose to live.  Thomas Street Tavern is one of the hubs of our neighborhood.  They make wonderful, fresh salads with plenty of dressing on the side.  Last time that I was there, my friend and I ordered the spinach artichoke dip.  So good.  Served with the right amount warm pita bread.  I have never been disappointed with their food.  The interior is just right for a neighborhood pub, and it features front door and back door outside spaces.  We have such good memories from years of hanging out at our neighborhood club house and can't imagine a better experience in a fancy-dancy exclusive community spot.
