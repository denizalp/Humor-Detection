This was my second time here and my last. Quick story: Was there for six hours on my day off, hair looked exactly the same as when I walked in, stylist was slow and asked me if she needed me to blow dry my hair after washing it, instructor was unprofessional and said it was my fault (loudly) that my hair looked the same. Paid $40 and got out of there. Waste of time mostly, but also waste of money.\n\nFull story: First red flag is when I looked around everyone's hair was very \"alternative\" looking....shaved heads, dramatic colors, all the students had tats and piercings-now I note this because I wouldn't go to a salon that looks like a tattoo parlor. I'm not saying if you have tats and piercings you cannot do my hair but we have completely different taste and that may matter.  And it did. So, I asked for highlights and lowlights which is my usual since I have very fine hair and color adds dimension. Shelby, my stylist asks me which colors so I tell her and she has to get the \"green light\" from her instructor, Ms. Henry.  This lady pretty much looks at me and guesses what I want....tells me which lowlight color I want as though she knows the exact look I'm going for.  Who am I to argue...she's the pro right? My hair is blonde= The highlight is bleach so that's the \"color\" and I originally chose a color that's light brown for the lowlight....Ms. Henry switches it to dark blonde- fine. \n\nMy favorite part of Shelby was that she didn't talk to me almost at all- why did I like this?  Because I didn't have to make idle chit chat with a stranger I will never see again.  Ha...I mean really we have enough of these types of conversations right...I wanted to just sit there and think and have some \"me\" time.  So 5 hours pass and this girl isn't close to done, she finally asks for help and so I have two students working on my hair....this is usually what happens and okay with me even though my hair turns  out slightly different on each side. \n\nShe washes my hair and tells me to go back to her station while she cleans. I'm there.  Then she asks me \"Did you need me to blow dry your hair or anything\"?  I thought this was a strange question...I mean did she want me to blow dry it myself?  Did she think I didn't want to see the results?...or worse was she trying to get me to leave because she knew it didn't come out right?  Anyway so I said \"Well...yeah\".  This is when I knew her tip went from $20 to $10. \n\nMy hair looks: the same as when I walked in. Not kidding...Okay not the same...it looks shampooed and blow dried. She says \"I guess you can't really see the color but you can back here\"...no mirror to show me though....and I'm just sitting  there thinking....okay you know what this is fine...at least it's not something bad...like a bad color or that my hair fell out...\n\nMs. Henry has to \"sign off\" on my hair. She immediately says...\"You can't really see the difference because you wanted the highlights and the lowlights to be thin so it's not a dramatic effect\".  I mean I didn't want that \"skunk\" look and I always elect \"thin\" I don't have enough hair to choose \"thick\"....so I just stay quiet. Then she says \"I think you don't like it because you wanted it to be more blonde\".  I thought this was odd since my hair is blonde and still remained blonde...if anything I wanted it to be more than \"just blonde\". \n\nAwkward moments begin: Ms. Henry asks Shelby if she can stay to add 4 more foils in my hair. Shelby says \"I don't want to but I can if you need me to\"...goodness thanks Shelby....this is when tip went to $5.  She agrees to stay and I feel so weird that I say \"Hey sorry for making you stay longer\" (as though this is my fault)...and she says \"It's okay I need to make up hours anyway\". Okay, great. \n\nAnother 45 min of my time. There I am with additional foils and she asks Ms. Henry \"Do I need to shampoo her hair all over again\".  No, Shelby, just let me go home and I'll shampoo it myself and while we're at it...why didn't I just do my own highlights? \n\nThe cashier says: \"Um...did you get your hair done?\"  I say yes...she says \"Okay...what did you get done? Why is your hair in a wet pony tail? Can I see your hair\"?  I show her....and tell her for times sake I asked for my stylist not to dry it so I can get going. She says...I can't tell what you had done. Same thing the mirror told me...and she offered me a \"re-do\" BUT before I even pay she asks Ms. Henry what happened and she loudly says \"This client doesn't know what she wants and had hair growth that interfered with the color- she just wants to be more blonde\". Maybe because it was an all day event but I seriously had it with this unprofessional lady YELLING about me. I didn't complain ONCE. I never said one thing. She knew it was blah which is why she offered me more foils. And of course I know what I wanted...Highlights and lowlights. I paid, I left, I am grateful my hair is at least \"untouched\" rather than in need of emergency treatment. Worst day off in a long time.
