Its a pretty chill atmosphere and they are pretty cheap its like chilling in your friends basement. The staff is pretty knowledgeable and they have a huge selection of flavors my personal favorite is \"The Garden of Eden\" which is mint and rose pedals. Dont expect something lavish or a club atmosphere youre spending $10 a person... there have been times they took forever to change our hookahs or give us our hookah but its no big deal... the only thing that bugs me is they only give you 1 pipe to smoke out of.... i was with a group of 4 and we all had to share 1 pipe every other lounge ive been in was 1 pipe per 2 people it just gets annoying
