3\/31\/13: The people are very friendly and it's a great basic Bible church, however no praying the Spirit here, nor interpretation of tongues, nor healing manifestations because it isn't being preached and believed.  Seems like they have a form of Godliness but deny the power thereof.\nOnly place I've found that still has a full choir\/orchestra but you have to go early to sing the \"traditional\" hymns; that service is at 8 a.m.\nSome Sundays they will have special choirs, etc. so you cannot even go to sing praises and worship the Lord. Oh - and don't even bother to show up next Sunday, they aren't even going to be there!!!!
