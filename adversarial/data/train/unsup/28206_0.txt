Christopher Movers is THE BEST! Over 25 years we had many military moves. This was our first as retired folks. I never thought moving could be enjoyable but everyone at Christopher Movers made our move fun! From Ann, the friendly secretary, to Mike the knowledgeable estimator, to the muscle men movers Marvin, Alex, Antonin and Tony, everyone was professional, polite, friendly and task oriented! They did everything they could to save us money. There were no hidden fees and because of their hard work our costs were below the original estimate. We would recommend them to anyone who wants a top notch moving experience!
