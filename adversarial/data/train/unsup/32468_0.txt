I like to say that, in general I love BMV, but I realized ...I was spoiled by first living near the big one on Bloor Street....the others kinda blow. \n\nI love the idea, the prices, and most of them do have some decent selection - I can definitely find a ton of books I want and don't need but will still buy at any of the locations....it's just that I can walk into this location and not buy something, whereas the Annex one...that can't happen. \n\nI looked for a notebook at this one and the cashier even admitted \"yeah this location sucks\"
