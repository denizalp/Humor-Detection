I went there on a Saturday night and it was very busy. There is no waiting area except for the small bar which was full as well. \n\nAfter waiting quite awhile to get sat (our fault-no reservations) our server immediately welcomed us. \n\nThe service was good, but the food was sub-par. It was just ok. I expected to be wowed. I wasn't. After a long wait and so much hype...I was disappointed.
