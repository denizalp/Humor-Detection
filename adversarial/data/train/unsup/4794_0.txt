This 'cupcakery' recently opened in Strongsville and I went in to check them out.  They were offering a 'Grand Opening' promotion which was Buy 3, Get 1 free.  I assume it was for all of the desserts.  I chose cake balls since I specifically went in for those.  The cupcakes looked delicious, but I opted out for this visit.  They were out of a lot of choices because she stated they were so busy for their 'Grand Opening'.  That's fine since I'm there for the cake balls anyway.  Looking at the selection, they had a pretty poor presentation (stacked in a cylandar jar and sweaty) and only four different flavors.  However, I tasted two and they were delicious.  It is, I suppose, what's inside that counts.  \n\nI can't write a legit review not having tried the cupcakes, so I will surely go back for those.  There was one particularly intriguing called 'The Glob'.  See photo for what's inside.  I also got a pumpkin latte which was good and inexpensive.  My 4 cake balls and latte were $5 and some change.\n  \n\nI'll go back and try them again.  Apparently they have a vegan and gluten free section as well.  For each dessert,  they state the calorie amount which is nice, but actually made me feel even a little more guilty.  Ignorance is bliss.
