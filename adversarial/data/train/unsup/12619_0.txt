Pro:\n-Spacious - even for this sold out event\n-Quick service for drinks\n-Great overall performances by all the DJ's\n\nCons:\n-Security involved with all the lines were rude power tripping assholes\n-Servers for the cabanas were racist and rude\n-Security on the inside were assholes literally pushes people around that were simply trying to enjoy themselves\n\nThis club was beautiful and filled with beautiful people.  The only drawback, AND THIS IS A HUGE ONE, is that the people in charge of both keeping the peace and keeping the patrons happy were COMPLETE ASSHOLES.\n\nAround the entrance to the pools are cabanas that expensive as fu**, and rightfully so especially since it was a dope lineup for the show.  When people pay so much money for a prime spot, it's understandable that they want their area for their people and for other people to stay out.  My issue isn't with the fact that these spots are exclusive, my issue is with the way that the servers were handling it.  I was walking into the pool to cool down and the entrance was right between 2 cabanas.  This was a common entrance and EVERYONE was using it. When I tried, the server came up to me yelling in my face saying, \"THIS IS THE LAST FU**ING TIME I'M GOING TO TELLYOU, STAY THE FU** OUT OF THIS CABANA AREA OR I'M GOING TO KICK YOU THE FU** OUT!!!! \"\nI responded by simply saying, \" I understand what you're saying, but there really isn't a reason to be so rude about it.  This is the first time I'm hearing this and it won't happen again.\"\nHe then responded with, \" I'm sorry but I've been telling you people all day and to tell you the truth, all you asians look alike. \"\nMy jaw literally dropped when the guy told me this.  I couldn't believe this came out of this guys mouth.  My friend saw the disgust in my face and came over to figure out what was going on.  And before I could gather myself to respond, my friend got me out of the pool and I went to my \"respective corner\" in this verbal boxing match that I didn't even have a chance to throw a response too.\nAfter talking to my friend, the server repeated how all of the asians at the club look alike and how he \" didn't want to be that guy who says stuff like that. \"  by \" that guy \" I'm sure he meant another racist white guy.  The cherry on top, was that when he was telling me friend how many times he had to yell at people to stay out, he pointed to my black friend and said especially that ni**er over there.  This is when my friend simply walked away because not only was my black friend no where near the area he was \"patrolling,\" but I'm sure that if he he said that he wasn't that he would just say that all black people looked alike too.\n\nSo after that I just stayed out of the pool altogether to avoid anymore racist comments.  Instead I stayed near our groups stuff stashed by a nearby tree that was near the pool.  After hanging out there, completely out of the way, I felt someone pushing me out of the way.  Not like a little nudge like an excuse me, but literally pushing me from the back into the tree.  When I gathered my feet and looked back.  It was red shirt security guy that said that I needed to get the fu** out of the way.  What was I in the way of???  No one was walking by, no one was complaining, no one was doing anything wrong except this douche trying to push his weight around.\n\nLast issue I have is with the security in charge of the entrance lines.  This was a SOLD OUT event so our entire group got on the guest list weeks before to ensure entrance.  Our group isn't new to the party scene, so we knew that we might have to wait for a while, but we knew the show would be worth it.  When we got to the front of the line, they decided to let in the people who purchased presales first before they let anymore guest list in.  This is understandable and our group of 13 girls and 7 guys waited patiently.  During the wait, we had a birds eye view of security getting greased by line cutters left and right.  The velvet rope served no other purpose than a source of quick income for all of the security guards.  We thought to ourselves ... ok this isn't an issue, it happens everywhere.  So we shut out mouth and continued to wait patiently.  After a couple of hours, the main security guard ( I only think this because he was yelling at everyone telling them what to do ) said no more people could be let in through the ropes and this must have pissed off some if not all of the security guards that feed off this extra income.\n\nSo, after waiting in line, at the top of the stairs, under the Las Vegas Sun ... We were getting ansy and decided to ask the person in charge of our line if we were next to get in soon.  His response, to this very simple question, that was not said in a rude fashion of any sorts was, \" You're gonna get it, but if you continue to give me attitude, I'm going to kick you out! \"  Once again, we had already invested 4 + hours now, so our group simply shut their mouth.\n\nRUDE STAFF AND WILL NEVER COME BACK
