One of the best old school burger in Montreal.  Let's say i didn't expext much from the place. It's not fancy but their burgers are so good that I don't care. The service is fast and efficient.  Price is good.  You can ask for the peppers on the side if you don't want them in the burger. Totally would recommend this place!
