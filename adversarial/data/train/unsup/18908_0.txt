Golden bags and Calamari are fine.\n\nTom Sap Isaan and Spicy Corn Salad are tasteless. (We ordered medium spicy)\n\nPing Kai with sticky rice is good.\nHowever, the menu and the server didn't tell us that the Ping Kai+Sticky Rice already come with corn salad, which we already order separately.\n\nOverall we are not happy with the taste. Can't believe how come this restaurant has so many good reviews. We both are disappointed.\n\n(We are Thai.)
