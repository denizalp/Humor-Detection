It ain't a Vegas trip without a buffet. This buffet is probably the most well known one in the Vegas strip and conveniently located in Cesar palace. This past visit was my second one and I can gladly confirm that it was on point.\n\nThe line is usually a hour or two but I suppose a Wednesday visit only made it 15 mins wait at most. Cleverly lined up at 2:30pm and got in by 2:45pm paying for lunch price ($38 + tax ) while getting to experience dinner options as well. Price after 3pm is ($54 + tax ). \n\nThe buffet is creatively displayed and well organized with much space for everyone to enjoy. I personally would love to point out some of my favorite food choices. When it comes to buffets... It's all about the seafood. Mussels, clams, salmon,  sole fish, seabass, raw oysters, clam chowder, lobster bisque and of course..the Alaskan king crab legs ( served at dinner only). There's also a fine selection of premium meat including brisket, ribs , steak etc... But those are usually very filling for me. Also there's bottles of delicious juices where mango is my personal favorite. I didn't really touch dessert, Asian food selection or any other food choices because of my focus on seafood but everything else was very well presented and I'm sure top tier.\n\nTip: king crab legs on King crab legs with butter. The legs are already half opened so it's very easy to just peel out the meat. Do prepare for small wait time for them though because of its high popularity. \n\nOverall, I would say this is the best buffet in Vegas.
