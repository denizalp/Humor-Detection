This place was a HUGE disappointment. It is a nice enough building but is showing some age. The problem came with their customer service, or general lack thereof. To be fair this was my first stay in a Las Vegas casino\/hotel. What a total disappointment. Thank goodness I was there as a guest and didn't have to pay or I would have probably moved before ever checking in. No need to get into a bunch of whiny crap but I would say I heard very similar complaints from most everyone in our group.(it was a very large group also) The shopping was OK (One of the stores had a Blancpain I have been trying to find in person). That, a nice suite, and the few competent staff is the reason for 2 stars and not 1. I would not recommend anyone stay here.
