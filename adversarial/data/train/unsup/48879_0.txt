I moved to LV around a year ago and originally bobbed around to Great Clips etc. I discovered Mr. D's (near my office) and this is where I will continue getting my ears lowered. Ramon is my preferred barber and he does a wonderful job. Very approachable man that is easy to talk to and provides great service. The whole staff is very nice.
