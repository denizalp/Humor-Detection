Ballys has nice rooms and a decent casino aesthetic (though a little out-dated) The casino is also host to the show, Jubilee which is great, albeit way-to-topless. It connects to Paris hotel\/casino by a hallway of shoppes and is owned by the same man.\n\nThe Valet is slow and often full but the self-park is a viable option for providers in a rush. \n\nThere is no security at the towers. Oh, another great thing is that many of the rooms have Bid√©es(sp?) making it great for people who are there to engage in consensual greek fun.
