Went here to grab some drinks and a couple of apps. We were waited on by Alex, who was the most wonderful waiter we have had in a long time (even though he's a Giant's fan, as evidenced by the tattoo on his arm). \n\nWe ordered 4 drinks. My husband is a novice whiskey drinker, so he asked Alex for a recommendation. Alex suggested the Union Bushel, which had a hint of sweetness and included brûléed apple as a garnish. It ended up being a great starter drink; my husband had 2 of them. He also ordered 6 hot wings with ranch and blue cheese on the side. I'd say the wings were 3.5\/5 stars. The blue cheese dipping sauce was outrageous. It was as though they put a scoop of chunky blue cheese in the dish and added dressing and hot sauce. It was pinkish in color and tasted phenomenal. It was the perfect touch for the hot wings.\n\nAlex talked me into the shrimp bisque, which, unlike most bisques, had chunks of shrimp in it. It was thick, creamy, and topped with chives. Very delicious, and warmed me right up in these low temps.\n\nI ordered the Rhuby Rhuby Rhuby as a drink and also enjoyed an extra dirty martini. They were made to perfection and, although it took awhile for them to come out, due to a shift change, it was well worth the wait.\n\nThe bathrooms were clean, although I froze my buns off both in the bathrooms, and at our table. We concluded, that due to the brick walls, it was probably difficult to insulate. We put in an order in for fried pickles that we did not receive, but wrote this one off as a sign from God telling us to not order anymore food, as we had a Valentine dinner ahead of us.\n\nSeems like a great spot for meeting up with friends, and we will most definitely try to come back soon.
