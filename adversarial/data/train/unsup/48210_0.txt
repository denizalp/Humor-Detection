My co-workers and I tried lunch here today for the first time, all of us ordering different dishes, and every single one if us thought our meals were delicious!  Food was more than plentiful (soup and salad are included with the meal), service was excellent and super fast!  Very reasonably priced too!  We'll be back often!
