What a unique gem of a restaurant!  I love that this place serves foods and drinks that are totally out of the norm for the Phoenix area.  I had never had Scandinavian food prior to this (unless you count the IKEA cafeteria? which, no, you probably don't count that) and I was excited to try something new.\n\nBeing new to this cuisine, I decided to try the Scandinavian sampler plate for $20 so I could get a little taste of everything.  It comes with 3 meats, 1 side, and 3 salads.  I liked the cured salmon, but it was a little strange to have it just by itself since it was so salty. I felt it needed some bland potatoes or bread to balance it out.  The meatballs were my favorite meat.  The plate also came with gnocchi, which was my favorite part of the meal!  Comfort food at its best.\n\nMy least favorite part of the meal was the beet salad.  From the pictures in the menu I thought the beet salad would just be big chunks of beets with a sprinkling of cheese.  What came out was little chunks of beets mixed in with a cream (maybe mayo?).  I don't really care for mayo and the \"salad\" ended up being hot pink, which I know is due to the beet color but was just a little off-putting for my tastes.\n\nMy dining companion got the elk stew, which I tried a bite of.  It was really yummy and filling.  His dish also came with a tomato salad that was incredibly good!  I don't know where they get their tomatoes, but they are so flavorful and not like the lame bland tomatoes you get at the grocery store.\n\nI will definitely be back again to try out some new dishes AND to try their desserts -- which looked HUGE and yummy.
