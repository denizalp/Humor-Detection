I am truly perplexed by the fact that there are some less than 5 star reviews lol. I have nothing but amazing things to say about this place.\n1) this enterprise is very well managed. Very clean, owners and those who attended to us were very nice and welcoming. I must say, an accurate representation of the warmness and joy of welcoming people by Africans.\n2) the food is DELICIOUS! As a frequenter of African cuisine around the US, I make it a mission to find African restaurants during my frequent trips, the quality of food at Max's is among the top 3.\n3) Prices are reasonable. Service is top notch. If you are not sure what to order, ask. I like my food spicy, and I know Ghanaians are not all about that life, but I asked and it was made to my preference. There was a delicious habanero on my fufu. Just how I like it\nI am coming back and bringing my posse. They say when you find something good, share with good people. Yes, you heard it from me.
