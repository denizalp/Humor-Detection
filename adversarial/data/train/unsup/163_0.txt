I actually like to cook and look forward to staying home to cook when my time allows such as the past two months. I came here two months ago to stock up on essential. It's been a year since my last visit to here and I was pleasantly surprised how much variety of food and food products they sell here. \n\nI don't often come to an Asian grocery enough to compare pricing, but it seems all I purchased was reasonable. I really enjoyed going up and down the aisle looking at everything they had in the store. It was like a trip around the world as they stock so many different food and food products from all around the world.\n\nLike many other Asian grocery stores, crowded between aisles, different smell at each aisle (this could be positive or negative depending on person). Service is nor good or bad, not overly friendly but not rude either.
