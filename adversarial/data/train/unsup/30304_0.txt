I love this hotel. I have been coming here every month for the past year and have been never disappointed. I was a little put off when they started in with the valet parking when the Super Bowl was here but really grew to like it because the valets are so damn cool and actually remember you from visit to visit. Since I only have been here for corporate stays I can't speak to the value for the stay but it is so close to Westgate it is easy to go have a nice dinner and people watch. The desk people are really nice and the concierge level is second to none.
