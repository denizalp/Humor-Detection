My friend and I LOVE going out for Mexican food.  We decided to give this place a try and it was pretty descent.  Salsa is spicy & cheese dip is basic cheese dip- nothing fancy.  We love our spinach quesaDILLAS and these are by far the best we have had in Charlotte.  Well, Mint Hill too;)  Took a while for someone to come to our table but I wouldn't say the service is either bad or great.  They DO have great drink specials.
