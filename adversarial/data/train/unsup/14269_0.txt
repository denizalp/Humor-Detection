As far as firearms are concerned, I'm an enthusiast.  As I can remember this was the place where I bought my first gun.  A silver shiny derringer .22 mini pistol.  Things were a bit different in the last century.  Now it seems that the world has gotten more streamlined and iphoney.  I'm noticing that most new gun shops have been getting that way too.  Yet, is it really necessary to have a gun shop that has brightly painted walls, zombie shooting targets, young girls welcoming you in and a phone app?  Not for me.  I like the fact that Accuracy is still the same as it always was.  Just a good old gun shop that has a good assortment of firearms and ammo.  Btw, no other gun shop has as many holster accessories as this little shop on Boulder.\n\nThe staff is not all gung-ho as the other places.  I feel like I'm buying my ammo from a general store here as opposed to some pumped-up 'roided out swat team wannabee at all the other gun shops.  People always seem to look funny at the tanned punkrock guy in gun shops.  Not at Accuracy.  They treat me just any other Hendertucky'an.  Every question I've asked has been answered with dignity from any of the staff.  Which is another reason why I'd rather shop here.  They always have every caliber I need.  I'm talking from 9mm Makarov, 8mm Mauser all the way to 7.62x54r Mosin Nagant.  The selection of new and used firearms are well balanced.  They have popular M&P Shields all the way up to Dragunov rifles.  \n\nSome people like all the glitz & glamour.  I'm not one of them.  I just like to get what I came for so I can get down to business.  Highly recommended for serious shooters!
