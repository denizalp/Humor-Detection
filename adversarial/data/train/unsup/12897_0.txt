I hear they have soccer here, and league Ultimate Frisbee! I think Breese would be a good place to watch both of those. I came here for a concert, Neko Case opening for Ray LaMontagne, and it was great for a concert!\n\nEntry was easy breezy with our ticket app, an hour before concert start. The concert promoter gave lots of helpful directions on available free and pay parking in the area, and we had no problem parking the car. We'll bike or walk in next time!\n\nWe had reserved bleacher seating, but the field is a nice astro turf and was pretty comfortable. Bring a blanket, or just stand closer to the stage! There weren't that many food options during the concert, but there were lots of local beer options! And there were even beer vendors w\/limited availability scattered throughout the field. I'd definitely see a concert here again- Easy, \"Breesey!\"
