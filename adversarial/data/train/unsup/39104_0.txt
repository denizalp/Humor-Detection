I've been here a half dozen time, and it was always fun. The staff is pleasant, the beer is good, but i can only guess the the scotch is good as i dont drink scotch. What brings me there is the free dancing classes they host there. They are very fun if you're into dancing (rock and roll and blues i think). I know they host these events on sunday and monday nights at least.\nI highly recommend.
