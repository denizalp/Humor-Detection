Hot garbage. \n\nI used to be a fan but since 2011 things have been changing and it's been all bad stuff. Final straw today when my falafel sandwiches were tiny, thin, and terrible and my side of potatoes was dried out and tasted like cardboard. Compounding this terrible food was a completely baffling interaction when trying to pay. At first I was told they only accepted paypal, no debit or credit cards. \n\nGame over Nora.
