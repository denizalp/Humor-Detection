SOME OF THE BEST BBQ IN THE VALLEY. I am a huge foodie & a very tough critic because I've been spoiled by Little Miss BBQ, but the brisket here was awesome and almost as good, and I didn't have to wait in an hour long line! I requested the fatty brisket, hot links, Mac & Cheese & beans. As well as a maple bacon donut for dessert. Everything ROCKED!  Highly recommend this place. Well done Naked BBQ. Thank you for not serving me dry brisket like many other BBQ places in the valley.  In my top 2 best BBQ in AZ list!
