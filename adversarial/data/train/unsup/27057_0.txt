One of the place that provides bang for the buck, imo.\nI order sirloin steak that includes 2 sides.\n1. Food I gave 5 stars. Very tender and juicy sreak. No restaurant come close yo their roasted veggie in term of juiciness, full of flavor and big portion (see photos)\n2. Service I gave 5 stars. I got refilled 3 times. Nice server and nice attitude. Note that I was there around 1pm. It was slow. But I had bad service when I was the only customer at other restaurant.
