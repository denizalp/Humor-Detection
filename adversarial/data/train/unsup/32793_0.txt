Deeply offensive \"policy\" forbidding visitation with ICU patients between the prime hours of 6-8.....AM and PM! It's like they want to prevent you from visiting your sick loved ones during their final stages of their life because your simply quietly existing is causing some kind of obstruction to their job.  When are day shift working relatives supposed to see patients? Calloused and arbitrary much, are we? Jerks.
