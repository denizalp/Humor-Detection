I'd give it 10 stars if I could. I walked in pretty much having no idea what I wanted. Carole was so kind and welcoming, immediately made me feel comfortable, and guided my decision making process perfectly. If I wasn't super excited about something she wisked it away. She challenged me with things I never would have thought to try on, it was an adventure!! She was supportive and enthusiastic without being pushy. She felt like family by end of it. It was the best experience I could've asked for!! Thank you Carole and everyone at Bridal Beginnings!!
