Sweet, Enola Gay\n\n  I've had the pleasure of dining here twice in recent past and by all means, Liverpool house has set the bar for some of the most amazing food and drink I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.\n\n  My first go round was a 9 o'clock table, mid week. We were seated immediately and started with a Tom Collins. I'm not usually a gin drinker, as I have seen some of the most manly men I know, reduced to tears by gin but when it is on the chalkboard...why not? A mean, Tom Collins was the general consensus.\n\n  Then the Onslaught of pork began. We started with pulled pork cigars. Succulent, smokey, pulled pork with the right amount of bark, wrapped in garden fresh, Boston lettuce and tied together with a chive. Awesome.\n\n Next up, deconstructed(kinda)BLT. Not overly pretentious, it was more of a self serve BLT. Boston Lettuce, garden fresh tomato, house bacon, mayo, stack of crostinies and a peck of steak tartar. Decadent.\n\n Then the Pork chop came. Despite societies nonacceptance of the word, the only mot juste that comes to mind is...retarded. A house snausage, marrow bones and a big hunk of pig, cooked to perfection, smothered in a veal stocky, barbequish type sauce, that, when I ran a piece of cop through, split like the red sea, held like divine intervention and then slowly resumed its original form.  Really decadent.\n\n\n  Second time 'round\n\n  9 o'clock again. We sat at the bar and had the pleasure of getting to know Thomas, a great bar keep and all around nice guy. He served up a couple Kentucky...um...somethingorothers...they had chartreuse in them. Ask Tom, he'll know.\n\n  Then the seafood onslaught began. Half a dozen fresh, perfectly shucked, plump oyster, wading in their liquor, to start. Served with mignonette and cocktail sauces. Tasted like the ocean.\n\n  Next up, crisp asperge with fork tender, smoked swordfish and a foie gras cream.\nThe swordfish was the best fish I have ever tasted. It fell apart as I rolled it in my mouth with my tongue while the smokey flavour encompassed my palate, complimented by the crunch of the asparagus and then the smooth flavour and texture of the cream. Not too much but just enough. Therapeutic.\n\n  Finally, a salt crusted arctic char, along with enough clams to choke a donkey and salsa Verde and hollandaise on the side. This was the second best fish I have ever had. Juicy, flavourful, stuffed with herbs and when doused in the hollandaise, forgetta 'bout it. Delicious.\n\n  To conclude, Go.\n\nWaka Waka.
