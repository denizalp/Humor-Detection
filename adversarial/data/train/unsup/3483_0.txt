There are tons of pluses and tons of minuses about this place. Lets hit the \"pluses\" first:\n\n1. THE FOOD: Amazing! Their food is fantastic. Everything is good; I have yet to try anything \"bad\" here. The portions are decently sized, the flavour is full on. I suggest ordering things on the less spicy side of the spectrum so you can add spice to it once it's served. Got overzealous and ordered a 6 on the spicy scale. Was a little too much!\n\n2. THE WINE LIST: Last thing I would have anticipated is a good wine list at a Thai restaurant in a strip mall in Las Vegas. BUT, this place blows it out of the water with their wine list! Definitely ask a server for pairing recommendations for your order.\n\n3. THE PRICING: IMO, their pricing is very fair for the quality and quantity of the food that you get. Order away, good sir!\n\nThe negatives are a little bit out of the restaurants control, but still something to take into consideration:\n\n1. LOCATION: The restaurant is located in a rather dark strip mall that is closed off from major streets. Don't be too worried, but keep your wits about you. Have been here a dozen times without incident, and haven't heard of any issues. Just looks a little...shady.\n\n2. SPEED OF SERVICE: Sometimes the restaurant is so packed, service is a little slow...too slow for my taste. BUT the food outweighs the negative for me, so I deal with it.\n\n3. LENGTH OF TIME TO GET SEATED: Be prepared for a wait! Sometimes you can wait here for up to an hour. Yes, it's that good.\n\n\n\n\nWould I recommend this place to others? Absolutely.\n\nWould I come back here myself? Thinking about going again tonight now that I've written this review!!!
