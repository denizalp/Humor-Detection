My friend had been wanting to check out Sweet Flour for some time, and the thought of custom cookies baked in minutes seemed like a magical concept to me. Let's do it!\n\nYou have the option of 3 cookie doughs: Original (similiar to the base of a chocolate chip cookie), Oatmeal, and Peanut Butter. There were a lot of Mix-Ins to choose from including Butterscotch Chips, Potato Chips, Dried Fruit, and Nuts.\n\nI chose Original with Toffee Pieces and Pretzels, while my friend chose Oatmeal with Dried Figs and Macadamia Nuts.\n\nThe fact that cookies typically take at least 12 minutes to bake had me a tad skeptical over the process, as these were baked in under 5 minutes.\n\nWhile my creation turned out okay, my friend's tasted like it was undercooked. I think the dough wasn't spread out thin enough. \n\nFun concept, but I think it could use some tweaking.
