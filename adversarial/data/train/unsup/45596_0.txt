I came to this restaurant on a Saturday night with my boyfriend. \nThe restaurant was pretty fancy and there are cool art pieces on the walls around the restaurant. \nThe good unfortunately ends there.\nOur waitress was cold and was not friendly, the bread was cold and the portions of food were minuscule. \nWe had the shrimp brochette as an appetizer and they were dry and not very good. The sauce that it came with was good but the portion of it was not enough.\nFor mains, we had the steak and the cod. Both were pretty tasty but for 38$, the steak was tiny. \nI would have given this restaurant a 3 to 4 if it weren't for the terrible service.
