The range itself is nice, the staff couldn't be anymore unhelpful...especially at the front desk. Feels like the people in the store (in a customer service role) hate customer service or feel bothered that you are there. I've been there ten times or so same thing every time. I will say the guy that works inside the range is really nice and helpful.
