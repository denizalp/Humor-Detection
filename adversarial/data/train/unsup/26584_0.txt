First time to the place and we had amazing food! The service was friendly and the place was very clean. If you like spicy food, you need to try the Southwest Gravy. My son had the crepes. I don't like sweets and thought they were amazing! I had Bruce's bowl. You like breakfast meats, then this for you! Bacon, sausage, off the bone ham and if course some eggs and hasbrowns! Not for the faint of heart. You MUST add the pork green chile too. \n\nCan't wait to go back and try something else!
