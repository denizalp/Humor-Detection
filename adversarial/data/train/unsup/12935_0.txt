According to my June 6, 2017 experiences....\n We really thought we were going to get the best steak out there (high reviews with Yelp), when we went landed at the Old Homestead Steakhouse. Steaks are special, we only get them on special occasions: birthdays, dates with my husband......possibly once a month; anyway you pay for the best and expect the best. \n\nOk, the food. The bread: mini loaves of different types of bread: pretzel, bacon, and some other flavors. It was pretty for the eyes, but when it came down the the truth they weren't extraordinary, just bread... the butter was great. \n\nWe started with a salad: \"Everything in the Kitchen Sink\" ($30) ...sounds gross, but it had some real ingredients in it, to be qualify as a salad I'd be interested in: tomatoes, avocados, olives, salami (strips), bacon (pieces, not chunks, tasted at the end), blue cheese, shrimp,  and it was not an iceberg lettuce based type of salad. Bravo, the salad was beautifully tossed, and the ingredients were paired off well, nothing too over powering. It was an average salad. \n\nThe main course: the \"Ribeye\" (16 oz. @ $50+) this is where my review will fall extremely sad.  You imagine: juicy fat marbling, thick and tender to every cut. Well it's all in your imagination here at the, \"Old Homestead Steakhouse\", because maybe the head chief went home early, sick, on an emergency note......the dinner crowd was gone, we were there after 9pm. When the \"Ribeye\"came out it was a center piece on the platter, ok, I thought, \"this is going to be delicious\". What happened when I cut into it? Where was the \"Ribeye\"???????? It was more like a BRISKET!!!! It was pathetic. Did they not think we would know? Of course I did not want to delay my dining experience with my colleagues by complaining and having them cook another steak, so I chewed on. : - (\n** If I had knew to save the butter, it could have helped. \n\nGood luck to you, if you end up here.
