I don't like coffee, but I love caramel! And, since they make a KILLER Caramel Blended Beverage - we are allowed to have business meetings here.\n\nThe location is very convenient, right off the freeway. The staff is awesome! Constantly checking to make sure you don't need anything. And, free Wi-Fi!!\n\nThis place tends to be a little more quieter than the average Starbucks. So great place to study or get some work done.
