My review is based on price. I called to get the price on steaming a bridesmaids dress the lady on the phone said price starts at  $100.00. I about dropped the phone I said its not a Bridal Gown its a formal dress I don't even want it cleaned just pressed. She says I know Bridal gowns start at $200.00.  I hung up and called Boston Cleaners they quoted me $15.00 and 40% off for 1st time customers.  I also called Thunderbird Dry Cleaners and they quoted me $10.00. So why do you charge 10 times what the competition charges? I'm still in shock. Signed a confused Bridesmaid.
