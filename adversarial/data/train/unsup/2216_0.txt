Not a BIG fan maybe it was the Queens Fest Week menu and experience but needless to say it was underwhelming. My husband and I take Datenight seriously as we have 2 teenage daughters & a toddler son so anytime alone away from home is very appreciated to just catch up with each other outside of our busy family schedule and work. \n\nWe were excited to try Upstream during Queen Fest Week (Restaurant Week) and the service was subpar to be frank. We were not treated as we expected in such an establishment. We were dressed to that nines and excited to be out. I even made the reservations on OpenTable as I always do when the restaurant is on opentabel and added notes about it being Datenight for my hubby and I. I'm use to restaurants reading notes to take into consideration any special request or to just see if they could get some info on the patrons coming into the establishment and acknowledging them accordingly.\nThis was not the case for us and even after sharing with our server while asking about bottles of wine he still acted unenthused (lol) don't get me wrong I'm not looking for a parade or streamers for being on Datenight I just thought it would make the server smile or chop up some small talk (it ALWAYS does at various restaurant with really good service). \nThe cost to eat at this place to me warrants some type of happiness in the service as they are there in a position to service customer which is customer service and they should be a little bit appreciative for having work as so many don't.\nThe food was not very good to my husband and I. Maybe we had a bad taste in our mouth already. We both vowed to try this place again to give them a fair go. \nOnce we do I will update my review (Addendum) accordingly.
