I was very impressed with this place.  Great food selection and prices.  My waffle was delicious, but it was so hard to decide which one to order.  There were so many delicious and unique options that you will not find anywhere else.  There is an equal variety of coffee drink options for those wanting to get coffee somewhere other than a national chain.  You will not be disappointed.  The only caveat I have is that the tables are small and there are few of them.  Seating is limited, although there was outdoor seating for when the weather warms up.
