A surprise find near my house.   Great food, service is outstanding, and plenty of options for all on the menu.  Yes, the rice balls are the BEST!\n\nMy only 'ding' is the background music was too loud.  Should be BACKGROUND music, not blaring.  \n\nLooking forward to my next dining experience at Ararat 17.....
