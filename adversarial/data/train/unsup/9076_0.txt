My 18-year-old brother hangs out with his friends here often, and was mind blown that I'd never been because: \n\n1) I'm a sucka for local coffee . . . And addicted \n2) It's close by my place\n\nFinally gave in after a quick run to Sprouts! \n\nThe Barista seemed to be putting on one heck of a show, something you don't see too often. Felt like I was hanging out at a bar, not a coffee joint. \n\nLike I usually do when trying out a new place like this, I asked him what would he recommend. He said \"Black and White!\" without hesitation. OK, normally don't drink milk bomb \"coffee\", but let's just give it a go! \n\nThis drink was a combination of light and dark mocha. Super, super sweet for my tastes, but enjoyable every once in a while. Oh yeah, not to mention, absolutely wired for the rest of the day! \n\nIf your drink is under $3.99, you better have cash with you.\n\nWiFi is regulated; you'll 3 hours of Internet from your coffee receipt. Never really need that much time anyway when I'm working on-the-go . . . It's just a little strange, and likely super annoying for those college students out there. \n\nPatio overlooks a man-made lake. Nice place to chill out and read a book if you're not competing with a large number smokers for oxygen. \n\nI look forward to coming back and trying their different roasts (read: their actual coffee).
