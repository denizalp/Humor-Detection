I called this company in desperation as I suddenly found myself in charge of a family reunion due to the former planner dropping out. I needed to provide some form of entertainment for the young\/teens in our family and thought a photo booth would be perfect. Tim was very responsive and handled my last minute planning with professionalism. The price was fair! He showed up early and had plenty of props to entertain over 100 people. I did not even realize that the adults would love this just as much as predicted for the younger folks. People still love actual prints when it comes to having their pictures taken! Thanks InstaBooth Rental.. the party was a hit!
