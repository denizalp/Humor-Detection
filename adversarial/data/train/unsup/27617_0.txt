I called at 7pm to see if there's any reservation available. The girl on the phone was pretty nice and says it's pretty open. \nI made it for 7:30 and the place wasn't packed. But I guess everyone is elsewhere. \n\nFirst flaw that they have: I asked to not be seated at the bar, I prefer comfortable seat than stool. The same girl says well since you called only half hour ago.. We are making an exception so this is the only seating available.  I'm like ???? Wtf?  The place is barely packed only about 20 people... You can't move me to the dining room ??? \n\nThis is the part that I don't like when I dine alone. They discriminate against you give you smaller table and think that you are gonna spend little money... \n\n\nLittle that they know I can spend 2 persons bill if not more... If the food n service was better!\n\n\nI ordered the jumbo crab cake with jicama and chipotle aioli. It was alright.. And for dinner I ordered Diver Scallop with chille releno and mole sauce.\n\nThe 2 dishes is not giving me a WOW I gotta come back here affect. I was expecting Rick Moonen's creation will blow my socks off.  But nothing... Not even a tingly feeling. \n\nService was a ok. My glass of water was  not refilled promptly.. I have to wait around..and my eye contact before I get it filled each time and for three times. I can only imagine if it was packed. \n\nWell Rick... I probably won't come back to see your pic with Oprah on the wall.
