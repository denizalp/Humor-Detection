I want to give zero stars but yelp requires at least one star to write review. If you want good healthcare you're much much much better off either starting with a good physical therapist in Charlotte or going out of town. Orthocarolina owns Charlotte and they are one huge conglomerate mess. There's success in numbers and this place is all about that. If you want unindividualized care, if you want impersonal staff interaction, if you want hurried doctors that act as if they're annoyed by your questions, if you love throwing money at the wind, doctors that really don't try and ask you questions to gauge your condition, and if you are good with not getting any real answers about a major condition that's affecting your whole life, well boys and girls this is THE place for you! They're website boasts excellence, care, and service! That's a joke and makes me laugh now as I have to find humor in all of this to keep myself from losing all sanity over the worst healthcare experience I've ever come across in my life. I write this review to advise anyone out there to do their homework and be very careful in choosing their healthcare provider. Unfortunately Charlotte is a big city with a lot of people and this company rests on that with ease as I'm sure they're staff and doctors can sleep well at night knowing they'll be paid well regardless of the type of service they provide.
