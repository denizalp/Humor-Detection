Hakkasan's first nightclub debuted just 7 months ago back in April \"13. The team behind Hakkasan spared no expense in designing their colossal nightclub & restaurant. This megacomplex clocks in at over 80,000 square feet, giving it top honors as one of the nation's largest nightclubs. The highly sought-after DJ's can earn upwards of $200,000 per night. The lighting and the sound system are first-rate with concert-rated acoustics. There are 5 levels of club space with a variety of experiences on offer. \n\nThe main level dance floor was outrageously packed. If you like being jostled around, elbowed and shoved, then you will definitely feel at home here.  If you even idled for even a second in a walkway, a bouncer would rudely yell at you to move --we were just trying to make our way to the front of the bar. The music wasn't my preferred-style of dance music--it was house music all night. The music selection wasn't the problem though, it was all the rudeness and shoving going on everywhere. The $18 rum 'n cokes and $10 beers definitely did not excite either (I know it's Vegas but my concert drinks at MGM Garden were $18 for a double). \n\nDespite the crowded dance floor, high-priced drinks and music, my girlfriends and I decided to make the most of the night and embrace the music and our Hakkasan experience. We danced and enjoyed the confetti drop and looking at some well-dressed fellas. We enjoyed rounding out our nightclub experience with the addition of Hakkasan. I've heard the restaurant has some creative and delectable dishes...maybe next visit I can get back over there to try out the dining experience.
