So, I walk in to KFC - already savoring my extra crispy chicken - only to find out that the FLIPPING CHICKEN NAZIS HAVE DONE AWAY WITH EXTRA CRISPY!!!!!!  All they have now is original and grilled.  Excuse me - but I don't need the food industry to regulate my diet!!!! It is my inalienable right to clog my arteries.  I am not on any kind of government assisted health care.  I pay my own medical bills - so let's not act like I am abusing the medical care system.  Oh -this just pisses me off.  No more KFC for me.  The end.
