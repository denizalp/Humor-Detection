You know what? I had a great time on the Goodtime III! \n\nWhy? I love the history lesson, nerdtastic facts, industrial sights, access to dranks (and they take plastic!), nostalgic look, Cleveland skyline views and, well, it's great just being on a damn boat on a hot summer day.\n\nThis straight of the 80's cruise tour of Cleveland, Lake Erie and the Flats via the Cuyahoga River is packed with info--which the inner nerd in my loves. Sorry if you hate a tour of the industrial, slightly abandoned Flats, but as a life-time Clevelander, I found it not only visually stimulating, but also extremely interesting. Then again, I also knew what to expect. You know, I'm thinking if you wanted a tour of nature you wouldn't take a downtown cruise ship tour of a rust belt city, but hey--that's just me using my common sense. \n\nOur trip was on a sunny Saturday afternoon and the boat itself was about 3\/4ths full with random families and a few, larger family reunion groups. We didn't have a problem finding a seat at any\/all of the levels. It started at the E. 9th pier so we snagged a metered parking spot in front of the Browns Stadium, easy peasy. Like the other Yelpers mentioned, it starts with a tour down the Cuyahoga with lovely tidbits of Cleveland ethnic history, talk of our historic bridges, progress and more. Then the boat turns around for a trip out onto Lake Erie which boasts gorgeous views of our city skyline, perfect for photo snapping, sipping cocktails and enjoying the lake breeze. \n\nThe food is blegh, but it's a 2hr ride. Eat before or after. The cost is super cheap for a fun family activity or even a romantic evening out. Yea, you might be the youngest couple there, but I think that's still OK! \n\nOverall, worth the money and a great experience!
