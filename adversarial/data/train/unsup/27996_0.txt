The food is amazing! The owner expects perfection with his pizza and he certainly provides it. \nMy only issue was with the waiter, he was very nice but didn't do much to provide us service. We asked 3 different times for water before we finally asked someone who wasn't our server to bring us some, which they did near instantly. And that's just one example.. All in all, I'd definitely go back!
