I went here for brunch on New Year's Day and it did not disappoint one bit.  I had a pickle spice Bloody Mary which was as unique as it was bold and delicious.  I chose a potato pancake benny and it was scrumptious, everyone in my party was happy with their dishes but the flavor of the potato pancake may have won over another fan with an offered bite.  Excellent corned beef was part of the benny.
