This store is amazing! They have a great staff.  Warren, Ashley, and Bianca made my shopping experience so wonderful.  Not only is the staff great but they have a great selection and low prices. I am renewing my wedding vows and did not want a \"normal\" wedding dress but something more casual.  I shopped all over Vegas (including David's) and Alfred Angelo was the only store in town that carried their dresses in white (or any other color you want).  I was able to get a bridesmaid dress that is perfect for my beach wedding in Maui.  Thank you to the staff at Alfred Angelo!
