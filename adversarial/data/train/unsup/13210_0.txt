How bowling alleys stay so busy - blows my mind. Is it just me, or every time I've ever tried to go bowling I get told \"It's League night, so we only have 1 open lane and there's already a wait\". Kudos to Brunswick and all the other bowling companies out there for keeping the sport alive. The same way the bowlers themselves are keeping 80's fashion and rolling ball bags alive.\n\nMy fiance and I enjoy babysitting some of our friends' kids. We took a 6 and 9 year old here a few weeks back and i had to circle the lot for parking. Thankfully we were just headed to the arcade where there was not a wait. Decent selection of games. Forced to buy into a Brunswick card in lieu of coins and paper tickets like the good 'ol days. The kids repeatedly were looking down waiting for paper tickets to barf out of the machine only to see the little LCD screen by the card reader \"12 tickets added to card\" followed by a slouch and a sigh. \n\nWe got dinner, which was fine. When i inquired about the integrity of the turkey club wrap, the cashier said she'd only eaten the chicken fingers and the pizzas. I then said \"i remember high school\" and proceeded to order the wrap sans mayo. The kids we were babysitting were taste buds with the cashier and raved about their chicken fingers and pizza. ! I must admit, they're putting the focus on the foods that probably make all the money so I can't really critique that. \n\nI'll be back, if for no other valid reason other than having $5.50 on a Brunswick arcade card and who knows how many tickets to redeem on chinese finger traps & laffy taffy. It will be mine... oh yes, it will be mine!
