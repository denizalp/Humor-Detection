This is a small restaurant in the Bloor West\/High Park area. The decor is very nice and we went in at around 5 pm and were the only ones there. I had the Vegetarian Basil Fried Rice and my friend had the spicy Thai noodles with chicken. Both the dishes were really delicious and had just the right amount of flavour and spice.
