Had to wait a bit, probably about 30 min, but we were hungry so we stuck with it. We sat outside in the patio, it was a bit hot, but we didn't want to wait another 10-15 min to eat. I ordered French toast and it was Ok, I'd say a 3.5\/5. It didn't come with anything, just the French toast with bananas on top. The bananas weren't quite ripe yet, so not as sweet as I'd like. Overall the food was nothing special, but not bad. \n\nThe coffee pot they leave on the table to self serve was horrible, the lid got stuck and burned my hand badly. It was not fun. We let the waitress know and she brought me a bag of ice which I appreciated. She also commented that the lids to get stuck sometimes (which tells me they know about the problem). \n\nWe didn't make a huge deal out of it but my hand was badly burned, I was in tears in the bathroom letting cold water run over it, super painful. A manager never came over to us or anything, and we paid for my breakfast. Seems kind of crappy considering. I don't think I'll be back.
