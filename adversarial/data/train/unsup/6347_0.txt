Waited 40 min for shuttle.  Shuttle then waited an extra 20 min before it filled up.   They will not leave until they fill the shuttle up.  They also will not send a shuttle to your queue until there are enough people to begin waiting for capacity.  We ended up waiting a full hour before we actually left for our hotel.\n\nFor two people, it cost $13 to get to the airport.   The price of a cab back ended up being $18.\n\nNOT WORTH IT.\n\nAVOID.
