The Eiffel Tower Restaurant was phenomenal! My boyfriend and I had the most UH-MAZING dinner, dessert and view! We were seated at a corner table overlooking the Paris Balloon and the strip.  Reservations were at 8:30pm. It was so romantic! I strongly recommending asking for a window seat and\/or a corner table. \n\nWe started with a riesling from the alsace region. It was delicious.  We received a complimentary appetizer, an asparagus puree. Bread choices were multi-grain, french baguette, or wheat. Water is either sparkling or flat. \n\nMain Entrees:\n* He had the filet mignon. Absolutely delectable! I had the rack of lamb. Melted in my mouth like butter. \n\nDesserts: THE SOUFFLES ARE TO DIE FOR! \n*He had the Pistachio Souffle. As I quote my boyfriend, \"Honey, I can now go to the top of the Eiffel Tower and jump because it just doesn't get any better than this. Sorry, babe but this pistachio souffle is just better than sex!\" And people, let me tell you ... it is true! I totally agree with him and we have great sex! It was heavenly. \n\n* I had the Grand Marnier Souffle.  That was absolutely delicious too ... but it was all about the Pistachio Souffle!\n\n* We also received a complimentary dark chocolate mousse. Wow! Just yummy!\n\nOverall - it was an awesome experience! Yuri, our waiter, was attentive and friendly.  Lyle, the manager was accommodating and pleasant.  I have high standards. It goes beyond Patina in Los Angeles. Maestro's is still a favorite but the Eiffel Tower was just that phenomenal!
