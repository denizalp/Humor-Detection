If your only complaint is that your stay wasn't long enough, that's an automatic 5 star rating, right? We arrived at 2:00 and our room wasn't ready yet. The bell desk took our bags and the front desk took a phone number to alert us when our room was ready. We were granted a temporary key to get us into the pool or fitness areas. \n\nWe took the opportunity to look around the resort and I'm glad we did. The fitness center is huge and features pretty much anything you need for a good workout. It was empty every time I peeked in. The 5th floor pool features a huge bar, plenty of shade and a small grassy area. We played a couple of games of corn hole. The 38th floor rooftop pool is accessed from another elevator on the 37th floor. This is where you can really soak up the sun. It's not very big but we never had trouble securing a lounge chair. The misters were nice in the heat of the day. The separate area for smoking has the best views.  It was fun watching the lights and city center thrive at night. \n\nOur room was ready a bit after 3:00 and we were stoked to get a strip view on the 23rd floor. The bedroom had a floor to ceiling window and I loved just sitting in the arm chair soaking it all in. The bed was ridiculously comfortable and the black out curtains were really effective when we wanted to sleep in. Having a living room, table, kitchen, 2 closets, and a laundry room was incredibly convenient. It was like having all the comfort of home, in the middle of the strip. \n\nThe valet was easy to access. The lobby frequently had free drinks (why, yes I will take a free mimosa on my way out the door), snacks, and a pool table. \n\nThis was my only trip to Vegas that I didn't leave with a case of pink eye and I fully credit this resorts no-smoking policy for that. \n\nAs my husband put it, \"Now I don't want to stay anywhere else.\"
