Not for everyone. Lots of machines but free weight selection is very limited. Facilities are usually very clean. Just like any gym, sometimes there are crowds, sometimes not.\n\nI pay for the $20 monthly membership so I can use the massage and tanning. That package is a great value, plus it allows me to bring guests.\n\nStraight men, DO NOT go on Friday nights. I just found this out last night. The place was a gay bath house. I'm not homophobic, I just don't go to the gym to be stalked. It started in the locker room. This guy sat staring at me, at first I thought he was just waiting to get to his locker, then I realized all the lockers near me were empty. I even asked if I was in his way, he huffed and headed to the shower area. Then while on the floor, two guys were making out in the stretching area. While I was working out on a machine, locker room guy appear again. He sat at the machine across from me, not working out, just occasionally giving me a glance. The final straw for me was when he walked into the black card member area and sat there while I was on the hydro massage bed. I finally had to tell him that we don't like the same brand.
