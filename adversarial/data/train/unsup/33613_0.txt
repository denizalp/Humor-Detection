Boy, did I enjoy those fried pickles and chicken wings. These really did hit the spot when I decided to spurge for my birthday this year! \n\nI know now where I want to come when I want some wings or pickles, or any other tasty bar food. I would be safe to say that the wings I had at Armadillo Grill were some of the best in Phoenix (and I've had a lot of wings throughout the valley). But make sure to order the wings with Armadillo Gold Sauce, they were made to perfection.  \n\nBe sure to to have a nice beer and enjoy some games on one of the many screens.  There is also a patio for the warmer weather :)
