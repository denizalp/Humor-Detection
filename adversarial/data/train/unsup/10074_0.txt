I'm sorry this review is about to be so short. Literally my favourite place to get a bacon-covered cinnamon roll in the city. Ask nicely (pay extra) and they will put a fried egg on it. AHAHAHHA I KNOW I'M A MAD GENIOUS. Bam, crushfast (more extreme than breakfast) of champions. \n\nNOTE: Prices could be better.
