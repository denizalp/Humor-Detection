I had a very bad experience here today!!\n\nFirst of all, the service sucked. They didn't give me any water or tea. They never asked me what I would like to drink. All the other customers had water or tea on their table. \nThere were three young Chinese employees here. They were looking at me and making fun of me in Chinese the whole time I was there instead of taking care of the customers. I was very uncomfortable so I left.\n\nTheir Dan dan noodles tasted like they just dumped peanuts sauce and oil on overcooked noodles. I tasted nothing but sugar and peanuts sauce. Disgusting!!\n\nI don't know why I left them a generous tip. Stupid. Never again!!
