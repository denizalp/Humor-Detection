This is, by far, the most reputable nail salon in Toronto. Yes, it's hard to get an appointment at the last minute. Yes, you get charged it you cancel without sufficient notice (common sense, no?)\nThe technicians are exceptionally talented, and they art they do is the stuff you see in magazines (and I'm being literal; most of them are brand ambassadors and do tons of editorials).\nExpensive? Yes. But my $50 manicure will last me 3 weeks without chipping.
