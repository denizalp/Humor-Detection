Oh Falbo. How I love thee, let me count the ways.....\n\n1. You are quality pizza, every time. \n2. You are a great value. I do not mean you are cheap but you are quality without being pricey.\n3. You make great thin crust. It is not cracker thin. It is what thin crust should be.\n4. You do not get my order wrong.\n5. You have great staff, EVERY time. \n6. You are easy to get to.\n7. You keep your word on when my pizza will be ready. \n8. You remind me of home. Just good Chicago pizza.\n9. I can get a single topping pizza and be completely happy. They have AH-MAY-ZING sausage. \n10. You complete me.
