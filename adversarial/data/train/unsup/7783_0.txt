I've had it sober, I've had it drunk, I've had it at 3 in the morning straight from the club, I've had it at 9 in the morning after waking up and finding it next to me. I guess you could say I'm a fan of this place.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get some of their house made pickled peppers as an add-on. The workers are cool, there's an arcade game inside and everyone's happy because we're all in on the secret of where to find bomb pizza. Just us and the rest of the 1,400 reviewers. Shhhhhhhh....
