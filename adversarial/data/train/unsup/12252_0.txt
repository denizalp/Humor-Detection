I don't care who you are, what Zodiac sign you are, what gets you up in the morning, how good your dad is at fighting, how big your cock is, how much you love going for long walks or any other bullshit. You're reading this because you want authentic Indian food. And if you really want Indian cuisine then you owe it to yourself to give up every other thing you give a flying fuck about right now and come to Kohinoor. This is why:\n\nKohinoor is bringing it- and bringing it HARD. The Kohinoor staff cooks and serves at Mach 10 speeds. Everyone needs to come let some tikka masala work through your digestive system. Feel as it ignites the afterburners, straps on falcon talons and drive its will deep into the core of your hunger.\nKohinoor is box office shit. If you're bored and you've got nothing to do and you don't know what to eat, just come to Kohinoor. Don't be surprised when you find yourself deep dicking your way through the menu time and time again with enough power to light up all of C-U.\n\nSeriously, you and the rest of C-U can sleep easy at night knowing that Kohinoor is open 7-days a week. Fuck any other restaurant you used to go to. And fuck your kitchen. Kohinoor is your kitchen now.
