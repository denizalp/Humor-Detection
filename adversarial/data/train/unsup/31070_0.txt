We love Fox concept restaurants but the Arrogant Butcher is a little overrated. It's not bad by any means but I think the real value is in the cheaper menu options. The location is great and it's a perfect spot before events downtown but I don't think the higher end food items meet the price points. Last time we were there we got some seafood and it was pretty bland. Considering dinner was close to $150 I was not impressed. The turkey pastrami sandwich on the pretzel bun however is awesome! Stick with the lunch items and go somewhere else for a nice dinner.
