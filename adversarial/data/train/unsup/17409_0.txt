What a shit hole, completely a joke compare to before. Note this used to be my favorite buffet spot In Vegas of all prices. I came about 4:30pm and dinner hour started at 4pm.\n\nCalled to check hours before I came, was told(somehow hotel operation answered the call) the seafood section has been removed but \"we still have snow crab legs\", which turned out to be a lie.\nThere's no service, was told to go get my own drinks. A busser walked by to pick up plates but not so often. The bartender was watching dramas loudly on this phone behind the bar.\nSushis were not fresh, sat too long in the fridge so the rice was hard. Some crawfish were half frozen. Raw scallops didn't look very fresh and were tasteless. It amazed me that even the cr√®me brulee could taste like a failure because it's one of the easiest dessert to make. Some of the desserts were not put out by 5:30pm, I was waiting for the Mexican lady to move the tiramisus out while she had to pause and joked with her coworker\/manager in Spanish for a minute. Noodle station wasn't open by the time I left at 5:45, which was 1 hour 45 minutes after dinner hour started. \n\nThis place feels like the last days inside the Toys-R-Us.
