This is a hard one to review. The work they have done for me is impeccable but the prices are beyond ridiculous. When it is something I can't fix or hem myself, they do a great job and are their work looks like it was right from the store. They are cash only. No price sheet up which always irritates me to not even have a ballpark idea of what it will be. You do have to pay in advance the full amount. Worth it if you can't do it yourself but be prepared to pay a lot.
