I don't like the round tables in the middle. Only two to a seat for sure. Unless you are smaller. I was uncomfortable when i was there. The service was good.\nThe food was alright, not my absolute favorite. I think it is because I heard it was  supposed to be really good and the wait is always crazy long. So when I got my food, I did enjoy it, but not my favorite brunch type food. The taste was alright, but it didn't match their presentation. Such a trendy presentation of food, but didn't feel like anything was mind blowing, but maybe that is what they were striving for all along... hipsters confuse me.
