So your trying to look good for the night. The night is young, you got a date at the hottest club but all you have is your perfect savers attire. \n\nI stumbled into this gem of perfection. First thing I notice, the staff.i was immediately assessed to find my perfect wardrobe. And at this point I'm in retail heaven. Without even knowing me they know my situation. They know what I've gone through to get to this point in my life to get me here today and show me what's what.  Next thing I know. \n\nBoom. New jeans. Not just jeans. Raw jeans. Raw lady killer jeans. \"This denim is from Mars\" I think to myself. Flannel from another world. Underwear. Boxer briefs. The future of man under garments. But not your average 3 pack. This shit does not wedge you ever. And I mean ever.\n\nBoom again. More shots fired. Another flannel? Do I need more. The answer is yes if you are at scotch and soda. X3. \n\nAgain, more shots fired. Cotton scarf? I never thought I would look good in one, but I assure you, I did and every girl in the mall knew it. Hell, even I knew it. Never been sure of anything in my life except this place and this scarf. \n\nAfter committing to buy my new, sexy, wardrobe I finally make my way to the cashier. Who appears to be some sort of Goddess among gods, rings me out. Folds, packs and bags in less than seconds. Now handing my receipt while singing the song \"respect\" but with r-e-c-e-i-p-t. I realize my euphoric retail experience is over. I don't want to leave. I don't wanna go home. I am home. \n\nThis is how it feels to shop at The Scotch and Soda. \nThank you.
