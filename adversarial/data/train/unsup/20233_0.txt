This place is beyond RACIST and prejudice! I will never waste my money and come back to this place. \n\nMy friends and I came here on Friday night we are vibing and having a good time. We are all standing around a VIP table and one of the girls that is there decides she wants to sit in front of my friend. My friend asks her politely to move and so this girl decides to look back at my friend and she shrug her off as if she is a piece of shit! So my friend asks her again and then this girl decides she wants to tell the bouncer. So the bouncer comes over to us black girls and ask us to move because we are harassing the girl. When really nothing like that ever occurred. Then next thing you know we are being escorted out of the club because the girl says we make her uncomfortable. \n\nI'll also insert a photo of this chick\n\nLong story extra short Drais doesn't have to worry about me ever returning!
