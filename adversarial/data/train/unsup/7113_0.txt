I have very mixed feelings about Whole Foods. I much prefer farmers' markets and little local shops when it comes to breaking bank on grocery shopping. Fiesta Farms on Christie North of Bloor is also a pretty great store for accomplishing getting great groceries, but I have to admit, there's just something about a well laid out Whole Foods that brings me joy. Sometimes this joy overrides the guilt of picking up my weekly goods from an American chain. \n\nThis hippie chain's pre-made foods, butcher and fancy pantry items are second to none, but you should know, my BFF and I spent over $300 on groceries that will last us about 10-14 days recently. That's ridiculous. Trust me, when we left we weren't feeling smug and healthy, we were feeling like ass clowns. \n\nThis Whole Foods validates parking. That last sentence was fun to write.
