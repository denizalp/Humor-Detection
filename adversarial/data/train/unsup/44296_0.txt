This is a fast food restaurant and I am writing review. This tells it all. This one has great kid friendly playground and the staffs are awesome. Even though we do lots of drive-through, it will be awesome dining inside if we had time. I wonder how they do this in fast food restaurant. I heard they get paid well and it is definitely working well. Good job Chick-fil-A.
