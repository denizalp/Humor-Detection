I don't think soup should be so expensive. I thought the soup was good. I wish I would have brought some water to dilute it a little bit. Then I would have had leftovers and my blood pressure would not have spiked. The little buns of stuff were really good. I adore the cat on the logo. I almost broke down in tears when I saw someone spray paint tagged the little waving kitty in front of the now closed hibachi place in Lakewood. I can't believe people get tattoos of that dumb Melt logo and don't get this cat put on their skin. I guess there are a lot of things in life that I will never understand.
