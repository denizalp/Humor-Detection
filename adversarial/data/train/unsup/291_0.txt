Beautiful balloons everywhere to celebrate the opening of this new store.  For $5 you can become a balloon owner.  It's just as well that there were balloons to entertain us..... for about 30 mins.  Because that's how long my friends and I waited for our desserts, but decided to do a refund and go elsewhere instead.  Apparently the machine was broken.  But we were not told this until we asked when we will get our desserts.
