Been to Vegas about 12 or 13 times and I've rented cars from most of the providers here. This is the first time I've ever rented with Hertz and this will also be the last! Slowest front desk agents in the terminal. I'm watching the other rental car agencies and they all get their customers in and out. These guys have 4 agents at the desk but can only serve 2 people at a time. Not sure what the other 2 agents are doing at their computer screens. I've been waiting in line for 40mins now. Terrible!
