This is my second time here.  This restaurant is a hidden gem.  The Japanese food and sashimi is fresh and the portion is super generous.  The price is above average but consider the portion is generous, that makes up for it.  The place is small so the seats are limited.  A lot of people tends to buy take out because of the lack of seats available.  The waiter and waitress are friendly and offer suggestion when we don't know what to choose.  I love their spicy salmon double double roll.  It taste good!!! We were surprised that after our meal, the chef gave us another plate of spicy salmon double double roll and toll us it's on the house.  The food is good and service is awesome.  We will come here regularly from now on.
