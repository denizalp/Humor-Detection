So here I came back again for their lunch buffet, which is only $10 per person. The food was pretty good I have to say, but when I got there, most of the meat dishes were gone. I felt bad asking for more but another group of people came in after me and they asked the waitress to cook more, so we got lucky and got to eat some freshly cooked meat dishes. I really liked their tandoori chicken - it was not dry at all and it was very very flavorful. I also liked their potato yellow ish vege dish - i don't know what that's called but it was very yummy as well. The rice pudding was decent too.\n\nso, if you walk in and found out that most of the stuff were gone, don't be afraid to ask them to bring up some fresh ones. Chances are if you don't ask them, you dont get to eat anything..
