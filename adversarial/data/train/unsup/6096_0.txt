Rehab Burger reminds me of Hooters with more modern outfits. The food is ok, the waitresses are friendly, and the ambiance is sorta sports bar ish.  Service was fast, location was great. No complaints on those fronts.\n\nI ordered a burger, but just when I remembered we had reservations for a steakhouse that evening, I quickly changed it to a grilled cheese sandwich. Unfortunately, the sandwich was pretty disappointing. The bread was 90% of the entree: huge one-inch thick slices that contained a couple slices of barely warmed (let alone melted) cheese. The sweet potato tater tots were fine.
