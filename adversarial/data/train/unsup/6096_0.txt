Wow, that is all I can say about this place.  I would rather eat East Indian food served in a dirty diaper than the crap that comes out of this joint.  The food here is so bad that my dog wouldn't even eat it.   Where should I start?  The wings?  Nachos?  Combo platter?  Seriously, the nachos here sucked, I mean littlerally, if there was a trailer hitch in the parking lot it would have no chrome on it that's how bad they were.   This place is not even worthy of one of my review essays but I will say this, get better help, a chef that isn't from a part of Mexico where they eat dogs and a new owner, then change the name and maybe I'll come back.  Gordon Ramsys would probly burn this sinking death ship to the ground if he had the chance just to put it out of it's misery.
