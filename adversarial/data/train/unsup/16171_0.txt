It's a strip club that seems to run the gamut from being really awesome (weekend nights) to really dull (weekday nights)\n\ni dragged Peter G there over the summer in my never ending quest to corrupt the young lad, and was annoyed to find out that there was a 2 drink minimum per person. Back when I drank this was not a big deal, but being as I can't anymore, poor Peter G had to take 2 for the team (well 4) and drink my drinks as well as his own. This resulted in a quick decline from \"wow this is interesting\" to \"baaaaawwwwww\" on his part.\n\none thing i noticed (and was annoyed by since I wanted to buy him a lap dance) is that the strippers never came over to our table...i'm guessing it was since we were a mixed gender couple, because they were all over the tables that were populated only by men. that was annoying since  i couldn't really leave my morose compatriot behind to hunt down a diversion.\n\nas for the club, it is large, has multiple stages, the dancers run the gamut from really thin to rubenesque and from barely moving to \"i wonder if they are trying out for cirque de soliel\"
