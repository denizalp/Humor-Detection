Here's an example of where advertising works. I was just minding my own business walking around in the Paris Hotel and the billboard caught my attention. I wasn't even craving something sweet, but for some reason the color scheme made me want to try it.\n\nI was super thirsty and thought the restaurant was the only place to get something to drink. When we asked the bartender where we can order a shake to go, he told us to go inside to the store. Little did I know the shop was just on the other side of the door! \n\nInside there was tons of options to choose from, but I had my mind set on a shake. I ended up getting a raspberry fruit one because of the description. I won't say it quenched my thirst, but I will say it was a nice thick shake.
