I really enjoy Jimmy John's, but this location has consistently been the worst I've been to. I went in person about a month or so ago and the odor inside the store was overwhelming and smelled like bleach combined with something unidentifiable. We had to take our sandwiches out of the store halfway through our lunch and eat them in the car because the smell was so strong and gross. I also received a gift card and had a turkey sandwich (#4, no lettuce) delivered to my house today. The sandwich did arrive quickly, which was awesome, but it was two thin slices of turkey and four small, thin slices of tomato. I actually opened the sandwich to see if they forgot to add the filling because the sandwich looked empty when I unwrapped it. It was like eating a bread and mayo sandwich with tough (old?) bread. I have been ordering from this store since it opened, but I also order from two other locations when I'm working. The other locations are significantly better! This one seems to be getting worse. Very disappointing!
