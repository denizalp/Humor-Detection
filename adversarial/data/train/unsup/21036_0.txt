I called TheLens after finding a scorpion shortly after moving into my home. Clay was an hour late for our appointment, but called ahead of time to let me know. He was very accommodating to my schedule and even offered to come the same day I called. He was very thorough and spent two hours inspecting the outside of my home and applying the treatment inside and out. He went over everything with me afterward and gave me tips for things I could do to prevent bugs from entering my home. I would definitely recommend this company to everyone.
