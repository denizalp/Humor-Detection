Surprisingly had this place to ourselves for most of our dinner on a week night. The food and service was absolutely fantastic!!! We got one of the steak platters (don't remember the name) and I believe it came with filet mignon and ribeye in addition to fabulous tasting corn, beans and rice. The sangria was also fantastic. The waiters and chef could not have been more nice and accommodating. If you want top-notch Mexican cuisine, GO here. Very nice atmosphere as well. A little tricky to find. Look for a sky blue sign.
