These guys are nothing short of reliable- right about the time I start noticing the grass being a little long, they show up within a day or two. They take their time mowing, edging, hedging, and maintaining flowerbeds and doing whatever it is people do to make sure palm trees don't die, and they do it well- my grass is always green and property is always attractive.\n\nMy only qualm, and it's a minor one, is that they start working around 6:30-7AM. Mowers at that hour are a little unpleasant. But I totally get that they want to get started because Vegas daytime temps are ridonk- luckily they only swing by once every three weeks.\n\nDisclaimer: I don't handle their billing or scheduling, so I have no insight as to the value or how easy it is to contact the office, as my property management deals with them.
