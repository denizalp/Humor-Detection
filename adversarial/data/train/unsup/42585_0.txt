I had a free full house check-up coupon and Sean was extremely thorough and was able to assure me that I had no leaks which was what I feared.  Instead, he solved the issue I was dealing with simply because he is intelligent as well as an experienced plumber.  He checked every faucet and every toilet and he serviced my water heater and also corrected my low water pressure problem.  This all cost me about $900 for parts but at least my problems are now all solved.  Yes, it was expensive but I received good service and my water problems are gone.
