If you want something quick and doesn't mind to have something that you eat everyday, then the food court is a great option!  We went to a very popular restaurant hoping to have some yummy breakfast, however the line is very long so we decided to go to somewhere else, and ended up we are at the food court because everywhere is busy.  Thank you Caesar to have such a food court in this very very busy area!
