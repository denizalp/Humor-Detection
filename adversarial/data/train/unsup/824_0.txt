Unfortunately, these doughnuts didn't wow me. One of the closest doughnut shops to my house and I could care less.\nThe staff was super nice and helpful, I didn't know you could get doughnuts filled or dipped on the spot. I walked in and it seemed like there weren't many choices until I asked for a cr√®me filled and he said, I can make you one! Wow! Really!? And dip it in chocolate! \nThe concept is cool but the actual doughnuts didn't have much flavor and the fillings and toppings were just \"meh\". \nPrices were on par with most places.\nI think I'll stick to my other doughnut spots even if they are a little farther to get to.
