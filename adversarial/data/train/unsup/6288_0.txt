Everyone at this trader joe's is super friendly and I love it. I hate it tho! Don't go there! The area is horrible with traffic. Stay away. Blah! So much traffic. So many weird lanes that are all of a sudden like, oh - you're turning. But trader joe's tho! I'm on whole30 so I am so stuck here. I need to go back to Eastlake where I belong  and go to walmart in my jammies.
