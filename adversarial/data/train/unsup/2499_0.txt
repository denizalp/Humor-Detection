OH MY TACOS EL GORDO! When you thought you lived in a city with authentic mexican food, Tacos El Gordo... hands down beats it all! THE BEST TACOS. Whether you are drunk or sober, it doesn't matter. I love how this is jam packed & open during early & late hours throughout the day.\n\n* Ordered:\n- Small Carne Asada Fries (3\/4 stars): Sorry, I've tasted better in Southern California so this is just a good back up for your asada needs. A small is shareable for 2 unless you're drunkenly, hungry.\n- Al Pastor Tacos (5\/5 stars): SO good, that I wished I got more than 2!\n- Asada Tacos (4\/5 stars): Squeeze the lime all over & you're good to go. I think picking asada for tacos are better than the fries.\n- Horchata (3\/5 stars): Too small for it's price, but good enough to wash down the tacos.\n\n- They have a salsa & lime bar\n\n* Concept:\n1) Come in, pick your \"MEAT line.\" They have specific lines for all their meats from al pastor to asada to pork to beef to beef tongue & more!\n\n2) Ask them what you want between tacos, fries, tostadas, sopes, mulas, quesadillas & drinks. They'll grill the meat in front of you!\n\n3) Take it to go, they'll wrap it in foil for you or dine in, they'll simply put it on a plate hot & fresh for you to eat!\n\n4) Pay at the registers.\n\n5) Finding a table here can get difficult, but when you keep an eye out, people leave left & right here & there. We didn't wait very long to sit down because most tables were in groups. \n\n6) They have workers coming around cleaning up & take your trays & trash when you are done eating. \n\nDo not be intimidated by the lines & crowd. For a Friday night, lines were fast, got our food cooked fast, & the only line that was longer here was to pay because they only have 2 registers. This is THE SPOT to eat before, during, or after partying in Vegas!\n\nGRACIAS, Tacos El Gordo!\n\nps - This isn't the only location! (North LV & the strip)
