The reviews here are a bit negative but I went with an open mind. In my humble opinion, I think most people end up deceive because they had really high expectations and it comes with a really hefty price tag. \nWe had the tuna tartar as an appetizer. \nI really enjoyed it, especially the \"spicy\" sauce. So I will definitely recommend it. \nThen we shared a nice steak (20 oz Lou's cut: bone-in-rib) And drunken beef which is a 8 oz of filet mignon marinated in Porto topped with goat cheese. If you don't like goat cheese do not order this plate. The steaks were good but not the best I have I have ever had. {insert Drake verse} \nWe ordered our steaks medium rare and they were closer to medium. \nWe had a side of lobster mash. I think I would have appreciated it more if the pieces of lobster were bigger. \nEverything was ok\/good but I didn't fell off my chair. \nWe didn't have desert because we were pretty full. \nI really appreciated the service though. \nI'm not sure I will be back but I'm happy I tried at least once.
