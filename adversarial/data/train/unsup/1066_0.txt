Frank & Shirley's now accept credit cards, but unfortunately, they are no longer open 24 hours on weekends, closing up at 9PM on Fridays and Saturdays, so those who complain that there aren't enough independent late-night restaurant options in Pittsburgh have more ammunition. However, expect the same above-average diner food they've been cookin' up for as long as I've been alive.\n\nP.S. They have wi-fi too now!
