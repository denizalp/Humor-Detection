As good as it gets! Katrina is a skilled and polished pro, with a great knack for detail. I went with Myriad in part because of their team approach. I felt I would fall in good hands with Danny if Katrina got tied up, but she took such good care of me that I never had to find out! Katrina knows how to read between the lines of listings, and doesn't hesitate to contact listing agents to get the smallest of clarifications. Going in, I felt pretty confident that I could spot most house defects myself, but Katrina consistently rooted up issues I completely whiffed on. She proved her worth on the very first home we saw, and earned my trust and confidence quickly. \nI was being a PITA on a few occasions after placing an offer, but Katrina consistently validated my concerns, and made sure we got to the bottom of every issue with the seller. She's not timid, and was even game to make calls on my behalf Thanksgiving eve while her family was in town. \nI ultimately found a spot that hit all the marks and, with the Myriad team guiding me, closed within 30 days. I don't like any surprises on major purchases, and Katrina always kept me apprised of the next several steps of the closing process. To top it off, she attended my closing, and eagle-eyed an unwarranted $125 title company fee for a mobile notary that I missed, and quickly negotiated a refund! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Myriad to anyone looking to buy in the Phoenix area. Good people, and great service!
