I really love me some fresh bread. You would think I weighed 500 lbs., that's how much I love it. The only trouble with me bread is that I want it fresh and warm. I couldn't give this outstanding bakery a 5 star rating because of two reasons: \n1. they open at 9a \n2. they don't bake their stuff in house. \nI thought all bakeries open at the crack of dawn with all of their goodies out and ready. Not so in this case. I showed up at 830a, thinking I had already missed out on the good stuff, and watched their van unload all the goodies into the place with an open time of 9a. \nDespite the drawbacks, the pastries are so delectible I will still go there for the coconut custard danish and the black forest cake slice. Don't forget to take a pretzel roll with you for the car ride home.
