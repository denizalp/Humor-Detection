I believe the universe balances itself out. For all good, there is bad.  Well, for the Pink Nightmare that Aunt Clara unleashed on Ralphie, Malley's Chocolates is the Pink Dream to even it out. \n\nWhenever I enter the door, I instantly become the biggest kid in the candy shop. Delights for one and all exist here, (yes, even for those who can't have sugar!), and they're well worth it. The chocolate bars are sensational - from the basic CLE bar to the chocolate pretzel.  \n\nThis location is particularly cool - the carousel is very old school and sitting on this rotating stage gives you a chance to show off your amazing sugar haul to the entire store.  (Make sure to also give your best \"royalty waive\" as you slowly spin around!) On top of it, it's a proper soda fountain with great ol' timey drinks, tasty ice cream, and adorable candy-laden sundaes. \n\nMalley's is also great for birthday parties and fundraisers. ($1 chocolate bars? Sign me up. Bet you can't eat just one!)
