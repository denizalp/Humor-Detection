I dropped into this wine bar for.... surprise.... a glass of wine. I had checked out their menu online earlier but opted not to order anything solid. Though they do have a couple of small veganish options.\n\nEight has a modern decor, good atmosphere, and while I was there, a live DJ. There were television screens in the wall playing oh so hipply distorted Alfred Hitchcock movies.\n\nWhen I walked in it was mostly empty, the bartender was friendly, and the service reached that delicate balance of attentive but unobtrusive. \n\nI ordered a terrible wine, the name of which I have forgotten, but that's not their fault. I picked something local and cheap. They have a great wine list, available by the glass or by the bottle, so you're bound to find something to enjoy.\n\nThe server was kind enough to keep offering to fill up my glass of water at least 5 times after I finished that 1 glass of (terrible) wine. They weren't exactly busy, but there wasn't a moment I felt rushed out of there and it was appreciated.
