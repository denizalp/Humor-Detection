The service is truly horrible! I paid 24$ for a car wash. I was told 30 minutes. I was there 45 ! I had to go ask them if they started working on my car. They answered no. That was after being there for 35 minutes. You can imagine what a horrible job they did in the remaining 10 minutes! The people who dry off the car stand there and talk. I don't think I will waste another dime there!!! I had to even ask them for a cloth so I could wipe down some dirty spots!
