This is a different kind of place...in a good way. Inside has pink and blue neon looking lighting. And 70s looking booths. The restaurant is clean. Food is good. Wide variety on the menu. This place has been around a long time, used in a variety of Vegas themed movies.  Be sure to try the attached fireside lounge before or after your meal. It is different too. And good. You will want to come back to both the restaurant and lounge again. Give it a try. Enjoy!
