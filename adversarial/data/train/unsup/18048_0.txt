While it was totally fun, I wanted more.  I felt like it was a bit sparse and empty.  I was still craving to see more and left feeling like - that was it?\n\nAny doctors, nurses, or other practitioners already know this stuff so they would be better off saving their money.\n\nThis exhibit is more geared toward the average person (without a heavy Science background) wanting to learn about basic anatomy and the body.  \n\nIt's a quick walk through, especially if you know Anatomy so the price ~$30 (with a discount) was a little steep.  I'd understand charging $20-22 for it, but anything beyond that seems a bit overpriced but hey, Education is Knowledge and Knowledge is Power - Yeah!\n\nThere is a small gift shop afterwards where you can pick up awesome posters from $10-15.  Definitely worth it.\n\nLocation: inside the Luxor, on the 2nd floor - go up the escalator from the ground floor of the main lobby
