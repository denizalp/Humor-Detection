It is so hard to review things in Vegas because I feel like you have to judge them differently than you would other places.  Everything is expensive and Vegasy so you have to rate them based on other Vegasy places.  So I must give Guy Fieri an average rating.  The food was good but not great and if I am paying Vegas prices I want high Vegas quality food.  \n\nThe restaurant is pretty small so if you don't have a reservation you will probably have to wait during peak times.  We arrived and were told it would be a 45 minute wait so we put our name down and then stacked out a place at the bar and were able to claim bar seating in about 5 minutes.  The service from behind the bar was very good, fast but not bothersome.  The specialty drinks ok but small for the price.  \n\nI had the turkey burger and it was better than most I have had at restaurants but still not as good as the one my husband makes at home.  I did find it funny that they put bacon on a turkey burger but hey that was fine with me.  I liked that the pretzel bun was good and soft like I prefer.  I also liked the fries that came with the burger.  They give you all sorts of different ones all together and they were all good.
