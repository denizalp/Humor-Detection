Absolutely horrible! While I consider myself an adventurous eater, my teenage son is most definitely not. We needed assistance navigating the menu and I repeated four times that he does NOT like spicy food ... only to be told where the Siracha bottles were located. While my son only ate a few bites, I ate my entire meal. As I write this from my bathroom, I won't go into detail explaining how my body is trying to rid itself of this meal. . Suffice it to say, we will not be returning.
