This place is really adorable. We had originally gone to the sister restaurant for \"pizza\", which they didn't have. We're so glad, because, for the price, you really can't beat this place. The pizza is PERFECT, not too thin (I'm sorry my idea of pizza is not phyllo dough with some mozzarella splattered here and there) and not too thick (a moment on the lips, a lifetime on these freakin hips!). My husband is Italian & has grown up with an Italian mom making homemade pizza his whole life, he was very impressed. Quality mozzarella, homemade tomato sauce with the right amount of herbs. The Caesar salad was well done, the right amount of dressing, I could taste anchovies but not overwhelmingly so, and the lettuce was crisp & fresh. My only suggestion - add some garlicky croutons. This is the best part, though. If you have kids, there is a\"VIP\" room for them, complete with cartoons and video games, amazing! We sat & enjoyed our chianti while the little rugrats were engrossed in a show. You can't beat that precious bit of paradise.
