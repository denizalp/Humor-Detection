Had brunch again here on Sunday! Again amazing service and good. Had the grits with special added.. this means pork belly, corn, and other delightful flavourful addition to the grits. Had the chicken and waffles again and added a kale salad and Brussel sprouts.. needless to say we are too much and had to take an afternoon nap at the pool. All in all.. great place for brunch after a night of drinking.
