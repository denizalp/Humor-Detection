2nd time, first was fun, but this was bad. I like the dancers; however, Rude\/pushy floor men throughout the place coral you like sheep into the few small areas were you can try to stand. If you step over any of their imaginary lines, anywhere in the club, they will harass you.  I'm not talking VIP areas here.\n\nOne Bouncer saw me come out of the dance floor where I had been for at least 90 mins with some ladies. I was going to get us drinks.  When I came back with the drinks, he had roped off the aisle and wouldn't let me in; instead, making me go around to the other side of the club and make a horrendous walk through jam-packed crowd in a tiny, narrow aisle... next to impossible to get back to my party without practically bulldozing my way through the crowd and irritating others.  All this after paying $75 to get in and at least $100 on a few drinks...smh.\n\nThis Bouncer with a BA...knew exactly what he was doing: picked me to hate on that night.
