If I could give 0 stars I would. This place is an absolute joke run by a family that condones speaking to their customers like garbage. We were first greeted by a very nice hostess that immediately began to get our table together. We were sat at a nice high top in the back near the bar with a great view of the whole restaurant including the musician. A few minutes after we sat down and had ordered a bottle of wine + an appetizer we were abruptly approached by a woman who did not introduce herself and insisted we must move as a different reservation needed our table. After I asked if it was possible to find a different table for the 6 top I was given the answer, \"Um no, it's easier to find a table for two so get up.\" At this time the owner, Joe, finally stepped in to let her know we were okay to stay where we had been seated. Already appalled by the way that was handled, we decided to stay and stick the rest of the evening out. We then found out that the woman speaking to us like scum was a MANAGER named Veronica. Never in my life have I come across a more unprofessional human, let alone someone allowed to be management in a customer service driven industry. The incorrect bottle of wine was brought to our table and our very nice server went back to exchange for the correct one. At this time we heard Veronica say, \"Oh so now they want white wine? Of course they think they can just change their bottle now\", at which time I stated that we had actually ordered white in the first place and it was simply an error. After a snarky response back we were still not brought the correct bottle. I decided it was time to bring the owner over to discuss the issues I was having. Veronica saw me speaking to the owner and proceeded to make a snarky comment under her breath about how I can continue to cry about it. The owner asked what he could do and I stated simply receiving our correct bottle of wine sooner than 30 minutes after ordered would make me happy at this point. When he returned to our table he brought Veronica with him (?) and they proceeded to \"apologize\" by saying I misheard everything and she did not act the way that I was claiming. I replied by noting how unprofessional this was and got the response \"No, YOU are being unprofessional.\" This is laughable as a customer- I am not at work, YOU are at work and it is YOUR job to be professional and cater to a paying customer. The best is yet to come- Veronica is the owner's stepdaughter. As they continued to not only put their hands on me as an attempt to comfort me they continued to tell me how wrong I was for not simply accepting an apology. Yes, you read that correctly, putting their hands physically on myself and my boyfriend. At this time we walked out and I now am writing this in absolute disgust. Clearly the owner condones his employees to speak to his customers this way solely because they are family. That is a sick way to run a business and I cannot wait to see this place go under as I know I am not the first, nor will I be the last, to encounter what is possibly the worst staff in all of Cleveland.
