This place rocks. I love Stinkweeds. They have a great selection of new and used music. I could hang out here and listen to tracks for hours. The employees are very helpful. They will throw on any CD you want to hear. Plus, any business owned by Kimber is going to attract people in the community. Buy local! Visit Stinkweeds
