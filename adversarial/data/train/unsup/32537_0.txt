Their 'gifts' aren't worth the time to sit and listen to the sales pitch.  If you get the 'trip' to Napa or somewhere, they book on the latest flight and return on the earliest.  They also put you in a Motel 6 or equivalent.  After taxes, the amount we paid, we could have paid on our own without the hassle.  We decided to go to Vegas.  Well, the reservation person was very nice and said that the room was an 'upgraded' room.  NOT!  It was the most basic and it wasn't worth paying the upgrade fee so we just sucked it up.  When I cancelled our other trip, one of their agents called and kept pushing you to take another trip.  When you say 'no', they pretty much just cut you off and hang up on you.  Their timeshare package sounds reasonable and a good deal.  It's like a 'club'.  They don't even have their own facilities that I have seen.  You just join the 'association' to pick from other timeshare facilities.  I wouldn't waste my time with this company.  It sounds really good and we almost purchased.  Good thing we didn't.
