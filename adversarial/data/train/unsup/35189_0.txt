My friends and I enjoy coming to this indoor range. The people are very friendly and the facility is state-of-the-art. I like that there is a guest viewing area behind a wall of glass unlike other ranges were my non-shooting friends have to sit on a bench twiddling their thumbs somewhere inside the store while the rest go shoot. I will definitely be coming here again and again! Highly recommended!
