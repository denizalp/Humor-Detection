Forget your DIET, you are not fat...\n\nForget the small portions you actually have to eat throughout the day, who cares if you have today breakfast, lunch, and dinner all in one at Bellagio's...\n\nForget your strict work-out plan, you would do your stomach a big favor once a year...\n\nForget the not ending line with screaming, crying kids and their annoyed parents...\n\nIT IS WORTH IT!!!
