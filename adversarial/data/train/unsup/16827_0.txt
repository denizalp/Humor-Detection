Are you thinking about sleeping here for a vegas trip?\n\nShort Answer:  No.\n\nLong Answer: Saying the walls are paper thin would be a compliment. I was able to tell when and which neighbor was using the bathroom.\n\nThere is no one working late at night. Meaning, if you are trying to sleep at 4am in the morning but the upstairs people are playing nonstop music and having their drunken ass fall to the floor all the time, you can't complain to anyone. The adjacent motel 6 has security, but this shit hole place doesn't.\n\nVending machines are like buying food\/drinks at theme parks. $2 per CAN, and about $1.50 for small sized candy.\n\nIf you happen to rent out the room #277, notice the nostalgic dents from someones fists from a previous lifetime.\n\nThe basketball court is more of an \"lol\" factor. it looks like a dogs head when trying to understand you. other words, tilted.\n\nIf you decide to stay here, you'll notice the fine line between usual vegas (hooters casino area) to ghetto, which is at the best value inn and motel 6.\n\nANd, if you decide to stay at this charming piece of crap.... after your stay, let me ask you this... \"Remember their awesome customer service?... you're right. Neither do I\"\n\n\nps. THey don't charge you until after you check out. Meaning you could show up with a \"reservation\" but they have no rooms available. As to what almost happened to us. They had a difficult time finding a room for us even though we made a reservation weeks in advance.
