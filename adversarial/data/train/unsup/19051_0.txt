I have dealt with these guys on three occasions and they have been great every time.  \n\nI went to Lowe's and they:\n\na.  Didn't have blanks for all the keys I needed\nb.  The keys they did copy didn't work anyway\n\nSo I went to my friendly neighborhood locksmith where every key was flawless, even the \"manufacturer only\" keys that they didn't have a perfect match for.  They were still able to shave a close blank down and make my keys.\n\nI never go anywhere else now.  Why bother.
