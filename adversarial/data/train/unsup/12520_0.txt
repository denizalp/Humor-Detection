I took a friend here to get her CPAP supplies.  You walk in and are greeted by a girl behind the desk with a cold welcome which sets the tone for the rest of the place.  Most places you are greeted with a warm welcome and made to feel welcome but not here, its like WHAT???\n\nYou have a set appointment but you are not taken back at your appointment time so be prepared to be here a little longer then expected.\n\nOnce called back, you are greeted a little more warmly and taken back to a room which has masks on heads, NOT REAL HEADS PEEPS, which in my opinion is VERY COOL because no other place I have been to before have they had the masks displayed so you can look at them and see how they sit.\n\nThe guy we had was very warm and friendly and left the room to get the mask my friend wanted and when he came back he was helpful in making sure it fit her the way she liked.  He did make it sound like this style mask was going out of inventory which baffles me as to why they take things that work for people out of inventory, but its all good.\n\nOverall the service here was ok, nothing over the top like in other places but this is where her insurance sends her.
