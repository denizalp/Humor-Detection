This year's Computer Electronics Show was mostly about the next generation 3D everything from televisions and cameras, smartphones, and iPad look alike tablets....YAWN!?!?\n\nAs compared to many year's past, the 2011 version of CES was an extremely crowded mess and mostly a disappointment!\n\nAlthough one thing of note that was interesting was the glasses-free 3D televisions....still in it's first generation, but something to look forward to next year!\n\nThis year's integration of Social Networking has grown! I definitely noticed more advertising and participation in Tweetups and Foursquare FUN for the participating attendees....I am far from the Twitter\/Foursquare Master, but there was prizes from participating vendors like Blackberry, Victoronox, Sandisk, etc. I walked away with a few goodies that had people asking how I got it!!  =)\n\nA quick note (at no fault of the CES organizers...I think), I heard constant complaints about the internet connection and all cellular providers connections was a problem, if your within the proximity of the show. It was a constant complaint of the many CES attendees that I talked too....BOO!!\n\nIMAGINE....the CES attendees with their AT&T iPhone, Sprint Blackberry, and Verizon Android smartphones had little or no good internet connection.....traffic jams on the information super highway is to blame. Attention Las Vegas and CES organizers - FIX IT!!\n\nAs I stated on my previous review, I don't have the $$$$$ to purchase any of the new and fun consumer technology, but it is always fun to dream!\n\nBut for this year, the WOW factor is gone - until 2012, Four Yelp Stars for this years iteration of the Computer Electronics Show.
