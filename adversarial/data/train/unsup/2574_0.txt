The Brazilian wax went so quickly that I was surprised when it was over. It felt a LOT less painful than my first wax at the Ten Spot, and half the cost as well. My skin is a lot less irritated too - my first time, I needed three days to recover but an hour after my wax I already feel not bad at all! This will be my new go-to for waxing!
