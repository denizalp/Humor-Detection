My review is based on the care that I received from my practitioner she takes really good care of me she used to be at a different business but is move to this one Allison always takes really good care of me and generally concerned about my health the location is a little farther out really easy to get to off the freeway really nice waiting room and the staff is friendly wait time is very sufficient in and out with in around 30 minutes
