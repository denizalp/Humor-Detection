After a friend spoke highly of the restaurant, my wife and I decided to try it.  Night didn't start out so great.  We were seated at a fairly dark table near the bar. Had to use our cell phone to read the menu.  After about 10 minutes of no one coming to our table, we flagged down someone who turned out to be the asst. manager.  He was very pleasant and apologetic and said he personally would be working our table.\n\nThe peel and eat shrimp appetizer was very good.  Although, we could have used a bit more cocktail sauce right off the bat.  I'm sure more was there for the asking.  Could have also used more napkins and a hand towelette.\n\nWife had the pasta with four vegetables.  It smelled fantastic, had plenty of veggies, and was flavorful.  I had the pork with apples.  Excellent.  The mix of apples and cranberries was perfect.\n\nExcept for the slow start, we were pleased with the night overall and definitely will return.
