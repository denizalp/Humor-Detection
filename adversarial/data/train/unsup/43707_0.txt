I've only eaten here a handful of times, but thus far it has always made for an enjoyable dinner. The first time we ever went, we ordered the Capellini Sorrento, spaghetti with tomato sauce with a side of meatballs and two custom slices of pizza all for $34! Their prices are reasonable for the large portions served.\n\nTheir garlic knots are super yummy; Their pizza is always very well done with fresh ingredients and a nice crust; Their meatballs had a nice flavor and weren't small and their spaghetti sauce has a nice flavor as well! The Capellini Sorrento (angel hair pasta with shrimp and scallops in a creamy pesto sauce) was a nice hefty helping of pasta with just the right balance of seafood mixed in and tasted good. We've tried a few other items off the menu, including their tortellinis and other various pasta dishes and thus far have zero complaints! Everything is cooked well, and tastes good!\n\nI think my favorite thing about this restaurant is that they have a good sized children's menu with a variety of foods which is wonderful if you have a picky eater or one that enjoys trying new things or eating what the adults eat but in smaller portion form. The majority of their prices are reasonable for the larger portions you're served, so all I can say is dig in! We look forward to returning!
