I beg to differ! The spa is beautiful. My stylist Tenaya is brand new to this establishment and she is a must in my monthly \"relaxation\" schedule. She has been doing my hair extensions for 6 years and is an incredible artist. You must request Tenaya!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh... don't forget to tell her I referred you. Cat T
