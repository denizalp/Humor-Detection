When I was applying to live here the management staff were so accommodating, helpful, and nice!  After I moved in I was beyond disappointed with the management and maintenance staff. Trouble tickets take forever to be \"completed\". Other tenants for the most part are just as grumpy and rude as the staff. It is a great location, but in my opinion it is far from worth it.
