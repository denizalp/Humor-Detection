Unless you're a local yokel McFarland douchebag, you won't get any measure of service here.  After waiting more than 15 minutes for a server outside, I went inside to inquire of outdoor food service.  Of course, since I am not one of the regular inebriated bar flies, getting the attention of a bartender is nearly impossible.  I guess I'm just not loud enough, drunk enough, or both.  And once I did get his ear, the next local loudmouth douche bag stumbles up to the bar and interupts me to order his next round of Captain and Cokes (classy).  So we left and will never be back...unless of course we lose all sense of decency and purpose and relocate to McFarland.
