Kayaking is my latest things to do and this place was closest from my house to enjoy kayaking.\n\nRental process is easy. All you need is a credit card and a driver's license. I asked them to store my wallet, key and a phone at the office and they agreed but I think I would leave my wallet at home next time.\n\nRental is from 60 minutes. She added 10 minuets to just to make sure I was covered. Staff helped me get on the kayak and I was out enjoying in no time.\n\nKayaking in the middle of the city is different than out in the nature. Instead of enjoying the wild nature, I enjoyed looking around the buildings, but mostly aircraft landing. This area is a flight pass to the Skyharbor airport and I kept looking up airplanes and was guessing aircraft type.\n\nI would still prefer to kayak outside the city but this place is good when you have limited time.
