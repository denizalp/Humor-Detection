Eggplant entrée was fantastic.  Avocado curry was fantastic, my wife said.  It was a little too spicy for me even at \"mild\".  Chicken kabob was also tasty.  We ordered delivery to our hotel room, which was a little difficult conveying the correct address, there is a little bit of a language barrier over the phone.  But that barrier lens a bit to the authenticity right!  Our children loved the eggplant and kabobs and rice.  All the entrées came with rice.  Generous portions.
