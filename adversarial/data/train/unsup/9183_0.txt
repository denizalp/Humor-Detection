I don't get the hype. Probably because I can't eat dairy, which is the secret ingredient in everything. I settled on a plain old hamburger and was pretty underwhelmed by the quality of the patty. There was really nothing special about it. I totally forgot about the secret menu and perused it when I was eating. Everything was pretty cheese-heavy.\n\nThe fries were really good, but that was about it.
