I feel so comfortable at B19.  While the decor is somewhat trendy and stylish, it has something that just seems comfy.  That comfy could come from the servers and bartender...all so nice and do a great job.  Stopped by on a snowy night when a function we were going to was canceled...needed to find a nice comfy place with good comfy food...B19.  \n\nThe food is very good and sometimes a little adventurous with some great comfort type items.   We stopped at the bar and since we did not have reservations decided to eat at the bar since the wait would be very long...gee, it is snowing like crazy and not one cancelation.   The bartender is great, friendly and mixes a good drink.  We split the Lamb Empanada with mole sauce, lime cilantro slaw and the Pear and Roasted Beet salad; both were very good.  For the main course, I had the Red Wine Raised Beef Short Ribs that had an apple cider glaze with some delicious whipped potatoes and baby carrots.  The meal was delicious, meat was tender and tasty.  \n\nIf your looking for a neighborhood bistro with a comfy and trendy feel, B19 is it.
