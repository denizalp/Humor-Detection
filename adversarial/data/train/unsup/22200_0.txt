I can't say enough good things about this place. Brew Tea Bar is the best boba cafe in Vegas. It probably ranks up there as one of my favorites of all time. It's a little far and out of the way for me, but I will gladly make that trip every time. The service is outstanding and their drinks are perfect (and if they aren't, they will make it to your liking until they are). The owner is super friendly and always asks greets us and asks how our drinks are.\n\nThere's a number of drinks that I've tried, but my favorites are the lattes. They tend to be creamier due to the sea salt cream on top. The mango is my go-to drink, but I also really like the jasmine latte. The Hokkaido milk tea is another popular sweet option that tastes more like cake. Best of all, their boba quality is on point if you are particular about how soft or hard the balls are. Grab a stamp card because you'll be guaranteed to return!
