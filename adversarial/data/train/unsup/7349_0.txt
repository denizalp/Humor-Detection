What the eff Home Depot! I've been 3 times now and each time nobody has any idea what's going on there! Well, nobody until I reach the 3rd associate who's able to guide me right where I need to be. But by then I've made my way through the entire store looking for a product that's generally right where my journey began. If you're looking for humidifier filters or a pumice stone to make your toilet bowl shine... you're screwed. Wait no, here's the deal. Humidifiers are up front near the exit, filters are located in the same aisle. Pumice, your guess is as good as mine. I've found them in the cleaning aisle and the hardware aisle. Last time I threw in the towel after 20 minutes of searching (just keep them in the same place) and bought a grill stone which I'm told works the same.
