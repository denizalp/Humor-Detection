I will never, ever book with them again. I purchased a ticket for $109 because it was the most affordable. There was another ticket with Southwest for $137 but I passed it up b\/c I wanted to save money. HUGE mistake - Frontier charged me an extra $41 for a SEAT and a CARRY-ON. Then, they charged for WATER on the plane!! What in the hell?! The bag and water, maybe you can rationalize it, but a SEAT?! Gimme a break, Frontier. Unless there's a standing option, that charge is ridiculous and shady. Will never recommend and will strongly advise AGAINST them to family & friends.
