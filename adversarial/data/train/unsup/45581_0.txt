A family member recommended this place-- and she is an avid fan of Korean barbeque. I came in hungry after a trip to the chiropractor and found it quite empty for dinnertime.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and they are very friendly. I struck up a conversation with the owner who immediately threw some recommendations at me that I couldn't afford :) Their dinnertime prices will throw you closer to the $15-$20\/per entry mark, which was not my budget that night, nor what I would pay for takeout. \n\nSo, I chose the Bulgogi with Spicy Chicken to go.The owner then discussed their process for choosing fresh vegetables every day, along with never adding MSG to their products, which he is extremely proud of! Cheers! No MSG is appreciated. I paid $13 for the one meal that he claimed came with lots of veggies and kim chee. Thus, since it was talked up, I was actually a bit disappointed on those specifically... The kim chee was not plentiful at all, actually, we only had four measly dollops of each one. Next, the veggies were a very average amount-- however, they were very fresh. I will definitely give him that. The meat was just... fine! Overall, I liked the owner's optimistic approach to the food and the food's fresh quality. However, I think I will only partake in lunchtime due to the price-to-food quantity ratio.
