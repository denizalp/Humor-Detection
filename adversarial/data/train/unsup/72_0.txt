Tf. How does this have such good reviews\n\nWalk in, lady tries to sit us by the busy counter and we say no, she moves us to a bigger table and gives us a high chair for our son. I don't think she ever spoke to us? Either way, she was annoyed that we didn't like her first table option and we could tell.. She hands us some grimy menus and leaves. \n\nMy son was screaming crying at this time and I was really relying on our chips and salsa to come but IT DIDNT. After like 15 minutes of no service, I flagged a lady down and she was out of breath and threw some chips on the table. Uhhhh k\n\nThen she took our drink orders after being there like a half hour (we only wanted some WATERS) and we told her we were ready to order food. Ordered La Mediana (taco + cheese enchilada) and two ground beef enchiladas with rice n beans. Legit took 1 min and our food was at the table. Kinda left wondering how it was ready soooo fast..... but yeahhhhh\n\nIt was nasty. The red enchilada sauce was black, burnt af and tasted like shit. I took the ground beef out of the tortillas\/sauce and my son and I just ate meat with rice n beans. My husband ate his taco and said it was good, but didn't eat his nasty enchilada either..\n\nI cannot express how gross the food was and how poor the service was. They threw the check on our table and basically ran. A lot of regulars must give them business and good Yelp reviews because I would NEVER come here again. When we move to AZ, I'm going to have to find another good Mexican restaurant because this is NOT it!!!
