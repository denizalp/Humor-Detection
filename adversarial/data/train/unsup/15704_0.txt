Reduce, reuse... good ideas to live by.  Well, last weekend, my roomie and I were reducing our book collection and decided to take 2 Trader Joe bags of books into Bookmans so someone else could reuse them.  We dropped them off at the front and then browsed the store while they figure out our exchange rate... cool right?  Well... kinda.  The problem was that, even though a lot of our books were cool travel books and fiction reads, they said they only wanted  2 books from both of our very full bags!  Then they ask if we wanted to donate the rest.  We said sure but, I might go back in later to see if our books were really donated to a cause or if they were donated to the Bookmans cause.  Seems weird that they only wanted 2 books out of about 20 books.  That was a $7 credit.  \n\nOh, and I'd recommend going to exchange on a weekday, not Sat or Sun.  They were way busy in the exchange dept. and then we put the books we'd picked out down and left because they had a HUGE check-out line and only 1 register going.  Really?  \n\nThis was my first experience and I think it ruined me.  In general the store was well organized, has a lot of variety of books and other media, has a cafe and, has comfy chairs to rest in... but I'm not sure I'll ever be back, even to use the credit.  So... I guess we 'donated' all of our books, which is fine so long as they're actually donated.  \n\nProlly won't see ya there.
