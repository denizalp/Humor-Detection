I really like the Blumenthal. But they recently changed the chairs from normal theatre seats with arm rests to temporary seating with no arm rests. I'm currently seated between two men having to cross my arms throughout the entire performance to not be touching anyone. It's pretty uncomfortable. I hope that this is a temporary thing and not their real plan. I will think twice about coming to something at the booth playhouse anytime soon.
