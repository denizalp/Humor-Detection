I first came here as a child, late 80s. This was a family favorite. It's a family owned place, it should have that feel. I've been disappointed for years, today I came in with family, it's been a while. Disappointed, as I have been last few years. The prices change like the economy but you would think the flavor would remain the same, good homemade Mexican. Far from it. Taco salad in my home has beans, not a chicken salad mix thrown into ice berg lettuce w a lot of sour cream. It's gross, waste of money. The drinks are good, only thing they care about. The green chili tamale was bland. Too much salt on the chips. Two stars only because this is my childhood. Food needs to bump, people come and make it busy because it's a staple. 70+years, it's known. It's not great. There's better \"homemade\" Mexican than this. Phoenix.
