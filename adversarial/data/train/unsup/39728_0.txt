I came here for dye highlights the whole 10 yards. Ricky was the one that helped me out. I was asking for a a lot all in one sitting. I specifically wanted it a lighter with a lot of dimensions. I showed Ricky what I wanted and that was it. He did it just the way I wanted it. It did take a while but I am very pleased. \nThe shampoo part was a bonus! The chairs were very comfortable so I didn't have any strain on my neck or anything like that!\nEven after he finished colouring my hair he recommended a trim so the dimensions of my hair can shine through! I agreed and he didn't rush the hair cut. Loved the entire experience. This is the only time I was truly pleased with a haircut and a hair dye plus highlights! \n\nI will definitely be returning!
