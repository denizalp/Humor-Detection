I thought that this was one of the better buffets in Vegas but after eating at the M Hotel, I had to mark it down. The wait was about an hour an the food was decent. There wasn't as much variety but I heard the prime rib was delicious (fyi: I don't eat beef). Everything was fresh though even the salmon. \nService was ok but not great...
