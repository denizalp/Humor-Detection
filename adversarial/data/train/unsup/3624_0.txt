You know things are going to be crazy when you are greeted by a giant Somoan tribal man, a bubble girl, and a disco Cinderella girl at the door!\n\nMove over Vegas clubs because The Light nightclub is now the BEST club I've been to by far!   \nMy group arrived at 10 pm which was super early and we didn't have to wait long in line before we were all let in. Girls free and guys pay $40+ on guest list.\n\nThe place is big and I absolutely LOVE the LED walls and ceiling, the large dance floor, and the amazing sound system. Aerialists and Cirque Soleil type performers can be seen performing all night to the hottest DJ beats. I love how they give you a bunch of drink tickets if you arrive early and from those who paid for their drinks I heard it was pretty reasonable too. I don't think I have ever said this in my life but the bouncers here and security people are the nicest I've ever met. If you are blocking the walkway they kindly escort you to the side and they even directed me to the speakers to sit on when they saw me limping around without my heels on. \n\nTip* the bathroom line is HORRENDOUS! Use it before the crowd gets crazy! Otherwise expect to wait in line with 50 other girls.
