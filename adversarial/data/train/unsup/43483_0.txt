Excellent service! I loved my gel manicure and my daughter and her friend were thrilled with their pedicures. The customer service is top notch and the salon is extremely clean and inviting. Both my daughter and I signed up for the membership (what a great idea!). We are looking forward to our monthly visits to Prose.
