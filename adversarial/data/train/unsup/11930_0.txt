After reading reviews on yelp I decided to go get a pedicure with my fiance here. The lady cutting my nails proceeded to try and rip the sides of my nail out of the flesh. After I made her stop she proceeded to cut the sides of my nails diagonally, rounding the corners. \n\nThanks to this place my fiance and I both have ingrown toenails.
