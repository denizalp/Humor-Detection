Overall, I like the workout I get here.  I've been attending their early morning classes for about 20 days (just finished their intro deal), and so far so good. Be aware they are very strict on their start and stop times, so allow for a little extra time to get there just in case your clock doesn't quite match with theirs. Their staff also seem very knowledgeable about what they do here, and are approachable if you have concerns. Each class is very consistent and is taught the same way, so, for example, if you come in for Topaz it'll be the same class no matter who teaches it. I've seen some people on here complain about that, but I personally like that so that I know what kind of class I'm coming in for that day.\n\nUpdate: 7\/29\/2016\nSo in the time I've been working out at Arrichion, I have to say my opinion of the place could only improve!  I've been attending their classes consistently for about 2.5 years now, and thanks to Arrichion, I officially fell in love with yoga, got my RYT200 certification, and now get to teach yoga to little kids at my kids' daycare!  I also dropped from a size 14 to a size 6 and have toned up in a way I haven't been since high school!  The owners and staff here truly LOVE what they do every day and it shows!  You truly can't beat the heat here either...it's the hottest yoga studio in town! \nThe only significant drawback here is the lack of showers. There is only one small shower room that everyone has to share. In the evening when you can go home stinky it doesn't matter so much, but in the morning right before work showering is a must. Luckily I can keep the workouts I love at Arrichion and use other options closer to work to take care of the shower. :)\n#arrichionstrong
