Casino Only Review: \n1: The place smells like someone dumped 50 gallons of Febreze right inside the front door. It's like ok people, you overdid the scent stuff, back it off a bit. It almost burns the nose it's so strong. \n2: Want a players card? Cool your heels, service is friendly but slow. \n3: Slots: Blah, boring, and the casino floor even on a Saturday is maybe a notch above what you would find at a Dotty's in some far flung strip mall with a group of seniors who are 2 hours past their last cup of coffee. No energy. Snooze-ville.\n4: Cash Out machines. I finally found it, all the way back by the cashier's cage. Seriously, we can't buy a few more machines to make it easier to cash out like your competition across the street does?\n5: One bright spot, they have one of the coolest dang Megabucks machines I've ever seen. I couldn't resist it, and while I didn't win, I sure liked the damn thing. (If you know how slot machines are made, the tech side of it will get your attention). \n\nOverall: Just NOT impressed. Not even a cool Megabucks machine can save this review from 2 Stars only. Your best bet? Don't step out from under the West end of the Fremont St. canopy as there's nothing to see over there.
