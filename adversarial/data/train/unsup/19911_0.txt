I'm Guyanese, so I know good West Indian food (though I'm slightly biased, as everything is compared to mom's cooking - lol).  This place is FANTASTIC!  The prices are great, and the food is even better.  The people are very friendly, and the restaurant is very clean.\n\nThe doubles are delicious and only $1.50 each.  My boyfriend, who has a bottomless stomach, ordered 4 and was stuffed.  Highly recommended!!
