This is a GREAT place. It's quiet, the waiters are polite, the food is great, and the water is fresh. FRESH!!!!!! The bread is warm and the butter has \"Picasso\" written on it. \n\nYou can go outdoors and watch the water show. Plus, you can feed the ducks the bread. My cousin can communicate with the ducks. She figured out that if you clap your hands, the ducks will come to you.\n\nI would recommend ordering from the right side of the menu. First, they give you a Pheasant Croquette and a drinkable cold Potato Vichyssoise. \n\nI got the white asparagus, and the quail salad. They're both very grand. For an entr√©e, I got the veal. And for dessert, i got the Trio of Meyer Lemon, Vanilla, and Rasberry.This place is actually expensive, so I split my din din with my bro. One meal is $115! But if you get the special, that's another $40.\n\nNow, if you're a fan of soups, my mommy got a pea soup. It was delicious. Also, here's a joke from ICarly. What's the difference between Roast Beef and Pea Soup? Anyone can \"roast Beef\", but nobody can \"pee Soup\"! Ha ha.\n\nThe waiters put the napkins on your laps once you sit down, and the bathroom is so fancy!\n\nBut now, the bad part is that Picasso has a dress code. They say Business Casual, when my mom called. She spoke with a man, who said that children could go in with shorts and a collared shirt. But when we went there, three waitresses said we had to have long black pants or jeans. We had to wait 10 minutes, while one of the waitresses got me and my bro black pants. She said we could put them over our normal pants, and also said that they might be too big, but when I put them on, they actually fit pretty well. I tucked my shirt in, which is optional, and I looked like a clown!!!! That was pretty ridiculous, and also they forgot my dessert, so we had to wait an extra 10 minutes at the end of dinner. So, yeah, it was pretty ridiculous at some times, and I was pretty ticked off. But otherwise, it was good.
