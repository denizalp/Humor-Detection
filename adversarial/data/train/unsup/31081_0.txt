Went into the store today  and Zac , Jayne, and the manager Lilly were very helpful in selecting and fitting sunglasses that I wanted too purchase. They really want too help you and make sure your happy with your purchase.\nLilly gave me discounts and a back pack since I purchased three ( 3) pair of sun  glasses! \nLilly, Jayne, and  Zac rock!
