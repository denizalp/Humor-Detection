The Mac and Cheese at this place is to die for!!!!! I mean I literally wish I could break in and steal the recipe it's that good! Now why not a higher rating you say?! Because the staff both times I've been to this place seem out of sorts, it doesn't run smoothly down the chipotle inspired set up line, and my server was a rude young man and attitude young lady to check out BOTH seemingly irritated by my simple questions my very first time experiencing the place, I initially chalked it up to a rough day for them the first time, but upon my return the young lady still had the same attitude. Nonetheless, the food makes up for the poor customer service and again the MAC and CHEESE makes this place a must try on that alone
