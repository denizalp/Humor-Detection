Love the concept of this dessert place! The people who work here are so nice and would be able to answer and questions or give any recommendations as well. The aesthetic is so nice, great for all my instagram foodies out there! My personal favorite is the strawberry cheesecake dipped in white chocolate. YUM! Their milk teas are pretty good as well. I've heard great things about all their drinks and desserts!
