I formerly lived at 922 Place on Rural and Apache and it was absolutely dreadful. \n\nSince moving to University Pointe I've experienced nothing but excellent service, quality living quarters as well as the friendliest neighbors. \n\nAll maintenance requests are attende to promptly. \nWater is always hot or cold. \nAir Conditioning is top notch which is imperative  for this Sun Devil.
