Very nice lobby...almost fancy...loved it when i walked in...\n\nAm not overly in love with the room, water from the bath tub is running (leaky faucet) not the best quality bed linens for a brand name hotel...I am a hilton guy...just tried Sheraton for once because hilton next door was way too expensive for this travel.\n\nNothing to complain when you see Toronto from the top floors...:)\n\nAccessible public parking across the street...\n\nNo WiFi in the rooms...Lobby WiFi is free
