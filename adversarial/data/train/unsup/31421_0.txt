Came for breakfast this morning and it was amazing!! They have a little breakfast menu but the plates are super satisfying! I got the French toast!! My boyfriend got the same and we totally could've shared. Our friend got the egg plate and it came with a good amount of food and protein!!!! Would definitely come back here again!!
