Oh Bellagio! \n\nI have been wanting to try this buffet for the longest time. Ever since I started coming to vegas a few years back, I kept hearing about how good this place was. Well for brunch this past weekend, I must say I was just a tad bit disappointed.\n\nFor $29.99 the price was pretty decent for a vegas buffet.. however, with that said, what you got was pretty mediocre.\n\nThey had all the standard breakfast foods, sausages, bacon, eggs, waffles etc, but nothing fancy smancy. Like Jon B. said in his review, the food was just really average nothing more, nothing less.\n\nWith the price, you get an average selection of breakfast food, some dim sum selections, prime rib, cocktail shrimp,  smoked ham and turkey, pastries, etc. There was a small sushi area with hand rolled spicy salmon which was probably the gem of the buffet. Otherwise, everything was just a bit forgettable in my opinion. \n\n\nDefinitely not the best buffet in vegas, but not the worst either.
