You people cannot all be serious....\n\nAfter being lured in by the clean signage (which looks remarkably similar to gamestop... in fact this is originally how we found out about this place...) the simple menu, and a decent smell I must admit I am completely dissapointed.\n\nCourt ordered a 1\/3 while I splurged for the 1\/2 pound burger, we mixed it up with sweet potato fires, and onion strings what we found was the following.\n\nEvery person who eats here must be;\n\nFat and used to having to dig around the grease pool our burgers were swimming in.\nStupid by being conned into paying $25 dollars (we shared a drink) for $5 worth of burger materials and $2 worth of the measliest portion of fries possible....\n\nMy 1\/2 pound burger was flat as a pancake and had literally 2 inches of meat in a ring around the bun.....slothered with a sickening sweet BBQ sauce, cheese and a single onion string, it had completley (I mean literally) soaked both sides of the bun with grease to the point where I removed the bun and squeezed it our as you might ring out a towel.....gross.  The onion strings were okay for pre bought stuff, you can get the same thing at chilis except they charge $1 less and actually strain them before serving.\n\nCourts burger at least fit the bun (points for that) but was salty as anything which suggests they are keeping the meat way longer than they should......same issues with the grease.....literally I feel acne growing on my face just thinking about it....\n\nThe sweet potato fries were uninspired and greasy again, I have never had a bad sweet potato fry until yesterday......I guess it had to happen sooner or later.\n\nI must admit after eating at literally hundreds of burger joints this is by far the worst which is sad because there is major potential\n\nWe got about halfway through our meal before we couldn't stomach it anymore....I have a stomach of iron....and felt sick all day after eating just 1\/4 of a burger and a few onion strings and fries.....\n\nMain Complaints;\n\nGrease and Ingredients\nMeasly portions of sides (for $3 a side I would expect more....)\nSmallest Drinks I have ever seen ($3 for a 'Large' for what McDonalds calls a small.... come on people)\n\nLong story short if this was my only option I would starve.....best of luck to all you facing this grease burger the only thing I wanted to smash after finishing was my face into a toilet bowl.....
