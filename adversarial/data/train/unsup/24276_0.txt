This review is based on my experience today.  I've noticed this shop when I shop at Lee Lee market which is only a couple of doors away.  I've been meaning to get my dog's anal glands expressed because I've noticed him scooting.   If I were to go to a vet it would have cost me a lot more.  I'm just glad Isabel Grooming's exists.  \n\nI didn't have an appointment, but walked in right when it opened.  There was no one ahead of me.  The place itself is very open and clean.  I noticed several cages on the right side for dogs.  She has a couple of stations in the middle and on the left hand side.  The washing station is behind glass so I couldn't really see how she set it up.\n\nShe was very friendly and personable.  The procedure itself took only a few minutes and my dog looked a lot happier.  I would definitely recommend trying this place for anal gland expression.  I will look into grooming and bathing later on as this was a great experience.  \n\nShe also handed me a dog treat for my dog, which was an added bonus.  I'm glad small businesses like these exist.
