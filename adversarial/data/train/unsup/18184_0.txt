Before Christmas my son and his girl friend came up from Tucson for a visit and to exchange baked goodies.  She had passed on she was in the mood for Chinese.  And being one woman and two men Chinese was of course the only option. :-)  Not knowing what their itinerary was I figured I would choose something in the Tempe area so their drive back would be shorter.  So I plugged that in to Yelp and up came Tott's with a good strong 4 after over 40 reviews.  Located in a shopping center on the Southeast corner of Guadalupe and McClintock it was easy to find.  It shares a building and patio area with Starbucks.\n\nI was intending to pick a place with waiter service for this and did not realize it was fast-casual until too late to change the meeting.  Well fast-casual may be what it is set up for but with the owner(?) running around taking care of things you would think you were getting waited on most of the time.\n\nFirst we shared a sampler platter and then I got Hong Kong stir fry, my son got Pad Thai and his girlfriend got Singapore noodles with shrimp.  He confirmed she wanted a hot dish as she was ordering it and she said she indeed got about as hot as she could stand.  I like the fact none of the dishes were swimming in sauce, so we could taste the individual items, which can happen at many Asian restaurants.  In fact I could have used a touch more and almost used one of the dipping sauces for the last bit of rice.  Much better, in my opinion, to add a little more if needed.  The whole meal came to under $40 including soft drinks and tea.\n\nThere are dozens of Asian restaurants in the valley that also do take out as a large chunk of their business.  For the most part they do a decent job and in my book rate in the 2.8-3.2 range.  This one I give a 3.6 rounded to 4.  The place is very clean.  They are willing to modify dishes.  The service is above average for a fast-casual restaurant.  I am glad my fellow Yelpers led me here.
