A long time favorite that after all these years, still does not disappoint.\n\nMy son and his girlfriend came up from Atlanta over Labor Day and we enjoyed their stay. Ate out several times but on the last night, I wanted someplace that was nice and quite with great food and Mama Mia's in Huntersville came to mind.\n\nBack in the late 90's, we were at a meeting in Atlanta and when we were discussing where to go for dinner, one of our friends pointed out that one of the best Italian restaurant that they had found, was in our back yard. Had lived in Cornelius for about 3 years at this time and this place was only about a mile from where I worked in Huntersville.\n\nNeedless to say, we went as soon as we got back from Atlanta and loved the place. My wife even through a surprise birthday party for me here although I will omit which one it was.\n\nOne of our favorites and it did not disappoint this time either.\n\nMade reservations for 6 pm and because of traffic, were a few minutes late but no problem. The hostess promptly seated us. They have the restaurant broken up with curtains, drapes and other design elements into smaller more intimate spaces that take away from the overall size of the restaurant. It's a house or probably a mansion in it's day, probably built around the turn of the last century in what was then, downtown Huntersville.  Completely restored  and very tastefully decorated in period furniture in warm inviting colors and textures.\n\nWe were seated in a nice alcove with a window view on the gardens and street. Our servers were there promptly and we did not want for service the rest of the evening.\n\nSeveral started out with wine and I must admit, they have a great selections of wines by the glass or the bottle.\n\nA rather large menu with many items to choose from including 5 veal dishes.\n\nMy son's girlfriend chose the Lobster Ravioli while my son had the Veal Scallopini. My wife had the Veal Saltimbocco and I chose a Caprese Salad followed by Veal Parmesan.\n\nA few minutes later, the bread course arrived. Fresh baked bread, straight from the oven with plenty of butter and olive oil for dipping. A good start.\n\nThe Caprese Salad arrived next and it was delicious although I will admit I have never had it served in a bowl. Normally presented on a plate with tomato and mozzarella alternating garnished with balsamic and basil. Still good and a good quality mozzarella.\n\nDinner and the table fell silent as everyone proceeded to enjoy their dinner.\n\nFlavor, texture, presentation, atmosphere, service etc all worked together to make for a memorable dinner.\n\nGoing to have to make a note to self.  Dine here more often.
