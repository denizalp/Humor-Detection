I swear I had already written a review of this place....\n\nIll never go back here.\n\nI bought a deal for them off of Living Social. The shop was empty when I walked in and the girl didnt even acknowledge me. A few more people trickled in while I was checking out their inventory, which was ledd than impressive.\n\nWhen it came time to try things on, they only had one dressing room available. The older girl who works there was using the other one as an office.\n\nPicked my item, and wanted to get out of there. The counter girl told everyone in line at some point during their visit about the sales, and was very cordial to all of them. I dont know if she didnt appreciate the work uniform I was wearing or what, but when she got to me she was less than friendly. Even less when I gave her my LS voucher.\n\nHer: \"Uh this cant be used on this, it's 30% off. It cant be used on sale items. Read it.\" *gives it back to me*\n Me: \"Is there anything that isnt on sale?\"\n\"No. Everything in the store is 30% off.\"\n\"Well you didnt tell me any of the specials at any point.\"\n\"Oh. Well you cant use this today. There are certain days you can use it.\"\n\"There were no date restrictions other than the expiration date on the deal. Read it.\"\n\"Well I guess I can pretend its full price.\"\n\"You do that.\"\n\nNever again.
