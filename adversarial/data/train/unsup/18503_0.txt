Some restaurants offer home-style cooking.  Nemo Grille offers home-style seating - it's literally a retooled home, with small rooms where it's not hard to imagine the place where a couch and television used to be.  It's like they evicted a family just for your comfort, giving you the lovely air of being a rich landlord dining with your table legs resting upon the bones of starving poor people. \n\n....Seriously, though, it's like being invited into someone's home to eat.  I like the intimacy of small rooms.  The only problem with a setup like this is that if the table next to you is loud, as they were here, it's like having six people yelling at each other in a cramped room - there's no escape.  \n\nThat said, eating in someone's house isn't a thrill - the dining is.  And Nemo, fortunately, delivers.  \n\nI must confess that any restaurant gets an automatic +1 star on my rating if they do bread right - and Nemo has the best bread in the area.  Most places have bread that is: \n\na)  Hot,\nb)  Possessed of a great crust; \nc)  Possessed of a moist interior.\n\nYou get your choice of a, b, or c, so you can have hot average bread, or cold bread with a great crust and a doughy, tasteless interior, or a great fluffy inside with meh crust served cold.\n\nNemo combines the three with just a hint of garlic butter for a bread orgasm, shooting them up to five stars.  Then the guys at the table next to me started yammering on about something that required 120 decibels to discuss properly, bringing it down to four stars again.  \n\nFor an appetizer, we had a flatbread pizza that was thoroughly okay - not a patch on what you can get at Three Birds, but perfectly serviceable.  The other was a seared tuna, which I do not care for, but the girls at the table rolled back their heads in orgasmic delight.  \n\nMy meal was an upscale macaroni cheese and bacon dish that was phenomenal; the pasta DEFINED the term \"al dente,\" and the cheese was cheesy without being overwhelming.  The only ding was that there wasn't enough bacon - but frankly, given that they could have hauled a wheelbarrow full of bacon up to the table and I still would have wanted more bacon, so it's hard to fault them for this.  \n\nMy wife had the scallops.  She always says, \"No, I'm going to look at the menu,\" but it's a bald lie; if there are scallops, she is getting them.  And she gave these scallops a high thumbs-up.  \n\nIn short, Nemo's right on the bubble; one more good meal there and it could jump to five stars.  As it is, the loudness of the place and the fact that the appetizers were above-average but not excellent makes me give it four stars... for now.\n\nBut like a culinary Terminator, I WILL be back.
