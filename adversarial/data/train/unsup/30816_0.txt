I have actually been to Pastels on several occasions. I love crepes so I come here a lot, Pastels was where I tried a salty crepe for the first time. I knew they existed but never really tried them.\nI had the spinach and sun dried tomato crepe it was good but I think I will stay with my sweet crepes which are so much better. \n\nI like the atmosphere mainly because I know the people by first name now. They are very friendly and always have what I like ready to serve. I have sat in Pastels for hours with some friends and had a great time. \n\n#30daysofYelp
