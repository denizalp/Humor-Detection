This was an interesting place. I went around Noon on a Thursday; the place was 75% full, primarily with the hipster type. Folks appeared to be 18-25 years old...lots of Apple products. The staff was helpful for a newcomer. It was someone's birthday (maybe JPH's itself), so PBRs were on sale for only a couple bucks. It was very difficult to resist this temptation.\n\nA couple of friends met here for a meeting; one of our friends is a sincere regular, so she guided us. I ordered the Roast Beef Sandwich for $7; this was a particular treat for me considering I don't eat meat too often, and certainly not beef...on a sandwich. The beef, cheese, and caramelized onions were great, very melty. There was a sauce (sriracha involved?) that added some punch. I did not opt for any side dish but in addition to the regular chips, they offered greens or potatoes ($2.5). The menu is definitely breakfast or brunch focused.\n\nJPH's coffee is very good, there is not usually a line and if staff are cooking they know to prioritize a to-go cup of joe before a group of six dining in with sandwiches. The finishes in this cafe are appreciated. It is self serve, so one must get their own silverware, napkins, water then bus the table afterwards, which is fine if you actually know it's a thing. Parking on side streets is totally do-able. I will be back for coffee at least; this location and EVP serve this particular community well.
