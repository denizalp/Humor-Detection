Really bad experience,  management is very unethical.  We bought a car there under the pretense that it was equipped with a key fob  system,  they even gave two key fobs. They never worked so we figured they just needed to be reprogrammed so we took them and the car to the dealer to program them. Turns out the fob receiver had been removed from the vehicle before we bought it. They wouldn't put it back in unless we paid the regular part price and labor,  $199.  Classy.
