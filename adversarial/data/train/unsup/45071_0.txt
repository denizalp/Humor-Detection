So random and delicious!! We got and shared a beef bahn mi and a grilled pork and spring roll vermicell and a coke. The bahn mi was not the most authentic that I've ever had but it was still delicious! The service was good and quick. The woman (possibly the owner) was lovely. When I paid for my $18.65 tab with $60.65 (I needed 2 $20 bills) she gave me back $42. I thought it was wrong but didn't think again. I walked over to sbux to get a coffee and when I sat down on the patio, she ran over to return my $5. So honest!
