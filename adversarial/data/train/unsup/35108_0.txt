They are not about serving their patients.\n\nI have been going to the 4C Medical group for quite a while now.  I saw my doctor less than 2 weeks ago and have now had an allergic reaction to the medication.  I called to get an alternative medication and have been informed that my provider has left the group and I would need to see another doctor to get the script.  I informed them I am out of the state and could come in next week.  I have been informed that they cannot help me and I would have to go to an ER or urgent care.  The purpose of going to a group practice is so that this situation does not happen.  I will betaking my health to another practice that actually understands the concept of covering provider and isn't just seeking another copay charge.
