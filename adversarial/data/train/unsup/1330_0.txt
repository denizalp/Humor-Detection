Dutch Bros is the BUSINESS! Always delicious coffee and quick service. Also, it's awesome that the Baristas actually know how to engage you in conversation (not forced or fake) and put a smile on your face! \n\nMake sure you get a stamp card for Two-Punch Tuesdays. \n\nFavorites: \n\n- ER 911 \n- POTENT Iced Coffee\n- The Kicker \n\nYou gotta love how insanely efficient this location is. After I dropped my boss off at the airport this morning, I decided it was time to get caffeine fix #2 of the day. \n\nThere was quite the line, so someone came out and took orders from everyone in line. Pulled up to the window, paid for my drinks, and was on my merry way to the office. \n\nCan you beat \/ do that, Starbucks? Didn't think so. ;)
