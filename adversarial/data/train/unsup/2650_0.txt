My favorite Target!\n\nI don't know why it took me so long to review this location. It's clean, has a garage, a produce & freezer food section and even has a Starbucks and Pizza Hut. The staff is always friendly. Every time I go looking for something that's on sale in their weekly flyer they have it in stock.\n\nIf you have little ones they will love the escalator for the shopping carts that meet you once you've reach the shopping floor and meet you again when it's time to leave. So cool.\n\nThis location seems to have a better selection of products then the other Target's in the Pittsburgh area. It has a slight upgraded fill to it. Maybe this location is a Tarzae and all of the other locations are just Targets.\n\nThis Target is just what East Liberty needed not to mention all of the much needed jobs!
