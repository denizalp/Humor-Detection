This is one of my favorite hotel in Las Vegas. I have never been in Italy but I dream about it... I really do!!! Maybe that is a reason why I absolutely fall in love in decor of this hotel.\nRooms are impressive. Prefer to stay on 33-34 floors. Amazing view. Good swiping pool.\nRecommend by Mouse for one-two nights in Vegas ;)
