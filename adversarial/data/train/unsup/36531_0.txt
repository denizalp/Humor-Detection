I've been going to this shop for several years now and the haircuts are always on point! My guy is Andy. But I do have to say that when he isn't available I've had Luke or Jake cut my hair and they are just as talented. Plus they (Luke and Jake) take appointments, if your one of those guys that can't wait around. I've read some reviews and have always had the opinion that if you come out of a shop with a cut your not happy with, you at least have to give the other barbers a try. There are plenty capable barbers to choose from!
