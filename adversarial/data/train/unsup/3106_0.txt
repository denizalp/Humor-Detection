I go to chipotle like once a week! This place is crazy busy. It's a Monday at 12:20 in the afternoon. Parking is a challenge for sure! \n\nThere are 5 people behind the counter and 3 people are helping each person at a time! It takes forever to get your order here!! The location is right off the strip and it's in the outlet mall area. \n\nThe location is clean for the most part, but they have NO ONE managing the sitting area that could use a little help.  Glass is clean and floors are clean. \n\nI would come again... or just head down the street to one that is a bit more organized.
