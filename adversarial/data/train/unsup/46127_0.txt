Moved in to the neighborhood recently,  so we have been looking for a new sushi location for the family.  This was our first attempt at finding a new sushi restaurant.  I must say I was expecting better from the reviews i read.  I have had much better at the same price point.   \n\nMy son seemed to enjoy all the fried goodies.  Tempura and calamari was good!  The miso soup seemed to be watered down.   Some of the sashimi which should be serve cold was room temp. The fish on the sushi was cut thin with lots of rice.  \n\nIn the end it took me a while to receive my bill for which there were only 2 other patrons, so the restaurant was not busy at all.  \n\nSide note, I did notice many people getting take out.
