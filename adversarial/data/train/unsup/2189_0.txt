Now we are kinda new to the whole swing lifestyle but not to being watched. We moved here to Vegas about two years ago and started looking for a place to play and call home and The Studios certainly fit the bill. They even have a dungeon themed area. Yea!\nIt is a fantasy funland and great times that can be had for those who really enjoy being an exhibitionist or voyeurs. Every time ready to play and we are never disappointed. With so many themed rooms to choose from it's mind boggling.\nJoyce who owns The Studios and all the staff who work there are always friendly and eager to give tours and tell you the rules.\nVery inviting atmosphere both in the open lounge area where you can meet and mingle with some great folks.\nIt is a very LBGT friendly and cater to  individual tastes on certain evenings during the week allowing for anyone's individual freak flag to fly.\nWe've brought as many as 6 friends along with us and they all agree that The Studios is one definite place to come and enjoy oneself.\nNot at all dirty or out of date as some of the other places we've visited here in Vegas in the past.\nYou need to go to the website to find just the right event for you.\nAnd if you're lucky enough you just might find us there playing!
