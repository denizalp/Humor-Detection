Was really surprised by the food. It was way above average bar food. I got their special burger with beer cheese, crispy bacon and grilled onions. They also have like 5 different kinds of fries I tried 2 and they were really good. Give this place a try for good drinks and better food. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because service was slow
