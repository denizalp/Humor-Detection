I'm on the fence about this place, more leaning towards good, but they do have few things that need to be improved.  I stayed here last weekend with my husband...\n\nThe good:\n-No casino, not a fan of the big casino hotels and all the hoopla you have to go through to get to your room.\n-Nice pool area & really lovely property...I love how it felt like a Palm Springs Hotel, similar to the Ace hotel, just smaller and less hipster.\n-Cute decor and good sized rooms.\n-Very nice staff.\n-Great prices\n\nThe not so good:\n-SMOKY room...maybe I didn't specify a non-smoking room so I will take half blame for this, but my God, I felt like I needed to go to the hospital for some oxygen treatments after 2 nights in our room.  It smelled terrible and burned my eyes.\n-Slow staff...We were running late to a wedding and needed an iron.  We never received it.  They should probably spend a couple hundred bucks and get some irons in the rooms.\n-The refundable charge they put on your card for \"incidentals\".  In this recession, it's really hard on some people to have a more than $100 charge on your card for a few days.  I understand the concept behind it, but I just feel it's wrong to assume I'm going to destroy the room and charge me before it's even happened.\n\nAll in all, I have already recommended this place to a couple of friends with caution to the issues I had.  Honestly, if the room wasn't so smoky I probably wouldn't have even minded the other things.  I know this is Vegas and it's smoky everywhere, but it's also 2011 and not everyone is smoking anymore..The room could've been better ventilated.
