Cute place, but food was so, so. I got the Pacific Rim chicken salad. It looked yummy, bit the chicken was tough. Also, the dressing was a ginger peanut soy sauce mix, and was REALLY HOT!!\nThe red beer was very good, though!!!\nOverall, beer good, food blah!\nAlso, took staff forever to clean up a big group table after people were gone.  Had to look at the mess for at least a half hour. Hum? Wonder were the manager was hanging out to not notice!! Think a new manager is needed!!!
