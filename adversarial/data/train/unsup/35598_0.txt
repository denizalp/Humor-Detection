Standard issue small Sbux: good service, standard quality of beverages and food.\n\nIt's a little tight to get around, but there's plenty of seating for the location and some patio seating - people seem to take advantage of that, even in summer.  There aren't a ton of outlets but I did get one when I came in to do some work on a Tuesday morning.  Due to the size, it's quite loud at half capacity. As another reviewer mentioned, it only has one bathroom, but that seems appropriate for the size of the store.\n\nOverall, a decent place to work or meet up, provided you don't mind a little ambient noise.  Now serving some Teavanna iced teas (although, inexplicably, they all seem to have calories).
