We were gonna leave after shopping at the mall, when we saw that outside was pouring. So we decided to get a drink at Aroma and wait for the rain to die down. \n\nI immediately picked the Iced Hazelnut Latte because I really like the flavour of hazelnut. And this latte from Aroma did not disappoint! The drink was so good and definitely restored my energy from walking for 2 hours!\n\nTried my friends's Iced chocolate and Matcha latte as well. The Iced chocolate was so comforting because it was just super chocolate-y!! The Matcha Latte on the other hand was not bad, but we all feel that the matcha flavour could be a bit stronger. Maybe we are just used to the strong bitter flavour of matcha in Japanese dessert and drinks\n\nWe were going to get some baked goods as well but we saw a bug flying around inside that enclosed glass case..so no we didn't end up getting any food from there. \n\nOverall a pretty nice place to hang out with friends, the seats are comfortable and there are lots of natural lights from the large windows. Would def go back to Aroma for the Hazelnut latte!
