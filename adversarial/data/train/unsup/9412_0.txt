Calgary has been getting a bad rep in the US media because of the XXLL Keystone pipeline; I suggest instead of transporting Oil Sand in those pipes, they transport crab legs from Bookers. We took my brother to Bookers for his birthday. The location is made for Yelpers; in downtown Calgary right across the street from a homeless shelter in a nondescript building. SHAZAM.. you can accumulate street cred for braving the rough streets to get good food. The door transports visitors to a different realm : plush seats, Flat-screen TV wallpaper, clientele wearing their Easter clothes. We did not reserve and had to wait at the bar for a minute, but it was worth it. After we snagged a table, there was no stopping the buckets of crab legs and ribs . I am talking juicy, succulent, ginormous crab legs, tender well-seasoned ribs. I did not know this day would come, Food 1-Jay 0.\nthrow in polite hipster waitstaff and its definitely worth the $39,99 All-you-can eat.
