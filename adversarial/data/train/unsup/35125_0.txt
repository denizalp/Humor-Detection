I have gone to several medi spa's around the valley, and yes even though some might be a few dollars less than Willo..I wouldn't go any where else.\nDr. Nello takes his time marking the areas that need treatment and taking the time to explain exactly where & what he's doing. \nI have now been a loyal client  of Willo Medi Spa for about 3 years, and wouldn't even think about going else where! \nI'm very happy with my lip injections and results of my botox!
