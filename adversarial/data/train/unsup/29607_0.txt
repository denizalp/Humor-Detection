This outlet used to be one of my favorite places to stop and buy clothes for my husband and son. The prices were fantastic and I truly do love their firehose line of clothing. The clothes for sale are returns, previously worn, or may be defective in some way, but still serviceable. We stopped in today and were very disappointed, for $20 more I can buy brand new and get a lifetime warranty. The deals are gone! We'll no longer drive the 2 hours to shop here.
