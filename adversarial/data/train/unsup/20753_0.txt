I was at this Tony Romas on Nov 21, 2011 for there 12.99 Steak n lobster with family and three of us order the same special!! But i guess you get for what you pay!! My steak and  was so bad that it was full of fat hard to chew was so disappointed that even my sisters and my boyfriends was just as bad!! My sister mentioned to the server after he came to our table and asked us how everything was and as soon as my sister mentioned the steak was rubbery and he just ignored us and just walked away!! I will say that he also took a long time to bring us our check let alone never came back to collect the check after he dropped it off!!  I was so disappointed that I should have walked away without paying because no one seem to notice but of course I'm not a person to do that so I had to find someone to take my money so i went straight to there greeter!!   The one thing I will say is I did not leave a tip to our server!! This place already charged me enough for a rubbery full of fat no meat steak that the service did not deserve a tip!!! I will never come to any of the Tony Roma's since they are over priced anyways!!!   so don't waste your money on the Special!!!
