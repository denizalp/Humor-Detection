The atmosphere is chill and low key.  The selection of arcade games was nice but my husband and I enjoyed playing some card games.  It was really neat that total strangers would walk around and jump into board games and card games with each other.  \nWhile playing our card games we enjoyed some pizzas.  We got the Buffalo style pizza and the Smoked BBQ pizza,  both tasted great and would go well with any drink from the bar.  My husband was thrilled that they carried one of his favorite single malt whiskeys,  lagavulin!  The staff was friendly and made sure to keep our waters full and tend to our needs.
