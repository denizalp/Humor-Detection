I've been here twice now and each time was very pleased with the service and the food. To date I've tried the San Andreas enchiladas and glazed tilapia and was very happy with both items and they were only 4.95 each!!! Best value for food in the area in my opinion. They also have a live dj on weekends spinning mostly old school hip hop and rock. I would come back.
