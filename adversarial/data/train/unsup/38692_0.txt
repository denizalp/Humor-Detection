Stopped in expecting desserts but ended up just getting a matcha cheese foam tea. Very good and refreshing! Not too sweet, but the foam adds just the right hint of sweetness and thickness to the matcha tea. Only seems to be one person working but the store was pretty empty so service was quick. Cute store, just not too many dessert options. Maybe cause we were here at around 6?
