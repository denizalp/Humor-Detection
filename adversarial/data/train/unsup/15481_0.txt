This place is like a garage sale ran by Uncle Scroogle. Junk at high prices. Items are often more than retail even though they are noticeably used. I often like to look at the electronics to chuckle at the prices.\n\nTwo of the same item, one in a box that is obviously not the item is double the price. Wow that's expensive for a Playststion that obviously doesn't work.  Multiple dollars for cheap glassware from McDonalds. Stupid. Maybe the clothes rack has a deal or two, but avoid everything else.
