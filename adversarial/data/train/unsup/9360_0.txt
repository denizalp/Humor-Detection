So I'd never heard of this place but my friend from Houston decided that we should have a girls night out and this was her chosen dinner venue.  When we went it had only been open a week but I'm a little behind on the review writing because I've had many similar girls nights since then.\n\nYou know the type of night I'm talking about....where you start at the National down the street for post-work drinks and probably have a few too many before you continue on to your dinner reservation where you have a bit more wine before leaving for more booze down the street.  You know the type of night I'm talking about RIGHT?\n\nAnyways, on to Briggs.  Would you believe we arrived a tad boozy?  \n\nThe server was new but did a great job helping us pick out a some wine.  The rest of the girls ordered some appy's before their mains but I was trying to be healthy so I stuck with a salad and copious amounts of booze.  Soooooo responsible right?  Vegetables absorb alcohol like nobody's business.\n\nLong story short, we had a great time, the food was tasty, and the server was cute and competent.  Winning all around!\n\nBottom line - boozy or not, give them a try.
