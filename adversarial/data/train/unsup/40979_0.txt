Still waiting w\/my mother in law, racing heart & trouble breathing, but no chest pain. They randomly take patients,  1st person to get here @ 8am still hasn't been seen (9:30 now).  I heard the front desk lady say they don't take you in the order you come in,  it's the order they do your paperwork.  Say what?  Some lady who walked in w\/a cold went right in.  This isn't a dire emergency,  but I would think a patient w\/a racing heart would be seen BEFORE  someone w\/a stuffy nose.  ----Update after 2hrs finally got in.  The PA, Alexandra Leguire, was awesome. Would give her 5 stars. Very nice, professional, & thorough. If you must go to this urgent care hopefully you can see her. Rest of this place,  disorganized.
