We were excited to visit the Bellagio during this Las Vegas vacation.  Im sad to say it will be our last.  \n\nUpon arrival, we were shocked  the checkin line was winding through 4 roped off lines all the way to the  lobby exit door.  It took an hour to check-in.  Why they weren't better staffed was puzzling.\n\nThe room was of decent size but was dusty in areas, shower had loose molding, wallpaper is pulling from the wall, there were spots on the bathroom floor and tub area that were never cleaned and the bedspread smelled of urine.  All items I would not expect from a \"luxury\" hotel.  I asked housekeeping to remove the bedspread and bring a new one, but it wasn't replaced  until the day before our departure.  The A\\C rattled and we called engineering to repair.  A nice gentleman did come and repair it, but he stood there and talked (we had just arrived) until we tipped him and he left. \n\nWe immediately took note of the expense of the In-room snacks and beverages in the refrigerator and decided to avoid that at all costs (pun intended).   There is also no coffee maker in the room.  So, we taxied to a market and purchased some milk, water, wine and snacks to enjoy in the room.  (A bag of chips in their ice and concession area is $5 and a beverage is $7).   We did not carefully read signage and removed a couple of sodas and beer from the refrigerator in our room to keep our items cool.  We had a knock on our door two days later from an employee who informed us we were being charged $50\/day to use their equipment.  I was shocked and said by all means I would remove my items so they could put the items we removed back back so we wouldn't be charged.  She put those EXACT items back in that we removed.  Worried about the charges, we called the manager who said we had actually been charged $50\/each day AND $468 for the contents of the entire fridge.  He said it was a health code violation to put items back.  I expressed outrage and said a) not everything was removed and B) the exact same items were put back in so how could we be charged for all of it?  He then he agreed to remove  the charges \"as a courtesy\".  Perhaps as a courtesy they should make things affordable, provide a coffee\nmaker  in the room and provide a refrigerator you can actually use?  The evening before check out we were settling our bill and noticed another $50 charge.  Called and at first we were told it was a \"perishable\" fee charge then by a different person a \"restocking\" fee.  The manager refused to honor what we were originally told that it be removed and would not credit it off.  \n\nThe entire experience we felt so nickel and dimed, disappointed by the lack of customer service and it just wasn't worth it for 4 nights.  There are too many other options on the strip to be treated this way.  We will not be returning.
