Today is the 50% off everything menu!! Until 6pm. This is the time to try multiple items without regrets! And yes I did try several items. \n\nKitchen Sink Salad: Quinoa, beets, spring greens, carrots, jicama, cucumber, feta, golden raisins, balsamic vinaigrette and roasted bagel chips to tie it all together. Impeccably fresh and healthy! $8.25. Add chicken for $2\n\nProtein burger House Style: house made quinoa and black bean burger with sliced portobello, creamy cucumber sauce, tomatoes and feta and pesto sauce to mesh the flavors together in between the toasted artisan bread. Optional to go Naked (no bread) on a bed of spring mix and balsamic dressing.  $9\n\nSignature Tuna Sandwich: served hot or cold. Albacore Tuna mixed with their signature sauce, white melted cheddar, onions, celery, tomato, cucumber, dull on a multi- grain bread. Mmmmm for a cold windy day! $7.75\n\nCroissant sandwich: a warm breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon tomato and pesto drizzle $6\n\nDirty Chai: comes in a choice of 12oz, 16oz or 20oz for $3.50\/$4\/$4.50 respectively. And of course went for the 20oz. I added soy milk. \n\nBreakfast Buzz Shake: the best 32oz shake and their signature shake. Whey protein, espresso shots, peanut butter, nonfat milk, banana chocolate syrup, and other vitamins. $6. We ordered 5 of these. A couple to drink and the rest to give to friends! Yummmmm. They have the punch  card to get a free one after all 10 purchases are complete. \n\nTheir drive thru was just as long as a busy Starbucks line. Definitely worth  the wait. Until next time!
