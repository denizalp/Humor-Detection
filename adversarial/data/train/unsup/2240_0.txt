We first heard about Nick's at a small bridal show at Scottsdale Stadium a while back and were shocked at what they do! Guys, you can get a brand new, custom suit for the same price as a rental. They literally have every color of the rainbow and can customize anything that you want for your special day. The best part, the $210 price tag includes the suit, shirt, vest, and tie! \n\nFast forward a few months and we finally had the time to go into their store and check it out. We were SOLD the second we walked in! The suits do not feel cheap {which was a concern of mine} and the service was absolutely amazing. We were in and out of the store in under an hour with everything chosen and paid for. We were lucky that the owner just happened to be in the day that we came, so he made sure that we were totally taken care of. We picked out a classic black suit, white shirt, black vest, and a bowtie for my groom + skinny ties for the groomsmen. They also have additional accessories like fun socks, tie clips, flower pins, etc. \n\nAll in all, if you're getting married soon, Nick's is a no-brainer for the groomsmen! Not only do they get to keep their suit, but it will be custom and a perfect fit {unlike rentals}. We can't wait to see it all come together on the big day! Thank you for the amazing service!
