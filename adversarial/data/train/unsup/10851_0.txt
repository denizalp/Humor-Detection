Paradise Bakery you are not.  I'm sorry, you're just not a paradise to me.  And I hold bakeries near and dear, believe me.\n\nYou are a common bakery - I'm not sure how many states you are in but you are common.  Maybe that's your problem.  Your locations are fine.  Nice enough.  You have free wifi.  Good.  But your muffins?  They just don't do it for me.  They fall short of similar establishments offerings in the valley and in other areas.  Go to Wildflower Bread and get yourself a Morning Glory muffin.  This is what young muffins dream of becoming when they grow up.  \n\nAnd your cookies.  They are so prefab tasting.  My wife had an oatmeal raisin cookie and offered me a bite.  She broke off a good size piece and I tried it.  It was doughy.  And there were no raisins.  And I had to look to find a flake of oatmeal.  But they were sugary in that prefab, gritty, not very good sort of way.  An oatmeal raisin cookie should taste like...oatmeal.  And raisins.  And perhaps a hint of nutmeg and cinnamon, not gritty sugariness and doughiness.  Blech.
