I like the ambiance and feel of Grassroots - however, the cook has a bit of an attitude. \nWhen I explained this was the second time I had come in and they were out of what I  wanted to order he said because everything is fresh. Ok-I can appreciate and love that! However, I was asking for a baked potato. How can you be out of baked potatoes? That seems pretty standard. He then went on to say they are doing pretty well.....what?? How about just apologizing for not being able to accommodate your customer. Lose the attitude.  Food is par - I would recommend this place for drinks only.
