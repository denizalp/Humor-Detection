I must say I was so excited to find a hand car wash that reminded me of home (Chicago) that had a team that take their time and get to the nitty gritty with cleaning the vehicle. The first trip here was AMAZING & the car was flawless. I'm all about consistency so we came back and this time not so much as the manager who was onsite the first time we came was no longer onsite and there was another manager and the staff looked different. \nWe found several inconsistencies in the cleaning of the car and pointed them out and the staff tried quickly to resolve our issues which is why they still get the stars because they are open to constructive criticism. HOWEVER, they are ABSOLUTELY better than any AUTOBELL those places SUCK & cost to much for NOTHING.\nThis is our Go To Carwash for now as it's the BEST so far.
