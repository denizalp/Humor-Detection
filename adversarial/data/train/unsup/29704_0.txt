Pretty great zoo with free admission AND PARKING, which is awesome. Having volunteered at this zoo for years when I was a vet tech at the vet school (now I'm a nurse in a hospital), I know how hard this zoo works at community outreach and education. I love that they are keeping up with the times and working to provide enriching environments -- the giraffe enclosure was great, and I was happy to see the old monkey house is gone. The old lady and I enjoyed a lovely picnic lunch in the shade on a recent hot and sweaty day, copying the snoozing tapir we saw in a shady corner. \n\nMy only observation and request is that they improve their accessibility, because it took us a long time to find a spot at a picnic table that we could wheel up to with the old lady's wheelchair (we struggled over some unpaved ground without too much difficulty). The bathroom (next to the pretty decent giftshop) could use some accessible updating as well. Even with me navigating, we had to rely on the kindness of strangers holding doors. \n\nTip: Don't forget to check the back entrance if you can't find handicapped parking by the main entrance.\n\nStill my favorite zoo:)
