Update : Changed from 1 to 5 star. Travis and company went above and beyond to rectify the situation to my satisfaction.  This speaks volumes in a world where customer service is severely lacking. Travis called me the same day and Gomez was out the next morning to complete the job. I can honestly say I would use this company again and recommend them to everyone. \n\n\nSo very disappointed.  Tuesday before Christmas expecting many guests.....job unfinished by Affordable Flooring. Paid (in my opinion)way too much for one room of carpet ($1000)but thought because of the time issue it would be worth it. Extremely poor communication and as stated job unfinished. Workers said they would be back by 4pm today..no call, no show. Called the office, closed until AFTER  the holiday. Will be disputing charge on my credit card and would NEVER recommend this business.
