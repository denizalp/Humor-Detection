There's closer urgent cares to us, but we prefer to visit this facility. It's a PCH, which makes me feel more confident about the pediatric care than your typical strip mall urgent care.\n\nThe staff is friendly, hours are great and we usually see a doctor within about 15 minutes -- key when you have an irritable sick kid. We usually see Dr. Young, who is knowledgable and takes time to explain why my son is sick and how to get him better. Access to this level of pediatric care is both convenient and reassuring.
