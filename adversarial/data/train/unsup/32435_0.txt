Went through the car wash tonight & yet again there is an issue with the car wash.  How can you wash a car without soap-what a rip off the last 3 out of 4 times there has been an issue with  this bay with the brushes, last time the dryer stopped with 46 minutes to go, prior to that  the clear coat didn't spray anything, the bars went around but nothing came out.  When you pay $10 for a was it should work as advertised.  The worst yet, I went in and told them I went through and it never sprayed soap out.  The cashier said ok and turned and walked away.  no offer to rewash of even discount the next one.  Carwash sucks and so does the service\/staff!!
