I just experienced a comedy of errors. While having lunch here, Gayl B and I watched the employees make at least three errors.\n\nFirstly, our order was botched. The cup of soup became a bowl of soup, and the house salad became a Caesar salad. My beef sandwich looked good but the meat was both as tough as nails and totally flavorless and the honey mustard dressing was almost non-existent. \n\nAt the next table over, both corned beef sandwiches were served with the incorrect side dish.\n\nAs we left we heard another customer saying that his order was wrong.\n\nFortunately, most of these sorts of errors can be fixed. However, first off the employees have to understand what is wrong and then be willing to fix the errors. I did not feel that there was any real desire to learn from the mistakes being made. Customer service needs a lot of work if this restaurant is going to remain competitive.\n\nNot a good dining experience. Even though the bread had great flavor, the rest of the meal was a huge disappointment.
