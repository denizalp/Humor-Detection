I can appreciate a restaurant that offers a full gluten free menu! When we walk in, the cashier was really friendly and had I not stop at my favorite coffee shop beforehand, I would've ordered coffee here. \n\nWe proceeded to order the famous chicken and waffles and the breakfast sandwich. I liked the chicken and waffles - it tasted fresh and the sauce that came with it was perfect! I could've used a little more chicken though as they were a little stingy on the chicken.\n\nThe breakfast sandwich was ok - a little dry and lacked flavor. It could use some avocado and a type of spread. Since I checked in on Yelp, I got a free GF chocolate chip cookie and that was delicious! \n\nOverall, I like the restaurant and I love eating gluten free (when I can) so this place definitely allows me to do just that!
