Super cute place! Servers in pajamas, large booths and umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. I also really like the tile on the walls.\n\nI was there on a Monday morning around 11AM there was no wait. This was my first time here, but my friend had been there quite often because he lives right down the street.\n\nHe had the french toast with 3 eggs and bacon (apparently he's a growing boy - don't know how he ate it all, PLUS a slice of MY bacon!). I had just the standard breakfast with 2 eggs, hash browns and bacon. We both ordered the \"pot of bread,\" and he ordered an extra for himself (I seriously don't know where he put all this food).\n\nEverything was really good, although I am not a big fan of their style of hash browns. The service was fast and friendly and I will definitely be back because I really want to try one of their signature steak dishes.
