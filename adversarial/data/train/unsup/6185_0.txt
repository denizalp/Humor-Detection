I don't really understand the hype. Compared to bottom rung fast food places, Chik-Fil-A is noticeably better. The service here is friendly and quick, but my chicken tenders were ready before I ordered them. The fruit cup is a nice healthy alternative for a side if you are trying to do slightly less damage to yourself by having a meal here. I've tried locations new and old in other areas and have had a very similar experience every time.
