Located inside adjacent to a supermarket, we wandered in aimlessly after Congee Wong in search of pastries. Get 20% off when you pay with cash! How delightful! Compared to the pastries I get at the Chinatown in Chicago, this place is miles\/kms ahead in freshness and taste. I LOVE my pineapple buns and Gloucester serves up the regular kind, red bean filled, plus a darker-chocolate\/coffee? version. I couldn't resist on getting all three and then some. While none can compare to the life-altering warm pineapple buns I got in a Taiwanese night market years ago, this bakery's pineapple buns were still slightly warm and soft. With my bag of fresh pastries for the road, it definitely eased the pain of the long drive back to the states.
