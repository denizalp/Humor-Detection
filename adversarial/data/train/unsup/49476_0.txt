I come here maybe 2 or 3 times a month and let me start by saying this place is amazing! Inside it's very clean and the staff is amiable! Not once have they ever messed up my order. The prices are reasonable and the food tastes delicious! I strongly suggest anyone come here if they want non-expensive, good quality food and service!
