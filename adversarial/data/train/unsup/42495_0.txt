Fresh, authentic food and wonderful service. The owner is very friendly and took great care of us. We ordered the tapas grape leaves, the chicken shawarma, and shish kabob plate. All excellent. Some of the best hummus I've had too, served with warm pita bread.  I highly recommend this place. \n* It's the sister store to Amena's on S Decatur.
