Just ok. Came for doughnuts, but I don't consider these to be real doughnuts. They are those tiny machine created things, yes, the machine is fun to watch, but the doughnuts were actually undercooked. They were mushy fried dough, lacking flavor and structure. Basically just an overblown vehicle for toppings, and kind of expensive at that. They are cute, don't get me wrong, just not all that great. Adorable if you want to gift to someone! Less satisfying to actually eat. They are very slow at making these too, definitely order on Ritual or something if you want a bunch.
