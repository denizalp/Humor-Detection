This place was great! So great we almost came back a 2nd time, 2 days later. \n\nI've been wanting to try La Cave since they opened but there has never been enough time or hunger to fit it in. \n\nThe ambiance here is akin to a dark, sexy underground bar in NYC. Something totally different than what you normally find in Vegas.\n\nOne thing that stood out was the full bar behind us!\n\nThey only provided us with a food & wine menu so I thought they didn't serve cocktails..\nuntil I turned around & saw a full bar.\n\nEverything here is tapas which was great since we weren't too hungry to begin with.\n\nStandouts include the short ribs as well as the sea scallops on polenta & the beet & burrata salad. There were a bunch of other items that looked great so I'm sure I will be back on my next trip.
