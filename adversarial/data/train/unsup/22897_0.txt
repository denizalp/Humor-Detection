STAY FAR AWAY \n\n\nWish I would have gone to yelp and google reviews before purchasing a $19 Group On exam, xrays, and cleaning deal. \n\nI give them one star because there is not a choice for zero or negative score.  My story is similar to many other reviews. I feel that this practice is baiting customers in with a very affordable \"deal\" which undoubtedly they would lose money on. When the customer is in the chair, comes the \"switch\" and they demand additional more expensive services. \n\nI purchased in February. Earliest appointment was originally 2 months out, mid April. They called the day before to cancel. Next available is 3 more months until July 11th. \n\nWhen I get to their office, I am informed that the Doctor is not in today, and that I will have to return for the exam portion of the deal. After 30 minutes of xrays, and preliminaries, I got a proposal from the front office clerk for a \"new\" deal for a deep cleaning. I am given this whole BS explanation, about the way the office does things and office standards. I was very upset and left the office mad. A few minutes after I left, someone from their office called and hung up on me. After several attempts to call back and waiting on hold, I was told that Margaret would call me when she came in and handle my Group on refund. I did not hear back from her. I did contact Group On, and fortunately, they handled the refund immediately. Apparently they have had to do many refunds for this vendor.
