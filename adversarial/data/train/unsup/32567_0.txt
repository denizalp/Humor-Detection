The service was great and we were seated quickly. That's where the good part of this review ends. Unfortunately, the chips were cold - which is odd for 11am in the morning, they should be piping hot, right out of the fryer. The 'salsa fresca' was bitter, which tells me it wasn't made this morning. Maybe change the name to salsa vieja, to tell the truth. I ordered a taco salad and I received about 5oz of beef fajita meat\/onions. There was at least 1lb of lettuce and little else. The service was quick and they were courteous, which is why I'm rating it two stars.
