Brilliant Bridal was the first shop I went to to find my wedding dress, and it ended up being the only one I needed to visit! Tessa did an amazing job at listening to what I wanted and narrowing down my options to get me to the perfect dress. They have a huge selection of dresses, even in my size (16).\nI expected dress shopping to be a long and exhausting process, but Tessa and Brilliant Bridal made it fun, easy, and fast! I loved that I was able to walk out the door with my dress and veil the same day. I would definitely recommend Brilliant Bridal to my friends!
