Brought in some like-new summer clothes to sell (mendocino, mink pink) but they wouldn't take them. I found this puzzling. They said I could donate them, meaning they would sell them to the cancer society. I have a sneaking suspicion they end up selling the \"donated\" clothes in the store at a significantly marked up price without being transparent about this (see other reviewers for evidence of this). Disappointing. If this is true, I wish I had taken the clothes back and donated them myself to a charitable organization rather than support this thievery.
