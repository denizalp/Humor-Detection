I am an addict!  I am addicted to coffee....better yet, I am addicted to P&S coffee!!  Mmmmm their latte is sooooooo delicious.  P&S makes coffee, I mean real coffee.  If you are a real coffee drinker, you would know what I mean.  They sure know how to make a good cup of coffee, it is not sour or not burnt, it is perfect.  Whenever I go to Chinook mall, I have to grab my P&S latte before I shop.  It has become my ritual.
