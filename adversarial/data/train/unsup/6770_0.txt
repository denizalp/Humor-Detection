Never had been here, came across it looking at restaurants that had been aired on Diners, Dive-Ins, & Dives. The land was beautiful and well put together. The food was amazing and so fresh. Employees were happy and friendly. Definitely will be returning for not only the restaurant but the Farmers Market.
