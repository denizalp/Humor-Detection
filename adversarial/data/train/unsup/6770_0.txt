I'm up in arms that it's taken me so long to try out Great Links Brewhouse & Grill. I really have no excuse. It's close to home, has great Yelp reviews, and even has veggie dogs on the menu. Come to find out not only do they have offer veggie hot dogs, they have a full blown vegetarian faux meat menu that includes veggie chili, brats, cheese steak, bacon, and chicken nuggets! Veggie items are priced the same as their meaty counterparts. I squealed in excitement and vowed to be a regular customer if the food was good. Ladies and gents, I was not disappointed. \n\nDELUXE CHILI CHEESE DOG ($5.49): Covered in vegetarian chili, cheddar cheese, and jalapeno slices (sans onions). A few slices of veggie bacon were tucked in the veggie hot dog. Tasted awesome, and I'm so glad to have an eatery that really caters to the vegetarian community. I only wish the cheese was more melt-y. 4\/5\n\nLAS VEGAS CHILI DOG ($5.49): This dog comes with white chili and is an upgraded version to the traditional dog. Cayenne sour cream and pepper jack cheese were some of the unexpected ingredients. Husband liked it! 4\/5\n\nITALIAN FRIES ($4.29): Loaded with parmesan cheese. Not what I'm used to but we were happy with these fries. 4\/5\n\nZUCCHINI STYX ($4.99): These were just okay. Probably won't order them again. The zucchini was too squishy. 2\/5\n\nVIBE: Small, casual hot dog joint. 4\/5\n\nSERVICE: Upon walking in, we thought we were supposed to order at the counter but we were instructed to sit down at a table. Our waitress was super nice and checked in on us often. As we left the guys working behind the counter waved and bid us a friendly farewell. 4\/5\n\nGOOD TO KNOW: They have a BOGO coupon in the Entertainment Book, up to $6. \n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #240
