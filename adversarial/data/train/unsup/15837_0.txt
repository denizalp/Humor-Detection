Brought our dog here during the Christmas week because everywhere else was booked. When I brought him in for orientation the people working there was awesome, nice and friendly so I felt welcomed. When I brought him in for his stay for about 8 days, the package that I bought said it came with a picture a day which was awesome because we get to see him everyday. The first few days we got different pics of him, then towards the end of the stay we received 3 of the same pics but with 3 different borders just on different days. So at this point I'm worried because I don't know if he is ok because why would you send us 3 pictures that are EXACTLY the same but try and fool us by putting 3 different borders to make it seem like it's a different picture, but the person sending the picture swears it was 3 different photos. Overall the staff I interacted with was awesome.
