Want to watch a free show in Las Vegas?  Fall of Atlantis at Caesars Palace may be what you are looking for.  It is about a 10 minute show, and it starts at 11am everyday on the hour.  It is located at the Forum Shops near Cheesecake Factory and Nike.\n\nI do not recommend going out of your way to watch this animatronic display show.  As other reviews have mentioned, it is so difficult to hear & understand any words.  Only worth seeing if you are already here.  Otherwise, skip this freebie.
