This one is right by my home and it's not too bad for a post office. Smallish parking area bumps up against the GIANT Indoor Swap Meet lot, so for a couple extra feet you can even park sideways if you want!\n They do Passports, all the usual stuff. Staff isn't as grumpy as many others are.\n Don't lick anything in there and you should be able to make it out without catching anything.  Hehehe
