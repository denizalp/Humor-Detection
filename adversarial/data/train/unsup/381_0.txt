Very nice family outing. The kids loved it, it was very small I envisioned it being miles of lights but a walk around the lagoon was plenty especially in cold temps. If you go after 8 you can find closer parking spaces since most families with small children will be leaving by then. Admission is a little pricey for what you get but go Ina value night and buy tickets online and it's not a bad deal.
