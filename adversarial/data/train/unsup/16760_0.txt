Let's keep it simple, I LOVE THIS PLACE. I have been twice, tried a variety of items, and been overly impressed each time!! Let's just say I would not expect it to stay a hidden gem with flavors like this. The word is out! The Yelpers\/Hipsters\/and Asians of all sorts will be here soon if they have not yet already! \nMy first trip, I met a bunch of Yelp ladies for lunch. I tried the Thai Chowder (AMAZING), the red curry flatbread, and a few bites of Terri R.s chips. \nI also had a Thai ice tea, which was perfect and not overly sweet. The service was friendly, the food was unique, and overall I really enjoyed everything about this place. It wasn't until trip #2, that I actually fell in LOVE. \nI dined on my lunch break with a coworker. It was her idea to share some Dragon's Breath fries. Just thinking of that spicy, mouth watering flavor is making me want some as I write this review. I sat there the entire meal contemplating what spice they use on those dam fries. Red Chile? Serrano? WHAT ELSE!?!? It is served with a siracha like ketchup that really makes this a flavor overload. \nI also went with the Pork roll. Thich chunks of BBQ pork, Asian slaw, housemade pickles. Are you drooling yet?! This sandwich hit the spot. Add a little Bad Karma sauce for a nice kick. You get sweet, spicy, savory, and meaty all in one bite!!\nNow if the food hadn't already won me over, the service was so on point!! We were checked on by the cashier, the server, and even the chef came around from the back. Full of smiles, and concern for the customers. \nI will be a regular at this place until they kick me out! I hear they have a secret menu too. I will be picking more brains next visit.
