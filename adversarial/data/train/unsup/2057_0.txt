This review is for the food only. I really enjoyed their veggie burger! Super flavorful with great texture. Not just a morning star patty from the grocery, which is what most places provide. I paired this with ranch and Mac and cheese.\n\nThe crowd is not my type. Lots of d-bag guys, & Cougars... But hey that may be your scene, but it's not mine. Guys should not take selfies, especially in public places (Period)
