Standing in the suicide lane I contemplated if it was worth risking my life to walk to this place for lunch.\n\nThe menu here is a bit more eclectic than the average betero's. It has burgers, fish n' chips and even hot dogs on the menu.\n\nI went with a more original item, a cactus burrito. the staff was nice enough to let me know that the usual red sauce had meat init and they left that out. I ordered some chips with my meal too.\n\nIt was the best cactus burrito I ever had, and the only, it is supposedly healthy and not too bad. (4.25) The chips were wonderful  but a bit pricey at $1.25.\n\nDrinks are limited to cans and bottles so getting you food to go and getting a drink at the adjacent circle K is recommended.\n\nThere were a few homeless people enjoying a High gravity malt liquor' out on the patio, but that just comes with the territory don't let that scare you away.
