The absolute best thing about this place is the fried Twinkies with strawberries, the singer warmed up and sang very well once he got going, but the band members did not smile much, which made me feel as if they thought they had somewhere better to be. The mixed drinks were extremely over priced and I thought well at least they were in pretty large glasses, but I didn't even get a buzz and they were $24 each, so that was really a rip off. May go back in the future, but definitely will not be ordering drinks there again.
