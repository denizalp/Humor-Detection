Haven't eaten here yet so I can't really rate it but will update when I do. Although I went twice and the same item was sold out  my fault since it was after 12 and breakfast wasn't served anymore. I cant wait to try it on another one of my lunch breaks! But from what I hear I won't be disappointed ! Welcome to the community Mary Be :)
