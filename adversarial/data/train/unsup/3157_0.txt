On behalf of Peoples Mortgage Company, I would like to say thank you to MEB Management for donating to our 4th Annual Derby Day the Peoples Way Charity Fundraiser. Being in the Business Development department, I constantly strive to expand my networking relationships among the community. While walking downtown one day, I stopped by the MEB office and introduced myself to their wonderful staff and dropped off information about our charity event. MEB immediately made a donation that will be going to a wonderful non-profit organization, The Tucson Musicians Museum. Great business is based on impactful and positive relationships. I highly recommend MEB Management Services!
