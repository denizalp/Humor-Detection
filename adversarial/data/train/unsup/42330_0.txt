I called to have our water softener installed.  A man named Rich came to take a look to see what he would need to install it.  After he was done looking at things he proceeded to ask if I was talked to about their water softener options.  I told him that we have one; it just needs to be installed.  He stated, \"Oh we don't touch Morton's.\" He proceeded to tell me how horrible of a unit they are.  Basically telling me that I can't afford one of their $900+ units.  He was rude and insulting.  I am on a timeline to get everything completed, and, to find out that they will not install something that I was under the impression that Ray said they do, this added more unnecessary stress. Regardless of the fact that it was a misunderstanding there is never an excuse to be rude and I will never do business with a company that treats customers with such disrespect.
