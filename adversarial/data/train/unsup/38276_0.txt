I've been in Cleveland for a little over a year now on a project nearby. I used to eat at Mizu once or twice a week when I first started working in the area. Mizu has some decent rolls that hit the spot, but if you're looking for more authentic Japanese sushi, this is not the place to go. The rolls are very \"American-ized\"...drenched in sauce and often with too much rice. Going a little overboard with the sauce is usually a clear indicator that the quality of fish is not that good. I've had cuts of the sashimi at Mizu - not the most fresh, but not the worst either. With that being said, if you're going to consume raw fish, only fresh cuts should be making it to your palette (unless you and your stomach like to live life on the wild side, haha). \n\nYou can ask for less sauce, less rice, more sauce, etc to customize your roll to your liking which is nice - but in my experience, it's been 50\/50 whether your sushi roll dreams ever get executed into reality. Often times, it's lost in translation. Either the server didn't understand but gave you a polite nod, or the sushi chef didn't understand the request and just straight up ignored it. \n\nI ate here often because it was convenient and because it's got enough options on the menu to please an entire party. The price is good - reasonably priced for the average level\/quality of sushi served. However, now I hate coming here and only do so when I'm dragged into it. The wait time is ridiculous. Dinner at Mizu now is a full on evening commitment. Block off 3 hours for dinner because it will take that long. The entire staff is unapologetic and unaccommodating to the inconvenience. Also, they stopped accepting American Express. Not sure if they are penny pinching, but it's an inconvenience to those of us who are on business and can't use our corporate card for dinner.
