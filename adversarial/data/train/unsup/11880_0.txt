I had to update my review as things have completely improved.  The host which I cannot remember by name but if you have been there recently you'll know, she gives the best hugs and smiles. She is one of the biggest improvements!  Sushi is back to its yumminess and quality and hope to continue to make this our regular go to sushi spot. Thank you for the changes made!
