With Chef Pluvinet off spreading great French Pastry from coast-to-coast it was early Friday morning that a stop was made at Rosallie on South Rainbow, the space festively decorated and a pre-order ready for pickup consisting of three boxes, one of which was still warm.\n\nTruly a Restaurant that changed local dining culture, the quality of Viennoiseries improving across the Valley ever since Rosallie opened up shop, it was immediately upon arrival to work that Coffee was made to accompany the treats, Breakfast logically beginning with an oven-fresh Almond Croissant that raised the bar from great to \"as good as Lyon\" with a crackling skin and soft interior stuffed with house-ground Almonds instead of Frangipane. \n\nReluctant to share the bounty, the Nutella Croissant slightly smaller but equally rich and perhaps even more dense thanks to the Chocolate-Hazelnut Spread, it was on top and between snappy Shortbread that more Nutella was enjoyed before moving on to a slice of Jonathan's Walnut Pie, an item that also only seems to be getting better with just enough Sugar to balance out the Nuts atop a buttery Shell.\n\nRounding out the sampling with this year's Yule Log, a variant of last Christmas' Buttercream Roll that places Vanilla Custard at the center of a Dark Chocolate Sponge, it should go without saying that this one might require the work of more than one person as the Cocoa adds up quick and the delicate texture makes for a rather limited shelf-life, though over the course of 24-hours in the right setting one might be able to justify eating a whole one given the fact that it can only be ordered during the Christmas season.\n\nFIVE STARS:  Although some may say that Rosallie's collection is a little *too* rustic, whatever that means in the Instagram era, there is really no denying that as far as French Pastry goes there is nowhere else in Sin City nearly as authentic, an early morning arrival this time reminiscing of mom n' pop bakeries in a place like Chaudes-Aigues France...aside from the Strip Mall.
