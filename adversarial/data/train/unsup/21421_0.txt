Definitely a waste of your time.  Unless you're shopping for some emergency undergarments because you exhausted the supply you had brought from home.\n\nIf you're over 23, you probably will not find anything in the Men's section that would suit your needs.  All the selections are on the bright and striped side.  However, if you're into Bert & Ernie or the Incredible Hulk, you may find a Cardigan or t-shirt with your name on it.\n\nSeriously, you're joking right...
