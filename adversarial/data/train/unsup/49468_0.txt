I love that lush is fresh handmade Organic products! They never test on animals and most products are vegan or at the least vegetarian! Veganese is a amazing conditioning shampoo that is vegan!! It's made out of seaweed! The black pots are made from recycled product. And they encourage you to reuse them! The bottom of the label actually tells you who made it!
