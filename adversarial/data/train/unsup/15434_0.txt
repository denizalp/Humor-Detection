Either I had an unusual experience at Zaw's or everyone in Pittsburgh needs to venture out of state to find real authentic Chinese food.\n\nThe high reviews from Yelp encouraged my drive from Rivers Casino all the way to Zaw's.  I called ahead and they kindly told me that they'd be open till 10pm tonight. I was excited because I was craving Chinese food!\n\nThe cashier (whom I will assume is the owner) was extremely kind and friendly.  I ordered a large Pork Chow Mein and General Tso's Chicken.  Just FYI, this is really expensive Chinese fast food!! I was born and raised in San Francisco so I suppose that may have played a large factor.  But $7.95 for a large chow mein and $8.95 for the chicken is outrageous (or it would be in the west coast)!  I told myself this had to be amazing for what they're charging.\n\nYou can imagine my disappointment when I opened up the chow mein to find that it wasn't even chow mein!! It did have pork, but there were NO NOODLES. All I had in that red and white take out box was thin slices of roast pork, a big batch of cooked BEAN SPROUTS, and an overwhelming amount of SAUCE?!? i was so upset that I paid $8 for it.  I've taken a picture so please tell me this was just a huge mistake.  There are absolutely no noodles in my chow mein.  I didn't pay for a big box of cheap bean sprouts.  I have no idea how this happened because I even watched the cook make it from my seat on one of their bar stools! We must both be blind. Zaw's had the nicest man in the world working there but I do hope they read this as to make sure they don't make the same mistake with anyone else.\n\nThe General Tso's Chicken wasn't so great either.  They put way too much sauce on everything! That is some THICKKKK sauce they're using. My boyfriend found it decent but I may have already been scarred by the chow mein.\n\nI was starving and upset so we ventured off to Primanti Bro's nearby since our chinese take out didn't make the cut.
