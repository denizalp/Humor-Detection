If you are planning to get flooring or countertops or in any way come accross this company... RUN AWAY.   They play a bait and switch game to get your business!!!!   They were the most unprofessional business people I have ever dealt with.   The father son team are the WORST.   Their idea of customer service is to hang up on you mid sentence.  From shoddy workmanship to unfulfilled promises this is a company to STAY AWAY FROM!!
