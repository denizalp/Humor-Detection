Even tho the food here was delish and we loved the atmosphere. We never got waited on by a server!!! There were plenty of servers walking around, even waiting on tables right next to us and behind us, but no one came over to us. The whole time we were there!!!  And we had food and played games, and had 3 rounds of drinks that we went to the bar to get.  That was quite frustrating. \n     I have no idea why you would buy tickets to get drinks and food. They said it was easier than having cash, but who pays with cash anymore?  So the ticket deal was a mystery to me. \n    I don't know why the food is a separate window and self service. Ridiculous. I ordered the half chicken, and it was delicious, very juicy and flavorful. My husband got the pulled park, he didn't rave about it or complain. We had pretzel bites which were fine, the cheese sauce was tasty. \n    Being in the service business, it disappoints me when there is bad service. Las Vegas is built on service and gratuity. If it wasn't for the open atmosphere to Vegas this place would tank.          Beerhaus, all you have going for you is your location. Get it together.
