It's tucked away in a run down plaza, but it is a secret gem. I dropped in during it's grand opening. They had a 10% special with your purchase as a grand opening promotion. I got one of each macaron characters, which came up to $60 flat. They are absolutely amazing and they have the ohmagerrrd factor to them. I'm definitely going to come back to try the other deserts they have. The staff are friendly and awesome. They take everything from debit to credit, so you're not limited to just paying in cash. Which is perfect, I never carry cash. The shop is fairly small, so highly suggest don't come in huge groups. The only problem is, the plaza has limited parking so I would suggest to park on the streets where ever you can; it is also a one-way parking plaza.
