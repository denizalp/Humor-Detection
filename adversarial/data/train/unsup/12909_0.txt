I frequent this location about once a month. I enjoy sewing, crafting, you name it. I can, however, see how this store can be very overwhelming for the INfrequent shopper here. So on that note, let me give YOU folks some tips...\n\n1) If you know you will be buying fabric, start by grabbing your \"deli ticket\" first! That way, once you have it picked out, they're finally ready to cut your fabric. No more waiting!\n\n2) Know the lingo! A yard is 36 inches, so if you are thinking \"feet\" when you tell them how much fabric to cut, you will be taking home way to much fabric! \n\n3) Download the free app before hand. There are always great discounts applicable on things that are not on sale. You can even get an extra discount for being a first time app coupon user. Cha-Ching!\n\n4) Bring a written list and don't get side tracked. It is so easy to go in with a plan, completely forget it, and leave with stuff you won't end up using just because it looked appealing or was on sale. Guilty!\n\n5) Don't be so serious! Make friends with the people in line waiting to pay. Answer the nice ladies with a smile when they ask you what you're making. Everyone is here to enjoy their own hobbies. This isn't the DMV, so don't act like you were forced to come here.
