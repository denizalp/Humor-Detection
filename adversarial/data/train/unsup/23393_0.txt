Worst dealer experience of my life, and I've bought from a lot of dealers and spent 13 years working in the industry. The sale was painful and took longer than it had any right to, and now a month after the sale, I find out they never paid off my trade in. So I'm getting collection calls and negative marks on my credit for missing a payment on a truck that they've probably already sold to someone else. Trying to resolve the issue with the dealer has been much like the buying experience. Complete run around, lies, and zero help on the phone.
