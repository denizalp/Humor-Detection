Not many places are worth an hour and a half wait (in line), but Wicked Spoon is.\n\nYeah there will be a ridiculous wait. First you'll have to wait in line to pay (about 45 minutes) and then when you're all stoked that you get to eat....there's another line to be seated (another 45 minutes). And the entire time you see people rolling out of the restaurant. Too stuffed to walk. The price was just under $40, not cheap, but well worth it. You can also upgrade to bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's for a few extra bucks.   \n\nSo this isn't your run of the mill buffet. This buffet is whats up! It is a perfect hangover cure because it has got everything you could imagine. All sorts of brunch items (my personal favorites were the french toast and eggs Benedict). There were also vast quantities of bomb meats, chicken. pasta (the gnocchi was just wow), sea food, ...everything damnit! \n\nThe service was a bit slow the day I went, but apparently they had understaffed that day. The waitress was also super nice and really apologetic. \n\nThe weakest link were the desserts. The assortment wasn't great. The best part was probably the thai tea gelato. Which was crazy good.
