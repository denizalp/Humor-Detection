My first time dining at Gordon Ramsay Steak in 2012 was magical! I was lucky to come when a recent Hell Kitchen chef worked there during their starting months. At that time, Gordon Ramsay Steak was so hard to get reservations. 3 years later, the food here remains its high quality. However, it lacks a little magical touch that I firstly got during my very first visit to the restaurant. Regardless, this restaurant is my togo fine dining location every time I go to Vegas. If you are looking for the Gordon Ramsay's blowing-your-mind-kind-of food, this destination is a must comparing to his other restaurants in Vegas. \n\nLocation (5\/5): Gordon Ramsay Steak locates inside the Eiffel Tower Building on the Las Vegas Strip. The entrance to the restaurant is modern leading you to a London hip atmosphere with contemporary interior decors. If you are dining in a group of 4, you are more likely to be seat at their first floor. If you reserve for a party of 6 and more, you will be seated at the private dining room on the second floor. \n\nService (4\/5): Services here is great before coming to the restaurant and during my dining experience. If you come here for a special occasion, let them know! I'm sure they can add little touches here and there to \"fantisize\" your dining experience. All waiters are professional and knowledgable about the food. Depending on your eating pace, orders can take a slightly long time if your party consists of fast eaters. \n\nFood (5\/5): I had the opportunities to try both regular menus and the Hell's Kitchen Limited Edition Tasting Menu. If you are a TR member, you will pay less for regular menu food. Regardless which route you go, they will give you complimentary assorted bread to snack before your meal. \n\n* Regular menu: I love their Butter Poached Maine Lobster ($28) and Smoked Beef Tartare ($22). If you are a MasterChef fan, you would probably remember the episode where Masterchef Lucas had to poach lobster inside butter. YES! That's what you are getting here... but better! The lobster meat was sooooo buttery and light and slowly melted in your month. The fact that the lobster's portion is small made my palette craving for more EVERYTIME! The smoke beef tartare, on the other hand, was just awesome! The way it was brought out to the table was smoky and full with mystery. You know that you order something cool when people at nearby tables stop eating and stare at your food! YESH! The potato chips served on the transparent acrylic holder was so beautiful that I didn't want to eat it. For the main course, I usually go for the most famous Ramsay's signature dish, the Roast Beef Wellington ($57). My boyfriend would go for the 16oz Bone-in Rib Eye. Both are huge portions! \n\n* Hell's Kitchen Limited Edition Tasting Menu: The way the tasting menu works is that everyone in your party has to join in the tasting menu. It costs $145\/person and an additional of $75 per person if you want wine pairing. At the beginning of the meal, everyone at the table will be given a copy of the official Hell Kitchen's Tasting Menu signed by Gordon Ramsay himself. According to the restaurant, there are only 2000 official copies of this menu. So here is the list of 5 courses along with the wine pairings:\n\n1) Amuse Bouche - Scotch Egg\nBerkshire pork sausage, red wine braised cabbage\nPairing - Louis de Sacy, Champagne, Grand Cru, MV\n\n2) First Course - Potato and Octopus Salad\nCharred octopus, mustard vinaigrette, remoulade, pumpernickel soil, marbled fingerling potatoes\nPairing - North Coast Brewing, Pranqster,Belgian Style Golden Ale, California \n\n3) Second Course - Butternut Squash Risotto\nSeared scallop, sage, mascarpone \nPairing - Emeritus, Pinot Noir, Hallberg Ranch, Russian River Valley, 2011\n\n4) Third Course - Roasted Beef Wellington\nGlazed root vegetables, potato puree, red wine demi-glace\nPairing - Fleur de Bouard, Bordeaux, Le Plus, Lalande de Pomerol \n\n5) Dessert Course - Sticky Toffee Pudding\nSweet date pudding cake, brown sugar toffee, brown butter ice cream\nPairing - Chambers Rosewood, Muscat, Rutherglen, MV\n\nI personally LOVE their creamy risotto! It was so flavorful and smooth that just went straight down to my throat leaving a tasty warmth at the back of my tongue. Of course, the beef welling must be included in their tasting menu! For the first time, I witnessed my mom eating a medium-rate piece of meat and she loved it! What must be emphasized in this tasting menu is their Sticky Toffee Pudding! For a person who hates chocolate and cake like my dad to happily enjoy this dessert should tell you something! As you can tell, their tasting menu converted both of my parents and opened their palettes to new flavors! \n\nPersonally, I would definitely come back simply because their food changed my parents' perspectives about what steakhouses are nowadays. I would also come back and bring friends here if they are interested in trying Ramsay's bold flavors for the first time.
