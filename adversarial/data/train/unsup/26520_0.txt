Everything I have ever ordered from here is delicious.  The atmosphere is gorgeous, prices are reasonable and the portions are just right.  Not only is the food fantastic, but the service is exemplary.  I have had small children with me on numerous occasions, and they have been running around and making a mess, and the waiters are kind, understanding, and friendly.  One of them even carried my runaway toddler back to the table after she had escaped from me for the fifth time.  When I mentioned to my friend that I was concerned about how I was going to carry my leftovers back to the car (they were in Styrofoam boxes), someone who overheard me from the other side of the wall came and brought me a plastic bag.\n\nI really love going here, and I would especially recommend anyone with kids to visit.
