All the other reviews are pretty much true which totally prepared me for our visit!  We came on a weekday so no line, busy but not too crowded.  It was nice not to expect much and made it that much more enjoyable.\n\nWe had fun looking at items we had seen on the show.  Also fun and cool to take a free pic to post to Facebook.\n\nI completely understand why the \"stars\" wouldn't be hanging out there... would you want to if you had a hit show and were famous now and rolling in the dough?  I know I wouldn't!  And why would you even sell these items that were featured on the show unless you got a premium price for them?  They are more fun to look at after seeing them on the show!  I get it!\n\nThe staff working were friendly and patient considering the crazies they must get in there haha.\n\nFun place to visit for sure.  I wonder what will happen to the store after fame of the show fizzles?
