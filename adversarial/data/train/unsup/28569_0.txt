This place was a favorite spot of mine whenever me and my coworkers needed a good Thai meal.  Centrally located, parking always available, and the atmosphere is so relaxed.  I tend to go straight for the Pad Thai (which is a great choice here - you will not be able to eat the entire thing in one sitting, even the lunch portion), but everything else I get I enjoy as well.  The one thing that I would watch out for is time constraint.  My coworkers and I used to work right by the restaurant and were a little more flexible with our lunch hour.  However, sometimes I did have to wait a little longer than I felt I should for my food (although they may have just been very busy those few times).  All in all, a good grub spot!
