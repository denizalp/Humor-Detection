I have been to Kaya three times within the past month.  And I can give them a solid 4.5 stars each and every time.\n\nFirst visit:\n* Steamed Pork Belly (Marinated and steamed Pork Belly with condiments) $15.95 - Comes with leaves, thinly sliced radish, sliced jalapenos, sliced garlic, kimchee, etc.  Place it altogether with a slice of pork belly and oh so yum.  Definitely meant for sharing, and more than enough for two people!\n* Korean Seafood Pancake - Loaded with lots of seafood, and really good.\n* Spicy Sashimi - Generous portion, but perhaps a bit too much. \n* Something Wrong Roll - Whatever was in there, it was really good and we were fighting to get an extra piece.\nOur waitress was super helpful and we didn't know what else to order beyond the seafood pancake.  She made the other recommendations and were so very pleased with her suggestions.    \n\nSecond visit: \nNew addition to the menu is AYCE sushi for $22.95 (until midnight).  Beyond the standard nigiri, rolls, and appetizers, we also had:\n* Bulgogi (steamed beef) - Generous for one, so go with one order first to see if it's something you like.\n* Skewers: bacon & shrimp, gingko, garlic, chicken gizzard, shrimp, beef\nCame for a small party and they were very accommodating for our group.  Even brought out a special dessert for the birthday boy and didn't complain with all the splitting of the checks.  Our waiter, Sunny, took care of us and really made sure we were having a good time.\n\nThird visit: \nAYCE sushi again!\n* Steamed black mussel\n* Ahi poki\n* Fried jabchae\n* Spicy Korean ramen\n* Skewers: bacon & scallop, mushroom\n\nService was a bit slower this time, but they apologized and threw in a bottle of free beer.  We didn't mind as much since we got to linger and enjoy our meal more. \n\nTheir nigiri is pretty good.  Generous slices of fish and not a whole lot of rice.  That's pretty much what had us coming back the second time for AYCE.  Skewers as part of the AYCE menu is also what we enjoyed - especially the chicken gizzards, the garlic, bacon & scallop, shrimp, beef, etc.  Their steamed black mussels came with a creamy sauce that was good.  Soft shell crab appetizers are also available, including tempura.  Noodle dishes included are udon and ramen.  Rice dishes include fried rice, teriyaki chicken and beef bowls.\n\nDessert is limited to vanilla, strawberry or green tea ice cream, limit one.\n\nFor a relatively new restaurant, they are busy!  We even saw Mr. Lee's son the last two times we went! (From Lee's Liquor)  \n\nAYCE sushi with some Korean thrown in there?  Works for us and we have very pleased bellies when we leave.\n\nThey also have a frequent visitor card - Buy 10 AYCE, get 1 free!\n\n(Pics posted!)
