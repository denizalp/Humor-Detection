Love this place. It is a throwback in most ways - that said, they have HD projectors so the picture quality is great. Price includes two movies and they do well to pair movies which match.\nThe concession is terrific and they have a all the normal things you'd expect, but also things like: fried pickles, pulled pork sandwiches, poutine, etc... They even make their milkshakes from scratch and the employees have always been on the ball and friendly.\nI've found this place extremely beneficial as well for a couple specific circumstances. 1) For a couple summers when our son was a toddler, he'd simply sleep on the drive over. That allowed us as a couple to go out, and without having a babysitter. 2) The other niche I've found was working as a support worker for people with developmental disabilities. Anyone who knows the field will know there's often challenges going into crowded places like a movie theatre, as well as the fact that the staffing ratio is often too small to bring everyone. With the drive in, the people I supported have always been calm since they're in a familiar environment, and in the worst scenario, you're already in your car if you need to leave. Just a couple ways seeing a movie in your own car can actually help more people get out depending on their circumstances.\nI can't really find any critiques, so 5 star.
