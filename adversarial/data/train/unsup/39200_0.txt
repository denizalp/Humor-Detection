Stopped in and had dinner after reading really positive reviews on yelp thanks to all that left really good reviews\nAdam (owner) is friendly and recommended lamb chops\nSo delicious and this was my first time trying lamb. \nIt was a very filling and tasty meal for 15$ not bad for lamb!\nThe hummus and pita was delicious also.\nThe food appears to be made in house and is fresh and full of flavor. Took home a macaroon, cannoli and a Swiss Roll. Treats are spot on too\nWe will definitely be back! \nThanks again Adam!
