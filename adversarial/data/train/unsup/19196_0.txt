I stand out when I go, because I don't reek of burnt skin from the tanning bed across the street.\n\nI only go to this gym because it's close enough to hit in the mornings and I can ride my bike there. That's where the fun stops.\n\nHere are my beefs:\n1. Not enough cardio equip if you're going to let 1\/4 of the machines be out of order every day.\n2. Hiding the free weights isn't a fun game. They are never stacked where they're supposed to be. I always have to hunt around and sometimes never find the ones I need.\nc. They have been missing three different medicine balls for more than 6 months, now. I asked about them, three different times and was told that they were in the gym, I just had to look. Liar, liar, pants on fire. \n4. If you go past 3p on any day, it looks like what is has to be like walking into Axis Radius on a Saturday night (not that I've ever been bored or drunk enough to know). Meat-heads gallore, complete with spiked hair, fixed around their ban-danas and barbed wire tats around their arms. Also, their chicks wear outfits so ridonkulous that Michael Phelps would be embarrassed at the amount of skin showing.\n5. Fat trainers. \n\nOther than that, it's awesome.
