Attention: Delicious coffee served here! This was the final stop on the CMYE: East(er) End Espresso Crawl II. So good, I downed my double Americano faster than Nicole Kidman reaches for her Botox syringe. I probably could've had another double except I enjoy sleeping.\n\nThe space is inviting and the orange slices in the water pitchers are a nice touch. Too bad this cafe is so far from me and I wouldn't know how to get there without a chaperone.
