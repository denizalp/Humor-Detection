As per my other reviews of other Bonefish Grill locations, it's no secret that I love this company. The food is of good quality and executed very well. \n\nOur service at this particular location was outstanding. Top notch. Will be back. Happy that a Bonefish is open right down the street from me.\n\nAlso, hard to please parents came with me for lunch and after bitching about going ended up very happy with the whole experience, food, etc., and will also be back.
