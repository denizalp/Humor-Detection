(Lyrics - Chicago - You're The Inspiration)\n\nYou know that Yelp was meant to be\nThe kind of Yelp that last forever\nAnd I want you to taste with me\nFrom tonight until the end of time\n\nYou should know, everywhere I go\nI'm Bo Biting all the time, on my Yelp\nOn my site\n\nAzculture Baby!\n\nI'm Bo Biting with some stars\nI'm at Old Chicago\nYou bring feeling to every bite\nI'm at Old Chicago\n\nWanna go review it\nI wanna go reviewing\nNo one deserves more stars than you......\n\nOld Chicago is a chain American pizza restaurant that started out in Colorado.  The location I attended didnt seem too happening so I was a tad bit skeptical.  Needless to say, I've heard great things about it so what the hey.\n\nOh how I was wrong!  I should not have been doubting the O' Chi-town!  Let's just say I was pretty blown away by their Chicago style pizza.  I understand the pizza rivalry; New York or Chicago, but I got to hand it to them.  Nice thick and doughy pizza crust atop with warm and spicy pizza sauce.  This mouth watering pizza punched my palates and had me singing....and eating of course.  I also tried their fried zucchini and was pretty impressed.  Nice and crunchy while the warm zucchini inside brought the soft texture to this wonderful appetizer!  \n\nIn the end, if I'm in need of some Chicago style pizza I'll definitely stop by this joint and order a few drinks along the way! - Enjoy!
