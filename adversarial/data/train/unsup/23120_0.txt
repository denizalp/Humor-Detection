I stopped in here for a burger with friends last Saturday and it was delicious! Beware though, their \"regular\" cheeseburger actually has two patties! I'm glad that I asked because I only wanted 1! I probably could've eaten two but this gal really only NEEDS one. ;) The burger itself had so much flavor and I loved all of the toppings, including their special sauce! My only complaint was the bun. It was a little dry and not anything special. In fact, I may order it wrapped in lettuce next time and forget the bun altogether. \n\nTHEIR FRIES. Holy heaven, you must get these! They are hand cut and have the most delicious seasoning on them. I could literally eat these every single day and be the happiest camper. \n\nSince it is right around the corner from our house, I'm sure i'll be back!
