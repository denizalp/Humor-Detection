4 stars for Renegade's drive thru experience alone... I was a frequent visitor when this place was formerly Buzzberry and was super relieved that they didn't get rid of the drive thru with the new ownership \/ changes.  \n\nWhen I have hungry kids in my car, and we're on our way to or from a soccer practice, karate, school, etc... the last thing I want to do is get everyone out of the car to go inside, order, wait, etc... Renegade's drive thru has been a pleasure on both of our visits to date. \n\nMy kids have had smoothies here... I don't love the added sugar, but I balance it out by adding protein, and they seem to like it!  I hope to return soon to try the coffee, acai bowls and\/or avocado toast.  Stay tuned for an update after that!
