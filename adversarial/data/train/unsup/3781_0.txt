Over the past 4 years, I've been here numerous times for a variety of occasions (a date, business dinner, birthday celebration).  The service is fantastic, the setting and decor devine...but the food just doesn't stack up against better known steakhouses, and with virtually the same price point.  The location inside the Red Rock Hotel makes it an easy-peasy, no hassle, off-strip choice...might be the only reason to choose it (especially, if your staying at the hotel, or if convenient to Summerlin residents).  For me, having an appetizer or a drink at the inside bar, or better yet -- the beautiful outdoor bar with a firepit, large sofas and chairs -- is absolutely terrific.  For the main course, I'd take my business elsewhere.\n\nA tip for parking is to valet park on the backside, the hotel entrance, with just a short walk thru the hotel lobby and either up the stairs (passing the outstanding chandelier), or 1 floor up in the elevator...takes you right to the T-Bones entrance.
