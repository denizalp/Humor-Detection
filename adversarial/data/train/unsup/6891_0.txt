This Target is hit or miss in many aspects depending on the visit, so it is not consistent in service for me. I have a love\/hate relationship with this location. My last couple of visits I have found that they are sold out with cleared shelves on basic grooming items. I think having a sale or a Cartwheel store app discount is great but it would be nice if they stocked accordingly. \n\nThe communication in store is lacking, for instance I asked an employee who had one of those handheld stock devices if he could verify inventory for me. He did and replied to me zero quantity in stock or back inventory. I asked another employee the same question about 5 minutes later and he came out of the back stock room with 10 of the product I was searching for. \n\nThe service is another story, it really is hit or miss and depends on which line for a cashier that I get in. I have had sweet employees ring me up and I have had the cashier from hell give me issues over a store originated deal (cartwheel). It is sad to know that each and every time my experience will be like playing Russian roulette, will it be good or just bad bad bad.\n\nA store like this needs to strive for more consistency, everyone needs to be on the same page and know the policies,procedures, products and common sense customer service. \n\nIt should always be a pleasant experience, I should not have to worry or think as I walk into the store if my visit will be nice or a nightmare.\n\nCome on Target, get your act together, don't turn into WAL-MART. I am at least expecting or prepared for rude employees and chaos when I step foot in that hot mess of a store.
