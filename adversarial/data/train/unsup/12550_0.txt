It's OPM with a face lift.  VIP was full of amateurs.  All that being said, it's a good place to go when you want to see brown people and dance.  With the number of promotions they run, if you are a chick, you should NOT have to pay to get in here.  I have had fun dancing here, but this is not the typical Vegas mega-club or ultra-lounge experience.  \n\nDepending on who you are, that is a good or bad thing.
