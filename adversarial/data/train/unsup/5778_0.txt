The food was great and the service was spectacular. I came here wanting to try the universal breakfast, but reading the description, I think it was too much food so I settled for some good o'l eggs Benedict. The server was really nice, she kept coming back to check if I needed anything or to refill my coffee. When my plate arrived, I was surprised to see that fruit came with it. That was a bonus for me and let me say I've been to a few spots in NYC for brunch and the eggs Benedict here outweighed the competitors in New York lol it was just exploding with flavor and it was filling even without the fruit. The Canadian ham\/bacon c'mon the maple taste, oh yeah much much better than NYC version lol next time I'll take a crack at the infamous universal breakfast plate
