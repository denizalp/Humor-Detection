We've bought their bagels a few times and my husband likes them but I do not.\nThat being said, I've been  wanting to try out their deli.  Being a huge sandwich lover I was looking forward to it.\nTheir prices come with a big sticker shock.  Not wanting to spend a ton and being that I wasn't starving, my husband and I opted to split a 'colossal' Reuben...at $17 for just a sandwich I had high hopes.  It was a good size, but I have had bigger sandwiches at nowhere near the same price point.  Throw in a side of sweet potato fries and our total for 1 sandwich was $20 plus tax.  Say whaaaaaat?!?!  \nNow on to the taste....the Reuben was decent but it was stacked high with meat that was pretty dry.  Had hardly any sauerkraut on it which is what defines a good Reuben in my book.  The pastries looked really good but I didn't want to spend an additional $6 when I was unimpressed with the sandwich.\nVery disappointing and I won't return.
