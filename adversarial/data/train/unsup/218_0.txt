Jenifer Street Market has steadily become a regular part of my grocery shopping.  For a small grocery, they have a surprisingly robust selection and I have discovered many favorites here over the years.  Their cheese section is fabulous - and if you buy what's on sale a really good deal as well.  \n\nWhere they really shine, is their staff.  They are extremely customer focused and willing to go above and beyond for you.  Not sure where to find something?  They stop whatever they're doing and walk you to the right spot.  Most recently I went in looking for pre-cut melon to take to a pot luck.  There wasn't any in the case, but I asked if they could slice some up for me and Rod in the produce department got right on it!\n\nI love having Jenifer Street as an option for my shopping.
