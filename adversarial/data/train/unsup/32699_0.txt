Finally checked this place out a few days ago and to be honest not impressed. I've eaten at plenty of burger joints across the U.S. This is probably one of the worst. It has the classic look of a burger place, set up is pretty nice but the key points are the food. The employees didn't care much just doing the job said nothing and actually checked my ID when using my credit card for like 8 bucks which isn't a big deal but still odd.  Anyways my cowboy burger came and the meat was dry, lettuce and tomatoes didn't seem very fresh, it was very bland burger. The fries were decent though so ill give them that. Needless to say go elsewhere for a burger.
