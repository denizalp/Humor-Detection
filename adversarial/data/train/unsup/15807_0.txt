Uber made me miss my first ride & a very important appointment. They say my card is invalid, yet it worked fine elsewhere. These \"virtual\" service things have no customer service and no way to fix the problem.\n\nAlso the fare estimate was same as a \"real\" taxi and pickup time was same too. These gimicks sound great on paper but don't actually deliver.
