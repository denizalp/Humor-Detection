Almost missed it as we were walking by. But once you walked in, the sweet comforting waft of baked goods welcomed you. We tried the croissant naturel, and it was easily the best croissant I have ever hd. It was soft, buttery, warm, flaky, and proper naughty but so delicious. Also very reasonably priced. The only downside would be the small seating area but we wll come back next time.
