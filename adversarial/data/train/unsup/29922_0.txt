went to Eastern location for first time. order taker was obviously new, as every question asked, she had to ask someone else.  she gave wrong info on a price- supervisor Andres then refused to correct bill.  restaurant was clean, food fast. staff besides the belligerent, rude mgr Andres, were all very friendly and nice.  Burger and chicken sandwich were \"ok\" but way overpriced. avocado spread made bun very soggy and fell apart. bacon good. Milk shake was not thick- does say real ice cream used in it. no other desserts available.  you can switch your side- French fries, Colossal onion rings or zucchini sticks. I chose the two onion rings\/two zucchini sticks. my husband loved them, I did not care for the coating on them. he ate all of them.  other than the offering of the giant zucchini sticks , nothing very special here.  they do have hot breakfast meals which are available at night too.  in addition they have fish, and some sandwiches too on menu.  look at about $11 for sandwich\/burger, side and a drink.
