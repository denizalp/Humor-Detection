Sheppard Centre, how do I feel about you? Sure, this place is a mall. \n\nThere are stores located inside this building. If it wasn't for being in walking distance to me and having Winner's or Cineplex I probably wouldn't go as often as I do.\n\nOh wait there is a Dollarama. I have to admit I am happy for that as this is convenient for me. Can't forget about Shoppers as well, which has pretty decent hours and it isn't insane like the one at Yonge and Finch.
