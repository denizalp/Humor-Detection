The pork bone soup in this place seems to be the specialty.  but after eating at other places, this place is just OK.  The price is around $7-8 as well and the apetizer served were good but not that memorable. \n\nI went with my cousin and her hubby.  As I looked around the restaurant and saw that everyone had ordered the pork bone soup I figured this is the thing to order.  I also saw a friend of mine with a girl that is not his gf! \n\nThe dish itself tasted good. It came in a piping hot broth topped with bean sprouts, potato, and chives.  It also comes with a dish of rice.\n\nThe ambiance is good.  Clearly good enough for my friend who appeared to be on a date with a girl who is not his gf!  But this is also the guy who got photographed at a nightclub and published online with another girl who is not his gf.  So lesson learned, do not go to this place for a covert date and definitely order the pork bone soup.
