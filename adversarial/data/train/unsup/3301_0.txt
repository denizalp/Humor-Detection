You know when you have a meal that you think about for days after? The meal that was so tasty that you can't stop thinking about every single delicious bite? That meal can be found here!\n\nI am kicking myself for not coming in sooner. So many incredible meals I missed. But now I know better and will be stopping in on a regular basis. It's a cute set-up with a casual atmosphere. \n\nI honestly am not too familiar with Columbian food, but you know you can trust this place because the couple who own the spot are both from there. I ordered the Colentado con Carna Asada. It's grilled sirloin with rice, beans and a fried egg on top. The owner told me it's actually a traditional breakfast meal. I'd have this meal any time of the day though!\n\nEverything had so much flavor, I was floored. The extra bonus is the four sauces that are served to compliment the meal. I couldn't tell you what each was, but seriously, each one was incredibly flavorful. The great thing too is 95% of the menu is gluten free!\n\nYou need to get here ASAP, no more waiting! Plus, bring your fave bottle of vino because it's BYOB!
