I stopped by with two friends a couple of weeks ago on a Sat. evening.  Given that we were looking to get together later in the evening for hot beverages or dessert, Butterwood fit the bill, so we headed over to L-ville to check it out.\n\nBecause their specialty is clearly cake and there weren't many other desserts in the case, we each ordered a slice of cake ($6 + tax each).  Going against my usual adventurous streak when it comes to edibles, I decided to play it safe and stick with the chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream icing.  The cake was velvety in texture, but not quite as most as I was hoping, and it was rather stiff on the iced side.  As for the icing, it was definitely the best part of the cake--it was decadently creamy and rich, as buttercream should be.\n\nMy friends ordered the chocolate pistachio cake and the vanilla poppy seed cake, and I tried bites of both.  The cake component of the chocolate pistachio seemed identical to my chocolate cake, but the icing was saltier than mine with a rather muted pistachio taste.  The vanilla poppy seed was the most interesting of the bunch, consisting of yellow cake and tangy vanilla icing sprinkled generously with poppy seeds.  As others have mentioned, the slices were rather large, such that neither of my friends entirely finished theirs (as usual, I unabashedly housed my entire slice, however).\n\nIf you visit and don't see a cake that you'd enjoy, I'd recommend waiting a bit and checking back, given that the cakes seem to rotate.  By the time that we left, all of the cakes that'd been available when we ordered had been replaced by different types of cakes (hello, Meyer lemon cake!).  The atmosphere is quaint, making it an ideal setting in which to relax and catch up over dessert and\/or hot beverages.  If you're a night owl and\/or a fan of dessert, I definitely recommend checking it out--your inner Martha Stewart will definitely be pleased!
