This was the most amazing find! We were looking for breakfast on the way to the Hoover Dam. We weren't sure we were going to be able to find anything other than fast food. Then we drove by and decided to try it. I had the most amazing French toast I have ever had! The corn flakes add just the right touch. The coffee was really good! The half portion (2 pieces) was more than enough. My son had the biscuits and gravy and it was a huge portion. The biscuit was homemade and he finished the whole thing. My daughter had the hamburger with curly fries and I tried the fries. The were homemade and similarly delicious, She said the burger was great too! All in all, I would make a special trip to this place any time I am in Vegas.
