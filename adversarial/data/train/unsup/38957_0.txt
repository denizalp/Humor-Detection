I want to give them zero stars! My flight was late I missed the second shuttle! had to take a cab and when I got there it was an hour wait! The air conditioning was off and they were out of waters! After waiting 40 minutes with my 18month old It was announced that if you were late your reservation was cancelled and the shuttle will take you back to the airport. Ended up renting from budget last minute. The beginning of my trip was ruined. Never again
