I'm probably the last person who lives in Vegas to try Fuku. I've many failed attempts to go to Chinatown and food truck events to have their burger since almost everyone I know like them. I was excited that they were at the car show last night. The line was a bit long so I had high hopes.\n\nI had the Tamago burger and garlic fries. My friend got the Karai (spicy) burger and garlic fries. The Tamago burger was too sweet and messy to eat. The garlic fries were not garlic-ky at all and the dip was also sweet. The Karai burger was a little bit spicy but plenty sweet.\n\nOverall, Fuku did not live up to my expectations. All hype, sadly. I might have enjoyed it if I were drunk and couldn't feel my mouth. It's just not for me.
