It's not like I needed any persuasion to come here but KOMP 92.3 was giving away FREE bbq, NHRA race tickets, a $3K bbq grill ,concert,movie and comedy tickets plus  lots more.\n\nEntering the shopping center here you can smell the bbq and damn was I hungry. After signing up for the drawing I had to get a full meal.\nEven though they had a feast at their tent you could grub from. I wanted my own!!\n\nSuprisingly there was no wait to be seated and we got the table right next to the fireplace.\n\nMy son & I decided on the 3 meat combo w\/St Louis Ribs,Beef Brisket & Chopped pork. 2 sides come with it so we got their incredible Wilbur Beans & Drunkin Apples. Plus 2 drinks $21!!\n\nThe service here is great, fast & friendly very helpful and quite entertaining too.\n\nSo, no suprise the food came out quickly---\n\nThe chopped pork is the BEST! Smoky,crunchy and so tender & moist. The ribs are great but I like mine dry-rubbed no sauce. The brisket is great but has no crunch and they sauced it too.\n\nThe sides here are incredible bbq eats. The Wilbur beans are so good with brisket & chopped link in it. The drunkin apples are quite a delight too. Amaretto sauce over tender sliced apples sprinkled with cinnamon.\n\nThe meal was great-no doggie bag needed here. The service was fun & friendly and the whole atmosphere takes you back to the county fair & bbq cook-offs. The trophies are impressive but the fact the nail it every time out is more impressive. I have tried over 40 bbq place s in Vegas and I still say Dave's is the BEST  !!
