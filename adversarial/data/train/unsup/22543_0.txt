Most people who like Vietnamese Pho noodles (sometimes referred to as Tonkinese in Montreal) like the Pho Bo noodles, which is Beef (Bo) noodles. \n\nBy far the beef is the most popular, and has a lot of variations. But if you like Chicken noodle soup (who doesn't, especially with a cold?) then Pho Tay Ho is known in Montreal for the best Pho Ga (chicken). \n\nThey don't use free range chicken like Pho Ga An Nam in San Jose, CA, but they make a good Pho Ga.
