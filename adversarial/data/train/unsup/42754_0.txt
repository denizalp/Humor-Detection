A standard chain restaurant with a big selection for food and drinks. Consistent quality you can depend on. Maybe a little lacking in flavor intensity. My Thai Red Curry Rice Bowl was not spicy at all although it was listed as a spicy dish. \n\nService was efficient and friendly. Portion was satisfying and price was reasonable. This location has expanded and there was plenty of seating available. We only had to wait 10 minutes for a table on a Friday with no reservation.
