I have to say...this is probably the worst Jack in The Box ever!  Sad too, since it's the closest one to my house.  I have been here about half a dozen times, but I am never coming back.  Reasons why...........\n\n1. Unfriendly service-  Go to the drive thru and I hear a monotone voice come on, \"What are you having?\"  Same monotone, unhappy in person look once I get to the window.  This has happened multiple times!\n2.  Crappy food-  I crave Jack in the Box Tacos every so often.  Every time I have been here, the tacos are a soft mess.  They are the greasiest tacos in the world, and are never crunchy.  I have experienced this once or twice before at other JITB, but this one has had limp, greasy tacos EVERY time I have ordered them here.  Also, have been out of certain items (jalapeno poppers) multiple times.  How does that happen?  \n3.  Long lines-  Takes forever and a day to get your food here!  JITB is usually pretty quick with the drive thru line, but not here.  They lag and take their time.\n\nI'm over it.  I will drive to the one down on Waddell.  This Jack in the Box sucks!
