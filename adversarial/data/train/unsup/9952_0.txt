HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!! slow and rude waitresses, running around like their heads are chopped off! Good food though, but horrible customer service skills.\n\nWent in for lunch and ordered bento box. When I received it, it was undercooked. So they took it back. Server looked like I was inconveniencing her. IT'S YOUR JOB. no apologies just skipped out on our table, passed by us multiple times and no acknowledgement. \n\nAlso, beware. They won't tell you about any additional charges for whatever you order until you get the bill.\n\nUNPROFESSIONAL and TERRIBLE service.
