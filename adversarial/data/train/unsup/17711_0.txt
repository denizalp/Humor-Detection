My friend and fellow Yelper Robyn N. put together a little birthday UYE for me at this amazing buffet.  We were joined by Jeromy H. and Scott W.  And of course my daughter, Claire.  \n\nThis is by far the best buffet I have been to in years!  Since it was a Sunday we induged in the mimosas and Bloody Mary's they offered with our meal.  Walking into the buffet area was like walking into a food dream.  There was the usual salad offerenings and some different soups. And several different areas of asian food with my daughter's favorite, fried shrimp, as well as my favorite, coconut shrimp.  There was an omelet station, delicious bacon and yummy potatoes.  I had the best salmon I have ever had!  It was like butter and metled in your mouth.  And there was pizza made right there in the pizza oven.  My daughter and I watched and they made her a special pizza of her favorite topping, black olives!  She loved it!  There were so many choices and everything was delicious.  \n\nAnd desert.....omg!  They have a gelato station with about 12 different flavors.  I tried the Limoncello and it was delicious!  There was pie and cake and pudding and cookies.....my daughter was in heaven!!  \n\nWe had a great time with good friends and delicious food!  I can't wait to go back!
