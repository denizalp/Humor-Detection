I just love it when you are exposed to flavors that is not part of the daily norm.  Its just refreshing to taste unique textures that is palatable while pushing the boundaries of exploration. More so, it expands into the curiosity mindset on how basic ingredients can unite together with such harmony on a plate.  Some people in this world just have that special gift that allows them to be artistic and creative on a plate.  I applaud these chefs. \n\nI ordered the grouper fish paired with cauliflower.  Again, the unison of protein and vegetable with the medium of sauce is just sublime.  Definitely recommend the grouper fish dish.  I also enjoyed the mussels.  It wasn't rubbery, which tends to happen when you over cook it.  The taste was light and flavorful.  You can definitely take bread to the sauce and wipe it clean.  The grilled bread with the ricotta cheese is interesting as well.  The seemingly thick but crispy bread was absolutely nice.  \n\nI feel that this restaurant found its way on delivering dishes that is mapped out quite well. Taste, texture, and service is well thought out here.  Especially when the server took notice of our sharing and split our entrees.  Love it when people are mindful of such details.  \n\nI would recommend anyone to stop by this establishment and enjoy a memorable meal.  \n\n**You may want to call in to inquire about its location since its not visible from the streets.**
