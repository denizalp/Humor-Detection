yum yum yum yum YUM!\nI'm visiting Toronto and trying to hit up as many vegan places as possible. We went here on a rainy Sunday afternoon for brunch and it was wonderful!\n\nMy friend and I both got the BLT and her boyfriend got the unchicken and waffles. Both dishes were huge portions. While the \"bacon\" in the BLT didn't taste as good as tempeh bacon (to me), it was still so satisfying and filling. The home fries were the perfect blend of crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and balanced seasoning. The unchicken on the waffles was probably what impressed me the most. Best mock chicken I've ever had and the breading was to die for!!\n\nOverall, super happy AND full. Thanks Hogtown! :)
