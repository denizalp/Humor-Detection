Loved this place!! Absolutely delicious! It's a little hole in the wall but packed because it's so delicious! \n\nThey allow you to taste test before deciding, unfortunately it didn't help because everything tastes amazing! I had the carnitas and jerk chicken fried rice. They also add a nice touch with a warm soft snickerdoodle cookie!  I will definitely be coming back!
