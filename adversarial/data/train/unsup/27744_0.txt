Went here for lunch with my 7 year-old daughter. It was a mixed experience. We walk in and there is a sign instructing patrons to wait to be seated. So we wait. And we wait. Strike 1. \n\nNo host or hostess ever shows up, so eventually the bartender points to a booth and we go sit down. And we wait. And wait some more. Strike 2. \n\nSo now we have been in the place about 10 minutes and still no server, no drinks, no menus. I start to explain to my daughter why I think we should just get up and leave, and just then a waitress finally shows up. She is pleasant and she brings us menus and drinks. But I notice that the people next to us, who have a different server, are given a menu containing specials. So I ask our server to see the specials since she did not bring those to us. Strike 3.\n\nThe menu is amazing. We order, and the food is delivered super quickly. And it is delicious. So far, all the problems we have faced here are service-related. The kitchen appears to be performing optimally.\n\nI get up to use the bathroom and it is occupied. I get up later and try again and it is occupied. I get up a third time to use it and finally it is free. Why the hell does a restaurant this size have a restroom for only one person at a time. It clearly needs a larger restroom. Strike 4.\n\nI ask for the check and it arrives quickly. I place my credit card on the check and we wait. And we wait. And we wait some more. Strike 5.\n\nThe place was not very busy and the service was still awful. But the food was delivered quickly and tasted great. My advice for managers is to do some serious re-engineering on your service quality with a particular focus on servers and hosts\/hostesses. And while you're at it, give the folks in the kitchen a pat on the back for a job well done.
