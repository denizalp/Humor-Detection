An interesting experience with an 'ehhhh' comfort level. The dining style is confusing. After the waiter described the menu to our table, we were all convinced that we surely needed a degree in nuclear science to understand it. The stark decor and interesting kinetic art hanging from the ceiling was more interesting than comfortable. Being a vegetarian with a gluten allergy proved to be an unfortunate combo when dining with a group of coworkers in a family style only dining option. The waiter explained that I would have plentiful cauliflower and rice to suit my dietary needs. I could barely contain my excitement as I watched my party dig in to what I am told was an excellent meal. On a brighter note, the noodle spinning was a bright spot of much needed entertainment. 3 stars for what I am assured by others was a one-of-a-kind meal....the cauliflower and rice was not worth $100+.
