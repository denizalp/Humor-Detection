I really want to love this venue, however, the General Admission\/Pit can make your experience there chaotic.  I recently went to a show at The Axis and had the worse time just to trying to reach the Pit area.  Once the doors open, the GA guests push\/run to get into a second line...  which then you wait...  and then once again you have to hopefully not get trampled as you make your way down to the actual area.  Security should let GA guests in 4 at a time so that guests do not have to panic about their safety.
