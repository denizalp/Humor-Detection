I got introduced to this place by my co-worker... it's a street side old convenience store looking place by the airport, completed with the \"Pepsi\" store sign that says Dixie Grill & Grocery.  So it looks \"questionable,\" but let me assure you that they do serve food here.\n\nWe normally go on Wednesdays (um hum, today) for the cheeseburger lunch special... for $5.25 you get a cheeseburger (I get mine with chili & slaw), side and tea.  The other lunch specials through the week are: Monday 2 hot dogs, Tuesday chicken tenders, Wednesday cheeseburger, Thursday BBQ, Friday porkchop sandwich and Sunday Dixie dog (not sure what that consist of).  I normally get onion rings as my side, but the tater wedges are great too.\n\nPersonally the owner lady is the highlight of the visit.  She's this feisty older lady who sometimes has a different sense of hospitality (especially toward the male patrons).  But to me, she's always nice and sweet.\n\nI like this place... for similar price, I would much rather enjoy my burger here than any fast food joint.  It has characters, make a great quick lunch place.  And that beer walk-in chest is very tempting during lunch :)
