Went for the first time tonight after this place has been open about a month. First impressions were very good. Warm greeting when we entered. We decided to sit at Sushi Bar and had a friendly sushi chef that was very eager to please. The menu is very large with a lot of custom rolls not found anywhere else. The choices re cool but also a little much to digest. The sushi chef recognized this and asked what fish we like best. After we replied, he suggested a \"Special Roll\" and it was awesome. Very good flavor and fresh. The service was VERY attentive, almost too much so. The staff works in teams and is very aware. I was asked three times in two minutes by three people if I wanted a drink refill. Too me, i like having too many requests than none at all. Overall, nice place we will go regularly.
