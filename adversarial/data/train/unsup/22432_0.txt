SRP Sucks!!!!!!! They charge an initial $275 deposit. I was somewhat okay with this. Phoenix is a big city and I can understand that they need to make sure you pay for what they're providing. I was not aware however, that every time you're late paying your bill, they will shut off your power immediately (no warning, or grace period) and for each time you're late - they charge you ANOTHER $275 DEPOSIT!!!!!!!!!! SRP is not required to give this money back to you until you terminate services with them. They say you'll get your deposit back after 18 months, but I've just read several consumer complaints online saying otherwise. Apparently, they assess your credit after 18 months, and if it doesn't meet their criteria they don't have to give your deposit back. Also, if you've had even ONE late payment, they do not have to give you your deposit back after 18 months. Can you imagine how much of the Valley's money they're sitting on right now? I've only used SRP for 4 months now and because I was late on one payment, I've now accrued over $600 in fees and deposits - this doesn't even include my power bill. Total crooks. I HATE SRP and I hope the people that run this company get what they deserve some day.
