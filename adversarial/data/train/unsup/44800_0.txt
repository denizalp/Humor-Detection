Lotus is an original boutique with a few Charlotte locations.  I often look in the Dilworth location because I am intrigued by something in the window.  However, once I get inside I typically realize that what had seemed great from a distance was almost obnoxious tredny up-close.  I do like that the clothes at Lotus are reasonalby priced and that they aren't the run of the mill mall clothes that everyone has.  I have found a few cute things here, but I usually leave this place disappointed.
