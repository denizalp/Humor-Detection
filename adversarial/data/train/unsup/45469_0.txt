Came here on the night of the ice storm for my girlfriends Bday, originally we were a group of 17 but that dropped to 9 and they were very accommodating. I stuck to beer but most of our group dove into the huge cider selection. There are a lot of different types that are not available in stores... we want to go back to try a batch that was fermenting. The food was awesome! I got the chicken Schnitzel and it was amazing! All in all the staff at the ciderhouse when above and beyond for us all night and made it a birthday to remember. We will be back for sure
