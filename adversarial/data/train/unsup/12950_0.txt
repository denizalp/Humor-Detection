Does healthy have to mean small portions? I ate sandwich  split side order of \"fries\" and split a desert 2 hours later I am hungry again and out about $30. \n\nI do like the concept local veggies, meat free food and contemporary atmosphere. But $12 for a BLT and $11 for a Kale salad was a bit steep for a place where I order at the counter, refill my own water etc..  \n\nThis is the crux of my issue the lack of value. \n\nThe BLT it self was decent, the Tempeh bacon was a bit sparse, the tomatoes were good as were the greens. The Side of hummus was bland and came with a few fresh veggies.\n\nThe Kale salad was good with a large flax seed chip, fresh kale and many other ingredients.\n\nThe pomfrits (french fries) were not as great mealy slices of potato under cooked in oil.\n\nThe Desert the almond joy $4 was quite decadent and tasty , however we decided to get this later on and had to wait in the slow line to order to get this.
