This place is great. My mom's kitty is named Abbey Kitty. She is from the street Abbey that Gateway is on. She is a long haired kitty and her fur gets knotted up and dreadlocked. We get her grooming taken care of here. It reminded me of when I worked for the Cuyahoga County and had to take unpaid days off as a cost saving measure for their budget. Why you ask? Because we get her fur low (furlough). They really do take care of the animals here.
