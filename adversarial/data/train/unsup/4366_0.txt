This place is so great. Always very chill and relaxing to come to with the nicest bartenders, especially Lisa! I don't even have to worry about creepers creeping either ;) \nThey have a 24 hour menu so you can get your fat on anytime of the day. Plus a dining room area so Hunnie Bunnie can come and chill too :)\nSuper convenient that it's right across the street from the crib too so it's a short walk away! \nAnd TV's to catch your favorite sports.
