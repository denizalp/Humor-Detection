In a search for some not-too-pricey dinner that we could grab relatively quickly before heading to an event at The Sony Centre, my friends and I considered a couple of joints directly across the street before settling on Loaded Pierogi a short walk away.\n\nI'm glad we went, because the $12 average per plate was reasonable, and we were able to order a few types to share.  I chose The Cabbage Patch Kid and Wild Mushroom & Truffle, and my friends chose the Bacon, Sauerkraut, and \"Oh Yeah\" Bacon plus the Donald Duck.  My favourite was the Wild Mushroom & Truffle.  \nAlthough there isn't much actual truffle in the dish, I enjoyed the mix of sauteed fresh mushrooms together with the creamy goat cheese.  A lovely mix.  \n\nOne of my life fantasies is that I will someday become a rich old lady, wearing overwhelmingly odorous perfume, wrapped in Macklemore's thrift shop-style coat, hurling cats at people while screaming \"What the hell is this crap? BLACK truffle? I only eat WHITE TRUFFLES!\"  Heh heh heh.  This will mess up the horrendously applied red lipstick as I throw a major fit, but it will be worth it.  But, I digress...\n\nThe confit duck leg on the Donald Duck was a bit salty for me, but everything else was pretty good.  \n\nThis place kind of reminds me of poutine or fries places, where you can load it up with whatever toppings you want on a relatively bland medium (the potato, or in this case, the pierogi).  You'll be asked whether you'd like your pierogies regular or crispy, where regular is boiled and crispy means fried.\n\nService was very friendly and would check in on us from time to time, asking us whether we were enjoying our meal and to refill drinks or water.  I asked for two cups of ice for my menopausal, hot-flashing self (y'know, cause I was channeling my inner, crotchety old lady persona) and she happily obliged.  \n\nEach dish comes with 8 pierogies, and each sweet\/dessert dish comes with 4 pierogies.  My friend M lamented that the strawberry & chocolate pierogies, served fried, contained only a drizzle of chocolate rather than large pieces of it, but I think she's still glad she got this item (it wasn't listed on the menu).  I'd come back and try the sweet apple & caramel mix one next time.
