After a long drive to Vegas from the Bay Area, we were looking for a bite to eat before checking into our hotel. Instead of the usual expensive resort fare, we decided to duck into Island Style instead and have a light snack. Right. \n\nIsland Style is a very unassuming place in the middle of a nondescript strip mall on the west side. As plain looking as the place is, it is really about the food. I had hot rock Bil Bum Bop and the Missus had a combo that included the best tasting Kalbi ever. The homemade Kim Chee (cabbage, Radish, and cucumber versions) was terrific. Everything on the menu is hand made. As we were walking out, they were making fat hand stuffed won tons.\n\nThe only down side was that we ended up eating everything to the point that we may have to beg off on our dinner reservation at the big time strip restaurant.\n\nI have to go back for some Moko Loko for breakfast before I leave town.
