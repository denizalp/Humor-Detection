I am all over town during my day.  When I have to get gasoline, I want it to be quick and I am on my way.\n\nI am very displeased at the gas pump set up at South Decatur and the 215 Beltway.  I pulled up to the first pump and I was confused as there was no keypad, no card reader and there seemed to be no way to operate the pump.  So I figured it was out of order.  I got in my car, drove to a second pump.  There was a keypad but no card reader.  There were no instructions.  I looked all over the advertising, the pump and I figured I was going to have to go in.  \n\nBeing forced to go into the store is irritating to me because I want to get going on my way as soon as possible.  If the management thinks that making you come inside is the way to increase C Store sales, that is wrong on two counts.  I am not going to buy from the store because you are costing me time and hassle that I don't have to deal with from other stores.  Secondly, you are losing money on gas revenue because I have to guess how much to put into my tank instead of just filling up.  To fill up would have purchased probably another $10.00 of gas, but I am not going to put myself in a situation where I have to come back in again, deal with a line to settle the difference.  Competing gas stations are not set up this way.  This set up feels like a backward way of doing business and it does not motivate me to want to trade here.\n\nMy gas receipt said it was Qaraman Sunset\/Decatur.  \n\nThe attendant did offer to keep my card and ID at the register so I could fill up.  In this day and age?  No way.  \n\nSo I'll be on my way.
