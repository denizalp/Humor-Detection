Wonderful place for dog-lovers to get quality food and products for our 4 legged family members! Staffs are always so courteous and friendly. So worth paying little xtra for better-made food in my opinion than dealing with \"unnecessary\" health problems due to cheaper food. My dogs even enjoy going for their washes there, except my bulldog hates the blow-dryer X)
