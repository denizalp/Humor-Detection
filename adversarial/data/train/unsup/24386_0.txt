This place dummy lit. Walk into the lobby, was greeted by a balding middle aged man with the warming words of \"howdy\". He eyeballed me the entire time as I slid past the Starbucks. I knew this place was gonna be good when I glanced over a booth and saw a man the size of an elder orangutan casually chowing down on his entree with a pair of Beats headphones on like it was an everyday occurrence.\n\nAs I made my way past the rabbit food, I was judged by a wannabe Italian chef because I didn't show interest in what he had to offer. Even the don, Papa John, wouldn't call that crap he was serving \"pizza\".\n\nI settled for the soup of the day, which consisted of leftover bacon from breakfast which was not eaten and various scraps from throughout the week. Another mans trash is another mans lunch. Seating was comfy on the 2nd floor where I sat.\n\nI originally came for just lunch, but the show came free. Minding my own business eating lunch then BAM, QT3.14 hottie comes walking by to take a seat in the booth next to me, solid 20\/10. Would settle down for life.\n\n5\/5, would eat leftovers and quest for future ex-wife again.
