My poor husband has a life of \"where is she taking me now?\" and this was our latest adventure.    Let me be honest and say that I don't give two shits about KISS and am not a fan (I'm not an un-fan, just not a fan).  So why did I want to do this?  Because it looked ridiculous.  \n\nAnd it was.  Ridiculously fun.  Although the course is small-ish, some of the holes are HARD!  (That's what he said.)  Employees were extremely friendly and the two of us had a ball on the course.  At $23 for the two of us, it was definitely a cheap thrill in Vegas.  \n\nIt is NOT on the touch-kiosk but it's on the bottom floor.  Look for the tiny KISS car with a huge tongue (and it explicitly asks that you not sit on the tongue - where have I heard that before?) and it's just behind that.  \n\nWe weren't staying anywhere close and made the trip over to the Rio just for this.  Totally worth it and I'd do it again.
