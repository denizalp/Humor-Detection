My family and I stopped in for dinner and trivia night. What a fun time! The atmosphere was chatty, friendly, and comfortable. My grandparents, dad, and younger siblings were all able to participate in and enjoy the trivia. We will definitely be back for that.\n\nThey've got a nice beer selection, and all are at a reasonable price. The food is bar food- nothing super spectacular, but exactly what I want to be eating with a good beer and great company. I tried their pulled pork sandwich and would recommend to any meat eaters out there!
