If you're tired of Starbucks, come to Mighty Cup.  It just might be the coolest coffee shop I've ever set foot in.  The crowd is really eclectic, and it's the perfect place for an artist to hang out at.   The shop is in historic Glendale and while they do serve great coffee, they also sell retro clothing, art from local artists and other little knick-knacks. \n\nWhen you walk in, you don't feel like you're in just another coffee shop either.  You'll feel like you're in someone's artsy home...So right away, you feel welcome and oh so less corporate. \n\nThey also have these great comfortable chairs for you to sit in while you people watch or drink a cup of coffee.  Their food is pretty tasty too- they have pastries, muffins and sandwiches.  And if you're looking to be entertained, they have poetry readings, and live music on the weekends.
