I went looking for a sewing machine!  I found 2 but chose 1 of them, it was a Singer.  Ohhhhhhh I was super excited!  I talked them down a bit, so I walked out the door paying $30.00.  But once I got it home, and wiped it down and plugged it in, I found some issues.  And for me to buy the parts, this machine would have cost me about $75.00  I can buy a new one for that price.  So when I took it back, I decided to get the Brother sewing machine $32.00 out the door.  I thought it looked like something was missing!  there was a part that goes under the sewing foot, the whole panel was missing.  And the stem for the thread was missing!  Uggggg, They had other machines, they were more expensive!  At this point, and the 2 returns already, I wasn't willing to buy another one, just to have to take it back.  I love the pawn shops this just wasn't a good buy, specially if you have any experience with sewing, and machines.  I will just get a new one!
