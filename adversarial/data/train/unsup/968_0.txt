Had the prime rib philly cheese dip and it was good but the meat is fatty and au jus was Sorta gross.  Garlic fries are tossed in garlic oil or something so they're just soggy. Steak nachos don't have \"a ton of cheese\" and was just ok. Old fashions not the best either, tasted like ordering an old fashioned at a club. This plus a glas of Pinot was $69. Plus side was bartender was very cool.
