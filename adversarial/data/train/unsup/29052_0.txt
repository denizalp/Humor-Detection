This Red Robin is absolutely the worst. It's not even the food! The service is ALWAYS terrible! The hostesses are always welcoming and nice and friendly, but the servers are awful. They never listen to what I order. I always order sweet potato fries when I get a bottomless side- and whenever I ask for more, they always bring back regular fries and cop an attitude with me when I remind them that I had sweet potato fries (even when I've already told them what I wanted when I requested my refill). Refills on drinks are always an issue, too. You'd be better off pacing yourself with your first beverage because you're unlikely to get a second regardless of how many times you ask for one, and you can bet that if you get a second drink, it won't even be anything close to what you ordered. Don't expect your service to be quick, either. It usually takes an hour for a salad with grilled chicken to come out to you. I keep giving this place a chance because RR is special to me and my husband, but this location is just not living up to expectations. No matter how many surveys I do when I do decide to give them a chance, nothing changes and I just get invitation emails to take more surveys.
