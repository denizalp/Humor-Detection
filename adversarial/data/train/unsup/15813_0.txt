Bobby Flay's restaurant in Vegas? I had to pay it a visit during my stay. \n\nThe restaurant decor was colorful and unique. You can't miss the restaurant if you're walking by. \n\nTheir complimentary bread basket was good. I especially enjoyed the corn muffin. I loved how it was baked with half yellow corn and half blue corn. I thought that was pretty cool. However, I wished that the corn muffins and the cranberry wheat bread were served warm like the jalapeno bread. They were served room temperature and after awhile it became very cold. Bread is just so much better when it's hot and warm! \n\nFor an appetizer we shared the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale. It was soooo good! This was my favorite dish of our meal. The only thing was that for a $20 appetizer, you would expect more than just 3 pieces of shrimp. \n\nFor entrees my boyfriend got the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops and I got the Mango + Spice Crusted Tuna Steak. \n\nMy boyfriend really enjoyed his lamb chops. I thought my dish was just okay. I thought that there was way too much flavor going on. The cous cous that came with the tuna was spiced way too heavily. The tuna was already seasoned with a lot of spice, so there's not really a need to serve it with heavily spiced cous cous. The flavors of the tuna and the accompaniments were too intense and it didn't go well together. \n\nOverall, although my entree wasn't satisfying, I don't regret coming here because I finally got to try one of Bobby Flay's restaurant. However, because of the price and the just okay food, we probably won't be back. It was a one time experience for us.
