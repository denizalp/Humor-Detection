Being a fan of indian and Pakistani food, there are not many options in Charlotte. So decided to try this one out. First looks ruined my appetite. The restaurant is super small with a few tables and not a good place If you are a group more than 4. \n\nThe items on the menu are limited and 13$ for a buffet is a bit too expensive. I would rather prefer the 8$ saffron restaurant.\n\nThe items tasted okay but a costly one. If you are on a friends' treat try this one. Don't try it on your own.\n\nRemember,  they serve on Paper plates
