Hands down 5 out of 5 stars !!!  \n\nWith almost 30 years as a hospitality\/service professional (currently VP of Operations) and another 10 years as a Physical Education Specialist in CA and NV, I know great service & an excellent product when I see it.  This Center is directed by Calvin.  I have been a patient for 2 weeks (shoulder surgery) and could not be happier with the level of attention and service at this location.  It starts at the top with a \"hands-on\" director (Calvin) and a team of caring energetic therapists and assistants.  When your Orthopedic Surgeon tells you you are in good hands at Tim Soders PT Henderson that reassured me.  Thank you Team Calvin, keep up the great work and attention to detail.  Much respect.
