Cool brewery just outside downtown Cleveland, and next to several other breweries. It's right next to the city market. I tried the Cluster Fuggle, Viking, and Chinook Strike, and liked them all. Also tried a scotch egg, very cool. We just sat at the bar, and service was quick. There was a whole other area in back where a party was, and also an outdoor seating area. It's a good location, and a nice looking place. Ideal spot for doing a brewery call with say Great Lakes and nano nearby. Food menu looked good, next time I'll have to try that
