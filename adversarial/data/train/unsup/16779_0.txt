Dr. Kim and his staff are the most professional and courteous of any dental office ever I been. I have always been afraid of visiting dentist because of lots of bad experience from other dental office. Dr. Kim fixed all shit works from other dentists. Very reasonable price!! He always listens to patients and takes the time needed for each patient. Always explain what he is doing and why need to do. Never ask and sell what you don't need it. I also heard there is a dental lab inside his office, so all crowns made from his office. Fast and accurate!!!\nSo lucky to find him as my Dentist. Very highly recommends
