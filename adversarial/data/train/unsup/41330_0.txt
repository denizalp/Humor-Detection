This place saved me!!! I was dying to get some ahi poke. Just a random craving so I turned to yelp and typed in ahi poke and this spot was the first one to pop out. Definitely a place to try for me since its pretty close to my house. I walked in, I was greeted right away. Then i walked to the counter to look at their poke flavors but nothing was on there! Turns out you just have to ask em and they make it for you. Fish tasted so fresh! The seasonings were on point. I dont usually write reviews for places but this definitely made me happy! My number 1 poke spot!
