I was  looking for a good steak to try and I was referred to this place by two different people so  I decided to give it a try and take my girlfriend here for something a little different.  I was warned that this was out in the midle of residential homes and the tip was right.  The place has an old school vegas feel to it.  Upon entering we were immediately greeted by a lady that we presumed to be the owner...Super nice.  The decor is very old and there are photos of old vegas all around the place.  It was empty at first but the restaurant filled up pretty quickly.  \n\nThe service started off awesome but as the restaurant began to fill up it slacked up a little.  For appetizers we had fried calamari which was the bomb and stuffed mushrooms.  The stuffed mushrooms were some of the best stuffed mushrooms I've had in awhile.  \n\nThe house salad was not all that great to be honest.  I only had a few bites of it.  I should have gotten the potato soup but since I knew I was getting the twice cooked baked potato I didnt want to overdue it on potato.  \n\nI had heard that they had a 32 ounce porterhouse steak and I was dying to try it.  I also heard that if you finished it you get desert for free.  So I ordered the 32 ounce steak medium rare.  It came a little burned and rare in the middle which I could live with. Rare..medium rare....blah blah its all the same to me.  I loved the steak!  I finished it and got the deset for fee.  \n\nThe carrot cake was some of the best I've ever had before.  Delicious.  \n\nIf your looking for a new spot to try out and havent been here before I'd definetly try it out.  For me it's not some place I'd go to often because it's a journey out there for me and a little pricey if your paying for two.
