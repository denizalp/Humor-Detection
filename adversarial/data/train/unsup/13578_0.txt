I can't believe South Carolina has a Popeyes chicken. They are in just about every town in Mississippi. They even have one in my home town in Mississippi. So, every now and then I crave their red beans and rice. It's what makes me come to Popeyes. Secondly, I go to Popeyes for their fried chicken. \n\nAnyway, service today could have been better. They were a little slow on waiting on me. Manager or cashier wanted to talk to customers he just waited on instead of waiting on new customers. They were slow in getting up my order too. They could also smile or hire someone friendlier too.\n\nSee photo:  As you can see the menu items I ordered were; two pieces fried chicken, red beans and rice, with a biscuit and caned sweet tea as Popeyes advertises it. I enjoyed my lunch on this Saturday. One tip I would give is to order the red beans and rice for a side like I do.
