The prior review is dead on! The place reminds me of Jerrys Nugget downtown! The head of maintenance phas a half dozen projects going at once and they are never completed!\nDuring the summer the whole place smells like a sewer from the heat and cracked pipes\nIn the building. Whoever puts up those ridiculous notices in the elevator is an absolute egomaniac with know filters at all! Embarrassing is the best way one can describe it!\nRun don't walk away from this old folks home!
