This restaurant is not a place you go on a romantic date. You go here when you want to enjoy some authentic ethnic food.\nThis is a plain cafe in a mini strip mall in view of Walgreens.\nOnce you have recovered from the shock that you are not going to experience a candle-lit dinner you can start focusing on why you are here; you are here for the wonderfully tasty food.\nThe menu is chock full of interesting Afghani dishes.\nThe dish I ordered contained a whole chicken. Needless to say, I took some home with me. My dish would have fed a family of four easily. The naan that accompanied the dish was unbelievable. It tasted like manna from heaven.\nThe four of us polished off most of what we ordered and we left full and happy.\nThis is definitely a place I would return to eat again.
