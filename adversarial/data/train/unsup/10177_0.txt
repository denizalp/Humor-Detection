Good food, BYOB, noisy, good service.\nCheck out the back of the menu.  I know the routine here but it says table is yours for 90 minutes.  BYOB is $2.50 per person and $10 for the next bottle.  Although I have never been charged that amount.  This seems to turn off some of the party even though we told them in advance.  It is worth it for BYOB.  We have always finish in about 90 minutes, though we did not get desert this visit.  You can request longer when you make your reservations.   \nWe came with a group of 12 to celebrate.  Had a good time and everyone enjoyed their meal.  A few had never been before and stated they would come back.  \nWe split some greens and beans.  Enjoyed the little garlic bread sticks with the oil.  I had a special of the day that was Blackened Salmon and Shrimp on a bed of ravioli.  Cooked perfectly.  Very tasty.
