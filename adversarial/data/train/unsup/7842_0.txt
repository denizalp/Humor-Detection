This is my first of many reviews from our mini stay in Vegas. The reason I chose this to review this one first was to warn you. Do not get suckered into trying this wanna be \"steakhouse\". The premise seems cool @ first, every 20 minutes or so the decor of the restaurant changes, but after a couple \"switches\" it gets old. \n\nSo, onto the meal. To be honest, the meal I had was not bad at all. I kept it simple since I wasn't super hungry. Started off with the lobster bisque, which was actually excellent. Rich creamy bisque and an ample amount of lobster. Was off to a great start. \n\nFor my meal, I had the kobe beef carpaccio w\/arugula salad and mac & cheese. Both were good, but I wasn't blown away by either.  \n\nMy real \"beef\" with this joint is two fold. The first problem is, we went here being enticed by the \"Taste of Wynn\" menu they had offered. An app, entree and dessert for $69. On the website, they offered a 9oz filet. However, once you got in the door, the filet was not an option. Instead the substituted a \"sliced\" NY Strip. When we asked the waiter, they said they stopped offering the filet because they were losing money. Really? You're losing money because you're offering an $8 cut of meat for $60? Hmmmm.....\n\nHere's a tip you pretentious used douchewater recepticle. You're not losing money because you're offering filet at a \"discounted\" price. You can't get people in the door because the food is average, overpriced (albeit expected since it is Vegas), but the service is absolutely horrible. We barely saw our server besides him taking our order and presenting our check. And for what we paid I expected a little more. Maybe if the waitstaff didn't act like they were doing you a favor by bringing you the meal you are paying an arm and a leg for you'd be able to get people in the door.  I must not be the only one with this opinion either since the restaurant wasn't even 1\/4 full on a Friday night. Unless someone else was paying, I wouldn't go back.
