We enjoyed this monument- which is undergoing restoration.  It is surrounded by large cast bronzes of realistic battles.  We didn't see the inside on the weekend, which is also probably interesting.   We were impressed by the inclusion of an African American in the mortar grouping- this is not common on civil war monuments.
