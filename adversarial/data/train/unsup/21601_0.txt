I came here to buy some fresh local eggs thinking they would be humanly raised. As I parked the car I happen to see one of the owners who I asked to show me their chickens. We went into this building across their store where they keep all their chickens in a big cage, they were crammed,  jumping on top of the other, some barely had any feathers! I left that place and never went back.
