XS cargo rules. It's shopping and gambling at the same time. Gambling in the sense that the \"NO REFUNDS. PERIOD\" clause means taking a chance on buying something that was discontinued for reasons that would only come to surface once you used the product.\n\nIn this case my last visit to XS was a straight flush.\n\nB&D coffee grinder, spice jars, carafes, even the table I'm typing this computer on was all under $20. I even got enough pasta to last me the apocalypse.\n\nI had my handsome eyes eyeing the foreman grills...handsomely.\n\nI'll be back XS.\n\nps. They do have the most AWKWARD shopping carts. They're barely big enough to hold most large purchases and they carry this huge metal rod so that dickbags won't steal them away from the store.
