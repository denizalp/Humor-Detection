This is for the service department only:\n\nI brought my car in because I have been having problems with my vehicle for some time now and no one could duplicate the problem. The first time I brought it in was because my key light came on. I was able to show it to Greg. They ended up doing a software update. He said hopefully that will fix your trunk problem but if not let me know. He followed up a day later. A few days later my trunk latch was not working. I texted him right away and we set up an appointment to get it looked at. Thank goodness for me it was not working when I brought it in and was able to show it to him because by the time it went to the shop it was working fine. He ended up talking to the mechanic and had the latch replaced. Now I am a happy camper. Now if I can get all the other issues to show up again so I can drive it over to them to get fixed.\n\nShuttle service back home and pick up if you do not want to wait. Prompt service on that as well. Can't remember the drivers name but he is super nice.\n\nIf you are in the market for a vehicle, ask for Mo.. worked with him for almost a year and he will take care of you.
