I don't typically post reviews but i feel this is necessary because of the topic. Let's dig in:\n\nI come here often because it's close to where I live and i have established rapport with two lovely ladies there - I wish i could remember their names. \n\nHowever today I had an older gentleman cash me out today - I picked up a few OTC items that my HSA card always pays for, never have an issue and I have at least a few thousand dollars on it (footnote that). \n\nI get up to pay, swipe my HSA card and it declines (sometimes does, the provider likes to make me send in the receipts for the OTC items randomly and won't pay for it right there but rather just reimburse me later, it's understandable - usual for most HSA card users and not new to me with this issue), while this is event is occurring there is a large line in back of me, and he proclaims loudly \"you need to use another card, it declined and you got no money on it\".  Look, it's not so much WHAT he said, it was how LOUD he said it. Regardless of my money available on it - it's still embarrassing with 10 people behind me. \n\nI bluntly asked him \"if he could say that any louder\" and \"if he could be more respectful next time this happens to someone and yes I have another form of payment and i would need my receipt to send to my HSA provider.\" I paid with my own funds and left. \n\nI say all this to say is this is a learning opportunity for his gentleman and any other staff. This was absolutely rude and embarrassing and though it declined - I highly doubt the reason was \"because you got no money\" that was the issue code the register gave him. \n\nI was throughly shocked that this happened. Enough so i felt the need to write a yelp review and to email corporate  and share my review on my different social media accounts about this. What in anyone's right mind that this was ok to say to someone? I'm open to dialogue around it.
