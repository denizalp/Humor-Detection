After an unfortunate incident with a landlord who didn't understand how renter\/rentee relationships should generally work, my husband and I had pretty much no choice but to move in here. We've been here for about 3 months now. Is the area ideal? Not really. Are there a lot of different kinds of people around,  including a few unsavory types? Sure. \n\nThe inside of the apartments are clean, furnished, not the most cramped I've ever seen, and from what we have seen, the roaches aren't running the place. We actually rarely see a roach and when they start coming around, here's someone from the office coming to handle the situation. \n\nLook, it isn't exactly luxurious but free Wi-Fi which is actually decent, free cable, clean living quarters, and staff who are pleasant for the most part... I can't complain. I deal with the arguing neighbors because I see a staff who tries their best(and even on occasion go above and beyond to work with people) given the level of anxiety they deal with on a dialy basis, I deal with living in a weekly because they are helping us save money in the hopes that we will get back into a house someday soon. \n\nEveryone is entitled to their own opinion but honestly I feel a lot of these reviews are coming from a very superficial place, as well as highly exaggerated.
