Metro Pizza is a family environment with decent pizza, but I can say from experience that service here is a hit or miss... they either will always be at your table or only visit once and forget about you, at least from my experience. The pizza is decent, a little overpriced if you ask me, and a nice environment. I'll go back when I get the chance but it's nothing super special personally.
