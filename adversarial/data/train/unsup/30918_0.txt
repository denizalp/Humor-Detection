Absolute favorite happy hour spot!!  The best food and drink specials around.  The service can be spotty, but only because they get so darned busy for this great happy hour.  I love this place overall.  I am a member of the wine club and used to frequent their wine tastings on Fridays.  Food is great, service in the restaurant is far better than most.
