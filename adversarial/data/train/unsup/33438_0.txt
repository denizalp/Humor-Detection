I concur with most of the reviews here. The doctor here is good and deliberate but their support staff and their processes for getting doctor feedback after a visit is atrocious. I only come back for the doctor, else there is no reason to come here. It takes a week to hear back on any question with the doctor and even then the response is unsatisfactory. Hope the management sees these reviews and tries to improve their services in the future.
