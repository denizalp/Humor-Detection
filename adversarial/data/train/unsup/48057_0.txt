We stood at the front no one would even acknowledge us ,we seated ourselves waited another 5 minutes without anyone ever coming to our table. On the way out I asked why no one would acknowledge us and got some kind of mumbling and we made our way to the Korean barbecue next door SCORE!!! I highly recommend this place SAM WOO can go without our business.
