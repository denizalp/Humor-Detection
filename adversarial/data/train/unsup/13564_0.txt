#48\/2016\n\nIt took a full 45 minutes to get through TSA security \n\n(It was spring break so timing might be better or worse, be cautious and plan ahead.)\n\nOnce you're through, you're practically at your gate- no tram ride to another area of the airport like I'm used to at LAS.\n\nClean, adequate seating and decent stores & a restaurant\/bar or three.\n\n...and some one-armed bandits who'll grab those last dollars you feed them out of your pocket before you fly away!
