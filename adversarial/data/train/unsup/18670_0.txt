I'm fairly one to rate a place like this low, and when I began this review I sincerely wanted to toss them a 2 star based on price alone, but after some consideration I upped the extra star and here is why.\n\nThis place gets full marks on being unique, sheik, and trendy. The also produce a quality cup of premium coffee that I would say is second to none. However, as I mentioned before the major deterrent for me here is price. You wanna talk pretentious prices? This place makes Starbucks look like a Coffee time! Two coffees and a small piece of cake came out to $20! \n\nI don't care how perfect my Americano was, how crisp and clean finishing it was and how it didn't need a pinch of sugar or milk in it. AND I don't care how unbelievable the chocolate cake sliver (not slice... sliver) was, $20 for 3 items without getting properly fed is redic!\n\nI will say that if you're looking for a key date spot fella's this is a great one. It's classy, sophisticated and polished. Staff are nice and the location is great! But still, my god the price!!!\n\nAnd just to try and sweeten the deal, the staff handed us a full box of canoli's as we were leaving stating that they would just go to waste any way... stop trying to buy my vote ha ha
