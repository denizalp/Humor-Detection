This chipotle has so many different employees working here that every time I come here I feel like I'm in a whole new location... The lines are always out door which is a bit ridiculous with the amount of workers I see working here... I remember at the original location the hippy lie only had 4-6 workers and they would bust their butts to make the line go away.. Lines were rarely out the door and when they were, it was only for a brief moment (2-4 minutes).\n\nThis location has a lot of young workers who talk and play around more than they actually work...\n\nOverall the food is consistent... Some of the workers are pretty stingy when it comes to providing you with portions.. (By stingy I mean I asked for cheese on my burrito bowl and he guy with dreads put literally 5 strands of cheese on there and when I asked for more he told he it would be an up charge.. What a joke!). Basically my review is mainly based on the service in this location... Food is good and taste just like any other chipotle..
