Honestly, the WORST place I have ever been to. Pretty bad sheesha (never ever try the vanilla). We ordered food and 45 minutes we walked up to a server to check for our order...and guess what? They forgot to put it in. I've never been so disappointed. Mazaj and Haze are definitely x5383829292 better. Never coming here again. Stay clear of this place. Servers are absolutely inattentive... Do yourself a favour and save yourself the misery of coming here.
