\"This ain'nt no Yorkdale, This ain't no Square One.  This ain't no Eaton Centre!\" to the tune of \"Life During Wartime\" and with my deepest apologies to the Talking Heads.  \n\nAh, the Suffering Hall - Retail purgatory with convenient-ish TTC access and plenty of free parking.  \n\nThe Dufferin Mall is Toronto's in-city down-market destination mall.  Under one very large one level roof one can find almost 150 retail shops anchored by WalMart , NoFrills, and ToysRUs.  No \"flagship retail\" in this port of commerce.  People enter and exit the tastefully renovated premises with consumption on their minds and they tend to get in and get out having gotten things done. Pretty much the original design goal of the shopping centre. \n\nIt would be easy for me to deride the place as a little bit o' suburbia smacked in the midst of some truly dense urban real estate - oh that would be soooooo easy.  But as I have come to realize, it obviously fulfills a need.  The place is consistently busy (not Yorkdale stupid social busy, just busy) and forensic evidence of those multitudes going and coming there from parts beyond can be seen daily on the # 29 bus and Dufferin Station.  \n\nIf Dufferin Mall wants to be the Mall of the People then I say \"Let them eat Cinnabon!\"  \n\nDid I really just say that?
