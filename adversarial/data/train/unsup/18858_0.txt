It's no surprise that NE Ohio provides tons of family fun options for the summer months, but what about when the cooler, fall season approaches? \n\nPatterson's Family Fun Fest, that's what! \n\nTo be honest with you, I'd come here even if I didn't have any kids to go with. I'd be in line with these little munchkins waiting to go down the big slides in the middle of the forest and climbing up the tree house jungle gym. I'd be soaring high on the tire swings, rolling in the hay and sipping on fresh apple cider. \n\nWhat's wrong with that? Some people are just kids at heart, and I'm one of them.\n\nThis is where I spent my Sweetest Day this year--that's a Midwestern, American Greetings-made holiday for those who are not from Ohio. My parents met my boyfriend, his little boy and I out at Patterson's on a beautiful fall Saturday. Sunny skies, crisp autumn air and gorgeous fall colors. It was like a dream.\n\nWe drove up and hoped on the tractor ride over to the the play area for $6. Seriously, with all the activities they have, that price tag is small. Trust me. As you pull up you see a fall-farm wonderland of happy children running and playing. It just warms your heart. A hay filled playground, tire swings, stilts, sand-filled canoes, tee pees, corn mazes, slides into the woods and a jungle gym deep in the woods that looked like a tree house. Oh there was more, but I can't remember! \n\nIf you'd like to take the kiddies on a horse-drawn carriage, you can buy tickets for $4. Hungry? They've got fresh kettle corn, apple friters, hot dogs and more. Hot and cold apple cider to wash it all down. This place is the definition of fall. And hey, if you didn't bring a lot of cash on you, there are free apples for the munching. \n\nJust take the kids, take your significant other, take yourself. This little piece of autumn nostalgia will take you right back to childhood.
