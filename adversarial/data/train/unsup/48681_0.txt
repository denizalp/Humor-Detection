This place is Very well priced. The staff is great. Their beds are top of the line. My favorite service would be the eyelash extensions. Both astetitions are wonderful. The price for lash extensions is right where it should be. Last  but not least there are great accessories for day to day use or a night on the town. :] The waiting area is very nice as well. Check it out! -M
