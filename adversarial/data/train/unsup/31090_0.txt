My husband and I stayed here for a pool tournament that was held across the street at the westgate. This hotel was half the price and  a lot nicer. The rooms were comfortable and the staff was the best. Always welcomed us with a smile and a greeting. The whole place was clean and modern. We'll be staying here again!
