After compiling 3 quotes for my custom landscaping job I wanted, I chose AGS. Lowell is very professional and even answered my call on Sunday. I felt the most comfortable with them. The got the job done a few days early and I wasn't charged for anything I wasn't quoted. Lowell even came by a few weeks later and double checked I was happy with everything. It was a nice personal touch. I recommended him to my neighbors and in the past few months he did 2 of their yards and they were both happy. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them again.
