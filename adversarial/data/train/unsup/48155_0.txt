All the 5 star reviews for Mary are probably true, but those folks have never needed her service. I want to start by saying I have been a long term customer of Mary's. Over 10 years. I was recently in a car accident on a hot 115 degree day. I called mary's office and spoke with Heidi. I asked her to walk me through the process. She took general info from me and transferred me to some guy who said he couldn't help me and that my agent should have gone over the details of what I needed to do next. So I hang up and call Mary's office again. No answer. I call again. No answer. I call again ( please know it was 115 degrees outside and I had 2 small children with me). Heidi answered again but could not give me any information. She said she could not help me that I could talk to claims about the process. I asked what my deductible was, I asked if I had rental coverage, I asked if my car would be towed.... She said she could not help me and transferred me to the clowns department again who told me that since it was after 1pm on Saturday that would not get a rental car for me until Monday. Even though I have coverage for it. They also told me because of the time I would need to have my car towed at my expense and submit for reimbursement. Even though I have coverage for it. I had to call them back 4 more times that day asking additional questions and their response was we can help you on Monday during business hours. Very disappointed. 10 years of paying premiums and he first time I need to use them .... I was on my own.
