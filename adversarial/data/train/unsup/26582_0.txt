You wont find a better tasting cake, PERIOD!!!! My family gets all our cakes from Minervas. Their cakes are incredibly moist and the icing is to die for. They have this cinnamon pecan roll that is out of this world! Their donuts, tarts, and dinner rolls are also really good. The only thing that is just okay in my opinion are the cookies.
