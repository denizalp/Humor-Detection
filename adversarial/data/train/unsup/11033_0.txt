Honestly, I was being selfish, and held back on reviewing this one for a long time. Now that the cat's out of the bag, here goes.\n\nI was in need of a freezer cart, and saw one of their ads on craigslist, advertising restaurant equipment. I thought I would take a shot, and see if they had one.\n\nSure enough, they had the perfect one, plus a few other possible contenders. Not only that, the place was jam-packed with used commercial kitchen equipment -- ranges, ovens, freezers, gigantic woks, deep fryers -- everything, and marked cheap.\n\nIn addition, there were tons of old tables, booths, small utensils, china, and heaps of randomness that I could not even describe. Sure, a lot of it is beat, dirty, and worn out. But there are gems within.\n\nAlso, there are what I assume to be construction leftovers outside. Just crate after crate of travertine, marble, granite, sandstone. Perfect for small jobs like a bathroom or a patio. I picked up two slabs to use as pizza stones ($2 each), and I got the pizza peel there too. \n\nIf you happen to go, and see something you like, find out if they have an auction coming up. I ended up buying my cart through the auction, and it saved me about $30. \n\nThere it is. Hope you're happy now.
