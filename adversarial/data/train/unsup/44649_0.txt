While the entree was very good there were other aspects that were not so good.\n1.  There were 4 of us and just behind us was a man talking on his cell phone.  We mentioned to the head waiter that we did not come to this restaurant to listen to some moron on the phone.  Nothing was done.\nWhen you dine at a restaurant of this quality you don't expect to have to listen to people on their cell phones.  Since the people are rude they should be told to please use their phone away from the dining area, either in the bar or in the hall.\n2.  Ordered French onion soup that had to be sent back as the onions were basically raw.  When I told the head waiter the problem he argued with me but eventually replaced the soup with a salad that was skimpy at best and severely over priced.  The quality of the service and food has gone down immensely.  Will not be going back after 7 years of patronizing this establishment.
