Called today to ask a question. Got not one, but two rude employees on the phone. The first one wasn't even listening when I was explaining what I was looking for, she was talking to someone else in the store while I was talking to her. So she ended up giving the phone to someone else when I called her out on it. He made me feel like a complete idiot. Thanks for the help. Definitely wouldn't visit this store if this is how they treat customers before they even get there.
