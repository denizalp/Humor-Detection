This place really should get 2 stars for the grocercy level sushi and sashimi they serve but i will give them an extra star since sushi options are not readily available in Ajax and FOR ajax it is the one eyed man in the land of the blind for uncultivated amateurs new to Sushi...if youve been to Japan or Vancouver or even know the various different quality offerings in the GTA from Japanese, Korean and Chinese sushi chefs, then beware:  this is not the place for cultured palates that know quality sushi. \n\nSomeone summed it up perfectly:  these Chinese people serve grocery, prepackaged sushi you can buy at any Asian market store. \n\nMy problem comes from the gross misrepresentation of its business as an authentic japanese sushi joint. The website states the head chef trained in Japan under japanese masters...I've been to Japan and this business is lying. There's no way anyone who trained under a japanese sushi chef for 10 years would serve this level of disrespectful sushi. I hate to say it but this level of sushi can only be categorized as \"Chinese sushi\".\n\nTo those who don't know it is not a part of mainstream Chinese culture to eat raw fish.  They are all about the frying and the steaming.\n\nCulturally japanese and koreans have raw fish as a part of their diet. Both these cultures know about eating raw fish.  However the concept of sushi and sashimi is uniquely japanese.  \n\nThat is why an authentic japanese restaurants with a japanese trained sushi chef will always be more expensive than one headed by a korean. The chinese ones are usually considered the bottom of the barrel and usually offers all you can eat sushi to bring in the customers (as do a few korean places that dont care for standards).\n\nThis place is a third level Chinese establishment. Don't be fooled.  If you are ok with that...feed your self silly.  As long as you know and you are informed the decision is yours. Be happy.
