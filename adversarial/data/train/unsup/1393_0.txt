I don't think I have words for how great Hollo's is. Just look at their million effing pictures on their site. The paper just...never ends. It's just a giant paper parade.\n\nI'll admit it, I'm a paper obsessed printnerd. Highly obsessed. So years ago when a customer at my old job suggested it, I tried it out immediately and was so impressed. I'm pretty sure it is the only store like it in the entire US. Just giant rooms filled with paper. I don't even think the owners even know what all they have. I think it just collects, and they sell it.\n\nLast time I was there I spent 20 some dollars and left with rolls of paper, and 2 boxes of misc cardstock\/text stock. Massive.\n\nBut beyond my gushing, I'll tell you what they offer: wedding invites, art supplies, art\/design\/illustration\/watercolor\/etc paper, scrapbook bs, cut cardstock (there is a giant room of it, alright), laser paper, construction paper, teaching materials, crafting materials, handmade paper, specialty papers, envelopes (another room full of just them), bags, and more. It's just a huge place.\n\nSadly I have moved to Colorado and am now roughly 1400 miles from my beloved Hollo's, but I'm considering just sending them checks and telling them \"hey pick out neat stuff for this amount and ship it k thx.\"\n\nIf you need paper for any reason, you will not be disappointed.
