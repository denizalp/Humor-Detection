I met a friend for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. I didn't even know anything about this place it's been here for awhile but never really had a desire to even try but what the heck. \n\nI walk in and there are a few tables inside and a bunch of tables outside with a water mister which is required for this AZ heat. Anyways, there menu is above the counter. Sandwiches, sandwiches, and more sandwiches which is fine since it's called Breadcrafters. They lady at the counter was very nice and acknowledged me right away for my order. \n\nI had the Southwest Chicken sandwich which is one of there hot sandwiches. It has slices of grilled chicken with grilled jalape√±os, green chili, avocado on a grilled sour dough bread. Really good. Chicken was moist and the sandwich wasn't that spicy but had the right kick to it. It came with a side and I got a scoop of their potato salad. Really liked that too. I love potato salad and this didn't disappoint. Really good meal. Really good sandwich. \n\nSo what you do is order at the counter, get your own drink, and find your own table. They bring your food to your table. They don't give you anything for your order but the people behind the counter remembers you and bring the food to your table. Very nice touch compared to all these others places. Nice personal touch. Oh yea, they even come by and take your plates away. Very nice. \n\nThis is a very welcoming sandwich spot. Interesting spot. Very casual place. Love the personal touch. Enjoyed the food. Really good. I did notice that there were people always coming in and out of this place so it's pretty popular. So if you want different types of sandwiches then I would say give it a try. I did and really enjoyed it.
