I must first start by saying I am a big fan of Bobby Flay, so it hurts my soul to write this review.  This establishment was filthy!  Food on the floor, spots on the floor, and dirty chairs.  I saw crumbs all over tables,  I witnessed a server rake a few crumbs from the table on to the floor, then she must have realized there were too many so she took the menu and gathered them into her hand.  More crumbs still remained on the table, and at no time did I see a server actually use a towel to wipe down any of the tables.  I saw a patron come in and use a napkin to wipe the table she was sitting at, and I observed a server watch her do it and did not step in to clean.  \n\nIf the front of the house is like this for all to see, I cringe at what may be happening in the kitchen.  Three stars because I enjoyed the LA burger that I had and the Margarita was tasty too.  Please, I ask that more attention is taken to cleanliness.  It was not crowded so there was no excuse for the condition of this place.  Although my burger was good, not sure if I would return based on the untidy atmosphere.
