This place looked like it would be a lot of fun! Unfortunately, the system they use to navigate the songs is incredibly confusing and the selection is downright terrible. Furthermore, the way that their selections work, you have to pick from a confusing computer system. There are no books for people to flip through while others are singing. It also  seems as if they haven't updated their song library since 1986.  Drinks are reasonably priced, though the waitress had no idea how to make basic cocktails (I had to explain to her how to make an Amaretto Sour).
