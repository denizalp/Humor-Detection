All I need to know is that I sent an email asking a question and it took just shy of two weeks to get a response, much too late to organize what I was investigating. Clearly an amateur business owner with a lack of professionalism. With all of the outstanding pole studios I have been to nationally, I wouldn't waste a penny at this one.\n\nEDIT: Wow. So I wrote this review in 2013 - it's February 2016 and the owner just now responded to my review. It's certainly not any business owner's responsibility to address reviews on Yelp, but it you gotta admit, it's HILARIOUS that the point of my review was that it took two weeks to respond to an email, and now the owner responds to my review over TWO YEARS later. Sometimes, it's just better to NOT.
