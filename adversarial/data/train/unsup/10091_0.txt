Would not recommend this place for fish owners. Everything is overpriced. If you are looking for a large variety of inexpensive fish supplies you will not find them here as they have limited stock.  However you will find some basic fish needs here and the staff seem to be very caring about animals. I went there really excited because of the reviews that said this place caters to fish but was disappointed.
