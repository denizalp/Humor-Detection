Ferri's is a small mum and pop grocery\/pharmacy\/florist type of store that only the locals of the M-ville actully go to or are aware of.  They have nice weekly sales and friendly people who still bag up your stuff and carry it to your car if you need help.  They double coupons and carry my favorite lunch meat Boars Head.  They have an on-site butcher, and make their own sausage.  I very much try to support local (non-chain) stores as much as possible and love it that just because it is small they still offer a variety of items and are not burning holes in my pockets.  I will say I hate their parking lot.. Sorry Ferri's, but it stinks, otherwise it's a great stop and I'm happy it's in my hood...
