I love this place! It is a family run business & the owners are super sweet & quality oriented. The main baker, Kinana studied baking in Japan and learned how to make delicious treats like Japanese Cheesecake, which i was excited to see because ive been seeing that all over facebook lately and really wanted to try it. It was super light and fluffy yet decadent, i loved it. Im not too into pastries, but my mom tried them and she loved every single one. Ive taken so many friends here, it has such a nice atmosphere, and its a great place for students to go if they want to hang out or study as they have wifi and its pretty quiet in there. Their chocolate chip cookies are a must try, they are so good.  All in all its amazing, you need to check it out.
