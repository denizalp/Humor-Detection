I hardly ever give 5 stars, but this place definitely deserves it! I just had the best Mexican food at this joint and it was spicy as hell. We had no clue this place cooked everything super spicy, but that's exactly how I love my food so I was super duper happy. They bring you chips and 2 different salsas to start (red chili and salsa verde) and they are both spicy with chunks of chili peppers in them. We told the manager how much we loved the salsas and he went on to tell us how everything they make is from scratch, including the tortillas. I ordered the taco and red chili cheese enchilada platter with rice and beans. I'm a hard critic when it comes to enchiladas and they are super authentic and delicious here! Be warned though: the beans and the red chili sauce are really really really spicy! I wasn't expecting that kind of heat in the beans and I'm definitely paying for it right now as I type, but it was sooooo worth it. I'm a true fan and will definitely return very soon!
