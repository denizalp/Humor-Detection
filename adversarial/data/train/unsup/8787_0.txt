Hmmm, I may be in trouble.  I've already gone on the record saying The Senator is my favourite place for breakfast.  OK, I'm going to call this my favourite place for Sunday brunch.\n\nPeople here have described the food pretty well...it's all excellent!  The latkes, however, deserve a special mention.  They are THE BEST restaurant latkes ever.  Until the FT, I would have said that no \"store bought\" latkes could compete with home made, but these can.  They're fantastic, and Judy keeps them coming.  They are always fresh on the buffet, because they are so popular and are quickly replaced.  Oh, the blintzes are pretty danged good too!
