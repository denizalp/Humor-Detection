Mixed feelings after visiting Esther's Kitchen this past Monday evening!  Our reservation for six was welcomed immediately upon arrival, but the first thing I noticed was how extremely hot it was inside!  The interior will never leave you thinking you are in an Italian restaurant, but that's ok, except for the fact that the eclectic seating will leave you bummed if you end up with the metal chair!  Every fourth or fifth seat is a hard metal chair as opposed to the nicer cushion seating everyone else is enjoying!\n\nThe food is fantastic here, with homemade sourdough loafs and handmade pastas, the attention to that detail is superb!  The Rigatoni Carbonara is such a nice dish with a richness that of course accompanied a heaviness!  Perhaps a shareable dish due to that?  The simplest of dishes, spaghetti and meatballs, was elevated to a nice dish due to some quality meatballs and the handmade pasta!  You can't go wrong with appetizers of the Cauliflower and sourdough loaf with its butter or anchovy spreads!  The cauliflower is apparently the house favorite as it seemed every table ordered it while I was there.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the extreme heat inside definitely took away from the experience as you just couldn't get passed it!  Multiple people in the small dining room were actually fanning themselves, and several were using their napkins to blot themselves which I find unacceptable!  The food at Esther's Kitchen though certainly speaks for itself!\n\nAn update to the hot dining room issue.  The management reached out to me to apologize for the AC issue.  The explanation was that it might be undersized for the restaurant.  I find this to be a honorable gesture to reach out as most do not!  Again, the food speaks for itself!
