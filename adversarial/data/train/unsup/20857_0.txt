So, let me start by saying that the unprofessional manner in which the floor MANAGER conducted himself, was inexcusable.  After filling out the form to sit through the 2 hour presentation, I find out that I marked the incorrect income box on the sheet.  So what do they do, NOTHING!  My friend and I explain the mix up but to no avail.  The manager comes out to tell us that there is nothing he can do with this huge smirk on his face.  \n\nWe were so pissed off that they had us drive all the way out there and would not even listen to the fact that I made a simple error!  The guy I was with was very upset and the manager proceeds to provoke him by saying \"Are you gonna get in my face?\"  \"You wanna hit me, go ahead.\"  SO NOT PROFESSIONAL!  Take your pin stripe suit and your smirk and walk away like a true manager would have done.  Needless to say, this was the worst experience I've had with Worldmark.  Thanks a lot Dan and by the way, learn how to act like a true professional, not a child.
