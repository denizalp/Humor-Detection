A great little hidden Thai restaurant.   Enjoyed our first experience here.  Flavorful foods and nice ambiance.  Great service and attentive staff.  The place looks nicely decorated, simple and clean.  Not sure if they do reservation but no wait when we got here around 630 pm.  Shortly after that they was a bit of a wait.  Overall experience was great.
