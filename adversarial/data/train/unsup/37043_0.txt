The best and tastiest sushi on the west side!  I've been to this place so far about 6 times and always around lunch hour during the week and weekends.  The husband hates anything fish and he loves this place for the atmosphere and the teriyaki chicken (which is delicious).  This is the only place the husband will gladly take me to indulge my sushi addiction.  First, they enthusiastically greet you on coming in and the waitresses\/servers immediately take your drink order.  They are super nice and happy to help the most novice of eaters.  I may love sushi but have a hard time with chopsticks and while trying to use them for the millionth time, one of the servers laughed with me and handed me these training chopsticks.  Not only hysterical but they worked!  They are nice, welcoming and the food is so good it can't be described properly.  The sushi is extremely fresh, well cut and served at just the right temperature.  The sashimi is decent sized cuts of whatever fish served with a wonderful side of green relish.  They have a ton of variety of rolls from raw fish to deep fried.  Be patient with them as some may not have perfect English although they understand perfectly.  They are very very nice and seem to enjoy their customers.  The entire place is a little small with a couple outdoor patios cooled with misters and if you have to wait, it is more than worth it.  The prices are medium not being over the top and not being the cheapest though the food is to die for delicious cooked or not.  The servers are especially gracious with my own weirdness because I don't eat rice so I wind up eating the fish and the center of the roll then moving aside the rice\/seaweed.  Even doing that, the servers are gracious and understanding.  Delicious, tasty and a relaxing atmosphere that will put anyone at ease.  No clue about the happy hour or other times so this is all about the lunch hour.  For a great lunch, try Tokyo Lobby!
