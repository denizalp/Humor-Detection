This was our first visit to Charlotte to visit our daughter in her new place.  She was excited to take us to breakfast at this cute trendy spot, but our  trip to Roots was anything but positive.  \n\nIt's a tiny place with just a few tables so, upon entering we were trying to decide if we should stay or go, as there were no open tables.  This must have annoyed the gentleman at the counter, so we went ahead and ordered.  We asked a couple of questions about the menu, and that obviously annoyed him, as well.  He was incredibly pushy, rude and condescending -  and definitely killed the mood of our fun breakfast out.  I felt sorry for my daughter, who was embarrassed by what was happening, so we tried to make the best of it.  However, I can't give a positive due to the extremely poor service.\n\nBottom line, I spent $14 on two tiny breakfast tacos and a basic drip-brewed coffee in addition to receiving horrible service.  Roots needs to coach their employees to offer a warmer, more welcoming atmosphere to their customers as there are way too many other better restaurant options nearby.  Needless to say,  we'll all be finding a friendlier place to enjoy breakfast next time.
