Love Sonic's Drive in!\n\nA group of us stopped by Sonic's after indulguing on all that is Boiling Crab down the street.\n\nHow did we manage to find space in our stomach after eating BC?!  \n\nI ordered the Oreo Sonic Blast.  Oreo blended with ice cream, topped with whipped cream.\n\nIt was heaven but then again, you can't really go wrong with ice cream.  It was great!
