OMG!!!! I didn't know what to expect of this place but we went on a Friday night and wow it was such a fun night! They played everything from country, hip hop and classic hits! They are so much fun! They have two pianists, a drum player and even play the trumpet! The ambiance was awesome and we will definitely visit again! Plus+No cover!!
