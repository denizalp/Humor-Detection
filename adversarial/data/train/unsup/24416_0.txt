There are many things to applaud Cannibale for. Where does one begin?\nMaybe the bravado to open a unique concept for a barbershop\/drink lounge in Calgary?\nYes I'm sure Google will prove me wrong to tell me it's already being done somewhere else like San Fran, but\ngive me a break, they do EVERYTHING there.\n\nTucked away in corner, the front of Carnnibale is a small barbershop. I can't speak for the quality of cuts one can\nget here considering this area is dominated by 1st Ave Barbershop (slickest fades I ever got in the city). But\ntheir cocktails and desserts were SPOT ON.\n\nDrANKS: My date loved her California Milk Punch: it was light and well balanced and something any pineapple lover shouldn't pass up.\nI on the other hand, nursed a citrus-y but deeply flavoured Malachi crunch. A friend caught up with us and had their old fashioned (which\nI didn't get to try but made a mental note to ask for it in the next visit).\n\nDessert: The Bulleit bourbon pecan pie was delicious and generous on the pecans, but easily outdone by Pretzel Bread Pudding.\nSeriously, salty pretzel and Guinness stout ice cream? Just let your taste-bud's imaginations run wild on that one.\n\nThis place is busy, expect to stand and rub elbows with strangers, make conversation, ask for\/ give out your number, or bring them\nback to your place to show them your movie collection. Just don't get too drunk you lean over a candle and burn your hair.
