Since I'm talking about hiking in the Phoenix area, I thought I'd update my Piestewa Peak review to highlight some of the topics I've been discussing.\n\nPiestewa Peak is sort of a mix between Camelback Mountain and South Mountain Park. \n\nIt's similarities to Camelback Mountain are it's centrality, convenience, views, parking issues, and crowds.\n\nIt's similarities to South Mountain Park are the somewhat boring terrain, albeit it's 100% prettier than South Mountain Park, especially in the spring when everything is in bloom. Another similarity to South Mountain Park, is that this is a no-nonsense trail; it's for people trying to get a straightforward workout. What I mean, is that a lot of us are running most of the trail. You'll see a lot of regulars on a daily basis. I used to do this hike on a daily basis until I switched to Sunrise Trail. Sunrise Trail has all the run-ability as Piestewa Peak, but it's much prettier, and less crowds and parking issues, (and less convenient).\n\nI was here three weeks ago on a Sunday, and the parking line was about a 20-30 minute wait.\n\nCONCLUSION \n\nThis is a must-do at least once and it's a solid mainstay Phoenix area hike.\n\n4\/5 RECOMMEND \n\n****************************************************\n*****************ORIGINAL  REVIEW***************\n\nBACKGROUND \n\nHaving hiked this trail for 20 years, this is what I learned:\n\nTHE HISTORY \n\nLet's talk about Squaw Peak, I mean, Piestewa Peak...\n\nPiestewa Peak is 2,610 feet and is the second highest point in the Phoenix Mountains, after Camelback Mountain, and the third highest in the city of Phoenix. It is located in the Phoenix Mountain Preserve. Piestewa Peak is named in honor of Army Spc. Lori Ann Piestewa, the first known Native American woman to die in combat in the U.S. military, and the first female soldier to be killed in action in the 2003 Iraq War.\n\nI've been climbing this mountain for over 20 years, although, 20 years ago, I was jogging up and back instead of huffing and puffing up and back and I love this hike! The hike is relatively easy and manageable for most, and has remained consistently maintained over the years. My only complaint about the maintenance is that the use and the erosion has made some of the steps deeper and further apart, but that's just nit-picking on my part.\n\nAlso, it was called Squaw Peak, instead of Piestewa Peak. Local Phoenicians weren't happy about the name changes on either side, me included.\n\nOk, first of all, what's with the name change? \n\nShort answer? Politics and \"political correctness.\" Long answer:\n\nSince 1910, the name Squaw Peak had been used in reference to the mountain. Other historic names included Squaw Tit Mountain, Phoenix Mountain and Vainom Do'ag, the Pima name for the mountain. As the term \"squaw\" is considered derogatory by some, numerous efforts to change the name of the mountain were made through the years. State Representative Jack Jackson, himself a Navajo, submitted a bill to change the name annually beginning in 1992, which generated repeated and often raw debates in Arizona.\n\nU.S. Board on Geographic Names policy is to consider changes to features using the word \"squaw\" when approved by local authorities, but petitioners are strongly urged to choose new names that relate to Native American woman and\/or culture. In 2003, newly elected Governor Janet Napolitano petitioned the state board to rename the mountain for Lori Piestewa. The Governor's lobbying, while ultimately successful, proved to be controversial. The controversy stemmed in part from the fact that governor's request violated a required waiting period of five years after a person's death prior to renaming a geographic feature; Piestewa had been killed earlier that year.\n\nThe state board, approved the name change to Piestewa Peak on April 17, 2003, less than a month after Piestewa's death. The U.S. Board on Geographic Names, however, refused to accept a similar petition at the time, citing their own five-year waiting rule. Five years later the board agreed to review the request as the waiting period had passed.\n\nCONCLUSION \n\nBut the name changes ultimately are irrelevant to the hike, and the hike is enjoyable as a daily\/weekly workout and is always a fun place to bring out of town guests to stretch their legs and to look at the beauty of Phoenix, without a super long drive or much effort.\n\n5\/5 RECOMMEND \n\nOF NOTE\n\n*Parking can be an issue depending on the time of day and the time of year. Although there are several parking lots, during peak hours the parking is scarce and you will receive a ticket if you park in the close by neighborhood, so plan accordingly.\n\n*Hours: Daily: 5am-7pm\n\n*For more information:\nhttps:\/\/www.phoenix.gov\/parks\/trails\/locations\/piestewa-peak\/hiking-trail-map
