REVELRY AND REVOLUTION!\n\nI was taking a long exploratory walk through various parts of Calgary, when the Beer Revolution sign caught my attention. I immediately remembered my good times at Oakland's Beer Revolution and decided to to seek my \"40 Ounces of Freedom\" here in Cow Town. \n\nActually, Calgary's Beer Revolution is a little more scrubbed that the funkier Oakland version. My receipt at the end also mentioned the local Brewsters chain. Oh well, the Calgary Revolution has co-opted by The Man. No \"Up Against the Wall Redneck Mother...\" here!\n\nNonetheless, this Beer Revolution is a really nice place. I especially enjoyed the dark woods, the neighbourhood bar feel, nicely spaced and comfortable tables and booths, very good service, and watching sports (mostly CFL, MLB, and Premier League) on the many large TV screens. I should have had the pizza, but instead enjoyed a very tasty order of Truffle Fries. The various draft and bottle beers were electronically displayed and my choice of the Hop Burn High Double IPA was spot on.  \n\nIn Heaven There is No Beer, That's Why I'll Drink it Here (Again).....
