First of all, I was excited about having a boba house so close to us. The place is modern, nothing to wow about. I came to give it a try. There was only one guy working at the counter & I only order a 24 oz taro boba... The serving time was about 10 minutes & this was not a busy day. Just imagine on Friday  or Saturday when people are getting off from the movie. I was disappointed to say the least. If they want to grow , they need to work a little quicker.\n\n11-8-14. Return to this place after the movie. Place is full & people actually leaving before placing their order. There are 4 people behind the counter & wait time this time is 20 minutes. I suggest to the owner to find a solution. People are walking out--that translate to loss revenue. Go to California, learn from Tapioca Express.. They are quick & efficient.  I was actually though about bringing a Tapioca Express franchisee here in Arizona ( Maybe next to JT Boba House).
