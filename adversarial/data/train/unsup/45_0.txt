The service was TERRIBLE.  After our friends waited 45 minutes for food, we asked the staff if it was still coming. They seemed so confused we had to repeat the question several times before they finally assured us it was on the way. Another twenty minutes passed and, when asked again, they denied any knowledge of us having placed an order in the first place.\n\nA pan handler came in and started to harass our table, and refused to leave. After five minutes we asked the staff to help us out but they just stood there, watched, and wouldn't respond. \n\nI ordered a pot of high quality oolong. A small pot arrived with no leaves in it, and the water had clearly been poured at boiling point, spoiling the flavour of the tea. For $5 I expect the leaves to be left in the pot so I can add more water, especially for oolong. \n\nFor a pot of nice tea I will go around the corner to Samadhi Tea House on Baldwin.
