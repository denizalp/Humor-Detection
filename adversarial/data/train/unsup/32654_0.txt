I came in for an alteration on a coat. After telling her that I found her business via Yelp, she ranted for a little while about people on the internet, which was halfway between charming and uncomfortable. \n\nWhen we got down to business however, I was very impressed. I showed her how much I wanted the coat taken in she swiftly told me that it would not be possible without major expense, and gave a very satisfactory explanation of why the expense would be what it was. She also showed me how much she could take it in without making the coat look silly or requiring serious alterations to the shoulders and sleeves. She suggested that the difference probably wasn't worth it, and told me that I probably shouldn't worry about the coat being a little big for the occasion I was going to be wearing it to.\n\nI am always happy to find people who care enough about the integrity of their work that they will give a suggestion that turns away business. From what I can see, customers at AJ's can be certain that Annie will not do only what her customers ask, but will give her earnest advice on what should be done.
