Prime minced beef with licorice herb notes.\nBatatas Brava - roasted potatoes with tomato aioli...again devoured prior to photo.\nCacio E Pepe - black pepper and black truffle pasta that would be the pride & joy of any authentic Italian chef.\nSea Bass - Mediterranean style with perfectly crisp skin and Smokey accompaniment with fresh endive and thinly sliced green apple.\nSpecial of the Day - Seared scallops and a satisfying pea & mirepoix that is light yet hearty. I loved every bite of this dish.\nDonuts with dulce de leche - almost impossible that this doughy goodness is not cloyingly sweet given the cinnamon sugar and golden caramel sauce.\nHalf baked chocolate chip cookie with house made Bourbon ice cream. Ice cream and melt in my mouth chocolate...just get it.\n\nThis was an inaugural dinner to be remembered.\n#SommsofAnarchy
