Crab, shrimp, scallops, oh my, oh my, oh my.... Amazing!\n\nHeaded to Rod Stewart at Caesars so decided to check out reviews to dine at the hotel.  Yelp didn't let me down! \nNice bottle of Cakebread to start then came the shrimp cocktail, I swear they were 6ft long! Jk, but they were huge and served with a lovely horseradish infused cocktail sauce to dip in. \nNext came the scallops and my oh my they are off the charts! Don't miss these gems, they are small but full of flavor.  I almost cried when they were gone.\nThe Caesar salad was delish and next came the Alaskan King Crab Legs! \nThere was no Krusty Krab here! (SpongeBoB) 1 HUGE leg of the sweetest most tender crab, cracked open table side, and ready for a plunge into the drawn butter.  \nService was superb ask for Darrell; very attentive, kind, and never let our wine or water get low! \n\nWhether visiting Vegas or you're a local, meander down to the strip and partake in a fine dining experience.
