Good shopping with good pricing.  \n\nWith stores such as Michael Kors, True Religion, Coach and Bose, it's easy to find some cute finds that will fill the trunk. It's conveniently located on Las Vegas Blvd and the 215.  There are tons of tourists that shop here.  I am guilty of taking a cab here before I lived here while staying on the strip.  \n\nThe majority of the stores are inside with about a dozen with outside entrances.  There are also several restaurants that line the front of the outlet in front of the parking lot.  \n\nLike I said before, there are tons of tourists as well as locals that shop here.  It's always pretty busy. For this local I'll shop here on occasion to put that smile on my face.  \n\nHappy shopping!
