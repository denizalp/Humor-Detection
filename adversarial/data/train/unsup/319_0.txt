I would give this place minus 100 stars if I could.\nMost disgusting service ever.\nIf you have lots and lots of time to waste (as in 2-2.5 hours), then by all means, this restaurant is for you. \nI was seated at the bar for 30 minutes before I couldn't wait anymore for the waitress to come by. I called for her and asked her for the menu. She pointed to a table with menus and \"there.\" THERE?!!? I got my own menu and Then tried ordering and the waitress looked at me but didn't acknowledge my order. She came back to me after about 10 min to confirm my order. Then I waited just over an hour and asked her how much longer I would have to wait. She gave me a disgusted look and said \"just wait. There are others that ordered before you.\" I then proceeded to wait another 30 min. During all this time, she never even gave me water or asked me if I wanted to have a drink. Then she comes up to me and says \"do you want to move to a table?\" I said \"no thanks.\" And she replies \"no. You need to move. The bar is for drinkers. You just ordered food.\" WTF!!???? You make me wait 2 hours for my food and give the world's sh!ttiest service and tell me to move? It is NOT WORTH IT. Yes, the portions are big for a cheap price but PEOPLE!!! YOUR 2-2.5 HOURS IS WORTH MORE THAN THE $5 YOU SAVE. And they don't even take credit or debit.. Only cash. I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED BY THIS PLACE. I never usually have such hatred for people trying to make ends meet and run their own business but i TRULY HOPE THIS PLACE GETS SHUT DOWN SO WE CAN GET A BETTER RESTAURANT WITH BETTER SERVICE
