This is one of my go to grocery stores as it near my community. After T&T closed, this plaza has been rather quiet and people who want to go grocery shopping had to shop at Walmart, Sunny or Oriental, so Field Fresh makes it much more accessible for people to get to.\n\nField Fresh changed the colours from T&T and the original outlook of the place as the cashiers are moved way closer to the front entrance than they used to be and this is evident from the floor tiles. The bakery is still where it originally is - though now you have to purchase the bread at the bakery as opposed to at the cashier. I'm not a huge fan of their bakery products, but I would come here for their fresh produce.\n\nThere is also no more halal meat as a option in this supermarket, the spot that was originally for halal meat changed to a spot where they place packaged foods like rice. The lunch combos are still in the same spot, at roughly $4.99 a combo meal in a shallow styrofoam box.
