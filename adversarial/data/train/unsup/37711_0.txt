The pho here is always delicious and fresh. Me and the misses usually get the special pho bowl and the vermicelli shrimp and pork roll. The quality is always consistent. Great cheap eats place and satisfies our craving for pho. It's the broth that does it. Soo good.  Definitely recommend this place.
