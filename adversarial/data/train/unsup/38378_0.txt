Yum.  Authentic,  no frills, impeccably seasoned and every salsa is delicious.  Tried the shredded red beef and hatch green chile\/ cheese gorditas and they were absolutely delicious with a nice thin layer of beans.  We also tried the tripas, carne asada, and pastor tacos- all great, and the tripas were nice and crispy which was a real treat.  They were out of lengua today, but we will be back!
