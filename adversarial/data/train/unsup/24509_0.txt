Not worth the 45 minute wait. Not even worth a 10 minute wait.\n\nThough the flavors were nice, the pizza itself was DISAPPOINTING! \nWe got meat and more meat deep dish.\nThe cheese to meat ratio was awful. It was about 79% cheese to 18% meat to 3% bread. The bread was ok. The salami and pepperoni were as thin as paper. One slice I had lifted the cheese and there was a single sausage and one thin slice of salami. \nThe cheese wasn't even melted all the way through. It is as if they put blocks of cheese all over and it mostly melted.\n\nIf they cut the cheese in half and added about 7 times the meat, then they would have a winner. Also, meat and more meat made me expect more than 4 types of meat....
