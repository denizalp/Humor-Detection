I always pass by Lac Vien when I am driving down to Scarborough Town Centre.\n\nLac Vien is a small isolated pho restaurant in Scarborough at the Lindor plaza. Walking in on a weekend night, a few tables were occupied, but we were still able to grab seats right away. Their menu comes in three different languages (primarily English with Cantonese and Vietnamese under the English subs). \n\nThe Vietnamese Rice Noodle Soups come in three sizes, the largest bowl being around $11. We decided to try their special bowl to see how hot their soup was, cause that's how I like the pho. Lac Vien's soup wasn't too hot, and became room temperature as I was finishing the bowl. The noodles were alright, it wasn't anything too special in my opinion.\n\nTheir Crispy Spring Rolls came in twos are are about $5 for both. This was also average in my opinion - nothing extremely special, but not terrible. I would come visit Lac Vien if I wanted another safe meal to eat.
