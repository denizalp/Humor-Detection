I thought I knew what love was... until I met Tara. Here I was, a happily married woman from Arkansas with a loving husband, beautiful kids and a great job. I had everything I ever wanted. Then I met her...\n\nMy husband and I had a date night at Sake Rok. Everything was going as well as one could expect at such a fine establishment. Great atmosphere, intriguing music. All is well so we decide to order drinks. Right on time our server approached us and what happened next was life changing. At first it was her energy. Ever positive and relentlessly magnetic. Then she smiled and everything I thought I knew about life was shattered. Every movement is like a dance,  carefully choreographed to seduce and tantalize. Every word she spoke was delivered with such heavenly grace and elegance that it made me believe in God. \n\nI don't remember much about what happened after that. The moment seemed to last forever, yet somehow ended far too soon. The next thing I know I'm back at home in Arkansas but all I can think about is her... \n\nFood no longer tastes sweet or savory. Music doesn't captivate me the way it once did... the only thing my heart desires is Tara. My husband offered to dress like her and even let me call him Tara, but it's not the same.
