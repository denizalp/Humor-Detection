Checked in here two Sundays ago, on a rare day off from work, to see if I could find another painting or print to pair with a Ron Burns I'd received as a Christmas present from a friend years ago.  I didn't have any luck finding one of Burns', but I did spot about three or four other framed prints I would enjoy.  However, even with the 20% sale on posters and prints going on, I decided to postpone a spending spree.  (Didn't really have much of a choice, since I'd just left some cash for a lovely handbag at Brighton Collectibles nearby.)\n\nI found many items, from large glass votive candle holders and jewel-like salad plates to beautiful bedspreads and accent mirrors, that I wanted to beautify my home with, but as I've mentioned, I really couldn't afford to splurge anymore.  If one was adept at craftwork, one could get so many ideas perusing through this store!  \n\nI'll definitely be back!
