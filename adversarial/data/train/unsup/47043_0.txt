This is quickly becoming one of my favorite places in Madison. To start, the nachos are incredible - the cheese sauce is real cheese, somehow the chips don't get soggy, and the toppings compliment each other very well. I have only ever gotten tacos for a main dish, and they have great flavor. My only complaint is that they recently pared down the taco menu (bring them back please!) but there are still good options to choose from. As far as drinks go, the spicy margarita has a good kick and the tequila flights have plenty of varieties available. My one piece of advice is that you should definitely get the nachos though.
