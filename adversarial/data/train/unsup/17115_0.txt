Been a while since we've been here and they added a cool ramen restaurant and sell sushi too.  For at least the California roll, they make it kimbap style with the seaweed on the outside and that's what the family decided on plus a poke bowl.  We did try a sample of the broth and it was so so, apparently the smell was just too strong, not a bad food type smell just really pungent.   Still, co addition to the store.
