I gave Pat White a low five here after his 332 yard performance against the Heels. I tried buying him some drinks but he disappeared into VIP section.\n\nI love West Virginia Mountaineers Football (I mean, seriously, I live for it). Pat White is the greatest player in the history of WVU football.  This could have been the worst place I've ever been, I'd still give it 5 stars.\n\nIf you're visiting from other cities, I'll give the analogy (to decide if you want to go). If you've been to Chicago, this is like John Barleycorn Wrigleyville, if you're from DC, this is like the Clarendon Ballroom or Tom Tom's. Meaning, don't go here if you're not completely inebriated.
