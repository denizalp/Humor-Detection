Who doesn't like greasy diner food after a night of drinking! I know I do!! Friend and I wound up down at the 5 & Diner off 16th st, and man it was like close to 2am and this place was popping, people sitting outside, people on the inside made me think what the heck are all the folks doing up this late, then just shrugged my shoulders and found a table to sit at. \n\nI ordered a steak bombsomethinganother omelet, which was a steak omelet that had peppers, onions, cheese and eggs served with hash browns and English muffin, man I love English muffins!  The omelet was good, I of course loaded it with hot sauce cuz it needed heat. But it was good diner food and just what I wanted!\n\nThe staff was friendly, service was fast and the entire time I was there, there was a steady flow of people coming and going, I guess this 5 & Diner is the spot to go!\n\nYes I had a fun Friday night.......i do love my weekends!
