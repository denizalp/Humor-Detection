I'm torn. Aiden is so good at doing nails and super personable but I wish so badly they would have clean tools. The pedicure ladies do not do a good job and Nothing is clean. Same gloves used as the person before you, same towel, same scrub, EVERYTHING. Liners on the tubs are good but not getting the full treatment of a pedicure because you're afraid of getting other people's diseases and germs on you because the same tool was used is so saddening. As we speak I had to ask for a new foot scrub. I said \"could I have a new one?\" \"You want a new one?\" UHM YES??!?!?! This is the last time I'll be here and I suggest it be yours as well. They also come up with their own pricing so watch out!!!!!
