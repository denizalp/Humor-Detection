I like you Sloth, you are a friend of CJSW, you carry some cool new vinyl, but your used stuff I don't really peruse.\nYou carry turntables, maintenance gear, CDs (what are these shiny plastic discs, are they for me to microwave my pizza pop on?).\n\nYou tease me with your Shellac selection, 1000 hz is never in and the one time it was in stock I wasn't allowed to buy it cause of the Sled Island poster show.\n\nI like how you sell concert tickets, I get most of my tickets here, cause SCREW YOU TICKETMASTER.\nYou also have cool Sloth merchandise. I would wear that American Apparel hoodie with your little sloth on it.\n\nAnd now that Clive Burger is below you, I am tempted by greasy, delicious smells when I try to get through to your entrance.\n\nI respect you Sloth, but I still like other vinyl shops better.\n\nCan we make out now?\n\nReview #17 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge
