OMG. I am so happy I don't have to go 500 miles for this comfort food amazing ness. Ok so this is the third week the store is open and YOU WILL WAIT 1-2 hours and yes ITS HOT AS H E double hockey sticks outside. Put your name in go rock in a chair or shop at Bass and stop complaining about it. Come way before you are STARVING. If you are hungry bring some crackers or celery to chew on while you wait.  The wait did not ruin my mood I expected it. You two tables next and behind me complaining about the wait the whole time I was eating ruined my mood. The hard working waiters don't need to hear about your wait for 25 minutes. Smile. Give them your order and for christs sake the food is cheap, these people make nothing, tip them GOOD!  I watch everything and these tables of two leaving four bucks and tables of four leaving five or six ones. You are ridiculous. You come here to drop your Benjies on a green table you can drop a Jackson on the brown one. And no I DO NOT WORK at a Cracker Barrel. As a matter of fact I have never waited in my life. \nOK that is my rant. \nThe food is AMAZING very accurate Cracker Barrel food. The staff tries very hard and is friendly and attentive. If you want the best get the breakfasts the chicken fried steak or the amazing sampler platter. Sweet tea is awesome and you will be on a sugar high all day. Oh man split some pancakes best you will ever eat, ever.  Buy some goodies for Ma and grandma on your way out and plan on going back to your home\/hotel and take a nap after from the carb coma. So good you will think about the good ole days when grandma.
