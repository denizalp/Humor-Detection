The items on the menu sound so appetizing, but a majority of the dishes could not live up to our expectations. \n\nMost our party ordered from the brunch menu which was basically an all you can eat type deal. \nOrdered almost everything (big party) and the only good ones out of the bunch were the waffles and some of the huevos rancheros. By some I literally mean 2\/6 were cooked well and the others were garbage. \n\nThe churros are not even churros don't bother ordering it.  \n\nThe tostada with chicken was the best of the bunch along with the guacamole. These were off the regular menu. Also off the regular menu was the grilled chicken torta: this had absolutely no flavor what so ever. I asked for hot sauce to attempt to mask the dullness with spice but I never received it and gave up. \n\nBloody Mary was tomato juice and just that with a lime thrown in. \n\nNow. As far as service, oh boy! Our server was Tiffany M. Our party was of 10 people but we were pretty easy breezy with our orders. However, much of our side requests were constantly forgotten and when we asked for our checks she had us sit for 20 minutes and calculate everyone's orders instead of her charging each individual. She was rude about it as well, as if she didn't know how to do calculations herself. What kind of service is that? \n\nWouldn't come back here. You're better off elsewhere.
