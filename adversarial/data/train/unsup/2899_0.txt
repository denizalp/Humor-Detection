When I heard that there was good food at the Smiling Moose I have to admit my stomach turned a little.  The Smiling Moose that I knew is kinda dirty.  The Smiling Moose that I knew is smokey.  The Smiling Moose that I knew had loud bands downstairs and staff that were way too cool to be bothered to get you a beer.  The Smiling Moose was the place we'd leave in a huff to go to Dee's.  I'm so happy to report that the Smiling Moose that I knew is gone. \n\nWe went to watch the Pens game at the Moose last weekend.  We were the only people sitting at their CLEAN NEAT dining area (seriously).  The game was on a giant screen.  There are less than 10 table total, and all of them were filled by the time the game got underway.  This is a GREAT bar to watch hockey!  So much better than other places I've been on the South Side. \n\nThe menu is an assortment of sandwiches, soups, salads and sliders.  We ordered a cup of the soup of the day, a Chickpea Chili with Ostrich.  It was perfectly spiced and very tasty.  The soup came with a big chunk of bread and was a meal in itself.  I also ordered the grilled cheese sandwich, which comes with tomato and bacon.  Several different cheese blended perfectly and gave me my gooey cheese fix.  The bread on this sandwich adds a lot, too - thick but soft.  My husband got the BLT sliders and really loved the Pesto Mayo.  \n\nFinally they had Pumpkin White Russians.  They were awesome.  \n\nThe food at the Moose is quality, so the prices may be a bit more than you'd think.  These aren't $5 footlongs.  Sandwiches are between 7-10 bucks and come with a side. All of my drinks were all 5 each (but I am a beer snob, I'm sure the PBR was cheap).  All in all worth every cent.  We will be back....  a lot.  Especially during hockey season.
