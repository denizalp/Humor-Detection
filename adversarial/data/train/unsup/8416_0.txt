Shania delivered one of the best concerts that I've been to anywhere.  It helped to have the intimate setting of Caesars Colosseum and to have great seats near the stage.  Shania really made the experience personal and memorable by coming down off the stage several times and shaking hands, taking pictures, and interacting with the crowd.  She sang really well and of course her songs are fun.  She also looked terrific and happy.
