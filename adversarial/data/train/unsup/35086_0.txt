This store is very inconsistent with its presentation, customer service, and products. It used to be my go-to target since it was nice. Lately it's been messier, they're doing renovations though, so maybe because of that? The employees are nice but then other times they will be straight up rude. I had a moment when I witnessed the employees very loudly arguing with each other, right after the dressing room lady was pretty annoyed (and made it known) that I wanted to try on a few items before the store closed in 20 minutes even though it literally took me 5 minutes. I don't really plan on going here any longer unless I absolutely have to. There's nothing special about this location.
