A vegan writes a review about a steakhouse....\n\nMy DD is not vegan, so I do end up coming here from time to time for her, but it's always via curbside takeout.  DD enjoys their grilled salmon, tilapia, Bloomin' Onion, and Alice Springs Chicken Quesadillas.  Occasionally, I'll order a house salad, no cheese, with their Tangy Tomato dressing, a baked potato and a side order of broccoli.  Vegans be sure to omit butter from the potato and the veggie sides.  They have a variety of green veggies from which to choose. \n\nEverything was fine until the day a large fly was found buried in my DD's salad.  Poor baby lost her appetite for days after that. I reached out to the manager who apologized and took my contact information. (He was going to send me something.)  I decided that I wanted my money refunded instead, so I went up there. The manager obliged and still gave us gift cards.  This gesture earned them an extra star, but I just cannot give an A-OK after fly-gate.  \n\n\nFor a limited time, they're offering No Worries Wednesdays and Sundays. You can get a 3-course meal starting at $12.99.
