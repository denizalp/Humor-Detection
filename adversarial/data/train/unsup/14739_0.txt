I wish I could post a photo. The first time I went for an eyebrow wax, one eyebrow was significantly thicker than the other. I was upset so they gave me a complimentary redo. Their second wax burned my eye skin off. I have a scar for the rest of my life under my eyebrow.  I emailed them a photo of my bloody eyebrow and they ignored me. I was polite and asked for a refund. \n\nDon't go here.
