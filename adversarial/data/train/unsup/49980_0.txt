The location was kind of hard to find being that it's on the backside of the plaza it's located in. The ambience is great. We came as a group for my friends birthday gathering. Food wnd drinks were extremely slow to come out. We waited close to 45 mins for food and drinks took close to 20 mins. Our server was new and did the best he could. I will give it another shot because the food was delicious. I just hope to have a better experience the next time.
