There are two separate reviews for this place.  The first is for the Store itself, furniture\/selection, pricing and delivery.  4 stars.  Very professional and not pushy sales person.  Delivery occurred exactly as promised with a call the day before and just before arrival on the day of.  Very articulate and professional delivery service.  Price for what we purchased was very reasonable.  Long-term quality is yet to be determined.\n\nNow for the 1 star part of the review.  \nCustomer service here STINKS.  We had a $100 coupon which did not get applied.   Nice people on the phone for customer service - but completely ineffective in getting anything done.  I was told an e-mail was being sent to the store and they would respond directly to me. NOPE.  7 more calls with similar conversations in just under 2 weeks.  The last 4 calls specifically were requesting a manager at the store or customer service manager.  Each time \"I promise someone will call back\".  EHHHH.  Yeah, I heard that before!  Finally a customer service manager called back.  Turns out they did finally issue a credit, but no one bothered to communicate it.  Very odd.  \n\nGood furniture\/pricing\/delivery is just a lot of REFUSE if your customer service employees\/business plan drop the ball.  Why offer the discount then make your customers mad when you don't apply it and then make them jump through hoops for ridiculous amounts of time to actually get it?  And don't communicate or follow through as promised.  BAD BUSINESS CHOICE.  \n\nAnother bad business choice is putting a $18,000 couch right inside the front door \"on sale\" for $8,000.  We almost turned around and walked right back out of the store.  NOT the kind of deal I was looking for.  There are some good deals there - just not right when you walk in.  So, be aware of these things before stepping through their front door.
