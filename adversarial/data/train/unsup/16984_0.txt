Hospitals like St. Joseph's are funny: even if you're treated well, you don't want to come back anytime soon. Or ever, really. But from my occasional experiences there, St. Joseph's is pretty good. It's clean and modern, and they're adding a huge new expansion after tearing down part of the old hospital. They still give out the same goofy little blue plastic patient cards that they did when I was a kid, though.\n\nI was just here with my mom after she fractured her kneecap. I was actually a bit surprised how quickly everything got done. The only delay came in processing the credit card to pay for the $20 crutches, of all things.
