Absolutely delicious. Very friendly and welcome staff. The food is scrumptious and definitely my weekly treat from now on. The rice is flavorful and perfect. The grilled lamb melts in your mouth and the Persian tea is smooth as silk. Thank you for opening this restaurant. My palate appreciates the delicious foods. Fresh baklava to go for me. My daughter ate all her salad and that's a first!
