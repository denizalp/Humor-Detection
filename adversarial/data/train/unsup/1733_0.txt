How are people giving this anything more than a one star?! WASTE OF MONEY. He is completely disgusting. I was so excited to see him; love the show. Horrible horrible live show. Most of it was just videos of him from the past and for the price not a lot of tricks. He acts like he is Gods gift to women but he is the lamest. You can tell he doesn't have a daughter. Then at the end of the show he pretends to give a damn and gives a spot light on childhood cancer. He took a few pictures with some ill kids 10 years ago and turns it into a sexy model dressed like she had cancer so he could \"levitate\" her. Wtf. Then he asks the audience to donate money for the cause. Sure I get that but the dick has probably a million in custom motorcycles outside just for the sake of it. Then a girl did take a picture of the whole cast when they brought them out. Not doing tricks or anything but you're still not allowed so for about 10 Minutes he stopped the show just to kick her out. Was a complete asshole about it. He also loved to make fun of the \"Mexican\" punching bag. this show is horrible and don't take your kids too it cause it's highly inappropriate. Fuck you criss Angel. He said he was the #1 magician of all time. More like your a lame crow wannabe. Big ego. Little prick I'm sure.
