Needed a new Tv, so I went here.\nFinally after 8 years it was time for a new tv.\n\nPretty standard stuff here. Did research online, went to the store and purchased what I needed.\n\nThe service was meh!! The guy took maybe 30mins to find a tv that was in stock and one section over. So after purchase the clerk said because of some sort of store policy, I had to lug my tv out of store myself and that I could not use a dolly or cart.\n\nSo as I dragged the tv out of the store they said \"have a nice day\". Not sure if it is policy or the clerk wanted to count his commission but I was pretty disappointed.
