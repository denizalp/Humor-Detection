When your second grade student profile in your elementary school \"yearbook\" says that your favorite song is \"I'll Make Love to You\" by Boyz II Men (I had terribly permissive parents apparently), there's really no way I wouldn't enjoy this. It's fairly inexpensive by Vegas show standards, and if you're a fan, there you don't need Cirque Du Soleil level spectacle to enjoy yourself.\n\nThey perform a wide range of songs, from their early hits to Motown covers. They even cover a song they say was offered to them and they turned it down. The song went on to win a Grammy for the group that ended up recording it. You'll have to watch to see which song it is. The only single I didn't hear that I wish I did was Four Seasons.
