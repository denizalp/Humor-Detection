Hot N Ready! So I placed a phone order and the order was incorrect when I went to pick it up they said it would be a 5 minute wait, no problem. But when she gave me my order she gave me a free 2 liter soda for waiting. I didn't expect anything but was very happy. Who new great service could come from fast food?!
