It's really hard to give this place any higher then 3 stars due to the consistent fact that we order to go a lot and every time I get home we have the wrong order. We never feel like driving back for our correct order.  When we dine in it take out the correct order we have enjoyed are food so much. \n\nI would suggest there vegetarian chili, hummus and hot  sauce ( they have the best hot sauce ) , fattoush sale , there sampler platter appetizer , and there pita pitza's !
