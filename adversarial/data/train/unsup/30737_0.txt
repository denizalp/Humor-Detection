This place has food so good I wish they opened all day so I could have their food for dinner too...\n\nService: Been here multiple times, always had friendly and helpful staff, no complain\n\nFood: I've tried many things on their menu, including Huevos Rancheros, Spanish Hash, Menemen (no longer on the menu), their famous Red Velvet Pancakes, Challah French Toast (no longer on their menu), Pro Bowler, and Hummus Bowl, and I always leave satisfied on the tongue and in the stomach EVERY TIME. I highly recommend their pancakes and hummus bowl, especially that grilled everything pita bread included in the hummus bowl, OMG never have I loved bread SO MUCH, I'm tempted to ask them next time if I can just get the grilled pita bread to go...I only have maybe one little complain is that if you order the Spanish Hash, it tends to get really greasy and oily in the bottom in which I'm not a fan of, else no complains.\n\nNote: I've only been here on the weekends for their brunch\/lunch and it ranged from no wait - 40mins wait
