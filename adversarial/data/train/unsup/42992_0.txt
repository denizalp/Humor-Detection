It's an amazing place for dine in and chill for a drink.\nThe service and environment are out of your imagination. \nThe store can divide into 2 parts : garden and patio.\nI was sitting in garden zone,  treated with light music and incredible views.\nI strongly recommend this restaurant.\nIt's convenient to get there, just located in the old montreal!
