I truly appreciate fresh seafood. Nothing can be fresher than a raw, uncooked oyster. It should taste like the sea, salty and briney. \n\nThis was my experience at Oyster Boy. Strolling in after a dinner at the County General, I craved oysters! I made the mistake of ordering 6 fried oysters- forgot which kind. The coating was too thick, corn mealy and took away from the fresh oyster inside. 85% coating, 15% oyster. I will order raw oysters next time.\nMy buddy had baked oysters with cheese and spinach, they tasted much better than the fried. \n\nService was good, nice people that had the passion for serving fresh seafood.\nI wasn't able to try more of the menu since full, but everything looked and sounded appetizing.\n\nOverall, a tavern feeling restaurant. Good seafood, best served non-fried and with a bit of lemon! Prices are O.K. a bit more expensive than other places but cheaper than other more popular stops.
