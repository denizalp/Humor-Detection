This review is well overdue.\n\nI came here to take my attorneys out for a good dinner that turned bad. The Capital Grille is known to be a great steak house but they totally missed the mark; at least when I was there.\n\nLong story short, I ordered the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip \"MEDIUM\" and some parts were good but the majority of it was rare. I sent it back to get it redone and it came in looking burnt. The manager was kind enough to take this steak off the check but it just left a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nNote: If you are a well known upper class steak house, please know how to cook your steaks. The way you cook steak is an art and can make or break even the best tasting steaks.
