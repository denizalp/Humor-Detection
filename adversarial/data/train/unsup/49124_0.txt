I have been here a couple times. The first time was good. The swordfish is pretty good, however if you order any other fish you will be greatly disappointed. For the prices here I would rather spend a little extra and go to Monterrey Bay or Off the Hook where I know I will get an amazing meal. This place has been hit or miss, never does it provide the same experience as I had before. I gave it three chances and this past Friday was the absolute worst.\nWe went out for my sisters birthday and at what should be the peak of dinner rush, 16 of us were able to get a table right away. Which was awesome but at the same time made me wonder why this place was not busy. We ordered waters, were brought seltzer water... Ever take a huge sip of that expecting it to be something else? Not pleasant at all. Then we received our $9 beers which were warm.\nHalf of us ordered the lobster bisque because I had it before and thought it was so good, one of their best dishes. We received them and it was watery, very very fishy and just not at all what I have had on previous nights there. We had to send it back it was that bad, I never send food back.\nFinally when we all received our entrees, I had ordered the \"jumbo\" scallops. I received what they call jumbo but in actuality was bay scallops somewhere between small and medium size. My mashed potatoes that I received with my meal where like they had been sitting under the heating lamp too long and formed a hard shell over them. The broccoli was bland with no seasoning or butter for taste.\nNot one person in my party had a good meal that they would say was worth the price.\n\nWhile the outdoor area is very nice it did not make up for the meal that was served. I will never be going back to this place. \nI recommend if you are looking for a nice fish dinner to spend the extra cash and go to Monterrey bay or off the hook  in warrendale. \nYou would probably get a better meal at Red Lobster at least they are pretty consistent with the food.
