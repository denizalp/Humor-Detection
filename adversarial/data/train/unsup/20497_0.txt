I've heard so many great things about this food truck and at a recent fundraiser at Triple C, I was able to try them.\n\nI went simple...crab cake sandwich and fries but they have other sandwiches and other sides as well.\n\nThe sandwich smelled amazing and it tasted good as well.  The fries are probably the best fries I've had from a food truck.\n\nThere was a little confusion here with the order.  They did not take down names so you just had to wait around hoping no one claimed your order.  Also, I asked for a fork and they looked at me funny like there was some sort of fork shortage.\n\nVery happy I tried this truck.  I definitely want to try some of the other options on the menu!
