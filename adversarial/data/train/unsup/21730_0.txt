One day a man had a dream.  Probably not an inspiring \"I have a dream\" kind of dream, but more likely a poorly understood collection of images viewed while unconscious and only vaguely remembered.  At any rate, this man woke up one day from his slumber and said, \"Hey, I like Qdoba and Chipotle, but instead of burritos, could I customize rolls of extremely inauthentic sushi from limited options?  And make sure it's mostly rice.\"  BAM!  Sushi Fuku was born.\n\nSo pick a protein, some add-ons, a sauce and a type of rice, and throw it all together in a bowl or a roll (yes, it rhymes, and yes, you can't walk 2 feet in the place without being reminded of it).  It's not bad, but once the limited novelty wears off, that's about all you can say of the place.\n\nIt's sushi fast food, and though I felt it was a little overpriced (though admittedly each roll is quite large), I'll probably wind up back here.  Especially if the line is longer at Chipotle.
