I went in to get an oil change because I received a coupon for $14.99. Mike saw the coupon in my hand and said I would have to leave my truck all day because they were very busy. I looked around and there was one car being worked on and none in the parking lot. I told him my emergency light just came on. He said that's another issue then. I said no, it comes on every 5,000 when my oil needs changed. He heavily sighed and said you mean your maintenance light. Yes, fine. My maintenance light. He still insisted it would be all day. It's Wednesday at 10am. He made me feel like I was interrupting him and was not helpful at all. \n\nI ended up going to Big O' Tires on Pecos and Windmill. Justin is amazing over there!\n\nNote: never walk in holding a coupon in hand and avoid Mike.
