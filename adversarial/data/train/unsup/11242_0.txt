I arrived here with a large group and we had a wonderful evening. The view of the Valley from the Phoenician is beautiful. The restaurant has beautiful decor and a nice pleasant atmosphere to it. We all ordered our own dish but ended up doing things family style. I ordered the Prime Hanger Streak Frites & Caramelized Brussel Sprouts. The streak was nice and tender and the brussel sprouts were amazing. The server did a good job of making sure everything was perfect for us. Afterwards we ordered a few bottles of wine (they have a nice selection) and enjoyed the view around the fire out on the balcony. We had a lovely evening and I would definitely come back.
