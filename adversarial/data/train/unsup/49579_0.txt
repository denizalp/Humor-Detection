Love love love this place. I live in the neighbourhood, but no, I can't afford most of the things that are in the distillery. I love peeking into Distill - always neat & local things to find - the cards are great. I peek through for sale items, and have gotten some great items in there :D.\nStaff are friendly as heck!\nGreat place to purchase a gift :).
