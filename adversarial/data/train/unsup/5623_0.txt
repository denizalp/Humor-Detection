I purchased tix to this show while staying at the Bellagio. It was my anniversary and I wanted to do something nice for my wife.\n\nI figured I might be bored but I would suck it up for her. I didn't think we would both dislike it.\n\nFirst of all, it is grossly overpriced. I paid hundreds of dollars for each ticket. Let that sink in for a moment. For 2 tickets I could have made a mortgage payment. That's absurd. I understand the show is expensive to produce, but I expected more for the amount I paid.\n\nBasically it is a bunch of circus acts that perform around a pool. \n\nThere is no story, few moments of wit or delight, and nothing to actually grab the viewer.\n\nThere are elaborate costumes, but costumes do not a show make.\n\nMy wife and I fell asleep during it. I wasn't trying to be rude. It just happened. I was embarrassed by it when I woke up and realized I'd passed out. But then I looked around and saw I was not the only one in my section. Seems like quite a few of us ponied up for a very expensive nap that night.\n\nNo substance. At all. Go to ABSINTHE. It is much better than CIRQUE. And it has no pretension.
