I've got a golden ticket, I've got a golden twinkle in my eye! Oh wait, that's just a heavenly sandwich wrapped in gold. \n\nEarls!! How do you do it? How do you produce delicious sandwiches 24 hours a day for all the drunk people of Vegas? And more importantly, why aren't you in NorCal? It just isn't fair!\n\nEarls is def the best place to get a sandwich. The best is toasty and delish and it's full of meat and yummy sauce and everything wonderful. \n\nExpect to stand in a long like during rush times. It's hard to wait, I know. But it's worth it.
