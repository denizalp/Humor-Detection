Holy crap.  Nicest Yoshi's that I've ever frequented.  \n\nModern decor and easily accessible from Maryland Parkway.  Right across the street from UNLV --- lucky bastards.  \n\nAtmosphere was great, but the Bowl itself was OK.  Rice was a bit dry --- not as moist as other Yoshi's.  But I'll take it.  Cheap, sweet beef.  I can't complain.  \n\nShowed up on a Thursday at 11:30 a.m.  Not crowded at all.
