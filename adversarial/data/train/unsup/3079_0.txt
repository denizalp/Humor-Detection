I am so happy I stumbled across Kelly and Juan - they are 2 of the nicest, down to earth people I have ever encountered, and they do an excellent job transforming my house into, essentially, a model home.  They are very conscientious, diligent, and provide an amazing service.\n\nI highly recommend Wave!
