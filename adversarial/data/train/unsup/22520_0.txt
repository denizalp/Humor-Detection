Definitely a step up from Philthy Phil's which, trust me, was truly filthy. They've actually done something with the room on other side of the bar, redone the bar itself, added brighter lighting and some flat screens and just given the place a much needed facelift. So the good news is I no longer feel like I'm going to contract hepatitis here.\n\nI came here during Raiders\/Hip Hop night and there was a small but lively crowd dancing in the aforementioned room on the other side of the bar. I did feel suburbanly out of place in this urban environment because the bartender while nice enough definitely gave off a veteran tweaker vibe while I distinctly overhead his co-worker on the patio discuss a bite wound that was inflicted by another woman. While the severity of said bite was being debated among some of the patrons, there was what seemed to be a heated discussion about The Raiders going on between other patrons. I was unable to determine if that debate was loud but friendly or loud and hostile. At that point I decided it was best to go back inside and finish my beer.\n\nI had a pretty good buzz going on at  this point so I chose not to view these incidents as potential red flags and instead lingered to finish my beer. The rest of the crowd seemed to be having a good time and one of the gentlemen playing pool busted out some pretty sweet MJ moves when \"Billie Jean\"played.\n\nSo needless to say, I made it out in one piece and if nothing else, you now have a good idea if what a shit hole Philthy Phil's was if my account above constitutes a improvement. I do want to come back out of morbid curiosity on a non-Raiders night to see if the experience is at all different.
