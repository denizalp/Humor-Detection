When I first answered the phone the lady first said she was from Southwest Airlines (probably how they got my info) and they were opening an office in Town Square. If I went to the grand opening they would give me 2 free round trip tickets - no fees at all. So I asked her why is Southwest airlines opening an office in Town Square, and she bypassed the question and asked me if I knew where TOwn square was, if I was married, between the ages of 25 - 70 and just wait a minute for her manager. Her manager came on and then said they were called Fiore Travel. I then got on Yelp while she was still talking, found all the other reviews and that they've been open for months now while her \"manager\" said \"We are doing our Grand opening and that's why we have a promotion.\" They were quite pushy and glad I just hung up. Incredibly shady how many different deals\/promotions they are offering and from the other reviews, doesn't seem like any of them are real. How can they afford to have a physical office in Town Square when it's just BS? I hate time shares anyway.
