Remember what Eau Claire used to be like? It was a bustling community space with artists, musicians and a diverse community of people enjoying their day. Cafe Blanca reignites this community focus in the Eau Claire Area - this time, with a focus on Coffee.\n\nThey love coffee. They love coffee more than you love coffee. You might have thought you loved coffee, but they take it to a level that honestly, you probably won't every care to know. This is good, because the result of which for your average coffee loving Joe, is a very delicious cup of joe.\n\nThere's a few kind of seating arrangements, whether you're looking for a quick bite or looking to get social with some friends, a date, and interview, or cozy up and get social online with your email in a corner somewhere. It's a good space if you need some focus time because it's somewhat quiet right now, but it's really quite great so if this review has anything to do with it, I hope to see a little more bustle in the near future. :)\n\nIf you're looking at staying even a little longer there's a detached back room complete with TV if you wanted to host a large meeting, or some boardgames if you feel like hanging out next to the sunny windows.\n\nThe food is fresh tasting and quite healthy. As coffee shops become a big part of my work day, it's nice to be able to find a meal that is both tastes good and is healthy at the same time.\n\nA very welcome addition to the Eau Claire Area. Make sure you make this your summer bike path ride coffee stop!
