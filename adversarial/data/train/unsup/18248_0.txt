I'm between one and two stars for this place. This used to be a great store and then they got rid of all their good workers except for one. The customers are the best thing about this place. Aside from the stereotypical social awkwardness, they're usually great people. The customers in the side room are always nice and willing to play games or teach them to new people.\n\nAside from that, and I hate to say it, this place is terrible. They're more expensive than what you can get on Amazon or other places. I used to be willing to pay the extra back when the workers were good, but not any more.\n\nThe workers, as I've been saying, are horrible. The issue changes from worker to worker. Some don't pay attention to customers and others are just plain creepy. One of the workers are so creepy I refuse to go in the store when they work. The owner used to be really great, but she's kind of teetered off. I don't really know how to describe the change. It's like she's checked out. The one great thing about her is that she really is helpful to any customers who don't know much about games. I wish the rest of the workers were the same.\n\nIf you're just looking for a place to play games, Peg is great. If you're looking to buy stuff there, the prices and creep level just isn't worth it.
