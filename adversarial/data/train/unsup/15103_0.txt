DO NOT GO HERE... A THIEF WORKS HERE.  I went in for a normal haircut and when I went to pay, Anna, the hairdresser informed me she would not take my $100 bill.  That is all I had on me so I left her with my ID and a $100 bill so that she didnt think I was running out.  I broke my large bill next door and came back within 5 minutes.  She told me I never gave her any money and tht I still had to pay for the haircut... I called the cops while she called her manager who told me over the phone that \"no one steals money that works for her\".  And the police told me I could take her to civil court....  I learned a lot today.... Anna from supercuts is a theif and the police don't help citizens....I'm hoping karma will take care of Anna in the best way possible.  P.s there was no sign stating they don't take larger bills. This is the super cuts at 135 nellis, next to petsmart.
