Love the hash house here!!!!!! My favorite one! Don't go to the one at the Rio. You must try the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict!!!!! You will not regret it! Warning though, you should share it since the portion is huge! Everything is perfect about it! Except the extra biscuit at the bottom... It's unnecessary and too filling. The sauce they give us is also bomb, so creamy!
