Helllloooo and welcome to Henderson, Boba King! It's about time a boba shop opened up on the south east side. I actually thought a boba or dessert place would do really well in this space and here they are! \n\nTheir doors finally opened and they've been pretty busy ever since. The inside is brand spankin' clean and they have tables you could potentially stay and hangout for a while or even study. \n\nTheir drinks are actually pretty tasty and their boba is very good. Texture is just right and there's a bit of a flavor to it. They also have a variety of popping boba! You can order teas, slushes, or smoothies, and I believe if you buy 10 you get one free!\n\nIf you live in the area, like me, be prepared to become a regular. No longer do you have to drive out far to get a smoothie or boba.\n\nCall me boba queen!
