I found this place through a fellow Yelper who left a review regarding this newly opened Filipino restaurant, and I was excited to check it out!\n\nI was suprised at how cheap their food is by checking their FB page, but I was mostly impressed that they offer all-day breakfast meals for only $5.49 with a free drink!\n\nFor Filipino breakfast, I have always been going to Chef George, but I thought I would try this place, as the price is appealing and the restaurant is closer to home.\n\nOn our first visit, I tried their lumpia with rice, and my BF got their Tapsilog. For those two meals, the total was only around $12.\n\nLumpia with rice comes with 6 small pcs of lumpia, which I find really tasty and fresh! I wanted more! The Tapsilog was also very good! Definitely beats Chef George's Tapsilog!\n\nOn our second visit, I tried their 'small-sized' Filipino spaghetti, for only $3.49. The small size is still a good portion. I also tried their BBQ pork, which tastes better than the one they have at Jolly's Grill-In. This has got to be the best BBQ pork I have ever tried.\n\nThey have a big selection of desserts \/ cakes \/ baked goods as well.\n\nI suggest trying out this place, it's cheap, offers great service, and food is served fast as well. Definitely a 5-star!
