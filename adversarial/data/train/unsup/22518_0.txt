Compared to other Dim Sum restaurants in the world, China King won't survive a day.  The dim sum is expensive, the quality is poor, the tea selection is limited, and even the dim sum choices were few and far.  The shui mai didn't even have shrimp in it!  It was just a wonton wrap with pork, furthermore, they clearly over dosed it with Worcestershire Sauce.  The har gao was disgusting as well.  The skin was dry and the shrimp sizes were small.  I finally got shrimp noodle wrap (Hai Cheung).  This too was abysmal.  The shrimp were tiny and virtually non-existent.  Really?  4 small tiny shrimp only?  Disgusting.  The only thing I found decent was the egg tarts.  \n\nChina King is a poor choice for dim sum.  The only saving grace for China King is that it's located in Phoenix and the pickings here are few and far in between.
