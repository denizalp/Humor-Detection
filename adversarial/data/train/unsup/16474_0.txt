Hart's! How cool is the friggin' bus that has the top that opens up! Pop goes the Soda Shop! And the old school soda jerk outfits!\n\nMy kids had a lemonade Fizz- it was refreshing - not too sweet but did cost quite a bit (cough , cough) - $4.50 if I remember correctly. All natural ingredients and fresh fruit. Nice!!\n\nGreat concept - great product. Looking forward to trying one of their sundaes. Unicorns Do Exist looks right up my alley. Rainbow sprinkles are awesome.
