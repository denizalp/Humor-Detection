At my job, I am responsible at times for ordering food for various events.  For the last event I coordinated I called multiple sub places for a catering order to include Dave's Cosmic subs and Jimmy Johns but they either didn't deliver to my area or in the case of Jimmy Johns just seemed completely ignorant that I didn't feel comfortable placing my order there.  I also like Brennan's Catering in Cleveland but find them to be a tad pricey.  So I called Dibella's as I had in the past and they are awesome.  They quickly helped me estimate how much food I needed and made the whole order process quick and easy. I even called them the day of to add to my order and it was no problem. They are very professional and knowledgeable and by now are familiar with my company.  The food arrived 15 minutes early and the delivery person helped us set up.  He was really friendly.  We ordered a variety of subs and the meats and bread were so fresh and delicious!  We also got chips, cookies and bottles of soda with our order along with condiments, utensils and paper goods at a rather affordable price.  I was (as I always am) very pleased with Dibela's - no complaints whatsoever!
