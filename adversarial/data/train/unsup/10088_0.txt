I believe that beneath every DMV-employee's grim, angry projection is a sweet midlife crisis just wanting to be loved. As an experiment to liven up my horrendous experience, I wanted to see how many I could make smile. Some of them respond to wise-cracks, some self-deprecation, and some just want to laugh at you. After sufficient prodding, all but one cracked a toothy smile or a wry grin. Occasionally it came out as a grimace, but I chalk that up to them being out of practice. So go on, have fun with the examiner. Lord knows you won't have fun with anything else.\n\nThe building is old. It probably couldn't be condemned, but it is putting forth a good effort. The carpet is worn and ratty, the walls bland. The only attempt to liven the place up is a slow moving trivia ticker. But it is so slow that you'll have forgotten the question in the 5-6 minutes it takes for the answer to scroll by.\n\nFor those who played computer games in the mid-90s, there is a glimmer of charm. The recorded voice that chirps out ticket numbers is the same as the Sim City 2000 narrator. It took me ages to place it, but I am certain. Every time she says \"Ticket number 153, please proceed to counter number 4\", I just hear \"reticulating splines\".
