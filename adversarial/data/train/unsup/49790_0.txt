First timer at this restaurant.\n\n- got there at 10:45 on Sunday for Brunch (waited 20 mins)\n- we ordered the scotch-ish eggs, blueberry cheesecake waffle, the eggs Benedict and side of sausage\n* scotch-ish eggs was simple and light even though the eggs were deep fried \n*blueberry cheesecake waffle was delicious even if you don't have a sweet tooth. Waffle was crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. The sauce was creamy, sweet but on the mild side and the berries tasted fresh  \n*eggs benny was my less favourite - not because it didn't taste good it just wasn't anything special. \n*I would skip the side sausage because it lacked flavour.
