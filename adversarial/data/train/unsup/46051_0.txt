Super cute and homey coffee shop.  Probably my fave in the city!  Have made the effort to travel out of my way to visit twice over the past few weeks and was not disappointed either time.  Between my two visits, I was able to try an americano with lots of dairy free options (thank you for having this!), as well as an almond croissant, cheddar & chive scone, and pear danish.  Everything was fresh and very very tasty!  I must say, however, that the almond croissant was out of this world - the best I've ever had.  Bonus points for free wifi and for having a beautiful view overlooking Riverside Park.  Please bring a location up to Yonge & Eglinton - would love to visit you more!!
