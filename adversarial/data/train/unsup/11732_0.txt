If i could give 0 stars i would.  I just left here with some coworkers and not one of us was happy with our pizza.  3 of us purchased the thai chicken pizza.  The pizza had so much cilantro you could barely taste anything else.  \n\nTo top everything off , when i bit into my second slice of pizza the chicken still had a decent sized bone , STILL IN IT.   To give them credit , they did comp my pizza and did keep the ice tea flowing , but honestly i will never visit this location again.  \n\nIve had way better \"upscale\" pizza at CPK ( California Pizza Kitchen)\n\nAmbiance 4\\5\nServer 3\\5\nFood 0\\5\nCost 0\\5.\n\nIve chewed 2 pieces of gum and still taste cilantro & \nfree choking hazard with every purchase act now !
