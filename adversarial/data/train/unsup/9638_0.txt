I had been craving Italian for a while and we randomly found this place.  I was so happy when we did - it was exactly what I was missing from the Italian restaurant in NY.  \n\nWe got fried calamari for an app., which came with plenty of food and the marinara sauce it came with was out of this world!  I got chicken parm for my entree.  It was perfect and it came with a side of spaghetti with their delicious sauce.\n\nThe service was great and the prices for the quality of food was perfect!!
