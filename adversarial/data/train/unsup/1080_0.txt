Yuuuuuuuummmm!!!\n\nBeing Chinese with very traditional parents, I didn't grow up eating Filipino food but eventually gained an appreciation for it on my own back in high school.  So ever since I moved away from home (Guam), I've been on a mission to find some Filipino food that would remind me of where I first discovered my love for it.\n\nInexplicably, the ones closest to me (in Carson, Torrance, etc.) all close very early, ranging from 5pm to 7pm.  And you never get fresh food if you go in right before closing.  So imagine my delight when hubby and I were in Vegas for his 40th bday celeb and we searched (and found) some highly lauded places.  We randomly picked BJ Bibingkahan and were so glad we did.\n\nThe place doesn't look like much...you walk in and it's got the food bar where you order your plate and the it's a pretty sizeable dining room with a few scattered TV's playing Tagalog dramas and variety shows.  \n\nAlthough I'm very familiar with some of the foods, I still felt intimidated by the sheer size of the selection here at DJ Bibingkahan.  However, the friendly staff set us at ease, providing us with recommendations and samples.  We ended up over-ordering like we usually do at a new place and got the following:\n\n- Kare-kare (w\/ the requisite bagoong on the side):  This version uses pigs feet.  It was delicious but I prefer mine with oxtail and tripe.  \n- Lechon kawali: This was really why we were there.  I could feel my arteries clog up but I'm sure the Diet Pepsi took care of cleaning the pipes!\n- Diniguan:  Hubby's first time trying this...minerally and delicious, containing mystery meats and organs.\n- Sisig:  Chopped pork, fat, skin in a vinegary sauce.  My fave!!\n- Palabok: This version was premade with thicker noodles.  They had some chopped lechon on top and it was still pretty bomb a few hours later in the hotel\n- Fried banana lumpia:  Surprisingly light due to using younger (tangy) bananas.  Addicting!\n\nWe are definitely going back next time. Forget the strip: you can't beat the prices\/selection\/service here!
