Like walking into the world's largest homeless shelter.\n\nI remember visiting \"The Fremont Street Experience\" shortly after they unveiled it with it's beautiful high-tech roof, talented street artists every block or so, and cops walking the beat. I felt safe and it was exciting.\n\nYears have passed.\n\nI paid $7.50 to park across the street. There are a few street artists there, but mostly it was assorted toothless meth heads begging for money, a guy dressed in a dirty Elmo costume, a blank-stared woman with a sign tied around her neck that read \"homeless vet's wife needs help\", some shoeless folks sleeping in the planters, and drunk people barfing on the street. No cops, but some private \"security\" kids huddled in groups talking and drinking their energy drinks. The concrete was sticky with some unknown substance most everywhere I walked. Merchants stand outside their shops trying to grab some unsuspecting fool and sell them a wrinkle treatment, good luck charm, novelty photo or some other useless crap. In line for a cheap hot dog, a filthy drunk guy shouted and cursed unintelligibly right next to me for the 10 minute wait. \n\nThis place is like a nightmare where nothing makes sense and it's all very frightening. I can take care of myself, but don't recommend you come here and take any chances. Unless of course you find the possibility of being knifed at any moment attractive.
