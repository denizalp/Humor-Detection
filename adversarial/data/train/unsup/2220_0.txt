This is the one place that EVERYONE must stop by to hydrate yourself before heading home from Vegas aside from getting PHO for the hangover cure. I've been to many tea\/boba shops and I am really sick of Ten Ren and Tea Station. This place has a modern studio type of decor, a perfect place to hang and just chill.  They have over 50 items in their menu, hot\/cold, sugar level, and additional add-on starting at .50 cents. If only I was Local I would definitely bring my laptop and take advantage of the Free WiFi and do some work there.  Service was great and quick, the kitchen area is super clean.\n\nWhat I was really craving for was the Mango Green Tea, but asked what was highly recommended and she said: \n\nMust Try:\nMille Tea with Grass Jelly- one of these is not enough, definitely take advantage of the BOGO offer and get two for yourself. This is what they are known for.
