Have been going here for quite some time...since before they changed ownership and expanded into the part of the restaurant next door.\n\nTomo offers a great mixture of Japanese and Korean choices. They've recently added a few new maki rolls and other dishes to the menu and everything I've tried has been quite good.\n\nMy kids love the crunchy noodle soup they give you as a freebie before the meal. That's a nice departure from serving miso soup or serving no soup, which is the standard at other places.\n\nTheir maki rolls are the best in town. Not too big, not too small. They add some type of sauce that makes their maki taste distinct and recognizable. The first time you try it, you don't notice anything special. However, once you've dined at Tomo and decide to visit a different place next time, you find yourself craving that roll from Tomo. \n\nIf you are into raw fish and spicy stuff, try Hae Dup Pap, which a Korean bowl of rice with veggies and assorted fish on top. The sauce that comes with it doesn't hit you with heat right away. In the beginning, you hardly feel the spice at all. However, as you get closer to the end of the mean, you're almost breathing fire. \n\nit seems like they've been rotating through some younger sous-chef a lot recently and the food has not always been consistent. If these guys haven't been apprenticing long enough, the in-house recipe may end up not being followed a T. A couple of our visits were disappointing, i.e. the rolls tasted like they were picked up at a grocery store.  We wouldn't think much of it if we were visiting some other sushi place. However, we know Tomo to be the best in town and set our expectations pretty high when we go there. \n\nThis is one of the places we take our friends when they visit us.
