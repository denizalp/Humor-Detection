Since I'm new in Toronto, I searched the Internet for recommended nail spas. Going to Dream Tips was a great choice. I've been going to this place for 4 months now. I usually get a shellac manicure. My nails grow fast. However, the shellac polish remains in great condition for almost three weeks. I usually book an appointment with Shirley. I have had a pedicure and it's done really thoroughly. I also had my hands waxed a couple of times. I have sensitive skin and in the past I had an infection from waxing ar another salon, but I never had any irritation or infection here. They are extremely clean. The staff pays attention and does the best to cater to customers' needs.\n\nP.S. They give you a relaxing neck and back massage while doing your nails, without any extra charge.
