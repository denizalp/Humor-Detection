RideSmart is a motorcycle riding training company. Their format consists of classroom and on bike training. The multi-hour, multimedia classroom session let's you know all the ways you can die. Before you can move to the on bike session, you have to pass a written exam (to ensure that you know you can die). If (and when) you pass the exam, you'll be ready for the on bike training. This is two days of showing you how to live - and live you will. \n\nBoth the classroom and the on bike time can only be described as pure joy. The people that run RideSmart (owners and employees) are passionate about what they do. You'll know exactly what I mean when you look through the turn and hear your instructor yelling your name and clapping their hands like a lottery winner. They give you the best that they have and you'll leave with it - and that mighty \"M\" endorsement on the back of your license - just like me...
