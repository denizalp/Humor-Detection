I love Rachels Kitchen- but I do agree with quite a few reviewers that this might not be their best location (Hualapai4LIFE) in terms of consistency. Let's be honest though- a bad visit to Rachel's kitchen is still substantially better than just about anything else in a few mile radius. I have gotten good meals and bad here, but the good occurs more frequently. \n\nWhen some friends came in from out of town and wanted a close place for a good breakfast I told them Rachels. They went and saw the outside, thought it was a hippy place and drove away. This prompted a heated exchange in which I questioned their honor, family lineage, and level of impairment. After a civil discussion they agreed to try it the next day and low and behold they thought it was awesome. Point being get past your skepticism and give Rachel's a try.\n\nI have had a lot of things on the menu (I used to use a delivery service to get it for lunch pretty frequently) - so here are the highlights as I see them\n\nMac and Cheese- this isn't the Kid Mac at Outback (which coincidentally is also awesome) - its a more sophisticated \"adult\" (not in that way- get your mind out of the gutter this is a family show) dish- i.e. it has onions and mushrooms in it. I have downed probably 25 or more of these in my lifetime.\n\nSignature Pasta- this is pasta in a tomato sauce with chicken and a ton of vegetables in it- great for convincing yourself you are eating healthy when you may or may not be. \n\nGarden's Pasta- don't be fooled- despite having Garden in the name this is not a vegetarian dish, it has chicken in basically a carbonara esque pasta. \n\n440 sandwhich- chicken and tasty tasty goat cheese (which is pretty strong)- not for the feint of heart.\n\nGrilled Cheese- pretty good, although I would suggest subtracting all vegetables as an \"ultimate\" grilled cheese should not need them\/they aren't a cheese. i know this- I put the ill in grilled cheese\n\nProtein Scramble(again, mind out of the gutter)- this is a pretty good breakfast- recommend a side of bacon... or five\n\nPancakes- Not my favorite but certainly passable\/better than most breakfast places pancakes.
