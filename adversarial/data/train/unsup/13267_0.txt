This was a great show. I have always wanted to see them. I have seen them on TV a few times but never in person. I was coming to Vegas with my beautiful girlfriend and when we talked about going to see a show I suggested this one and she said yes let's go.\nWhat a good choice. I like the jazz duo that open the show. They are very good. Mike Jones is an amazing piano player. I think it is funny how most of the audience didn't seem to realize who was playing the stand up bass. Right at the start they have a bulletin border with an envelope posted on it and an empty wooden box on stage. They ask that you go on stage and check out the box and sign the envelope. I thought that was pretty cool. I also like the fact the my awesome girlfriend got us seats right down front. You really can see a lot more when you are upfront. They were great seats.\nI really liked the fact that it wasn't this big fancy magic show with laser lights and smoke and all of the stuff. It was simple and about the tricks not some crazy flashy stage show. They do some great illusions and slight of hand tricks. A few times you think they are explaining the trick to you but they are still tricking you.\nI don't want to give too much away but trust me it was a great show and I would go back to see it again. They are very entertaining. Very funny.\nIt is also great that they both go out to the lobby right after the show to take pictures with everyone. They are very nice and get to everyone. Just be patient and wait your turn. They won't run away. They will get to everybody.\nThis really is one of the best shows in Vegas and it is no surprise that they have been there for 13 years and counting.
