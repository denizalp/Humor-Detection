So.. my favorite animals are elephants and I heard great things about this place.  When I first walked in the decor was great and I thought it would be quite the spot.  \n\nBoy was I wrong.  \n\nThe tower of dirty drinks on the bar that needed to be placed in the dishwasher followed by the manager, Zoltan, flirting and talking pictures with the girls sitting at the bar while my drink sat empty was quite disappointing.\n\nWe did however take advantage of the elephant bar rewards program which got us a free appetizer immediately online when we registered.\n\nWe got the edamame, coconut shrimp skewers, and spinach artichoke dip.  It was all decent, at best.\n\nWe then had the pleasure of speaking with Zoltan, the manager, who when we asked if he was the manager he said \"No, I just hang out here\".  He was then asked by us why this tower of glasses was sitting next to us and he just made excuses for it.  We asked if he needed to hire a dishwasher to assist with the dishes & he said no and that the bartenders should be doing a better job.  He didn't act like he cared at all.  He was too busy taking selfies with the drunk blonde across the bar.  \n\nI then went to the bathroom where the toilet didn't flush & there was just enough toilet paper for me.\n \nRoy the bartender was very attentive however the other bartender was about as bad of a sever as you can get.  I would order through him & then he would just tell Roy what I ordered & Roy would serve me.\n\nAfter we had commented on the pile up of glasses the bartender made a comment to the one server who was dropping her glasses off and she said \"I don't really give a shit\" and then Quartae the bartender said \"Fuck off\".. in ears reach of myself and the rest of the bar to hear.\n\nIt was quite the experience and I don't think ill ever be back!
