Loved the booth that they gave us! Loved the d√©cor of the restaurant! Waiter was good looking and friendly ;)\n\nFood was pretty good. The French Onion soup looked different than usual, not as cheesy, so I was skeptical by the look of it, but....once I took a sip, yes, thumbs up! Always being a big fan of scallops, I was not disappointed at all by their scallop appetizer. For main entrees, I would recommend the shrimp risotto and baby back ribs. As to the chicken parmesan, the chicken was a little dry but the melted mozzarella on top was reeeally fresh.\n\nThe dishes were a liiiiittle bit on the salty side. Didn't bother me, but one of my friends made a comment about it.\n\nOverall, it was one of our great dining experiences in Vegas. If you come to MGM, definitely good to give Crush a try!
