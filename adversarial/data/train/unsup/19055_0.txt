If you've ever wanted to feel like a princess you must visit Alfred Angelo! This was my very first experience trying on wedding dresses; a special moment I've looked forward to my entire life and it turned out to be AMAZING!! I owe a lot of it to my stylist Kate, she made me feel so welcomed and special the entire experience. Wedding dress shopping, although very special, can be tough work, but Kate made each gown change easy. She attentively listened to my requests, offered me honest feedback, and managed my entire viewing crew. \n\nThey had several gorgeous gowns that would make any bride blush, but I ended up finding the most perfect one for our big day (I'll post pictures after the wedding!) Not only did I find my dress, but I was able to get my slip, veil (which is also AMAZING), and earrings for a deal you wouldn't believe!! This was probably the easiest part of my wedding planning process. \n\nThank you Kate for a wonderful experience!!
