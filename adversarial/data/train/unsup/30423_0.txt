I'd say this is my favourite grocery store in the area. The produce is always fresh, there's lots of international foods, and let's face it - you could probably spend an entire afternoon shopping here. \n\nYou can rack up a pretty large bill, though if you aren't shopping for what's on sale and are tempted by a lot of the pre-packaged convenience foods they offer. There are a lot of awesome things along these lines, but when you realize just how much you are paying for pre-crushed oreos as a sundae topping (PC brand I am talking to you) it is kind of ridiculous.
