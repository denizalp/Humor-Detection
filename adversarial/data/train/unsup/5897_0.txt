The. Best. Performer. In. Vegas. EVER!!!!!\n\nVargas plays sporadically around town, so check his website (varjazz.com) for his schedule. Right now (5\/11) he's performing as Bobby Darrin in Legends in Concert at Harrahs, but when he's not busy doing that, he plays energetic old-time Vegas big band, jazz and lounge standards with his AWESOME band, the Swank Set. Their horn section is out of this world!\n\nVargas and the Swank Set are like a '50s lounge act on speed...like Richard Cheese meets Freddie Mercury meets Willy Wonka. THAT awesome! Vargas is the most magnetic, energetic, wildly frenetic entertainer I have EVER seen...I can't believe he's not headlining his own lounge at one of the major casinos. He's THAT good -- really!\n\nIf you get the chance...check him out! He's good as Bobby Darrin, but he's even better on his own with the Swank Set. Past venues have included the Suncoast, the Bootlegger Bistro and the Fontana Lounge at Bellagio... I personally think the bigwigs at Caesars should let him play at least one night a week at Cleopatra's Barge -- he'd be perfect in that old-school room. \n\nBut until then...check him out wherever you can. ASAP!
