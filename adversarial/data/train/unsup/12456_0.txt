Pearl Fact:  Pearls are the only jewels created by a living animal. \n\nThe first time I saw this kiosk, I was walking by with a gentleman from Hawaii who I knew would probably shove an oyster up my nose if I stopped off at this \"Hawaiian\" tourist trap but boy did my eyes linger.  I wanted to get a pearl!  At $15 for your pearl, plus additional for whatever setting you want, I know I was walking into a money pit but I had to have it!  So I went back the following weekend and tada!  I now own a watermelon [greenish with a pink halo] pearl on a dainty pendant setting.  You can see the colors the best by putting the pearl in a clear glass of water.\n\nThe person who helped me was lovely.  She told me how while they may be Japanese oysters, it was a Hawaiian tradition to bang on the plate three times and say, \"Aloha\" [I don't believe this is a real tradition at all but it was fun].  So some banging and screaming was ensued and she cracked this bad boy\/girl open to reveal a pearl.  I must admit, I was hoping for a silver or pink pearl but I like my little 7mm watermelon pearl.  I looked through many settings and finally came across a $59 leaf bale setting that she described as saying that only the royals of Hawaii would wear it.  I found it to be absolutely fitting.  And while it's definitely not a cheap thrill, I gotta admit that I've spent money on dumber things in Vegas.  At least I got a pretty pearl pendant out of this experience!\n\nSo yes, I know it's a tourist trap but can a girl live?  I had fun!
