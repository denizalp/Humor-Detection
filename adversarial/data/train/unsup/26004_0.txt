The quality and quantity went WAY down.\nI used to go religiously to ND Sushi when they had their location at Baldwin.\n\nI would go a lot with my mom and boyfriend.\n\nToday I went with my boyfriend for the first time to their new location on college st, and we both were quite upset with the presentation of the food :(\n\nWe walked in at 2:30pm and we were the only customers.\n\nOrdered 2 California rolls, 1 salmon avocado, 1 Dynamite and 1 Tempura(5pieces).\n\nThe California and salmon avocado was the first to come, real quick. We were surprised it was ready so soon... I realized now there was a young man who made this one for us and the Dynamite was made by the owner.\n\nThe one made by the young guy was so badly put together the rice was already fallen apart when we were given the order, he clearly lacked the water vinegar your supposed to use to help stick the rice together.. I've seen all you-can-eat restaurants that have 5 times better presentation then what we got.. that might sound harsh but I'm really surprised he gave it to us like that... I can't believe the owner didn't look over it beforehand.\n\nAnd the kid had zero excuse to rush it when we were the Only customers there. So regardless it should of been made with care. It looked gross... half the point for restaurant service is the presentation of the food.\n\nThe size in shrimp for the tempura is now half the size, as well as the some of the veggies now... what happened???!!!\n\nI walked out and told myself I wouldn't want to go back if there someone who works there that makes the food half-ass.. it brings down the value of the place that I once new.. \n\nI expected better for a restaurant I used to love.
