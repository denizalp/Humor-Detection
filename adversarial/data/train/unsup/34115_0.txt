Went here for a quick dinner while visiting Vegas last weekend. Saw all the reviews on yelp and figured we had to try it....\nWOW.... These reviews are LEGIT.... Everything we had was top notch... Hummus was amazing (wish they gave you 2 pieces of the nahn bread). Everything we had was really good.. Grilled octopus was the best... Service was A+ through the while meal and not just by the server but by everyone there!!! Not much else to say except try it.... You won't be disappointed. Me and my wife will be headed the the Santa Monica location cause it's closer to San Diego ..... Hope they live up to what we had in Vegas!
