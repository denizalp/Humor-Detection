In the department of Reasons Why I Love Bloorcourt, Bloomer's Bakery opened their doors in late July and have been open every day since except the holiday Monday. \n\nNaturally, I have been gorging myself on Boston cream donuts, dream cookies (empire cookies), blueberry muffins, cupcakes, butter tarts, fresh made bagels with cream cheese, and carrot cake. Did I mention everything is vegan and some things are gluten-free?\n\nIt's a soft opening, because they are just sticking to baked goods and drinks at the moment, but they plan to roll out a sandwich menu come fall and offer soup and other nice, simple items like cake by the slice that for some reason aren't common at the other vegan spots around here. \n\nThe space used to be an Ethiopian restaurant whose sign advertised \"Organic vegetarian sandwiches\" but they always seemed to be out of these and the only time I tried the Ethiopian food, the veggies were under cooked. \n\nThe space has been painted blue, booths added and a bar across the window. I love their large wheat stalk logo. The place is adorable and right now with the nice summer weather, sitting at the window bar with garage door open is the perfect place to people watch on this colourful stretch of Bloor while enjoying an iced Americano and a donut.\n\nI'm so glad that the owners, a friendly couple from Winnipeg, chose this neighbourhood for their business and not, say, The Beaches or Leslieville. My dream is to see them become a Sweetpea's (Portland's greatest vegan bakery) of the east offering a new soup daily, satisfying sandwiches, a variety of dairy-free schmears with their bagels along side some of the best vegan baked goods around!\n\nTLDR: Get a Boston cream or dream cookies and iced Americano and park yourself at the window bar on the nice day.
