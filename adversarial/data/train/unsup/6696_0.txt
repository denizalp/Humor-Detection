Yummy! The boba spot we wanted to visit is closed on Mondays so I looked at my bookmark list and narrowed our choices down to here. Fairly easy to find, I parked and walked inside. My friend and I decided to go for the snow and so we split a medium (which is HUGE!) and got Thai tea snow, and added chocolate after the lady told us we could get another flavor. Very cool. Each topping is $.50 and we got mini mochi and cheesecake bites, topped off with a milk chocolate glaze. Total came out to ~$6.\n\nWe found a high-top table and sat down. About 5 minutes later, the helpful lady brought us our snow and two spoons. We dug in and I was satisfied with the flavors. I don't care for cheesecake so I only had a few pieces but I love me some mochi. I appreciate how light snow is, it's not heavy like ice cream or yogurt but it's got more substance than shaved ice. The milk chocolate sauce was good, but I would've loved a Nutella or dark chocolate flavor instead. I was surprised at how full I was after eating this dessert. It was probably from the mochi! \n\nThis place is adorable. It's pretty far from me so I wouldn't come regularly but if I was in the area again I would come back.
