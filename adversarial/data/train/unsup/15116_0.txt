I am so so glad that Tempe has an affordable and healthy vegan-focused restaurant that isn't THAI. I love Thai, but how much curry can you eat before gaining 20 pounds in pure coconut milk? I don't want to find out.\n\nI had gone into Tsom once before and left because I felt the prices were too high and selection too bare.\n\nI went in with a friend today and was proven dead wrong. I got the Mixed Veggie and Bean wrap. It was only 7 bucks and HUGE. My friend got their cold bar by the pound and was obsessed with everything they had.\n\nThe flavor was incredible. It is now on par with Haji Baba, in my book. \n\nAlso, the service was stellar. No bullshit Pita Jungle crowd. It was a legit veggie joint - positive vibes and all.\n\nHINT: Next week, they are getting a local organic tofu guy to make and smoke the tofu in house from now on. Can't wait to taste that!
