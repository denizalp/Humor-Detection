My husband and I were running late to a movie but still drove 25 minutes to the Alamo Drafthouse to see the show. We knew we'd miss the previews and the beginning, but we'd see most of the movie and were okay with it. However, since the movie started, they refused to sell us a ticket!! They said they wanted to reduce the number of distractions for their guest. So am I not allowed to use the restroom or get refreshments during the movie either? What a waste of a date night! We definitely won't be disturbing them again since they just lost us as customers!!!
