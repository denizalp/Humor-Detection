If I could give ZERO stars I would. This is the worst school ever. My grandson was bullied not just by a student but by his teacher! All the kids in his class corroborated his story yet the teacher was not disciplined and is stil teaching. We removed all 5 grandkids from the school and are now sending them to a charter school. Horrible staff.
