The entrance to nine is pretty low key, and tucked away in a back corner of the Palms.  Just past the front desk is a sleek bar, which over looks a nice sized dining room.  We got a nice booth in the back of the place, which gave us a nice spot to people watch.  The NBA summer league was going on, so several unidentifiable ballers were in attendance.  After a quick and strong cocktail at the bar, our hostess who we dubbed \"sade\" (who was actually quite helpful) showed us to our booth.  To start we had a shrimp cocktail and lobster bisque.  The shrimp were nice, but it would be nice to get more than 3 . Bisque was excellent (i get it everywhere that serves it) rich, creamy with a nice cognac finish.  I had an 18 oz  bone in ny that was fantastic.  My wife had a bone in fillet that was quite good as well.  For sides we had lobster mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus as sides.  As for the potatoes, they are amazing, topped with what looked like the same lobster bisque , which was fine with me. Asparagus have a great lemony zing.  All in all great food and service.  Just like any good restaurant in vegas, you could spend hundreds on dinner, especially if you take the waiters wine recommendation. They play rock music at a pretty loudly in here, which was ok with me.  But don't expect to have a quiet conversation in here.  If you are in Vegas, and you like upscale steak places with one page menus (like i do) check it out.
