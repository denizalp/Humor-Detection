WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER SEEN! I had the wig two days and I never moved the wig from the spot I left it in when I brought it home. For some reason it was all frizzy and tangled and was losing all the curl. I called them and told them about it and they said they would call me back and never did. I had to call again. I also sent them pictures of the wig and they called me a liar and said that I BRUSHED the wig and that's what it looks like so I must have done so. I never touched the wig once when I brought it home. They offered me no help, no solution, nothing. They told me that they would wash it for me only if I paid the 70 dollars to have the service done! WHAT HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I am devastated. I was so excited about this wig and now it looks like a rat's nest and it literally sat in one spot where nothing and no one could get near it. The manager of the store is a rude argumentative person who just wanted to blame me the whole time. I have never ever had someone act like that towards me ever!!!! She refused to speak to me anymore after I got upset from being called a liar and hung up on me!! DONT EVER BUY FROM THIS STORE DONT GO IN DONT GIVE THEM A PENNY! I hope this company is shut down because people start to review yelp reviews before going in there. \n\nI explained more than 5 times that I never touched the wig in 2 days and that I most certainly did NOT brush it and all she kept saying to me was \"well that's what it looks like you did\". So basically THAT'S CALLING ME A LIAR! She hung up on me and told me she could not talk to me anymore because I was upset. REALLY????? Wouldn't you be upset if you purchased something and it literally fell apart in two days before you could even use it? \n\nBOTTOM LINE DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
