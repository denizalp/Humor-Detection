It does look like a hole in the wall, and I thought that it was going to be a long wait due to the number of people but I was wrong.  The food is good, the service is very good and quick.  We didn't have everything at our table (ketchup, jelly, cream ....) so we kept asking for what we needed. Our server would quickly need our needs, apologizing for our table not being fully stocked and making sure that our glasses never were emptied.
