Try the mango chili lime ice cream. I like mine with gummy bears. There was a customer who told me after I got my ice cream that she came here 2 days in a row for the ice cream cookie sandwich. If I had another day, I would probably come back and see what all the fuss was about. This place has outdoor  seating where you can view the bellagio fountains water show if u come at the right time.
