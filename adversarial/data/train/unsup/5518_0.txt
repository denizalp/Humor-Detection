I have never been to England to see what a real British Pub is like, but I very much hope it is like this one.\n\nFor an appetizer, my party shared a \"Giant Yorkshire Pudding\".  My mother had a British boyfriend when I was young and she made him Yorkshire pudding. This one was better than some I've had, but not as good as \"Mom used to make\". But since those weren't authentically \"Authentic\" it's tough to deduct points for it.  They got cold quick, but that was probably because of the \"Giantness\" \n\nProbably the best Scotch Eggs I've ever had are here. And you can get them cold OR warm (I personally recommend warm).\n\nI also had the Fish and Chips (Since I was going for \"The Classic\" British Style) and they were good.  Just one fish, but it was a pretty big fillet, so no complaints.\n\nWe finished it off with Sticky Toffee Pudding which was great!\n\nThrough all of this, the ONE waitress kept on top of a pretty busy place.  Considering she was the only one waiting tables her performance was extraordinary. Though as an understandable side effect, service was a bit slow and a member of the party never got the coffee she ordered with the Pudding.\n\nI wish I was in Vegas more often so I could stop in more often. I do hope to come back the next time I'm in town.\n\nOne other side note.. They do have a \"Pet Friendly Patio\" so you can bring your pet for a meal outside.\n\n(PS: Due to some drunkenness, I checked in twice.  I've only been here once. The second check in is wishful thinking. Unless it is very far in the future and I've been here more than twice.  In which case, subtract one)
