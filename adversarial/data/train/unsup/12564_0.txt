I'm glad to finally try this place.  If you like chicken salad or  pimento and cheese - this place is for you.  They have a large menu with a copious selection of sandwiches and sides.\n     The dining area appeared spacious and very clean.  You order at the counter first and then they bring your food to the table.  The cashier wasn't helpful or very motivated but we managed to find what we wanted to order.  \n     The food was really good.  I got a chicken salad sandwich with a side of spicy pimento and cheese.  Both were wonderful.  The croissant was fresh and  buttery tasting. For the price, there should have been more chicken salad on the sandwich.  It also came with  a pickle spear and a small sweet biscuit.
