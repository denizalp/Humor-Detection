Attended a wedding here yesterday. Grounds were pretty nice, service was good. \n\nPros: It's off the strip quite a ways which was nice. Grounds are pleasant and clean. Restrooms are clean. Owner operator is very accomodating.\n\nCons: The owner kept making creepy comments about the brides shoes. I don't know if he wanted to wear them himself or he liked her wearing them.
