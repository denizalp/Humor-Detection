Right by Best Buy off of the Rainbow exit on the 215. Very convenient if you are in the area to shop or simply passing through. The drive thru is usually not a long wait, plus there are handy designated parking spaces for those waiting to pick up the drive thru orders in the rare (just past where the drive thru traffic exits. Of course!)\n\nThis location is kept extremely clean (at least from where the customers can see), even by the typical cleanliness standard of the average Jamba Juice.\n\nThe staff are friendly. The ones making the juices, smoothies bust their butts to get the orders out as quickly as humanly possible and accurately. Most do it with a smile even when they are getting slammed on their \"Free Fresh Squeezed Juice\" promo morning. They recognize and acknowledge frequent customers too (nice touch).\n\nThis location is not the biggest and took over from a now defunct Froyo business, so the design is a long narrow rectangle, with not much indoor seating area (for escaping the hot Vegas summer), but additional patio seatings are available.\n\nThere are many Jamba Juice locations in Las Vegas. This one is not even the closest to me, but it is now my favorite. Looking forward to redeeming the rest of my Jamba Juice Groupons here.\n\nEasy 4 stars. Maybe even very close to 4.5 stars.
