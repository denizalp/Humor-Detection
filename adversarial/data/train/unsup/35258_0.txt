I have been to Surrender twice before and both times have been really awesome with all my crew. Danced, drank and hung out in and outside. The indoor\/outdoor option is really cool and makes it a lot more spacious. However, this past weekend was super crowded it was unbearable. The entrance, exit, restroom and bar are all right at the front which makes it a cluster of people standing and bouncers shining their light at you. Granted, Lil Jon was going to be there so that's why the crowd was out of control this time compared to before. I would say go to clubs with no major DJ. Surrender is kinda small especially when the outside is closed off but other than that it's nice.
