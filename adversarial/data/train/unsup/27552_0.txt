It's taken me over 7 years but I've finally found a decent Chinese restaurant in Scottsdale. Their food is delicious (we had Mongolian Beef, Veggie Lo Mein and Moo Goo Gai Pan) and tastes fresh and not salty. We ordered delivery. Our food arrived hot, the delivery guy was professional and nice. He even met me at the entrance of our building rather than make we walk to meet him at then management office (we live in a condo, no one can ever find our building including Grub Hub). I love Chinese food and Yummy Yummy is definitely my new go to for great Chinese food!
