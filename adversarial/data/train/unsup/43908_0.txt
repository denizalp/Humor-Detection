Went for just a hour to test it out, my daughter is 18 months and a lot of places are too crazy for her. This place was great, it was busy but it didn't feel to overwhelming with kids. Clean, plenty of places for a little one her age. I hope this place stays this way, so many places become dirty and worn down too fast. We can't wait to go back for a longer visit.
