The Bank is pure Vegas cheese. Bottles are brought to your table via a giant diamond shaped carrier escorted by girls with sparklers. Be sure to spend a lot of money because there is a \"$15,000\" diamond pendant going to the table who spends the most. LOL \n\nSpending money won't be a problem either because water is $8 a bottle and there is NO tap water! Or ice for that matter. The dance floor is quite tiny and the workers are very strict about sitting at the tables so you can forget about resting your weary stiletto'd feet. Exiting the club also turned out to be a bit of a pain when we had to wait in line to take an elevator down because the club didn't want to reverse the 2 escalators. \n\nThe highlight of my night was when my friend dropped her napkin and a worker literally ran across the dance floor to pick it up and scampered away. I felt like I was at Wimbledon!
