First time visiting this place and I was very impressed! There was no wait for a table on Saturday at 6pm, and the service was very fast. I love the rustic yet industrial vibe they have going.\n\nI had the margarita pizza and my boyfriend had the pepperoni, we both felt they had really fresh ingredients and amazing flavor combinations. His only beef was that the middle of the crust was a little uncooked, but that comes with the cooking style they use (wood burning pizza oven). I would definitely recommend giving this place a try, but don't do take out. This pizza needs to be eaten fresh, even towards the end I noticed myself longing for the pieces I had eaten earlier in the meal
