I am a fan of OHSO.  I have to brunch at the Indian School locations.  LOVE IT!  I was in North Scottsdale meeting up with a friend, we decided to have OHSO.  And I was craving a burger.  It is smaller than the IS location.  We were greeted and sat between inside and outside of the place.  Felt a little on display.  I order the Burger + Cheese with fries.  It was so good.  The service was average.  I had to ask for refills.
