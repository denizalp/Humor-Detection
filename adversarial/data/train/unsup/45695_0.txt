We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here from the brussel sprouts to the Greek salad to the scallops and greens to the kale flat bread.  All of our dishes were carefully prepared and we both thought everything was so tasty and filling.  They also have a lovely wine selection.  Service was so friendly, cheerful and open to answering our questions.  The restaurant ambiance makes you forget you are in casino, and their prices are reasonable.  I would highly recommend this restaurant in the SLS casino\/hotel as we had a very pleasant dining experience here.
