Dang mang! I am really impressed with the Golden Nugget. I had no idea things like shark tanks and waterslides through shark tanks and poolside blackjack existed in downtown Vegas. Boy, am I glad I found it out.\n\nFor Sir Nicholas' recent birthday I took him on a surprise trip to Vegas. He mentioned the last time we talked about Vegas that he has always wanted to stay in downtown. Our friends Mike and Hazel always mentioned that they stayed in the Golden Nugget. After looking online and discovering that the NICEST rooms were still under $200 a night it was a done deal.\n\nCheck in and out was easy peasy. If you stay in the Gold Tower, where we stayed, on the club level floors you have complimentary Wi-Fi, water, coffee, and snacks. The snacks are in the hallway by the elevator, but they are things like apples, nuts, and M&Ms. The pool is nice, with poolside gambling as I mentioned earlier and the ability to rent out cabanas if you want your own private space. The location is also good for downtown, whether you want to stay around the casinos or venture out and discover a little more of the local scene in terms of bars, restaurants, or even arts stuff.\n\nI'd definitely stay here again - for the price and location, at least of the Gold Tower, it's easily worth it!
