My husband and I have both had work done here with Tyler and Brian. Both were friendly and very knowledgable. They stayed within our budget and drew me up tattoos that we loved. Everyone we encountered at the shop was very straightforward and definitely have earned our future business. I would definitely recommend Brian and Tyler at Black Lotus.
