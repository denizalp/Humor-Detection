I've eaten at Nove three times and I like the room and the food.  I was going to have a final meal at Aliz√© before it closes but they had no reservation times available.  Sorry, Nove, but you were my second choice.\n\nThis Sunday night, the restaurant was very quiet.  For a half hour, I was the only customer in the place.  Then a couple came and was seated at the table next to me.\n\nAfter ordering iced tea and placing my dinner order, the server brought me a bread basket and a small side dish with two compartments--one with olive tapenade and the other with a balsamic and olive oil mixture.  I'm not a fan of balsamic.  I'll try to remember just to get olive oil in the future.\n\nI started with charred octopus.  It was charred correctly and it was tender.  Following this, my main course was tortiglioni with spicy sausage, peas, and tomato cream sauce.  The sausage had good spiciness to it and with the tomato cream sauce, the dish was a winner.  For dessert, I got the amaretto mousse cake after learning that there wasn't a lot of amaretto and it was baked in.  The cake consists of amaretto mousse, almond chocolate cake, cocoa, and amaretto Anglaise.  There was very little amaretto flavor but the chocolate was rich.\n\nService was good.  Iced tea refilled without asking.  My only suggestion here is to check the glass when you refill.  Pouring iced tea into a glass in which all the ice had melted calls for a fresh glass or a separate glass with fresh ice.  It's something which a restaurant like this should catch.
