After reading many great reviews about this salon, I was very excited to try it out. The owner, aiden, is dishonest and after experiencing many different salons in the city, I have never encountered this type of experience that would prompt me to need to write a review. When I called for a quote about a full set, I was quoted $25. He convinced me to get the full set with French tips rather than paint on the white tips because it was \"the same price anyway\". He also did not round off my nails well and they came out very uneven. Also, the place was extremely dirty and dusty.i did not feel comfortable even washing my hands there. I wanted a red line on my nails and he rushed so much that the lines are smeared and uneven. I'm not sure why he wasn't diligent when he didn't have an appointment after me for an hour and a half. The acrilyc on my thumb is bumpy and he put way too much on there. I'm very disappointed in this place because to top off my already poor experience, after, he charged me $37(which I wouldn't have minded had he been honest from the start.) he said it was $25 for a set, $5 for the tips (though he promised me it was no additional charge), and $7 for the poorly shaped and uneven lines. I am so unhappy with my nails that I need to get them redone somewhere else immediately. This man is dishonest and I will never recommend this place to anyone, nor will I ever come back!
