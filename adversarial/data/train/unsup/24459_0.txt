Tucked in the corner of Nymark plaza sit Jerusalem buffet restaurant. It's been sitting here for years, and I've been living almost next door to it for over 20 years, and today was the first time I came here.\n\nI would say its a Middle Eastern 'Mandarin' type of restaurant. It's reminiscent of Middle Eastern food (not just from Israel), but it's just not as tasty or authentic. I actually prefer my mother in law's home cooking to this. \n\nAnyway, it was fun for what it was. On a Monday evening, there were barely 4 tables. Every night there is a Belly Dancing show (let's just say, I've seen better), although entertaining, it got a little awkward at a family dinner. \n\nThe buffet charges $20 pp, you get a variety of cold foods, hot foods (fish, chicken, lamb, falafel), some pizza looking things, and dessert (baklava was decent).\n\nThe service.... was non existent except clearing our plates and getting us the bill. Most of the time they are standing around, but no one could help us pour the pitcher of water.\n\nThey do have a take out section, adjacent to the main restaurant. Falafel (was tasty) and Shawerma.
