Great service with good food. What more can I asked for?\n\nMost of my friends make fun of me for getting a burger this weekend. I don't blame them. Since 90% of my diets are Asian food, me having a burger must be a major shock for them Lol. Anyhoo...I ordered a small burger (which is basically a regular size burger) with Cajun French fries. I also ordered a Oreo cookie milk shake to go with it. Everything is absolutely delicious. My favorite is the Cajun French fries. It is covered with seasoning and I basically finished the whole thing.\n\nI really wish I didn't have to eat out of a paper bag, but I believe this is how all five guys are.....other than that, I'll definitely come back here again.
