I was recently invited to join the Dutch Mafia by two really really nice baristas at Dutch Bros. Coffee. I was concerned that there would be some sort of \"coffee in, coffee out\" ritual that would require my participation, but I was assured that I had nothing to worry about. And that is how I became a card carrying member of this organization. Also, this card gives you one free beverage after you purchase 8, so I would recommend joining the ranks of the Dutch Mafia. \n\nI am not much of a coffee connoisseur, as in I enjoy the instant shit that is provided by my place of business, so you can disregard my opinion. However, I love the coffee at Dutch Bros. Just a plain old cup of coffee is really tasty. \n\nThey are also happy (like really happy, not faking it) to accommodate any other requests that you have. Once I asked for a half coffee half steamed chocolate milk (delish, bee-tee-dubs), and I got just what I wanted. They are even willing to experiment for you too, like the one time I got a kiwi-pineapple Italian Soda. \n\nI highly recommend stopping by for a drink if you ever happen to pass a Dutch Bros. If anything the uber nice beverage specialists will restore your faith in a kind-hearted humanity.
