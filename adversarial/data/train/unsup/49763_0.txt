Complaining about customer service is not something that I like to do because I completely get having \"off\" days. But I have been in this store about 6 times now and each time no matter who is working is always super rude. I go in because I need protein bars and it's the closest place to my house but I feel uncomfortable to even be in there for more than a couple of minutes. I always want to try a smoothie but I feel like I won't get any real help from them. The first time I was in there there was a little boy who was about 6 or 7 ordering a shake for his dad and the guy behind the counter could not have seem more inconvenienced. I just moved to the area and actually thought about applying there before I knew what their customer service was like. I'm going to continue to go as it's so conveniently located but if I find something better I will definitely make the change.
