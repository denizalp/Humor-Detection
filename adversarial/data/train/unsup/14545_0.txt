HIGH FIVE, High Park Dental.\n\nI had nothing but positive interactions here, and that's coming from someone who hadn't been to a dentist in 2 years, rarely flosses, and had to return for fillings. \n\nSo, hats off to these guys. \n\nThe staff here are friendly, gentle, and really professional. Everything's clean, and while the dentist examines and works on your teeth he calmly explains what he's doing in a \"this isn't a big deal, take a nap if you want\" kind of way, which I appreciate. \n\nThe less pleasant aspects were carefully done, I never felt overwhelmed even with a drill in my mouth. The hygenist was also a funny quirky lady who laughed a lot. The general atmosphere was super relaxed and I felt good leaving. \n\nAlso, my teeth look great, and I don't have to lie around feeling paranoid anymore!\n\nA bonus: they charge directly to your insurance, and you can book online.
