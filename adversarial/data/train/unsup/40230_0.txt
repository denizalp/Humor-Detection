This place just had a really inconsistent selection of food.  We went for the brunch, which ended up being $20 a person.  The breakfast was weird - the eggs were soft like I like them but had a strange rice-like consistency, the sausages were also mushy inside, and the bacon was not crunchy but not limp either.  The sushi was just eh, not memorable - it tasted like it had been made earlier and refrigerated, because it was cold and kind of hard. The shrimp was peel-n-eat, which is a good way to keep lazy people from eating it. The fresh fruit (grapes, pineapples, strawberries) were good, and so was the stir fried veggies.  The corned beef was way dry, but the BBQ pork ribs were pretty damn good.  *sigh* what can I say? After eating at Wynn the night before, TI couldn't even compare. We just wanted something quick before going to the airport, so I guess this place worked in a pinch. But, if you had a choice and wanted to pay something in the same price bracket, I think the one at the Mirage was much better from my last visit to Vegas.
