After waiting for nearly an hour for our table and being told they \"forgot to put us on the list\" we finally were seated. We waited for over 45 minutes and our food came out cold. We told the owner about our experience and said we would eat the food because we had waited for so long but just wanted to let him know, he said he'd take care of it. Well when our bills came out we were actually overcharged. When we asked to speak to the owner again they said \"he's in the kitchen and can't come out\" he finally came out after making us wait and said \"ok, what do you want. A free meal Or something? \" We insisted that we pay but it was the principle of how our visit went. In a very condescending and rude manor he said to us \"your food wasn't actually cold.\"  He then proceeded to chase us out the door calling us assholes, telling us we \"looked funny\", were \"ugly bitches\", and that we could \"wash his dishes\" if we needed a job. I've never actually written a bad yelp review but this needed to be shared. Such a bummer because we used to go there often but will NEVER be back. It's sad to me that people feel they can act a certain way just because they are the \"owner\". If they need a dish washer, maybe he should go back to that, customer service is definitely not his strength! In other news, our server was great!
