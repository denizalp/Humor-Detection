Ok, let me start off by saying, we didn't really eat here. We had reservations and we had every intention of eating here, but couldn't. Let me tell you why. It was LOUD. And I don't mean that kind of loud where you might have to speak a little louder to chat with your dinner mates. I mean the kind of loud where the music is at nightclub level and you have to yell to have a conversation. \n\nNow this might be a generation thing as my party of four are all in their 40s, but seriously, I just couldn't stay there. We asked the hostess for another recommendation and she immediately got us into Nove Italiano which was outstanding. They poured our drinks into plastic cups (so we could take them with us) and apologized - although they didn't owe us an apology...apparently we're just old! \n\nThe girls at the hostess desk and at the bar were great. It wasn't them. It was us. I just hadn't read any other reviews that mentioned the noise level so I just wanted others to be aware.
