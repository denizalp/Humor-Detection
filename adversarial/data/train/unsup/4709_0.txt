My stay at the Luxor was terrible. I have never been so grossed out by a hotel as I was with the Luxor hotel. A friend and I went to Vegas to have a fun girls getaway; neither of us are hotel snobs but to say we were highly disappointed when we opened the door to our room for the first time is an understatement. The room was dark and dank, the chairs and lamp shades has these weird stains on them(I don't want to imagine what it could have been), the shower still had hairs in it from the previous guest as well as this nasty looking ring of slime around the edges and the air condition was rattling. \n\nWe contacted the front desk and they eventually sent someone up, they temporarily fix the problem, but the noise gradually started back and by our third(and final) night it was back at full volume. Luckily,we didn't spend much time in our room. Additionally, we had to call down everyday to get housekeeping to clean our room and then again to get fresh towels and they had the nerve to drag on that.\n\nThe only thing, I did like was how soft the bed was, but because I question the cleanliness of my room, I wasn't able to sleep good because I wasn't sure what filth I was sleeping on top of. I have NEVER been so happy to check out of a hotel in my life! With all the choices you have in Vegas, spend a few more $$ and stay at a better hotel. You will be glad you did.
