This is the least clean Target I have ever been to. It's not in the best of locations, but it doesn't mean they can't take the time to take care of their store. There are items strewn around in different aisles and the lighting is dim. I think there are light bulbs that may need replacing to help with the lighting, but oh well I really just needed to pick up a specific item. \n\nOne helpful worker pointed me in the right direction of my item and while he was stocking shelves, there were two female employees just standing around chatting away while he was actually doing some work. I found the one item I needed and was ready to check out. The two registers were busy, so I used the self check out. Easy to use system and I was on my way out. Wouldn't recommend this location if you have another choice.
