Ugh. Where to begin.\n\nI drove up to Madison to visit my boyfriend on Cinco De Mayo, and decided we should get some mexican and margaritas to be festive! So we chose Laredo's.\nBad call.\nService was bad from the minute we walked in. Hostesses were unfriendly, and since they were on a 15 minute wait, they ripped off a piece of notebook paper, wrote the number \"30\" on it, and told us they'd call our number.\n\nWe decided we'd grab some drinks at the bar while we waited. When the bartender finally made his way over to us, we ordered a beer and a margarita, to which he responded \"Uhh, that's gonna be 8 something... maybe.\" So my boyfriend just handed him a $10 and told him to keep it. Really? Shouldn't he know how much to charge?\n\nWhen we finally got seated, we decided on nachos for an appetizer. They came out in one big pile of squishy mush. The meat was decent, but everything else tasted bland, and well.. mushy.\n\nWe ordered our entrees, and waited. And waited. And watched other people order and eat. And waited..... and waited... for 45 minutes, we waited. We actually considered just leaving (which I have never done and couldn't ever actually do). Finally our server came to our table and asked if we had gotten our food yet. We said no, he went to the kitchen, came back and told us they had boxed it up to go but that he would  bring it out now.\nYuck! I don't want food that's been sitting around in boxes for 45 minutes when I go out to eat. So my boyfriend told him we didn't want our food anymore and we'd just pay for the appetizer and leave.\n\nAt least we were too full of mushy nachos to really be hungry for the rest of our food.\n\nIn short, don't go to Laredo's.
