Uh, can anyone say \"why the fuck did I come here?\"  I kept saying that until I got on one of the penny slots near the keno section.  5 jackpots, 1,000 credits.  3 jackpots, 2 wilds, 1,000 credits.  Bonus with 15 free spins, 800 credits.  Another bonus round with 15 free spins, 900 credits.  When you're playing pennies, that only adds up to $37.00, but fuck, you're not losing money.  So why the 3 stars?  Hella the electronic games are video poker.  What's up with some more slots?
