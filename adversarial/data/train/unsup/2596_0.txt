To add insult to injury to my ordeal, I just found out that they added a tip to the total. I specifically left $0 tip on the bill to make a statement and they have the nerve to charge me a tip?!?! I will definitely make sure everyone knows my disgust with this place.\n\nI was looking forward to this place. Vegas local and have been to just about every high end buffet there is and this was on my to do list and boy was I disappointed\n\nService\nWas just horrible, our waiter spent a lot of time talking to two girls the entire time we were there. They got great service, our party, not so much. It was very frustrating to have to ask for things multiple times as was the case, I really expected much more from this place.\n\nFood\nThe selection is small. I do prefer quality over quantity but this place disappointed on both counts. The rack of lamb was excellent and the mint jelly was probably the best I ever had but the rest just sucked. The lobster tails were soggy as were the crab legs. The French toast bread putting just sucked and the shrimp were awful. Overall was not good.\n\nValue\nI don't mind paying good money for a good meal but this was just horrific, Caesars, Bellagio, and Wynn Brunch are so much better and cheaper.\n\nPeople seem to like this place, maybe I just got a bad server combined with a bad sampling of food but definitely not going to give it a second tru to find out.
