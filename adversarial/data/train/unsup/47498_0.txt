I went to this QT for lunch based on the promotion on the website for a free drink with hotdog purchase.  The assistant manager Michael said he was not aware of this promotion so I showed it to him on the QT website.  He still was not sure of the promotion and said it must not be valid and questioned the dates it was good for.  He then said he would honor it for only 1 of the 3 people in my party.  Each of us were paying individually and he said he could not do that.  He said it was 1 per group even though it did not say anything about a restriction on the website.  Again I told him we were paying individually.  I asked for the manager.  He said he was the manager.  I told him I was not at all satisfied with the treatment I received from him at this QT and would contact the corporate office.  I have always enjoyed QT and the value and service provided but was extremely disappointed by the interaction and non-customer focus that I received today.  I will think again before shopping at a QT.  I am shocked at the lack of training  your employees have been given to remain focused on the customer.  I thought QT was a new chapter in convenience stores but this appears to be wrong.
