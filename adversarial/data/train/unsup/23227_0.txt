Seeing as know the owners my review might be just a litle biased, and at the same time I see how hard they work to provide excellent food, drink, customer service and continuously improve their operation.  Awesome food, free poker three nights a week (with a chance to win a seat to the World Series of Poker) , countless TV's and a high energy, friendly staff are just a few reasons to visit KO's.
