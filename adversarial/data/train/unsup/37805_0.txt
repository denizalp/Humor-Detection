I had the worst service and food of my life at this place. Not to mention, when the manager came over, he seemed to not care how unhappy I was. I waited over an hour for food, and my wine was old. The manager(I can't remember his name but he had red hair and a red beard)just made excuses and didn't fix the problem. Needless to say I'll never be back.
