I'm really curious how this company even has 1.5 stars. That extra 1\/2 star must come from all their marketing interns who write reviews for them. Like everybody else, we used this place because of our home warranty. And I really wish we had just ponied up the extra money and gone with a well reviewed technician instead. Honestly, they will visit you so many times you won't even be saving money using your warranty service.\n\nSeriously, this is a bad company. You know how sometimes you walk into a situation knowing it's bad but you're like, \"oh, it's not really a big deal and it can't be that bad\" ? Well, this is that situation. Because fixing your home stuff is rarely really a pressing deal, but this company will literally drive you crazy trying to get anything done.\n\nAnd their customer service folks are LITERALLY the worst. They scheduled an appointment with us twice and both times forgot to come. So for a third time we were pretty frustrated and the lovely Amanda said, \"I don't know why you're yelling at me (we weren't yelling at her) it's not like I did anything wrong.\" Which is such bad attitude. What's worse is when we called her out on her attitude and said we're the paying customer she then said, \"If you want me to do anything for you, you should behave more nicely.\"\n\nJust the worst. \n\n\nSometimes I wish Yelp let us post negative stars. This place is like, -100 stars. Seriously, this place puts all other 1 stars to shame.
