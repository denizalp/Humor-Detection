Playing on water slides is my version of an extreme sport, and in my hood you can participate in the x games for free. That's right, Alex Duff is open until 8pm and it's completely free.  \n\nThis pool has a baby area, a winding shallow end, a deep end with a diving board and another shallow end that acts as the outpost for the best free water slide in all of the land. A tall, yellow winding water slide that can make a grown woman squeal with childish delight. \n\nBeyond all of this, the deck is huge with equal parts shade and sun and a lovely mixture of families and adults. It's far less busy than the pool at Bathurst and Dundas. Crap, I probably shouldn't have written this review, but it's OK, I'll share...
