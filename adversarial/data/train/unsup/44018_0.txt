Just stopped in here last night for an after-work treat with a coworker! For one, I love that it's open late. The whole little plaza that it's in seems like a real hotspot, from how it's so hard to find parking!\n\nIt's a little hard to find if you're not looking from the street, as it's upstairs, so once you're in the lot, it's blocked from view. Definitely worth climbing the stairs for! It's a small venue - not a lot of seating available, but I think that it's meant to be mainly a to-go location. The baked goods are all fresh and definitely taste like it. You can see the actual bakery in the back, which is probably the reason that the front is so small. My friend and I got the ham sandwich (which has a lot more than ham - jalapenos, some crab, onions, and more! She was very happy with it!), a little eclair, and a sponge cake. We also got the green tea lattes, mine iced and hers hot. Both tasted excellent.\n\nThere's a nice blend of European sweets in with more traditional mochi treats and buns. Next time, I'm definitely trying the strawberries, as well as one of the cakes in the small display by the door.\n\nThe decor is very pretty and ambient, and there's so much to try that I'll definitely need to come back multiple times to taste all of the offerings! The owner was very friendly and brought our orders right out to us on a cute platter. The little touches make this one a winner if you're just looking for a light snack!
