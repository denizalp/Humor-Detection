We were heading out to the west side for a concert at Ak Chin and have learned our lessons that everything at westgate stinks and there is nothing good near Ak Chin so we looked into old town Glendale and found a gem of a spot! This is a small pizzeria Italian restaurant and it's amazing! They make everything in house. We had the fried calamari, which came out fast and was crisp. The marinara served with it was delicious and I could have eaten it with a spoon! We got a pizza that had spicy peppers, sopressetta, basil and was drizzled very lightly with honey. It was a red sauce pizza with homemade mozzarella and was spicy but not overly so. It had great flavor and was the perfect meal before going to a concert!\n\nWe don't get out to Glendale often but when we do we will return to this spot!\n\nOur server was Sammy (I think) and she was great too!!
