What a beautiful building and really well laid out. I found everything I needed and the sign up process was quick and easy. \n\nMy *only* suggestion (not even a complaint, really) is in the a\/v space. If the DVDs aren't going to be organized alphabetically aside from the first letter of the title, perhaps stack them vertically so people aren't craning to read the titles through 500 square feet of shelving. And regarding the CDs, same goes. File them spines up so people can cruise them from a birds eye view rather than flip each and every disc *clack*clack**pause*clack*clack*clack*clack*, etc.\n\nI requested two DVDs be put on reserve and upon looking them up, the woman told me they'd gone missing. But no matter, replacements would be ordered that day and she'll call me when they come in. Handy!
