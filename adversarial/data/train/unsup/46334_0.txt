This restaurant just opened near me and I was intrigued so I thought I'd give it a try. Luckily I made it just before the lunch rush at about 11:30 a.m. \nThere was already a decent crowd and then, BAM! Tons of people. I can see why though. The food was hot and fresh and delicious. Decently priced. \nSo here's how it works...you order with a host and then go pay at the counter.  You are given cups for your drinks and you gather napkins, silverware, etc and choose your own table.  When the food is ready, it is brought to you at your table. No complaints about the food. I had the pesto pasta with chicken. It comes with a big ole French bread and you will be full if you eat it all. I saved half because I wanted to try the dessert!\nI chose the coconut creme cake which did not disappoint! I love coconut so for me this was nirvana. Moist and fresh and chock full of coconut. It is very rich so I recommend sharing with a friend.\nThe only complaint was that it was very noisy. It's all wood flooring so the noise just echos and the busser decided to use the table next to us as his bus station. I ended up politely asking him to leave since I didn't want to hear plates crashing while I was eating.\nThe only other thing is that parking is sparse. It's a tiny lot to accommodate the restaurant and the other businesses in the strip.  But overall, I loved it. It was fun trying a new place and the food is tasty. I highly recommend it!
