Balenciaga is one of my favorite handbag designers and I have been buying them for years so I have amassed quite a collection; however, women can never have enough handbags so I stopped in to have a look and potentially add to my collection because what is a trip to Vegas without dropping some money on handbags?!?!\n\nThis is an extremely high end store so if you walk in dressed less than high end don't expect a welcoming customer service experience.  I have mixed thoughts about this especially in Vegas where day shopping doesn't dictate expensive high end dress to achieve your purpose.  The one star missing is because I watched a few people get ignored for a while because of this.  Since I already know this about shopping in Vegas and since I appreciate quick, friendly and attentive customer service, I came prepared in the proper dress.\n\nThe selection of handbags here is large and they are displayed well on clean, organized and well lit shelving.  In my opinion the quality of the bags from the leather to the styles and the stitching is top notch and that's why I don't mind the price tags associated with them.\n\nThe staff was very knowledgeable about the product line as well as suggestions on how to match and wear the bags for appropriate outfits.  I enjoy sales professionals that also have style sense and knowledge.  My vast handbag collection grew by two more after shopping here and I can't wait to come back in June.
