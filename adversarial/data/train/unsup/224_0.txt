This place was recommended to us by a waiter at a restaurant... I guess it was our mistake for asking a yuppity hipster where we should get our drinks. These guys couldn't make a good drink if their bob Marley posters depended on it. The bartenders clearly didn't want to be spending their Friday night serving drinks. Maybe find a new profession? Our drinks were weak. We left with $50 out of our pockets and sober enough to pass an alcohol test. We went to a small bar right down the street and got perfectly inebriated on $30.
