Good prices. Some staff are hesitant in helping you. The Mountain Dew machine in the cafe area(dining) is always out of syrup. The tables are always dirty. I have attached a pic of dried up mustard. Over all the facility is kept clean. Some minor improvements on customer service and cleanliness and I would bump my review up to 5 stars.
