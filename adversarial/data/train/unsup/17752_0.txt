It used to be my favourite Vietnamese restaurant but lately their dishes are not so good as they used to be. We used to come in often for Pho (we realized that veggie Pho was the best - the most flavourful) and their Fresh Avocado Rolls with Peanut Sauce were divine... well, not anymore. Our last few visits left us disappointed as the Pho was missing taste - no salt, no flavour and Avocado Rolls barely had any avocado in it. I mean, they used to be full of avocado- so delicious. But now it's mostly noodles... no, thanks. And once the avocado was all brown and ugly, I had to ask for another portion. Will look for new place. Maybe their chef changed, not sure what happened here...
