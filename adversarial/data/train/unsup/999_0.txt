I went here for eyelash extensions and had a terrible experience.  First, the technician had a strong body odor which I realized halfway through my service as I was laying on a table with my eyes closed and she was leaning over me.  It was clear she had not showered recently or washed her hair...awkward.  The minute I realized this was not the scent of a mud treatment or something that would be acceptable at a spa was too late and I was so grossed out.\n\nIt took about 30 minutes for the girl to glue extensions to my eyes and midway through the adhesive caused me to start tearing up.  She had me sit with a fan blowing on my eyes for 15 minutes to set the glue (most places are able to \"set\" the lashes in 30 seconds or so).  I have had eyelash extensions before and never had an allergic reaction or been sensitive...little did I know she was using the wrong type of adhesive!  I was in incredible pain and when I left I actually said it my car and cried because the pain was too intense.  I couldn't believe it.  This is NOT what you should experience with lash extensions.  The type of burn most closely resembled the reaction to skin and superglue...so I truly have no idea what kind of insanely bonding glue they used but there is no way it can be legal\/appropriate for skin.\n\nI paid $40 and tipped on top of that for some reason.\n\nLater, when I went to another salon to have my lashes removed, I was told that they had used an extremely strong adhesive that should not be used on my lashes, or any human for that matter, as it was weighing down my lashes and not appropriate for the lash cycle.  The estheticians I have since visited have encouraged me to file a complaint with the state cosmetology board.\n\nMy lashes began to fall off and the extensions with them in about 2 days.  They should last 2-3 weeks depending on your showering habits, makeup, etc.  I am still in the process of regrowing my lashes and caring for their mistake.
