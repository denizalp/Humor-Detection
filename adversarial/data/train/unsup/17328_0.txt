Sure, there's a wait, but once you've eaten there you really understand why. I really love this place for breakfast. I'd give it 5 stars but I had a weird experience last Saturday. I ordered a strawberry Belgian waffle and a kids chocolate chip pancake. (Hey, be nice, I couldn't decide what I wanted and Mom said to get both so who am I to argue?) The waitress asked if I wanted whipped cream. Yes, I said, on both. She brought out the food but nothing had whipped cream on it. She realized and brought me a large side of it but it wasn't the same. The heat of the breads is supposed to melt it a little bit and make it moist but these were *seriously* dry. The strawberries were yummy but \"dry\" as well (which is fine-- they're not supposed to be wet-- but it didn't help the dry waffle\/pancake problem.) It was a little weird smearing the cream on after the fact, but whatever. \n\nThe ham and cheese omelette my mom got was fantastic, as was the orange juice. She also said the coffee wasn't bad, for restaurant coffee. I wish they had skim\/fatfree milk!! \n\nStill I love this place!!
