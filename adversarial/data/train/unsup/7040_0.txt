I had been hearing about Deering Vintage for quite some time now and being the fashion lover that I am I figured it was about time I check this place out.  I had a little trouble finding the place (stupid iPhone!) but my frustration disappeared the instant I stepped into this treasure chest!\n\nI didn't know where to start - there were so many great pieces that caught my eye.  I was on a short time limit, but I was able to sift though quite a few racks and ended up finding an amazing 70's cocktail dress to wear to a wedding I have coming up. I also found a few pieces that I wanted to think about before making the impulse buy and I haven't stopped thinking since!  \n\nThere is such a wide variety of clothing and I noticed quite a few designer pieces at REALLY GREAT prices.  And if you love vintage accessories, then this is the place for you because there is a HUGE collection that I definitely want to go check out when I have the time to really take it all in. \n\nAll in all, one of the best vintage stores I've been to in any city!
