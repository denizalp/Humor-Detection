I have been coming to purple perk for years.  I used to work on my leases for property managing outside on the patio and now I work on my contracts for my fast growing commercial cleaning business.  It's so great not being here for a while and the girls knew that I liked a different sweet sauce with my always yummy Thai beef wrap.  It's great to come into a super clean coffee place with nice familiar faces and great food. Keep it up and see you soon !
