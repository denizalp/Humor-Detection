It was actually pretty good! The staff was really friendly  & at top speed, the prices were also exponentially awesome, I got the french toast w\/a side of sausage & a lemonade and my boyfriend got the red velvet pancakes (which he slaughtered btw) with a side of bacon and orange juice leaving the total at only $23! We will be back! :)
