Great restaurant, fast service, excellent food. What else can you ask for? We for the dan dan noodle and the beef with tendon noodle soup. Both were really flavorful and the house made flour noodle was great. The noodles were not over cooked, had the perfect tenderness. \n\nwe went at lunch and the line was ~10-15 minutes, so just be aware there might be a small wait. I guess when the food is excellent, lines are proof\n\nAttached a few pictures, strongly recommend this restaurant. Will gladly eat here again
