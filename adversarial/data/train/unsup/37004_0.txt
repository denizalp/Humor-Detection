Avoid! I had a pang of guilt giving my leftovers to a homeless guy. \"Duck\" wings are actually duck sauce - flavored - chicken wings. Brussels sprouts slathered in sickeningly sweet Asian sauce. Pre-mixed drink was weak &, as it became clear one should suspect here, too sweet. Service was pathetically slow for what appeared to be a slow night.
