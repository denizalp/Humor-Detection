I needed my filter cleaned and pool maintenance done.  My last pool service, DiamondBack Pool Service, didn't return my call right away, so I decided to try Pool Daddy.  George removed the grid assembly then called me over and told me that the grids were broken and strongly suggested that I replace all of them.  I felt the corner of one, which was broken, the rest seemed fine, no tears or obvious breaks.  To be honest they were still in the assembly and I wasn't able to examine each of the grids separately - (but I wouldn't think that he should have been able either).  Plus I had just replaced all of the grids eight months ago (after 3 years of use), and couldn't believe that they would have been broken already.   He was going to charge me $40 per grid, while the other pool company only charged me $25.\n\nI decided not to have him order new grids but just clean the existing ones and clean and provide maintenance on the pool. \n\nHe sprayed the grids with the hose while still in the assembly, instead of removing and cleaning each one separately.  He left the mound of sludge on my lawn without washing it away.  I use cellulose fiber rather than D.E., which I asked him to use.  I left a new bag with him.  After he had completed his work he came back with the bag completely empty.  It was a 3 lb bag, and you're only supposed to use 9 cups.  So after consulting with my guy at Leslie's I ended up backwashing and recharging the grids.\n\nI won't go further into details about communication issues, other than to say that Kimberly was very pleasant to talk with and very helpful during this whole process.  It all ended amicably, but I wish I would have waited until my previous pool service returned my call - they're excellent.  Another lesson learned.
