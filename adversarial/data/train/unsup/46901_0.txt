I am giving the Walnut Street European Wax Center a 2 star review because it was not such a welcoming experience with the check in girl, DINA. It was my first time here as I referred by a friend, once me and my friend arrived we stated that we BOTH had an appointment, and the receptionist only checked in my friend until I had to remind them that I too was standing there to be seen.\n\nBesides DINA not acknowledging my being checked in, she had a TERRIBLE attitude!!! I'm not sure if DINA was not happy she had to work on Christmas Eve or not but DINA was working and should have been professional and polite at all times. Also she failed to advise me I needed a PA license to obtain half off my services. \n\nThis place wasn't all bad, the person that waxed me, LEXI, was AWESOME!!!! She did a great job and explained everything she was doing before doing so, and also told me about a lot of products they had that would be beneficial to have!\n\nI'm not too sure if I would come back to this location, if I do it will be to see LEXI. Management should, however, consider training DINA again on how to be professional and friendly especially in a customer service environment when you are working with the public.
