This is no longer Ava's Cafe as of a week ago.  It is now Me-A-More Cafe.  Same great menu, minus the fish.  It's family owned and their young daughter is the waitess, she is such a delight.  The service was top notch and the food was fantastic!!  Definitely a repeat and hope they keep the same excitement for their new business!
