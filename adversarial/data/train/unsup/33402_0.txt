Was sent here for and xray for my daughter. Told xrays are walk-ins. Arrived around 4:15 and was urged by the staff to come back another day since the wait was over an hour. Returned the next day around the same time. This time the wait was 30 minutes. Checked-in and proceeded to wait. . . and wait. . . and wait. . . and wait. My daughter finally got her xray after waiting for an hour and a half. Then there was the wait for the xray images to ger burned on a CD. That was another 20 minutes. I will say that they gave us a card as we returned to the waiting room that stated they take 20 minutes to create the CDs so I was just hoping it wasn't going to be like the \"30 minute wait\" at check-in. So overall, we were there for just over 2 hours for a simple xray.
