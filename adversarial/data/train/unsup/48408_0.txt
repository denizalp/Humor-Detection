I wish we had this place in Texas. Glad they don't though because I'd be an alcoholic! Just kidding. But this place is amazing, can't even tell I'm drinking alcohol even with the extra shot added! The flavors they offer are ALL so amazing so you definitely will have a hard time choosing. If you do, no worries because you can mix them together. They come in all kinds of sizes so it's pretty cool to see someone try and attempt to do the bottles that are as tall as them! I believe that the monster yard was just )15$ and to add the extra shot was $2! Can't wait to go back!
