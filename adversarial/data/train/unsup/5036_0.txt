Can we just keep this between ourselves? They just don't need any more customers to form a line at Sushi Ken.\n\nI lived in Japan for four years. My husband is Japanese, & we've picked apart every sushi restaurant in the East Valley(not on Yelp, though). I should make a list.\n\nThis is where we eat sushi. We live @ 40 minutes away & drive in for a meal.(Though with the price of gas...)\n\nIn the price:freshness ratio of good sushi, Sushi Ken has it made.\n\nIt's like a real Japanese family restaurant. Giant menus with a little of everything on it. Want sushi? Got it! Kids only eat noodles? Got it! Sister-in-law doesn't eat fish? Got it! Just like home, there's something for everyone. \n\nIn addition, the sushi is actually good, fresh & plentiful. Plus, if you can read Japanese there's little signs posted around with specialties like negitoro donburi, my favorite.\n\nHere's a little story;\nWe've been married almost 33 years. I'm ashamed to say that until my last trip to Japan in 2004 I didn't like sushi. At the great Tsukigi Fish Market, I ate my first negitoro donburi & fell in love. I even had it as my last meal at the airport before we left Japan, and my husband has taught himself to make it for me at home.(good guy!) It was life changing!\n\nSo go to Sushi Ken, and enjoy! But let's just keep it between us so there's still some negitoro for me!
