Did you know that \"Jamba Juice\" is a play on an African word, \"jama,\" which means, \"to celebrate?\"  Celebrate Juice!  Celebration Juice?  Celebratory Juice?  Eh!?!\n\nCatching a flight out of Las Vegas with like five pounds of extra weight on me from good food and lots of booze, I felt like I needed something maybe a little healthier to jump start my day.  But this is Jamba Juice so how healthy can I really go, right?  I ordered the Pumpkin Smash Smoothie.  It's made with real pumpkin supposedly.  Pumpkin's natural health benefits provide a hearty dose of nutrients to boost your eye and bone health as well as energy levels.  And after any allotted time in Las Vegas, I need a boost in energy.  It was sweet delicious, and easily chugged before I had to board onto the plane.\n\nLow energy also leads me to getting an Açaí Primo Bowl [\"A tasty twist of Açaí juice, soymilk, blueberries, strawberries and bananas, which we top with organic granola, fresh bananas, fresh blueberries, coconut and a drizzle of honey.\"]  as well.  This was truly outstanding.  The bright flavors and icy goodness woke me up.  Was I full?  Of course not.  I got pho as soon as we landed back in Phoenix.  #Balance\n\nSo yeah...  it's a Jamba Juice... at an airport.  What more can be said?  Prices are a bit more inflated since it is inside an airport but it's to be expected.
