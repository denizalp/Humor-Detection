Wow. I have not written a review for the buffet yet!\nCaution: Is more pricey, but you get what you pay for.\n\nTwo words: Prime rib. The best. I love it.\n\nI will tell you though, the Champagne lunch for an extra $7 is well worth it because they load you up! It wasn't one of those restaurant where they forget and you have to call a waiter and wait for them to come back. No. They refill it whenever it gets somewhat empty or half way empty if they're doing their rounds. COOL!\n\nOne of the best quality buffets out there. Trust me. My mom is Asian so I've been to my fair share. \n\nTip: Since it takes about an hour wait. Why not get a late lunch, stand in line by 2PM, get in at 3PM and pay for the lunch price and at 3:30PM, they switch the lunch menu to the dinner menu? You get the best of both worlds! So genius I should have thought of it sooner! Foolish me...
