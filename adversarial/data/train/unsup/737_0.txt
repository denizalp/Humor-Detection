Wish I could rate this terrible company 0 if I could. They are corrupt. They charge 3X more for sewer than Peoria City! The reps sound like zombies working behind the corruption. We used 3 gallons of water last month at most not even at our old home and bil was 138 dollars! More than our new home using water! This company needs to be iced. Frankly the worst service I have ever experienced in my life
