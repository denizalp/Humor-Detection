I absolutely love IKEA!\nSuch a convenient all-in-one place for your home or maybe business needs!\n\nAs you enter, there are arrows to guide you in how to go about the whole warehouse! You go through different set ups for living rooms, kitchens, offices, kid's bedrooms and so much more! Grab an item and put it in your cart OR write down the item name, color, aisle and bin number and your will have to look for your boxed item at the end right before check out!\n\nThere are also a ton of little knick knacks, tools, storage, as well as accessories for whatever you can think of that you may need.\n\nAll for a reasonable price! Tons of markdowns on different items each time.\n\nAlso, the cafe is delish! They're known for their meatballs with mashed potatoes and veggies, but you can't go wrong with their chicken fingers with fries!\n\nGlad Vegas has one of these now!
