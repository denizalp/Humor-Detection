early 2005, i had a part time job at a porn company. and as luck would have it, we were nominated for best retail website. and lucky for me, i got to go and work the convention and enjoy the fruits of my labor. \n\nbut besides all that, we stayed at the venetian, beautiful room, beautiful view, amazing food. the night of the AVNs our company won and we celebrated by co-renting out an entire bar in the hotel along with another porn company. i cant remember too much after that, but i remember waking up in a nice soft bed and being very happy.
