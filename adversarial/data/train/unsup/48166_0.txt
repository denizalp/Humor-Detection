I was on my way to have coffee and a dessert at a local cafe but I forgot that they closed on Sundays so since only two stores down there was a liquor depot I decide to pick up some booze for my birthday party this week.\n\nI was so surprised by the pricing here, so reasonable, I bought a huge bottle of Absolute Vanilla Vodka at less than prices I have seen in several liquor stores downtown and 4 bottles of merlot at $8.75 each.  What a score.\n\nI was so excited about getting everything I needed for my party at about 20% less than I budgeted for.  The man at the shop I think thought my screw was a bit loose because I kept on adding things to the counter every 5 minutes while yelling.  What a great find ... Stacey's!
