What good is it to have an upscale pool catered to sky suite members if there is no security and your $700 iPhone gets stolen right from under your nose! I now was in Vegas with no phone and lost all my pictures , videos, communication!!! Everything was gone. Happy Birthday to me! \n\nThey did pretty much nothing. They called security it took 45 minutes for the guy to show up and he said so sorry yada yada but did nothing to help. Why?? Because they don't have cameras anywhere. The waitress was super slow. The pool was small, the mojitos were absolutely terrible!!!  Drinks are outrageously expensive. What bothered me most was they really didn't give a sh*t. Just watch your things. Bunch of thieves work there.
