Overall, good experience and I'll likely be back. The polish choices were plenty and my basic mani-pedi were as good as I've had in the area. Spacious and clean salon, comfortable massage chairs. Minus one star because the service was a bit cold and I got the feeling that the nail technicians were talking in their native language about some of the customers. Not cool.
