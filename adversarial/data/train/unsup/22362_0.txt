Another day, another Chinese restaurant.  God, I hate my life.\n\nOrange chicken lunch special.  Judging by the time it took to make it (not long at all), I had already decided in my mind that the food would be average at best.  Yay for lowered expectations!  To tell you the truth, after awhile all these places start to taste the same anyway (that's food racist...I know), but for $6 for a full meal (entree, soup and drink), I'd be a fool to complain otherwise.
