I come to the Golden Gate Hotel & Casino to go to Du-Pars restaurant. I have gambled from time to time here but not that often. \n\nThe last time I was walking through the Casino to use the facilities I saw the Golden Gates new addition which are dancers dancing behind some of the blackjack tables. I am not surreally sure how I feel about this. What I dig about Downtown is that it is Old School Las Vegas and with this new little spin on things I am not sure what type of crowd they are trying to attract. The people like myself who have been coming here for years have been coming here to gamble not to hob-knob with local riff raff and with the new addition of dancers I am sorry you are probably going to attract a caliber of folk that I do not even want to look at let alone be around. \n\nI think these Old School Casinos should stick tot heir bread and butter the serious gambler. Anyone with a good head on their shoulder will be staying at the Golden Nugget and gambling throughout the Freemont, so stick to that base market. I guess I am just Old School like that. \n\nI tend to see behind the beaten path. I tend to see when Casino are adding dancers behind tables you are trying to distract the gambler. They might pay the dancer $10 bucks an hour to dance but the casino is making that back ten fold by people at the table playing Blackjack and hitting when they are not supposed to which throws the whole deck off for everyone else sitting at that table. \n\nI think my days of gambling here are done until this Casino realizes who their target audience is and sticks with it. If this Casinos new target audience is people who want to stare at borderline Strippers than I am sorry I will just go somewhere else. \n\nThe Dancers\/Strippers will not stop me from having meals here but that money is not going to the Casino and that is the only money this property will see me dish out.
