I took my first trip to this restaurant a couple of weeks ago and thought it was great. It is a classic place that has been doing things the same way since it has opened. If you are looking for a diet-friendly place, this is probably not the place for you (no gluten free or whole wheat pasta) but if you are just looking for a classic Italian place this is the perfect place. Each meal comes with unlimited wine- red and white, soup or salad, garlic bread, and a cappuccino. The environment is really fun and eclectic and the garlic bread was some of the best I've had. The chicken cacciatore I got was just okay but the sausage pasta my step dad ordered was really delicious as well as the eggplant parmesan. Service is really fast, friendly, efficient, and the prices are reasonable for what you get. You will probably have to wait to get a table but it is a Vegas staple and somewhat hidden secret from what I understand. It is a fun and novel place with classic Italian food. It was a fun night! I would give it 3 stars based on the meal I ordered but the overall spirit of the place gives it an extra star.
