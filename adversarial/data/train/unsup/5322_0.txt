Just got my food at 1126pm even tho my receipt says I paid at 1106pm! This is fast food?! I have ice cream in my groceries that I just bought not realizing I would be sitting waiting for Burger King for 20min!\n I am PISS'D! Didn't even get an apology \nAlso they weren't that busy for me to have to wait 20 minutes when the guy said he's only waiting on the fries- every fast food joint in Vegas sucks ass! I'm gonna tell my friends to quit eating this garbage!
