If you're looking for an auto company, go to Southwestern Auto Glass. They do a much better job. Not to mention, they offer $100 cash back, 8 Harkins movie tickets, or 3 windows tinted.\n\nKing provides poor installation and a lousy warranty policy.\n\nAfter a replacement by King ($200 cash) I had a leak and crack in my windshield. A few months of that (done by King whom I visited multiple times, wouldn't warranty it), I finally got it replaced. \n\nThe technician from Southwestern showed my that yes, they did a FAULTY INSTALLATION, and yes the crack was caused by that installation. I had roughly a 6 inch gap of no sealant, letting air seep in, causing the windshield to be weak in the corners, and cracked. King also did not prop the windshield up properly during installation, causing it to sag down!! The VIN wasn't visible it was so low!! Lastly, there was shards of glass on my dash after their installation....
