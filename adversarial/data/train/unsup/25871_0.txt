I put all three of my kids through this Preschool until they were out of grade school. I used this preschool for five years. There prices were always reasonable and my kids loved their teachers.  The facilities were also excellent. You may have to get on a waiting list as it seems to always be full but if you want the best for your kids it is worth the wait.
