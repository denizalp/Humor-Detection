OMG! My first massage! What was I waiting for??\n\nThis place is just a great place to relax, sweat, soak in Brossard.\nI did the Thermal Experience as well as a massage. \n\nThe massage room was quiet, dim, and soothing. I was a little uneasy seeing that I am usually uncomfortable with people touching me. But once my masseuse started working on my sore back from many surgeries from breast cancer, I was in heaven.\n\nThere were moments where I felt it was a little rough but all in all she was great.\nFrom there I met my hubby for a steam, the stream room is infused with what smelled like Vicks..lol\n It did wonders for my congestion! \n\nFrom there we went to the sauna, sweat some more. When I finally couldn't take the heat anymore we head off into the freezing falls outside, which revitalized my whole body, then into the hot tub!\nI hadn't felt so relaxed in months!\n\nThe air was crisp, the tubs were warm and the lighting was romantic. It wasn't to busy and the hubby and I had our own little spot in the tub.\n\nI would certainly recommend this place to anyone. If you can't get away, take a night after work do the thermal and melt the stress away:)
