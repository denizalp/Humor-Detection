The food is either very salty or bland. Their chicken dish was very dry. Kanpungi doesn't even taste like the real kanpungi chicken... Why not pay a visit to the nearest korean restaurant and order yourself a serving of kanpungi before calling your dish a \"kanpungi\" taco. In sum, I have not figured out what the hype is all about. I felt very gross after my meal. My mouth felt so dry... Not coming here again... Bleh...!!
