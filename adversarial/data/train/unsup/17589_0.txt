Awesome place with awesome people serving awesome coffee. Small storefront, but rounds out a good Oakland experience with the only thing the neighborhood was missing: great coffee. I could grab an americano before grabbing groceries at Merante's, or stop in for a cold brew fix after hitting Chick'n'Bubbly and before losing track of time at the Carnegie or Caliban's. Or, you know, I could just stop in because I'm in Oakland want some coffee.\n\nAlso, they serve their cold brew in glass bottles, which makes me feel hip as heck.
