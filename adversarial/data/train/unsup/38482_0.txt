We came here for lunch today and had the butter chicken mac and cheese and the buffalo wings. We finished eating and forgot to take pictures! Not to worry. We will take pictures the next time we are back. The food was delicious, the service was friendly and fast and the menu has something for everyone. P.S. You have to try the masala tea!
