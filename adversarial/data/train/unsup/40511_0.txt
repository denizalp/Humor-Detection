They started on such a high. Started with the Kale salad and a glass of Pinot Grigio which was excellent. Decided to split the Diavola pizza as we noticed everyone was ordering pizzas. It was so disappointing - overcooked to the point we were sawing it with the knife, flavour was lacking and it was dry. Other people's did look good so maybe we just got a bad one. I'd give the place another shot based on how we started out but would probably order pasta this time.
