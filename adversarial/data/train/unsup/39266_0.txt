I admit, this place can be hit-or-miss when it comes to dining, but I love it and so will you.  Open for lunch, grab a sandwich and soup, a choice of vegetarian entrees and coffee.  The Krishnas put on a Monday night meal, all you can eat for $5.  Very peaceful and cooperative, and spiritually and gastronomically healthy.
