Typical high volume sushi place in the downtown core of a land locked city that doesn't value good food.\n\nHAhaha and don't get me started on how bad they treated groupon users...~15 open tables and groupon people had to wait.\n\nIf you think the sushi here is truly 4 stars, you truly have never had decent sushi before. Or you just don't know what good sushi is. Whatevz, i don't judge.
