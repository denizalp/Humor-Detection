We were really looking forward to coming here since it opened. I had read about their burgers, but once we got there the ribs were calling me. I decided to get the ribs as an app and get the burger. I got the burger medium and it was perfectly cooked. I got it with the pimento cheese and bacon. The bun was extremely soft. The cheese was soft (obviously) and the meat was soft. It came out without bacon on it, which would have added the extra texture to break up the softness, but I was hungry and it wasn't worth mentioning it. Overall, it was delicious. My wife got the special which was a gumbo-like dirty rice. It had venison sausage in it that was a first for me. We are excited to go back to try other menu items.
