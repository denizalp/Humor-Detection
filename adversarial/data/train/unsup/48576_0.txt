Came here twice during my trip to Montreal. Once just for dessert and the other time for lunch. I must say the desserts here are phenomenal and are worth 4.5 stars. The lunch, however, was a bit disappointing.\n\nThe night we came for dessert I ordered a chocolate shake and my friend ordered a s'mores hot chocolate. We also ordered fondue to share. Everything was tasty and phenomenal. Service was great as well.\n\nWhen we came back the following day for lunch, it was definitely a lackluster experience. Although the sandwiches we ordered were not terrible, they weren't great either. The sandwiches we got were on \"waffles\" (made from pizza dough). I really think the \"waffles\" ruined it for me.\n\nI highly recommend you just come here for dessert.
