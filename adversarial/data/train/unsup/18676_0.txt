100% disappointment....I'll even go so far as to say it was a pretty horrifying experience.\n\nSince my boyfriend and I were coming to a friend's wedding in Vegas after two weeks in China and Japan, we decided to cheap out and stay at this Howard Johnson location. The Bellagio (where the wedding was held) wasn't really in the budget so we opted for the normally reliable HoJo. Usually perfect for a few night, no-frills stay, we didn't hesitate to book a room for Thursday through Sunday.  \n\nAfter walking through the vacant parking lot, we received the keys from reception and entered into a moldy mess with a bathroom floor caked with dirt and grime. After trying to stay in the room for a night, we decided to ask for a switch. \n\nThe next morning, they switched us to a seemingly cleaner room on the second level. Merely hours later, they issued the same room to someone else, so we woke from a jetlagged nap to a group of guys trying to get into the room.\n\nBy nightfall, the bathroom light stopped working and never went on again. At various points in our stay, the toilet would not flush and the sink faucet wouldn't turn on. \n\nOverall, just an atrocious experience. This was a little over a week ago and I just read a review someone posted today about the motel's plumbing issues. This is just ridiculous.\n\nI suppose you get what you pay for - but this place STILL isn't worth the inexpensive rate.
