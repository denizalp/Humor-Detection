Went there twice. The first time I was running late so instead of having Jina cutting my hair, I was reassigned to Andy. The cut was decent and easy to manage, but there were times when Andy's long hair somehow brushed against my face while he was shampooing my hair. I was a bit grossed out and would not want to let him work on my hair the next time.\n\nThe second time I was really looking forward to my appointment with Jina after seeing all the rave reviews here. But honestly, it was such a letdown. I do not understand where the hype came from. It was probably the worst cut I've ever got. it looked like a dog just chewed off my hair. Yes, it was that bad...... I brought a picture with me and she explained the result would look a bit different, but I did not expect the layers to be so out of whack. She sensed I was really unhappy so she curled my hair to make it look nicer. Well, guess what, I don't have the time to curl my hair every morning. Because she cut my top layer so short, either I chop off my hair to fix the layers, or I have to grow it out. :(  I should not have cheaped out. Will never go there again.
