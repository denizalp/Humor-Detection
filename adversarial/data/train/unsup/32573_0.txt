I came in for some filler work on my arm. Tami hooked me up with some freehand cloud like design thingy. She was great, I was pretty vague, I said I wanted some purple and blue filler around my traditional style eagle and traditional style heart. She brought my ambiguous vision to life and I love it. I got some work on my bicep done and need to go back to her to finish the filler. You can see the photos I added
