I've had a craving for a Liege http:\/\/forvo.com\/word\/li√®ge\/#fr waffle smothered in dark chocolate ganache since summer, when I visited last and found the shop closing early due to high heat = slow business.  Chocolade van Brugge is back to its normal closing time of 6 pm, so I was able to swing by after my afternoon massage at SWIHA.\n\nSo happy I stopped by, because the new fall\/autumn shipment from Belgium just arrived the day before!  I was able to sample the Sea Salt in dark chocolate, and it was satisfyingly delicious with a caramel crunch top layer.  (Dark chocolate is my favorite of the two choices, and no, white chocolate doesn't contain chocolate at all; It consists of sugar, cocoa butter, and milk solids.)  After eating an entire Liege waffle and its glorious dark chocolate goodness, with a delightful cup of Douwe Egberts coffee, https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/chocolade-van-brugge-scottsdale?select=lXUAfgYmNhsn5COINzhz0w I decided to look more deeply into the new autumn selections.  There were so many to choose from that it took me a LONG time to settle on just 12.  Btw, CvB now has new gift boxes, which showcase these lovely creations! https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/chocolade-van-brugge-scottsdale?select=nXwiawt4du6gWVLBAtRQEw  Don't know just how biodegradeable\/green the packaging is, but the chocolates present well in them.  One caveat to the new design is that you ONLY get 12 truffles for $25, whereas in the past, you could get an extra truffle, if the rep or owner was feeling generous.  ;)  However, if you ask nicely, you may sample a new (to you) selection, as well as get extra ganache on what's left of your waffle so that you may save face by NOT having to lick the plate clean!  Thank you Kind Chocolate Goddess for saving me from potential embarrassment!  (Though, sadly, I was the only one there from 5:15 pm until she closed shop at 5:55 pm.)  But I digress... my 12 selections were, clockwise from top left: https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/chocolade-van-brugge-scottsdale?select=GLzaqqC3vv52VkV0kCcT8w\n\nMokka, Meringue, Chili, Coconut, Almond liqueur, Tiramisu, Pumpkin, (Milk Gianduja), Koffee, Hazelnut creme, and (Milk Sea Salt).  \n\nI ordered all but two in dark chocolate.  For Mom, a milk chocolate lover, I only ordered two, because she normally shuns away from expensive chocolates in principle- her way of boycotting my senseless way of wasting money on higher-end organic\/non-GMO products, whether they are chocolates, produce, or clothing**- but she practically inhaled these two!  Will have to dedicate a higher percentage for Mommy Dearest with my next purchase.\n\nHave I mentioned that you may take frozen and vacuum-packed Liege waffles home for $3.50 each?  These were already available over the summer, and I remember, because I took one to enjoy at home, since the waffle burners at the shop were already turned off for the day when I had last visited.  It crisped up well in the toaster oven; I wouldn't try warming it in the microwave, as it may well end up a soggy mess, and that would be a very sad waste of a Liege waffle.\n\nNote: These delights can easily cost you a pretty penny, so be sure to check-in on Yelp to take advantage of that 20% off your entire purchase!  You're welcome.\n\n**I've won her over with organic fruits and facial beauty items, though-- SUCCESS!
