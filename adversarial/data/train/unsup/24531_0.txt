I used to live in Marina Del Rey, and at Marina Del Rey was one of my favorite restaurants called Killer Shrimp.  The patio had a great view of the Marina.  Anyways, now that I live in Vegas, I was super excited that this place opened up!\n\nBy no means should this be compared to Hot N Juicy or Boiling Crab.  It's a difference style of cooking.  \n\nIt's pretty much shrimp in a bowl of spicy goodness with a side of bread to dip.  I went with a spicy level of medium, and it ended up being really spicy!  Shell on shrimp is the best.  The Killer Shrimp bowls are generous portions.    \n\nThere's been so many businesses at this specific location of Town Square.  I really hope Killer Shrimp is here to stay.
