It's kitschy and that's what makes it fun! The food is decent, not mind blowing mind you but good!\nA bit pricey but the portions are big, hot and fresh! I had a gyro plate which came with two full Gyros and a good size portion of delicious crispy and hot Onion Rings!\nThe omelettes are huge as are the pancakes and deserts!\nThe Fireside Lounge is a must as it just screams old school Vegas! If your in Vegas and on that end of the Strip, definitely worth a stop in!
