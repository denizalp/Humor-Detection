First of all this is my Fianc√© and I's favorite place of all time and Rebecca one of the managers is seriously the best which compliments the food to a \"T\"!!! The food is absolutely amazing and their drinks aren't ones to over look! \n\nWe got out engagement party catered by Diego Pops due to loving their food and becoming regulars there. Rebecca was amazing at organizing and preparing all of our food for the party and let's just say that there wasn't ANY FOOD LEFT!!! Everyone loved the food and kept asking where it was from! Highly recommended for your next event!\n\nOur favorite items there are the:\nCoconut lemongrass ceviche \nCorn queso \nThe wings\nGrilled Shrimp tacos or shrimp bowl\nBraised green chili chicken tacos\nBraised pineapple pork\nThen all margaritas! The fresh one is amazing!\n\nIf you're looking for just a casual lunch out or a date night or your next event catered definitely give them a look!! \n\nThank you,\nTj
