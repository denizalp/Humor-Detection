In reviewing the other reviews this place seems incredibly inconsistent. I didn't look at the reviews before ordering. Frankly I wanted a pizza place that delivered late night and 2-liters as this being a desert and I'm from California I learned quickly on that I will be ordering two at a time, minimum. With that being said, I ordered the chicken barbecue pizza. It tasted pretty good. Wasn't a fan of the grilled onions I would have preferred red onions however the pizza had a good amount of cheese and as said, tasted good. Delievery was on time and it is Friday night right before 8:00 pm. Not wanting to cook over the weekend, this place suits me fine as the extra large pizza will be eaten all weekend.
