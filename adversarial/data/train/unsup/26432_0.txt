I stopped in to see Matthew Couper's Skins & Teeth exhibition and thoroughly enjoyed the work, and the space. I was very surprised to see some extraordinary glasswork by Judith Schaechter in the gallery as well. What began as a quick stop become some of my most memorable and pleasant moments in Las Vegas!
