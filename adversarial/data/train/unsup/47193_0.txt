When you depend on the appliance repair service the most, Appliance Doctor is a big let down. I had setup an appointment through Whirlpool service agent on Monday for Appliance Doctor to repair my refrigerator. I even called Appliance Doctor to confirm the appointment for Thursday. A broken refrigerator is one of the most painful appliance to have break down. So when Thursday came, no one showed up. I called and was told that they decided earlier in the week to cancel my appointment. No notice given at all. I can't believe a business can operate this way and can get away with it.
