We have three golden retrievers and walking into the vet is always chaotic. The lobby is always clean and quiet and the receptionists are accommodating, friendly and helpful. \n\nThey have a relatively small staff and everyone you encounter is very friendly and gentle with your fur babies. \n\nWe've been in twice (in the same week) for small emergencies, Dr. Roach has a great bedside manner and you can truly tell how honest and sincere he is when presenting the solution.\n\nDr. Roach and his staff go above and beyond what is expected for exceptional customer service.\n\nThanks for always helping us!
