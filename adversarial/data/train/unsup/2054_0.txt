Found this little place by accident. The customer service is outstanding. Phil was our server and he is awesome. Super helpful, friendly and patient. We ordered the shrimp, potatoes, corn and sausage. We tried the smoking cajun, lemon pepper and garlic flavors. The garlic was DELICIOUS. The lemon pepper was fantastic. The smoking cajun was good but not as tasty as the others. Everything was fresh and hot. We will definitely be coming back to try the alligator and the clams. Thanks guys for giving us a new palatable adventure.
