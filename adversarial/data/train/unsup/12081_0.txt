You really cannot disagree when someone gives Harry's high praise. If I've learned anything during my time on Yelp, it's that surprises await you around every corner and today, as I entered the divey, dated and colourfully decorated, (read: vintage sunshine girl calendars abound) doors of Harry's a burgerlicious surprise awaited me.\n\nAs I mentioned, it's a dive bar, but a dive bar with really good classic diner eats and strong coffee. What more could you want? I feel like 50 years ago business types would stop in for a pack of cigs, black coffee and a burger and it'd be served with a smile by a lady named Flo.\n\nNowadays, it's dark and seedy, and your burger is served by a hipster named Finn or Liam. But it still holds up.\n\nI did indeed partake in said black coffee but also was amazed by their burger list. I took the path less travelled and ordered a non-traditional but delicious sounding 'Green Burger' which is a chorizo patty infused with spinach served with a host of delicious cooked toppings. Just excellent... like but for real. \n\nI won't say much more, the poutine wasn't poutine but it didn't matter the burger was a rockstar\n\nEatcrest Out!\n\nCASH ONLY
