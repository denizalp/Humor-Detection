I started buying my flowers and plants at ecostems shortly after Joe opened about 4 years ago. He has always been helpful and informative especially to someone like me who often has a hard time keeping plants alive in my low light apartment. I have also used him for floral arrangement deliveries and I am always pleased with his work. I put trust in Joe's creative decisions because he's honest with me. \n\nMy advice is to take the good and bad reviews with a grain of salt. And take a chance on a business like ecostems. You might be pleasantly surprised.
