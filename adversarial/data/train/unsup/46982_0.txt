During a recent visit to Las Vegas, I was introduced to this yoga studio. It was a welcoming and tranquil environment to escape the hustle and bustle of life. The restorative class refreshed me and I will definitely return when I visit the Vegas area again. If you live in Vegas, seriously consider joining. The membership rates are reasonable.
