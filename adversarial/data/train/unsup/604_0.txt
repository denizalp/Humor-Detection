Worst pizza I've ever had... Waited over an hour and a half after being told 45 minutes twice. After that they delivered a pizza soaked in grease and cheap tasting pepperoni, I'd rather have a lunchable. On top of that they delivered it to my hotel room with a salad on the order and did not even put a fork or any napkins in the bag. I will go to the nearest gas station and buy the egg salad sandwich from 6 months ago before I eat here again.
