My husband and I love coming here. This is our favorite Chinese Restaurant. Service is very friendly and kind, and the food tastes great. So far, I have tried their orange chicken, sesame chicken, cashew chicken, and sweet and sour chicken, and their hot and sour soup, egg drop soup, and won ton soup. Always a memorable and good meal eating here for us.
