Dr Patel was very condescending to me and scoffed at any concern I had. I should be able to go to my primary care and expect some compassion and at least listen to my concerns why else would I come to the doctor? I was really hopeful based on a recommendation but I will never go back. I ended up setting up care with Coury Family Medical with Dr andrews and absolutely love her. I don't need to take up much of the doctors time I get that she probably has a lot of patients but I shouldn't be treated like I am an idiot for asking a couple questions.
