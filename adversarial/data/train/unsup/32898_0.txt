Pizza is alright, it's nothing special. I ordered a medium 8 slice sausage pizza. The sausage was put on sparingly along with the green pepper. I can't believe they charge $13 for that size. I would give it 3 stars but for the fact that I was visiting an apartment and the driver made it quite clear that they do not deliver to apartment doors and you have to meet them downstairs was a complete turnoff, yet I was still charged a delivery fee. Hence I didn't give him a tip. I highly doubt I'll return.
