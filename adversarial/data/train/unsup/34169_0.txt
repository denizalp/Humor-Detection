My fiance wanted a custom ring, and insisted we go to Robert's, despite living over 3 hours away. I was skeptical that it was worth the distance, but I could not have imagined a better result. They were very receptive to her ideas and drew up a number of great designs. They were helpful in taking apart a family ring to use some of the stones in the new engagement ring, and they were able to take some money off for the melt value of the older ring. My fiance absolutely loves her ring, as well as the custom wedding band. They are even making 3 necklaces with the remaining stones. I got a simple titanium band for me, and I'm pretty sure they gave it to me with little to no mark-up. An excellent experience, and a great product. Seems more economical than the cookie-cutter jewelry chains.  We got married three months after our engagement, and they were able to deliver the ring quicker than originally promised, impressive as it was already a tight time schedule.
