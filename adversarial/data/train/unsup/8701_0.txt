Best part of my vacation! I'm so surprised no one has written about it before. My husband and i went here for our anniversary on Monday Feb 14th 2011. Best.Time.of.our.life. We did the water circuit which consists of sitting in a steam room, quickly jumping into freezing cold water and then back into something hot, like a jacuzzi. We decided to do this all outside...while it snowed. A jacuzzi, while it snows, overlooking the city is the most amazing view ever. After the jacuzzi we decided to just lounge outside on the deck chairs. AMAZING. We stayed here for 3 hours. And the circuit was only 45 dollars each. Please visit this place, it will totally change your life.
