Why I feel the need to update my review on Bianco is beyond me, but after tonight I ended up more impressed and, even more satisfied with every visit.\n\nThis place is amazing, absolutely amazing... so humble yet so in tune with the kitchen and customers it would blow an entire 15 mile radius of chains out of business, if it hasn't already. \n\nI've looked over the reviews and the number one thing people seem to have an issue with is the wait time. \n\nAll I can say is, don't go here hungry or in a HURRY, and for god's sake go near CLOSING time if you really want to indulge here, who the hell really wants to wait 2+ hours for dinner at PRIME hour, I sure as hell don't!!! \n\nAnother issue I've noticed is that the staff is \"snotty, hipster or too cool for themselves\".\n\nNot true at all, c'mon now people...You can't take your \"I'M ENTITLED TO EVERYTHING AT THIS MINUTE\" attitude to a restaurant with one man in the kitchen, go to Chili's if your in such a hurry and save us all real foodies the headache and best produce :) \n\nKudos Bianco!
