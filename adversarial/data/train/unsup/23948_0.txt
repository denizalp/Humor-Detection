I am very displeased with this place. The food is just ok (nothing special at all) and the prices are ridiculous. The interior is outdated and the bathrooms are of very poor quality. The exterior is also outdated with cracking old paint. Yes this place is historic which I would usually love, that is if it's done right. I own a historic home and love it. I love going to historic places. But this place needs some updating like needed repairs of cracks\/broken items\/etc. The carpet is dirty. If they want to charge what they charge I expect the food to be amazing and atmosphere to have a little more effort. This place has really low effort - they just assume since they have been around forever they can get away with crappy service, food, and atmosphere. No thank you!\n\nThey also lack vegetarian options which is a huge downside for many people. Not one dinner item is so steer clear of someone on your party needs that. \n\nOur waitress was also snooty, which was annoying. She actually scoffed at me when I asked for a to go container at the end of our meal. I am a high paid attorney - you are a waitress. \n\nOur bill was over $300 for ok food, snooty service, and a place in need of some repair.\n\nAgain, I will not return.
