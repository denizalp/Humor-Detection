I'm usually so sketch about pan-asian-touring menus and, yikes, 12 dollar + entrees in a strip mall 'rant  but for lunch, this place was solid and pretty affordable. If you have indecisive pals, either leave them at home or bring them with the understanding that you're doing the ordering - the menu is gargantuan. \n\nThere's a little RuSan biting happening here what with all the orange and clubby hits pumping in the background, not to mention the insanely large menu, but they def aren't observing the cheap rule - so either come prepared or come for lunch, when everything is available in half-orders for 7 and up. Kind of odd that all the prices are base and you have to search for what your protein of choice will cost in addition - ah, there it is, up at the top of the section in small print, yeesh.\n\nThere are actually some Veg specialty rolls on the menu - omg - but they're 'spensive - Veg Tempura roll was 9 bucks and was more tempura than Veg (which, admittedly, was kinda awesome).\n\nThere's soba and udon to be had, noodle lovers! All traditional fish broth, so no soup for me.\n\nWe went with Sesame Tofu (because I'm kind of afraid of ordering curry here) and lordy lordy, it was perfect - all too sweet, coated and fried and oozing. A half order was a challenge to finish and I can't imagine feeling differently even at dinnertime - I'd love to see them permanently implement half\/full order options instead of lunch\/dinner pricing. Then, I could have my Japan and China both and leave a fat, happy American.
