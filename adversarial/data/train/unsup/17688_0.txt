The first time I came here was for dinner with friends last 2008. I was really intrigued by this place and was pleased with my initial experience. \n\n2009, was a bit different though, came here for lunch instead and they charged almost $10.00 more the regular buffet charge since it was Christmas Eve. I understand that they have to pay their employees more during the holidays but it doesn't mean they have to take it on their customers. In my point of view, they could have not charged more than the regular price and they probably would have had double their sales through the holidays. Let's give back to the community eh? Specially during the holidays. \n\nAnyway, I think even if I've become a fan the first time, the 2nd time around ruined it a bit for me...may not come back here next time...not ever!
