Although El Chorro advertises happy hour, I don't think they really want to offer one.  Things have changed.  \n\nHappy hour guests are now confined to one community table , which seats about 10, or the bar.  One cannot sit at the numerous tables on the patio, which the whole reason for coming here.  One can sit at the bar at any restaurant, so there is no reason to come here to do that.  \n\nWe decided to leave El Chorro and go to The Vig, which has an excellent happy hour.  We enjoyed it!
