I was at this location again yesterday and the staff still totally sucks.  This time, while I was bagging my own groceries, I asked the employee drinking Starbucks coffee and chatting with his co-worker at the next register if he could please authorize my wine purchase.  He gave me the stink eye and a totally sarcastic \"of COURSE!\" while rolling his eyes. \n\nSeriously, the only job this guy deserves is standing in the unemployment line.  I'm sure there are thousands of people who would appreciate having a job in this economy, and I wish Fresh and Easy would find one of them and replace this tool.
