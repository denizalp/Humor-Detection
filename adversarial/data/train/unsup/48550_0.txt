The restaurant is located in up and coming Griffintown, which is quickly becoming gentrified, a hospital is being built a few blocks over.  I made a reservation a few weeks in advance, which I would recommend, as it's a busy spot.  The menu is on a chalkboard so we had our server explain most of it to us.  We both had oysters to start and then the steak with red wine sauce, potatoes and greens.  The meal was simply delicious, I can't remember having a steak that good.  Service could have been better, but the food made up for it.  I would definitely go back.
