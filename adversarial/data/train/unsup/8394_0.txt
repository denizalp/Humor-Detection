The Barista was dressed\/styled so he reminded me of the Movie \"Grease\" because of the slick Hairstyle. Also gave me the feeling I went back in time like \"Back to the Future\" where Michael J Fox goes back to see his Parents in the 1950s. Not my scene, not my decade but those Movies did provide enjoyable entertainment although they were made in the 1980s. \n\nThe Cappuccino was served in what seems to be a Cup stolen from someones Grandmother. I felt so out of whack I wish I asked for either Tea or Americano so I can be in-sync to the general environment.  Apparently Grandma lost her Tea set because my Friend's Cappuccino Cup was different size and pattern than mine.  The TRUTH is I felt a bit awkward in here and wanted to dash out to the DeLorean.\n\nCappuccino was made the authentic Foamy non-Latte Art style.  Much like the Kensington locale, their Espresso shot is much too bold and deep for my preference.  It's A-OK but the vibe it felt so weird... I'm not sure if I should start doing the Bebop on the Roof or what?
