I was getting work done on my car and found this place and braved the 1\/2 mile walk and made it to Punchy's around 10:30 on Saturday 5.18 and the place was packed! But they were humming, getting food out of the kitchen non-stop.  I was a single and sat at the counter and read the paper. Service was good.  Fried bologna and home fries were both very good and the servings were generous.  \n\nWill definitely be back to try more of the menu!\n\nRecommended
