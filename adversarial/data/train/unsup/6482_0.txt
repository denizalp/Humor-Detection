I was so terribly sorry to visit this place that I decided to leave a review about it's pathetic customer service and unpalatable food.\n\nI have been here once before, and was disappointed with both the customer service and food quality. The server took forever to serve our order, and kept on messing with it. We ordered chicken and he brought something else, and so on for many other dishes. My friend was so disgusted that he left a big ZERO as the tip amount.\n\nBut for whatever reason, we decided to give it a second try, assuming that it was a bad day. But what are the odds that the same incidents happened during the second visit as well. Imagine what are the odds for that. The server was arrogant. The table was full, and there wasn't enough space to keep the incoming dishes on the table. So we requested him to keep them on the nearby table for the time being, since it was empty. He insisted that we keep it on our table only. I asked him to free up space on the table if he could, and he started to stack the dirty plates one upon the other on the table itself, not to collect them but to leave them there only. The food was so horrible that I had to leave my dinner unfinished. This time I left a ZERO dollars as the tip.\n\nI am never going back to this place again.
