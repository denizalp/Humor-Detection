I absolutely loved this class! My friends and I were in Vegas for the weekend, and decided to purchase the VIP package (includes 75 min class, complimentary cocktail & admission to Chippendales).\n\nOur instructor Koree was fun, friendly & encouraged everyone to unleash their inner stripper. She taught us a lap dance routine & a few pole dances and even took the time to contact everybody personally to give us some pointers.\n\nAt the end of the class, she had everyone strut their stuff and show off what they had learned. The environment was simply perfect; there was plenty of space for everyone to move comfortably, and everybody was just there to have fun.\n\nI highly recommend this class & I can't wait to go back to Vegas and take the class again
