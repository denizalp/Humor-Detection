If I could give this place half a star or zero stars then I would.  A few others commented on how disturbingly unfriendly and unsanitary this place is and I could not agree more!  The ONLY reason that brought me into this twilight zone of a place was a coupon.  The owner or lady who seemed to run the joint snatched it up and the \"specials\" menu and made sure to scare the living crap out of us.  The water tasted like something scooped out of the dirty dish sink.  Someone was smoking behind the bar.  There was NO ONE in the place except for us.  I don't know why we didn't run rather we asked to have our food to go and made up some excuse about getting an emergency call only to be told to go orders as NOT ALLOWED.  Uh okay.  Time to peace out and we did so.  Hysterically, the lady said \"was it something I said?\".    We took our business and appetite (what was left of it) over to the Grille in Brunswick (where we should have gone to in the first place but coupons make me happy) and we told the bartender about our terrifying experience.  He laughed at us in a Vincent Price like voice and said he's heard this before.  I still get the creeps just thinking about that experience.  You have been warned, people.
