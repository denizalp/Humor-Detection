Idiotically went to the Daniels Street location, thinking that it would be nice to fill up before we volunteered at Second Harvest. Turns out... it's the production plant and so they only sell 8 pints or 3 gallons at a time. \n\nWe walked away with 3 gallons of Oreo mint. Totally worth my significantly lighter wallet. I love the State Street location, and they were just as helpful and patient at the production plant. \n\nOops.
