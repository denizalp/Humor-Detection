This Marketplace portion of this Center, is great for sitting, hour after hour, in the water activity area, under the misters.\n\nIf its a shopping experience, you're after ....STAY AWAY.\n\nIts loaded with skinhead type Teenagers, that gather in herds.\nThey are always blocking the walkways.\nThey are visually disgusting.\nThey'll degrade any positive experience, you might have from your visit. \n\nAs I said earier, visit the water activity area ... when you have leisure time.\nAVOID this center, otherwise.
