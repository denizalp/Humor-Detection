After doing some thorough research about this place, I decided to give it a try. I'm impressed with how my nails turned out, however - the customer service is in definite need of an improvement. And this is SO important for a client based business, maintaining a professional yet friendly experience is what will attract customers to continue coming back. \n\nI won't lie, if something upsets or bothers me I will speak up about it especially when I am paying for my services. Margie was shaving my nail beds and holy, I kid you not she would NOT stop shaving the same spot. She shaved till it stung really bad & I politely told her to be a little more gentle in which she abruptly told me that's how it's suppose to feel. Lmao so you're telling me that it's suppose to hurt to get your nails done? Don't think so. \n\nSo I felt annoyed, and told her that it hurt. In which she responded, \"I know what I'm doing\" in a very rude tone. Okay, but do you know my pain threshold? I never questioned her professionalism, I simply told her to be more gentle because she was shaving off too much of my nail beds. \n\nI understand she's the owner and all, but I also don't think it's respectful to change the song or take calls in the middle of painting my nails. At least from my past experiences, the ladies either take calls after working on their current clients, or get someone who ISN'T with a client to respond to calls. \n\nEither way, I will admit that she is very precise in her work and made sure each nail was filed accordingly. She didn't make my nails super thick with gel as other places normally do, but until someone can prove that their customer service has changed, I don't see myself coming back here in the meantime.
