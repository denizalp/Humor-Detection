I have had an absolute nightmare trying to find a good nail salon, I have been botched so bad in the last few months and I have finally found a place where I feel confident! Loanne is excellent. My nails burn sooooooo bad every time and I am so scared and I sweat literally lol, but I have not felt a thing with her, I am so happy about it! Each nail is completely identical to every other - they are just perfect! I am definitely going back. I wanted to wait a few days before I leave a review because in a few days you can really see the quality of the nail and so far they are just the same as when I walked out. Thanks guys!!! XO
