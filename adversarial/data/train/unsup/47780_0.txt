Liverpool House serves some terrific food.  Definitely the best fois gras I've had in Montreal.  Beware though, it is a large size for 2 people, probably best for 4 as it is so rich and heavy.   Wine list was terrific.  I have the rabbit korma which seemed a bit off the wall for a restaurant like Liverpool, but it was quite delicious.  I've had my fair share of Indian food and I thought it had some very intense and authentic Indian flavors.  And the rabbit was extremely well prepared and tender.  I haven't been to Joe Beef yet, but this was really really good.\n\nI docked a start for two reasons.  The first is really minor, and not really a complaint at all, but the menu was in French and had to be translated by our server.  I don't mind because I'm a visitor in their town and restaurant, but it was very busy and the server didn't really have the time to properly translate.  This limited my confidence in ordering a few dishes that I just wasn't sure about from her brief description.  The second issue was unfortunate as the seating is cramped and we were sat next to a really, really drunk and really loud group of people.  Our server was apologetic, but it ruined the experience to some degree.  Perhaps not their fault, but I'm reviewing my experience.  \n\nWould certainly go back, although we'll probably try Joe Beef next time for a different experience.  Liverpool is definitely worth the trip.
