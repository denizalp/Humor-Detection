Omg. there's a bug on my clam chowder soup! I had a to go of New England Clam Chowder earlier. Gonna eat it tomorrow for breakfast but I decided to eat some tonight. (Preggy cravings) As I was enjoying my soup, I noticed that there were legs and wings of a bug not sure if it's a bee or a fly :( and it looks like it is cooked along with the potato as it was so attached to it. I really love their soups but this time i'll stop going there now. Hopefully, it won't harm my baby :(
