If you wear glasses without lenses, plaid shirts and have ever used the sentence \"you've probably never heard of it\"...this is your mecca.  Hipster douchbags rejoice, you have found your holy land!  If you just want a beer...a normal beer...don't even walk by this place or you will be intoxicated simply by the air of uptight pretense wafting out.  \n\nI'm not saying the beer is bad, some of their crafts are actually quite nice...but the crowd and staff aren't worth it.  It's like being stuck at Fraser Crane's wine tastings.
