As soon as I entered into the lobby area, I knew Windmill Family Dental was for me.  They did not disappoint.  Monica greeted me with a warm smile, professionalism, kindness, wit and humor. Magaly is a photo monster!  I never knew photos of one's mouth could be taken from so many different angles.  Lol. Dr. Jackson was so nice, professional and very thorough during my oral exam. The details and dedication she provided reinforced the fact I made the right decision choosing Windmill Family Dental.   Lexus was my hygienist and did an excellent job. She was very engaging, precise and determined to make my mouth happy. Mission accomplished, Lexus! I left feeling like a million dollars after my cleaning. More importantly, I left feeling like family, which is exactly the way I felt at my prior dentist before relocating.  Thank you, Windmill Family Dental for the wonderful experience and for helping to make the Las Vegas area feel a bit more like home for me.  See you again soon!
