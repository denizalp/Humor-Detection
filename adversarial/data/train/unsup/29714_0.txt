The Rogue had two eras, as far as I'm concerned: The Couch Days and Now.\n\nThe Couch Days were great. We'd drink cheap beers, listen to rock music and eventually get so tanked we'd have to lean on one another while sinking into the couches and laughing our heads off.\n\nNow the couches are gone, and the crowd skews a little bit younger. But they're fun and looking for a good time. I don't think I ever have left Shake, the Saturday dance party at Rogu,e without plans for an afterparty or makeout session.\n\nAs others have said, be sure to park in the neighborhood, because the parking lot is microscopic.
