Came here last night for the first time and had a great experience at TopGolf. From the second you walk in the door the staff was really friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable in helping you figure out how to get situated.\n\nThe facilities are incredible, and the bar on the main level is large which makes for a nice sports bar environment. They've also got billiards tables, Xbox Kinect, and Fooseball to make sure that even the kids are entertained when not hitting golf balls.\n\nHaving three floors of hitting bays is awesome, and I definitely recommend getting on the top floor. Being able to look out over the field and seeing the targets is really cool. This is definitely no \"driving range\", people that would consider themselves moderate to very good golfers should not need anything close to a driver when hitting balls here (okay, maybe the ladies but definitely not the guys). The experience is more about target shooting and racking up points in their pre-programmed games, not hacking balls as far as you possibly can.\n\nI'll for sure be back at TopGolf, the entertainment value is high for everyone even if you're not into playing the links or taking swings at a regular range.
