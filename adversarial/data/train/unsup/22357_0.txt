My first night and first time in my life ever in Vegas. This place definitely was a night to remember for my palate. This steakhouse is located lakefront of the Bellagio and it was super gorgeous inside from what I could see.\n I couldn't help but to notice it was one of those restaurants where the lights are so dim, you can't read the menu and everyone is literally whispering around the table.\n\n Our server was very helpful and brought out a wine list. I ordered a delicious bottle of cab! \nI took a look at the menu and lamb chops were crying out for me! So I had to!\nHANDS DOWN. The best lamb chop I've had. MELT IN YOUR MOUTH GOODNESS! \n \nI couldn't pass up on deserts! CRACKLING KEY LIME PIE. Mmmm.. it was so fun to eat! Every bite crackled in your mouth because of the pop rock candy they sprinkled on the top. The key lime pie tart level was JUST RIGHT.  Such a wonderful medley! \n\nI can't wait to come back! I had a great experience. I just hope they would have the lights on a little brighter. The place reminds me of a dark cave. :(
