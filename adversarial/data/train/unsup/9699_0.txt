What a delicious addition to Biltmore Fashion Park! I'm so happy Blanco opened their doors in this space at the outdoor mall. Not only is their sitdown service perfect after a day of shopping or for a night out, but they also have a walk-up window that's perfect for a quick lunchtime meal. \n\nDuring a recent visit, I enjoyed a lovely meal complete with a skinny margarita, housemade guacamole and a combination of three different street tacos. The meal was fabulous and the service was spot on. While we sat in the restaurant I noticed the bar and decided that I will be coming back soon to enjoy a casual drink and snack. I will also be back soon to order lunch of tacos or salad from the walk-up window. Sam Fox has done it again!
