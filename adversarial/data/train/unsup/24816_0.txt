Being an Akron Zip, Swensons is pretty much in my blood. Park near or far and watch them haul a$$ to your car! They'll hand you a huge menu but here's what you need to know: The Galley Boy burger will\nChange your life, the sauces on it set it apart from the rest. Also, try the potato teasers they are like the beautiful big sister to French fries or jalape√±o poppers. Eat in your car and turn back on your lights and the workers will run back out and grab your trash. You might want to go home immediately after because I always fall asleep within 15 minutes of devouring my galley boy.
