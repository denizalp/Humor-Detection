My wife and I went to your dealership on Thursday 6\/30\/16 in search of a certified pre owned vehicle. We looked at a few vehicles and chose a 2015 Malibu LT. The car was in fair condition overall, but had a severe brake pulsation\/vibration and A LOT of very noticeable defects (scratches\/chips\/dings) in the paint. We were informed that the vehicle was a rental car, so naturally there would be some things that needed repaired. We agreed to purchase the vehicle as long as the dealer agreed to address those issues.\n\nAfter a very unnecessarily long waiting time (I have purchased MANY vehicles from dealers over the years), the salesman comes back and says that they can't do our paperwork until the next day (Friday 7\/1\/16). We really wanted to take the car home that day, but were informed that there was no possible way to do so.\n\nDisappointed, my wife and I agreed to return to the dealer Saturday 7\/2\/16 to finish the paperwork and pick the vehicle up. I was told I would receive a call Friday morning confirming everything. I did not receive a call, so I called and asked for the salesman we dealt with (Bob). I was informed Bob is on vacation, and did not submit any paperwork that was required to the finance manager in order to get everything ready to go. I was also informed that the vehicle was in the shop being repaired, and that it would be ready for Saturday at 1:00pm.\n\nDisappointed again, my wife and I waited another day to pick up the vehicle. I left work midday Saturday to pick the vehicle up, and on the way to the dealership, I received a call that they were waiting on parts to arrive for the brakes and for the side trim piece that was dented, and since it was 4th of July weekend, the vehicle would not be ready until Tuesday 7\/5\/16.\n\nDisappointed again, my wife and I had no choice but to wait longer to pick up the vehicle. I then asked to speak with a manager, and was assured all issues would be taken care of. I received a call on 7\/5\/16, indicating my vehicle would be ready for pickup by 4:30-5:00pm. I told the second salesman that called me that we would come in at 5:30 to finish everything up, to make sure everything is done and nothing is rushed (I am in the service industry and know all about \"rush jobs\").\n\nMy wife and I took yet another chunk of time out of our lives to come to the dealership at 5:30. The second salesman started to finish my paperwork, but I requested to see the vehicle before signing any paperwork. I was then informed that the vehicle was STILL not completed.\n\nAfter waiting over an hour, the vehicle was then sent down to the sales department, and I went out to look at it before signing paperwork. The brakes were done and some of the scratches were buffed out, but none of the paint chips or dings were taken care of. In addition to that, there was a huge gash taken out of the right side skirt that WAS NOT there when we initially looked at the vehicle on 6\/30\/16. I immediately asked for a manager and brought these issues to her attention. After apologizing and speaking to the service department, it was confirmed that the gash on the right side skirt was definitely caused by one of their technicians.\n\nALSO, one of the more infuriating things out of the whole situation, aside from the lack of accountability, respect, and communication, they kept stating \"oh well it's a used car so what do you want\". I understand it is not a brand new vehicle and there may be a scratch here and there, HOWEVER, the problems with this vehicle are considered beyond normal wear and tear, and the dealership agreed to repair them before selling the vehicle to me. \n\nAll in all, my wife and I are completely dissatisfied with our experience, and would not recommend this dealership.
