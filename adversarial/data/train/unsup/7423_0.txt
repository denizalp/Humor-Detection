Still the best shopping center in Las Vegas by far, those interested in high end clothing will find almost anything they can want at The Forum Shops under a single roof.  From shopping at John Varvatos or Georgio Armani to dining at Border Grill or Spago there is no lack of places to spend money at The Forum Shops, and unlike within the Casino you'll at least walk away with something good for your hard earned dollars.
