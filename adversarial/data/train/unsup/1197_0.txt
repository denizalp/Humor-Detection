Well, I wanted to try these, but the line was always around the block with soccer moms with strollers and kids, so I didn't.  I pulled in the other day just 'cause there was no line, and I was passing by.  I ordered the Red Velvet cupcake for me and my amigo.  It came to $7.02 for the two.  But, it was the most moist and delicious cupcake I have had.  I wanted to buy enough for the next month, and just chow down for them and try to look like Jabba the Hut!  I didn't.  It was expensive.  But, MAN OH MAN, that was one DELICIOUS cupcake!
