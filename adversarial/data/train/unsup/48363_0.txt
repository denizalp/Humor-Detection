I decided to switch dentists since our current practice doesn't have a pediatric dentist on site. My kids get their teeth cleaned every 6 months. Six months after their last cleaning, I bring my kids here to find out that my kids had 4 cavities each, and interestingly enough, both my kids had cavities in the same teeth. The dentist didn't look at my kids teeth at all - she came up with this diagnosis from x-rays that were taken. Since my son wasn't enjoying the fluoride treatment he was receiving, the dentist immediately said he should be sedated when having his cavities filled. Since there has only been one cavity between my two kids during both their lifetimes, I thought I should get a second opinion. The second dentist found absolutely NO cavities in either kid's mouth. BEWARE of a place like this who preys on kids to make a quick buck. Not to mention, the staff wasn't very compassionate with the kids and I thought they lacked in their bedside manner. Canyon Modern is their adult practice next door, and you'll find several reviews (esp. in the hidden reviews on this site) where they prescribed dental work that wasn't needed.
