What a fun restaurant offering great Mexican food in a casual atmosphere, and at Great prices. This is not a trendy chain restaurant, but a local favorite.This is the home of the 99cent Margherita.   They have good chips and homemade salsa. Their food is fresh and well prepared. They offer a full bar in this fun and friendly restaurant. The decor is interesting and fun...we have enjoyed this place for many years.
