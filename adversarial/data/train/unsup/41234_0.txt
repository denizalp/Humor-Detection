Panago has a great idea: Come or call in and order your pizza fresh, don't wait around 2 minutes for a slice to be heated up at Pizza Pizza et al. when you can come here and order an entire personal pizza fresh and only wait 6 minutes. \n\nThis place runs like a well-oiled machine too, they are fast and everything is spotless.
