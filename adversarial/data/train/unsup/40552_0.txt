Extremely professional! Michelle responded to my email by next business day and was very thorough and polite all with her responses to the questions I had. It is a bit pricey but it was well worth it. Cameron and his team showed up on time and hustled! They were very quick and efficient with moving our 2 bedroom apartment, disassembling and reassembling 2 bed sets our tv mount, couch etc. They finished in about an hour (they moved us from one apartment to the next) we saw no damages and were very impressed by their service. Hopefully we don't have to move again for awhile because let's face it moving sucks, but they at least made it suck much much less. Thanks guys!
