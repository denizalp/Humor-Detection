Went for lunch late on a Wednesday afternoon. The place was just about empty so we sat right away and were highly attended to.\nThe atmosphere is incredible; love the design of the place. Complete with a dj booth, elevated dance floor, tables with their own taps (you pay by the oz), and tvs everywhere. The music is constantly playing (and is country obviously). \nThe menu is great as well, something for everyone. I had the fried pickle burger which was fantastic! Even the fries were especially good: crispy and seasoned just how I like em. They also have a pretty expansive beer menu. \nGreat place for families with children during the day\/afternoon, however, I'm not sure about later at night. The place looks like it could get pretty crazy! For those looking for good night life, this would probably be a good time! They were voted best night life in the area and best country bar. I would definitely go back!\n\nUpdate:: Went back the next day for dinner and it was every bit of amazing as it was for lunch. Try Dierks Lemonade, one of their signature cocktails... So good! Also, the BBQ pulled chicken sandwich is delicious as well. It seems you can't go wrong here!
