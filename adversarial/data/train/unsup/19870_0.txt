I'm gonna help this place out a touch having read all the reviews and just dined here myself (literally just put down my utensils). \n\nI've got an early flight out and let me tell ya folks, the options in T1 domestic aren't in abundance. I felt I deserved better than Tim Hortons and wasn't in the mood for fast food at A&W. I saw Twist by Roger Mooking and was pumped. \n\nI was seated quickly at a high top table towards the back and soon after offered beverages. Coffee and orange juice please and thank you! \n\nIt's definitely a chefs menu, basic dishes merged and kicked up with gourmet elements so they're memorable (and they can charge a premium). I ordered the sunny side which comes with 2 eggs, roasted tomato something something and a turkey sausage. You can add a steak for $5, which I did (obvi). \n\nFood came and it was exactly as described and as ordered. The turkey sausage was plump and maybe a touch greasy for my liking for still good. Great toast and eggs... We're eggs. But for me what put this over the A-OK (3 star) mark was the surprising steak. \n\nI seldom have high hopes for breakfast steak. Ever. I've come to expect rawhide leather with a dash of pink to let you know it might have actually been alive at one point. Not at Twist. The perfectly seasoned, and perfectly cooked (to med rare) was small in diameter but a nice thick cut. The result was an easy to cut and chew juicy price of meat that essentially brought the entire experience up in my books. \n\nThe reviews in their dinner menu do worry me but from what I've experienced here personally, I'll Twist again... Like I did this summer ;) (get it). \n\nEatcrest out!
