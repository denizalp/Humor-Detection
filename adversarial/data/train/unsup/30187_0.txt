Went here with my cousin during my trip to Toronto. We came here around lunch time on a weekday, so we were seated immediately and had the option to choose our seats as well. Service was amazing--our waitress was extremely patient and helpful with the menu. The place overall has a really nice aesthetic as well--located on Toronto Island, with beautiful seats and a very homey vibe. \n\nNow, what makes me give it 3 stars is the food. Yes the service and environment is important, but the food is what MAKES the restaurant. We both ordered fish and chips just to keep things light and were greatly disappointed. The. fish. was. so. dry. OMG. I have never had anything so dry it was as if I had consumed the Sahara or something. The chips were also just basic fries--nothing special there. For the price, I was definitely expecting more. We skipped on dessert just because we didn't want to risk it. However, we did get a sangria which was quite nice. \n\nOverall, nice vibe, cute place, terrible food. I really hope they work on the food because this place as a lot of potential.
