As far as Vegas clubs go, this place is one of the better ones. If you HATE the Vegas club experience you're not going to find much different here, but at least it will be tolerable.\n\nWhy do I say this? Well as a dude I am privileged to consistently experience horrendous treatments at clubs everywhere, Vegas clubs especially. The women really got us by the balls don't they fellas? We have to pay $30 to stand in a sweaty, crowded space and get pushed around by assholes with earpieces. Sounds like a fun night to me.\n\nBut I will give this place some props because I could have gotten my ass kicked ten times over the night I went recently, but the bouncers were chill enough to spare me that experience. What did I do to warrant such a potential beating?\n- I'm pretty sure I stole some drinks from a girl who then complained to the bouncer. I think it was on accident ...\n- When I was asked to clear some space for a walkway on the balcony I refused to move and actually held a clenched fist up to the guy (I didn't realize he was a bouncer)\n- My lady and I somehow wandered into the \"Employees Only\" area and were walking around there for about 5 minutes.\n\nSo thank you Tao for not having your meatheads beat me savagely. I hate clubbing, but if I have to club, I prefer Tao.
