There is always a first one for everything, I never thought it would ever be for fro-yo.  This place is really nice, however, the flavors are not great.  I tasted the snickerdoodle and the pumpkin pie.  The flavors were so off.  I didn't want to taste any others because the only person there seem to frown upon once I wanted to taste the second one, so I chose to go for flavors I have had at other places.  I got a little bit of cake batter, cheesecake and white chocolate macadamia nut.  Well, my; first bite was of the macadamia nut one, and it was horrible, tasted of rancid nut.  So I decided to avoid that corner of the cup, then I went for the cheesecake, it was so tart and not in a pleasant way, so I thought, well how bad can cake batter be, well I ended up throwing the cup in the trash can, if I am going to get the calories I might as well enjoy them, that is my new mantra. OHMMMMMM.
