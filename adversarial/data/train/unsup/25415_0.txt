Location\/Service\nInside Market Village entrance facing Steeles Ave. This restaurant is closing down near the end of December since the mall is being demolished. \nVery plain decor, brings back the typical HK 90s style. Service wise was okay, expected from a fast paced Chinese restaurant. If you be more chill and laid back, the waitresses are pretty cool to talk with. The owner is also very nice. \n\nFood\nFamous for the tofu and soybean, ordered a combo meal (~$6), which had soybean milk, fried tofu curds with fish meat and stir fried rice noodles with bean sprouts. The dishes itself were okay and smaller in a portion size. But for the price it's pretty decent. I really like the soybean milk, which is very smooth. \n\nI will miss this place as I've been eating here since I was a child. If you have time and would like to grab a quick lunch\/meal, this is your to go place.
