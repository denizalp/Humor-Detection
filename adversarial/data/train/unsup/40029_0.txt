A newer Popeye's chicken location so a cleaner store is a given. Service is surprisingly quick during lunch hours and friendly for a fast food. I always think to myself that I should rate fast foods before I eat it, because by the time I'm done, I feel so gross with myself. Popeye's has been a thing for me ever since high school. They don't have Toonie Tuesdays, but they used to have Cajun rice which is now no longer on the menu hence only 3 stars. If you aren't into feeling so gross with yourself order the chicken nuggets. The chicken is nice and plumped for nuggets, and doesn't taste as over processed like McDonalds. Opt for sweet chilli heat sauce, you wont regret it (: I don't recommend the corn, its really 'soggy' and not fresh tasting at all.
