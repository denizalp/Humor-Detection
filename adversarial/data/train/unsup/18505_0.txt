Maybe I'm easily impressed, but after 20+ years and 15+ visits to Vegas, I'm still impressed by the pyramid hotel\/casino with the huge, hollow interior.\n\nNothing else about this place really stands out. But, FFS, it's a giant pyramid made of glass and steel in the middle of the Mojave Desert. What else do you want? Dancing T-Rex's inside?
