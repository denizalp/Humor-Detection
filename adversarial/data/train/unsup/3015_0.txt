Wow.  I was in an accident at the park. Ended up having a bimalleor fracture (both my tibia and fibula snapped) After surgery, 6 pins and a plate. My surgeon said I won't be able to walk for 8 weeks and then 8-12 weeks of therapy to even walk correctly. When i called to let them know my situation and stop payment or credit later.. they said \"there's Nothing they can do\" shows how much they care for their members. My yoga studio was so accommodating and said don't worry about. Well at least I know which membership I will be renewing and which I won't . And the place I will be telling everyone not to get a membership from for the lack of compassion. Gym isn't great anyways. The least they can do is work with people.
