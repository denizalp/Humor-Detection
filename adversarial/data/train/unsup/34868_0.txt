Our first time here.  We wanted to share something so we went with the very garliky Caesar salad and the garbage bin nachos. Both were delicious and perfect to share 3 ways and even had some left. I'm not usually one for \"melty\" cheese sauce on nachos but this sauce was delicious!  The combo of the sweet bbq beef brisket with the cheese and fresh jalape√±os was perfect. We didn't eat any burgers but the people next to us did and they looked delicious, one even had Mac n cheese in it. I would recommend visiting while in Vegas
