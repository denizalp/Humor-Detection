I went here to buy a board game. I found one from the shelf and went to pay. The tag said $54.95 but when she rang it up, it came to be $59.95 + tax. I asked if it was $54.95 as marked, then she said \"it's because of the tax\". Please don't try to trick me into thinking that $54.95 + tax is the same as $59.95 + tax... Then she called some other guy over to ask about the tag. He said they will honor the tag since it was their mistake - then the girl made a snarky comment to him saying \"why do we even have to?\", which he responded \"we SHOULD\".\n\nIf it wasn't for the professionalism of the guy, I would've left without buying the game. I would come here to play, not to buy a game.
