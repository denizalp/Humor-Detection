This place is super awesome, if you like this kinda stuff! Its wall to wall stuffed with Southwest\/New Mexican\/Mexican inspired stuff. And when i say stuff, i actually mean just that - stuff! It is impossible to describe what exactly they sell as they seems to sell it all - furniture, mirrors, antiques, chairs, benches, pictures, ceramics, garden things, house decorations, wall plates, vases, trays, etc, etc, etc list goes on and on. \n\nIts super fun to stroll through the isles there awed eye, looking around trying to find something you have not seen yet. And for the most part, do find that weird something you are hunting for. \n\nI totally dig this place, and have purchased a few odds and ends from them and plan on hitting it back, every now and again, as their inventory always changes and unique things float in sometimes. \n\nI titally can not find a bad thing about this place as their service is always good, prices are fair and more often then not they even have 25%-50% off sales. One can not beat that. \n\n\"I like\"\n\"Very nice\"
