The good: Great prices on everything from roasted soy paper snacks, Hi-Chew candy (my personal fav), to sashimi quality salmon\/tuna slabs. Plus right next to a couple good eateries like Lee's Korean BBQ.\n\nThe bad: Barely anyone here speaks understandable English. You have to kinda know what you're looking for, and where it is (or at least willing to search on your own) before coming here. \n\nThe ugly: Some of the things here make my stomach squirmish. Severed fish heads staring back at you (almost) make me turn vegetarian. Haha. Place is overall clean, but people begging for money out front combined with communication problems, kinda turns away coming back as much as I would like to..
