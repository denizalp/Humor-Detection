Great place.  Don't judge it by being in a strip mall, this place is great.  Had the Carnitas tacos and the Chicken tacos and both were fantastic!  Can't wait to go back and try many other items in the menu.  Especially the drink menu.  Not a lot of seating so be smart what time you come and have low expectations in seating.  Which again is a testament to the great food!
