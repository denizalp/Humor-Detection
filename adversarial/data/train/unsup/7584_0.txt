Ok I get that tapas are small plates but when you are paying $17-20 for a small (and by that I mean borderline minuscule) portion you should at least be impressed. We weren't impressed by much at Lago. \n\nThe hostess was confused about when our table might be ready, which pretty much set the tone for our experience. We were seated at an oversized table (two of us) in a really loud restaurant so we had to sit on the same side so we could hear each other. Unfortunately this seating wasn't conducive to a great view of the fountains which mah have been a nice distraction to the busy, disorganized circus environment in the restaurant.  Ok, it had only been open a week so I can kind of forgive the organizational kinks the I'm sure will be ironed out.\n\nWe ordered bruschetta (ok but nothing special), langostina (one tiny one for $17), lamb chops (super fatty), filet mignon (just alright), cannelloni with short rib filling (our favorite of the meal but again ultra small) and 7 and 7 a gnocchi and lobster knuckles (pretty tasty), 2 desserts (very good) and a couple drinks each. Bill was about $200 and we were still kind of hungry when we left.\n\nWe won't be back to Lago and wouldn't recommend it very highly.
