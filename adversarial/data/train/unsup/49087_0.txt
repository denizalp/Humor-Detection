I bought a groupon so my son & I went on Monday night. We were apprehensive as the place was empty except at the bar, we heard a game being played & asked the waitress what was going on & she told us Monday nights is Trivia night at the bar everyone seemed to really be enjoying the game! She also told us of all the daily specials, which are a lot so if you go look into specials offered! We started out with the fresh tomato & mozzarella, my son ordered the Italian Chimichanga, and I ordered the lasagna EVERYTHING was so fresh & delicious, there was a wait but that's understandable, it's NOT a fast food so go with time to enjoy the food, relaxed atmosphere & the company you are in! We will definitely be back & will take family & friends, it's truly a hidden gem! I hope this establishment makes it because everything was great!
