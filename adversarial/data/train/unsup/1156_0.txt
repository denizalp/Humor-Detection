Mixed feelings about this place- selection is decent enough, DVD pricing is low enough to make this competitive with online ordering (especially since there's no shipping charge), but the service could be more attentive.\n\nI like how the DVD selection is just straight alphabetized instead of pre-sorted by genre, making it easier to just stop in, look for what you want, and go rather than going to multiple sections to check. I'm not a video game fan but that area seemed to be overpriced.
