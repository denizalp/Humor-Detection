Wagon Wheel is a throwback to the small town diner you remember from growing up. Take a step back in time and enjoy the hole in the wall that the locals visit regularly. \n\nJust know what to expect. It isn't a big chain restaurant, the building is old, the menu never changes, and they only take cash.\n\nBut as long as you aren't expecting some fancy Scottsdale place you will love it. The only time I hear other customers complain are people that don't appreciate what Wagon Wheel is. \n\nWe come every weekend for breakfast, and the waitresses know our names, and our orders. \n\nSo take a trip up Cave Creek Rd, and give it a try. I wish more places like this have survived the decades.
