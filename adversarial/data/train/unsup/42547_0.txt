This was my second visit. The first time was decent, but after a second time I doubt I'll be back. The vibe and venue are great (usually quite busy). The service is good - we had a really sweet waitress especially the second time - but its just not enough with all the options in this city.  \n\nThe food was a big disappointment, especially after an unacceptable wait. The seafood pasta was basically dry noodles with a few overcooked mussels and shrimp on it. The calamari was crunchy. \n\nGo for some drinks and enjoy the vibe, but skip the dinner.
