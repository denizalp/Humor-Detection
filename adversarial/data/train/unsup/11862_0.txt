Horrible service.. I got kicked out because I was too fit...they told me I was intimidating but in reality they just judged me. If they are going to stick with not judging people they should treat ALL costumers as equals. I also was confronted for doing too much weight...the only way to get stronger and build muscle is to do more weight. Planet fitness, more like planet prejudice. I strongly recommend that if you want a REAL workout, DO NOT sign with them.
