First time in this location, got in line for el pastor an a Brazilian guy was serving ( he was covering for the taco man) , then went to the carne asada lane and a Mexican guy was there, walk to the salad lane and an American guy (I believed) was working the salads it was United Nations in one place they were nice  but when I got to the register , the girl was on the phone and had me waiting there the whole conversation without telling me to hold on or acknowledged I was there , after she just rang me up I ask some questions and her answers were very blunt like she wasn't there, at the salsa bar I Looked for plastic containers for my to go order and ask the girl in the salsa bar and she said she didn't know that she was new, so I go back to the register and ask the cashier (I thought she was) where do I put the salsa and she said is there and I said no covers? And then she said oh take this ones and hand me to go plastic containers but I guess she forgot to put them in the bag., I'm assuming.  When I was leaving I noticed that she moved to the bar area so I'm assuming she was the bartender, I did wait to get her attention while she was on the phone so of course by the time I got home my food was cold, I live super close and still I had to reheat all the food , the guacamole was already brownish ( I did noticed it was a bit brown when the taquero was serving me) so that was my fault for not telling him to give me new one, the al pastor Mula was extremely greasy, I literally have stomach pain, it was really bad, never coming back,  for the taqueros super nice but the food and the service at the register killed it completely, hoping owners look at this and take action and either train them better and show them the meaning of customer service and urgency.
