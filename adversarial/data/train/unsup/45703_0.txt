I came in around 1am on a weeknight.  The selection was decent.  I got a glazed raised and a chocolate bar.  They were soft and fluffy enough (especially the chocolate bar, which was delish), but I'd like to come back when they first open and see how the fresh ones taste.\n\nFor my initial experience, I can't complain.  Four stars from me.
