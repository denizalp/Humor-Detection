I found THE Hotel to be less technologically modern than other hotels on the strip, but it was a comfortable stay overall. The rooms were clean and I didn't have the same issue of hearing other people's noise, as some reviews mentioned. Beds were soft and comfy. The size of the rooms and bathrooms were really good compared to other hotels. There is one small bathroom when you walk in, then a good sized living room with a desk, couch, chair, tv and table. The bedroom had plenty of space and the main bathroom had 2 sinks, a shower, bathtub, and enclosed toilet. I wasn't there long so I didn't use the shower but my friends said the water kept switching from hot to cold. When we requested extra towels they were brought up within 10 minutes. \n\nTHE Hotel is connected to Mandalay Bay so you share the casino and all of their pool facilities. There is a somewhat lengthy walk to get to the pools. I wanted to float in the lazy river but couldn't bring myself to spend $22 on a floating tube. The wave pool dispenses one small wave every 90 seconds. So, not too exciting. There is a topless pool for adults and Daylight Beach club. The good thing is if you're going to LIGHT nightclub, the entrance is so close to THE Hotel! In conclusion, as I sometimes say, there was nothing inherently wrong with this hotel but nothing special to make me choose it over others on the strip.
