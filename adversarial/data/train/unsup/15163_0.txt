Charlotte's party of the year! The event was great. With tons of great food and drinks and donations going to a great cause, you can't beat it. All of the vendors and staff were wonderful. For such a huge event to go so smoothly is amazing. It was awesome seeing everyone in Gatsby attire. The theme added a fun twist to this years event and event had some performances. Had a really great time at the event.
