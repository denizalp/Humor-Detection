This place is insane. The atmosphere, the food, the service! Are all off the charts great. \nI went there for the ribeye but got there after they shut the dinner menu down. I had to settle for the New York strip. But lo and behold when all the food came out there was my ribeye steak cooked to perfection. I guess my begging the waitress paid off. I also got a shrimp cocktail was holy hell huge good. And only 12 bucks. And I can't forget the lettuce wedge that was the best I've ever had.  I would come back to Wisconsin just to go to this place. I did not eat the fries or the giant onion ring. But I gave it to the people that were with me and they said they were amazing. One of my new favorite places on the planet. By the way this all took place after 12 AM on a Friday night. Incredible
