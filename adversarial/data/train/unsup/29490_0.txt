OMG I laughed. So hard. I love this place. I love comedy. What a great time.\n\nCover is $15. Its worth it. There were 3 acts (two opening, one main) as well as the host. My face hurt from laughing so much, cant recall the last time that happened. Borderline hysteria. I feel like laughing just writing this review :).\n\nI like the seating. Go early to get good seats (i.e. 1\/2 hour before showtime) as its first come, first served. Having said that the layout allows just about everyone to have a good view. Its a little more roomy than second city.\n\nThe food and drink is very reasonably priced. I noticed online they have meal\/show specials, which overall are a great deal. I might take advantage of that in the future.
