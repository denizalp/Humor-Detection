Ichiza is located in the same plaza as Miann, Tea Station and Crown Bakery, on the 2nd floor. \n\nMy husband and I decided to come a few Saturday nights ago. We came in around 10:15 pm and were just waiting for at least 5 minutes before we finally were acknowledged by an employee. \n\nWhen we were seated, we were given menus and ended up ordering:\n\nOctopus & Cucumber, $4.95 prior to tax- Liked the cold, sliced chewy pieces of octopus. This was refreshing with the sliced cucumber pieces. \n\nDaikon Salad, $4.50 prior to tax- Great size for the price, loved the daikon and thought this was refreshing as well. The salad dressing was good but I thought the plum sauce added was too salty. Good think there was only a small amount of it. \n\nIka- Yaki (Grilled Whole Squid) $6.75 prior to tax- Tasty, great chew and a good amount for the price. But a little on the salty side. \n\nMixed Veggie Tempra Bowl, $6.95 prior to tax- Although this is a vegetable tempora bowl, please note that seafood is added. But I believe you can order to have that omitted. This is a great size to share with another and can easily feed 2-3 people. I liked the flavors of the tempora and rice. \n\nIchiza's Ramen Noodles, $8.50 prior to tax- My husband decided to order this. I was disappointed that this was rather bland. The broth didn't have much flavor and would not recommend ordering this. \n-----------------------------------\n(Total= $34.26 after tax, prior to tip)\n*Please note that there is a $10 minimum for credit card transactions.\n\nService was lacking significantly. A table that was seated after us (party of 3) had their order taken before us. I had to remind an employee a few times that I wanted 2 plates so that my husband and I could share our food. We also needed 2 bowls for the ramen and bowl that we ordered. We also asked for some sriracha sauce for the ramen, which took a while to get to our table. \n\nWith the 3 servers working during our visit, we only had our water glass refilled once (it would have been nice for it to be refilled at least one more time during our late dinner experience). The place wasn't even full. \n\nWhen I asked for a to go box for my leftovers, it never came. I just ended up getting it myself because I didn't know if anyone was ever going to bring it to the table. \n\nAlthough most of the food that we ordered was good, it was annoying and disappointed that the service failed. I don't appreciate being ignored during my dining experience and so I won't be back here. \n\nThe only reason why we came here was because it was highly recommended by a Lyft driver that gave us a ride to the strip from our hotel (off the strip) and also the highly rated reviews (overall 4 stars with over 1400 reviews). Maybe we came on an off night, but I am not willing to give Ichiza another chance.
