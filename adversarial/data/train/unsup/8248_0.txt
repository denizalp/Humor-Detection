Three stars because the pizza can be good, but the manager and staff need customer service training.  I wrote the manager and said this location needs training on how to treat people and stated low class customer service makes good food taste bad. I noticed there is a canned reply if the comment is not positive.  I like the concept and the consistency of the food, but I want staff to be trained and high expectations set when working with the public, otherwise get a back office job. Good customer service is a great foundation for future jobs for the young people working in these places. Management should be proud to contribute to the future success of their staff with proper training today. I am not mad, just disappointed about something that is so easy to fix.
