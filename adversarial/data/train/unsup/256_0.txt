Ok. I said I was going to try everything here. I did not. After pursuing the available offerings, both visual and referencing the menu options, I made a list of my thoughts.\n\nHatte's Chicken - A resounding yes!\nLarado's - Pho'rench sandwich, ditto!\nPol Pok Wings  - Fusionistic Asian? Nah.\nDistrict Donuts  - NOA great!\nTekka Bar - Delicious hand rolls!\nand...\nGhost Monkey - A tequila and mescal bar. While I sans cocktails, Black Truffle Nachos are insane.\n\nBlock 16 is more than a food court. So bring more money, because it ain't cheap!
