I went for lunch so regretfully had to pass on the beer selection.  They have a huge crowd for lunch so be prepared for not a  quick lunch.  We had two apps: homemade chips with blue cheese and the redneck eggrole. ....both were fantastic!  Those redneck  eggrole were an ingenious way to serve collard greens!  I had the garlic parm wings which were ok.  The burger looked great though and another friend had grilled salmon salad which she confirmed was really good.  I will definitely be back.
