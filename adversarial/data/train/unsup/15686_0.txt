Champagne Brunch. Unlimited mimosas with Brunch, need I say more? Food was good, service could be better, but the unlimited drinks is definitely appealing. Although this is a fairly pricy buffet, for Vegas it is a good deal, and there are some healthier options. The meat was also of better quality than I would have expected, and they had fancy macaroons for desert.
