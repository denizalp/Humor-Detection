This review is for Adult Night the 1st Friday of the month.  Cash Bar! No tiny humans!  Free admission!\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like kids..but it is nice to check out the Science Center without the children who are learning the social norms of museum attendance and navigating interactive displays.  That being said, if you have kids, you should check this place out too!\n\nI have been a few times and they rotate some of the displays.  Some displays were not in operation (so hopefully they get those fixed regularly).  I would recommend 2-3 hours to see all the exhibits. If pressed for time, my favorites are that mechanics\/physics room and the forces of nature.
