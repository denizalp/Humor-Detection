3.5\n\nThe first time we came here the service was soooooooooooooo slow and the server was a bit awkward,.. We ordered a bunch of things and nothing stood out and the sashimi was not that fresh..\n\nFast forward to my most recent visit... The service improved tremendously! Food came out at a good pace and the same server was on her A game.. I tried the uni trio which was $15 and well worth it! Comes with uni sashimi, uni potsticker and uni hand roll... The uni was fresh and I thought it was super creative to put it in potsticker form..\n\nMy only gripe with this place would be that prices seem to be reasonable but the portions are pretty small.. My boyfriend ordered the Galbi bowl on our most recent visit and he could definitely not get full on that alone!\n\nBut I will be back for the uni trio!!! YUMMMM
