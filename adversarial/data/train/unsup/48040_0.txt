I was Excited to try this place and it didn't disappoint! Lot of locals, a lot of character, home style traditional Italian comfort food, leave your Gucci and Michael Kors at home instead bring your favorite easy jeans and a loose fitting shirt because you won't want to stop eating, between the delicious garlic bread, complimentary red, white or both house wine, and large entree plates plus complimentary cappuccino or dessert if you left any room! They also have an old man walking around playing Italian accordion music. When in Vegas don't miss this place ! Did I mention the garlic bread ? Mamma mia molto bene! Grazie mille Battista's!
