Update, after in room:\n\nAmenities, and the Good:\nDouble-suite with full kitchen.\nKing-size bed and dining room and sleeper sofa.\nJacuzzi tub, separate shower, separate double-sinks, hair dryer, laundry basket, iron\/ironing board, in-suite safe.\nWashing machine and dryer and detergent also provided. Swanky.\nGreat setup, fresh, pretty paint, granite. LOTS of room.\n\nThe Bad:\nWalked in, room smells bad. Like either poop or stinky feet, and no one had taken off their shoes yet.\n\nBedroom lamp didn't work. I even flipped the wall switch, which didn't help. Kinda dark in the bedroom due to this - I prefer lots of light to read in bed, but some people may not mind. Reading in bed doesn't make me have insomnia. Phone has no dial tone to call to ask about the lamp. Everything seems properly plugged in. \n\nI do not think we were given enough towel sets, so will have to ask for more. No daily towel service.\n\nWe traded a lot more timeshare points (like, more than 3x more) for this double-suite than they are currently charging more recent-reserving guests. Boo. \n\nUpgrading to 3 stars. Great place, but not a great start.\n\n---------------- original below:\n\nSo far,so bad!\nWe haven't even gotten into the room yet. No parking near our assigned building. Dad and son went for a cart for our luggage since it's a long walk from where we had to park, and they are short of carts and don't know when one will be available. This is a resort? I may update if we are at all stoked with anything, but they are starting off with a really bad impression for a swanky sort of place (the vibe they are trying to exude).
