It's true that Five Guys serves up a good burger and their fries have a nice flavor, but for me, it doesn't really stand out from the rest of the average fast food burger chains out there. Being in the mall and coined as a \"fast food\" spot, I have been disappointed with their service twice now. The first time, we waited over 20 minutes for our burgers and fries, but I thought it might just be a fluke. Sadly though, last night the same thing happened again. I was surprised that the wait was was so long for such simple food and also since this is a fast food place. The staff was also very rude when we asked about our food after waiting so long. The wait resulted in us being late for the movie. I won't be eager to visit 5 Guys again, unless I have a lot of time. Then again, if I have a lot of time, I won't choose a \"fast food\" spot and instead go to a sit down restaurant. I hope they fix their service and turnaround time.
