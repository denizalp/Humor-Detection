Horrible service. All the wait staff looked liked they were walking in circles. They'd be waiting tables then be behind the bar mixing their own tables's drink. I know nothing about running a restaurant but this was the most inefficient place I have ever been in. Margarita tasted as though they forgot the tequila and after an hour our food still never came so we gave up, paid for the tasteless margaritas and left...never to come back
