The majority of the staff here have no idea what they are talking about. I have asked for several simple items, like plastguage, an oil pump primer shaft, ect, and all I got were blank stares.\n\nI special ordered starter bolts from another store, and the girl at the counter had no idea where they were when they arrived.\n\nUnless you are mexican, avoid this place, there is a reason it has the nickname Vatozone, they don't offer much help if you actually speak english!
