This place is bait n switch unless you know what crooks you are working with and know how to handle them . Of course I'll share my experience and give you some tips !\n\nSome customers literally took 30-45 minutes at the counter while the clerks here tried to up sell every thing possible, gps, gas, insurance, car seat to people who obviously have no kids . Time is money! Efficiency is key! 2 sayings that have never been uttered in this building obviously.\n\nPeople you know they will ask you for your drivers license and credit card... Have it ready before you are next in line . Also have your confirmation number pulled up on your phone or on your print out ready to go... Come on!\n\nWhen I heard those golden words \"Next customer\" I felt like I hit the lotto. I passed the confirmation number to the clerk which was pulled up on my phone, and handed her my license and credit card. The next thing she said was do you was basic or premium coverage. Wait... What did u just ask me? What kinda question was that? Did you really just try to pull a fast one on me? Is that what they teach you during your training !!? Is that how you tricked those poor young girls into speaking with you for 45 minutes, holding up the line that was already going out the door?? I snapped back at her I don't want any coverage, no extras, I'll get my own gas, nothing additional!! My contract was printed immediately and I was out within 1-2 minutes. I think I set a record that day for being the fastest one out of the rental counter.\n\nComplaints about taking 2 shuttles you say... If you look at the location, you can see they are obviously located further away than most rental agencies..\n\nYes I'm herra asian so I will be back here to save my $40, but don't get tricked into any up charges and don't let these folks waste your time either. Come prepared !
