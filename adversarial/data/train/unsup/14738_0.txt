I Showed Up 5 Minutes Late For My Appointment Because Of Traffic And They Turned Me Away Because I Was Late. They Weren't Very Nice About It Either. The Women Looked At Me And Told Me Sorry Your Late And We Don't Accept That Here. So Either Make A New Appointment Or You Can Come Tomorrow Ok And Turned Away. As Good Reviews I've Heard From Here I'm Pretty Upset With The Experience I Just Had! \nIf There Was A No Star Button I Would  Press!
