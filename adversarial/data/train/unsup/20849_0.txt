I have such a wonderful friend that lives in Las Vegas, knowing that I was traveling alone (not uncommon for me), she brought me some food from Bachi Burger.  Although I don't mind eating alone in a restaurant, it's always more fun eating with a friend.\n\nI had the Kalbi Burger, which consists of: Ground Beef, Pork, Soy, Garlic, Ginger, Chili Paste, Green Onions, Ciabatta Bun, Kim Chee and Ko Chu Jang Mayo.  Got all that?  If you're from Hawaii, you probably didn't even bat an eye when I mentioned all those things because you knew exactly what I'm talking about.  But if you're not used to Korean food, you're probably scribbling frantically to go and Google the words you don't know, right?  OK, so go Google and come back.  I'll wait for you here.  *pause*\n\nNow that you know what all the ingredients are, here's my review.  Oh wait, let me give you my disclaimer first.  I'm not a huge burger fan.  Your occasional Mickey Dee's or grilled poolside burgers are great.  But I'm not a burger seeker outer.  With that said, this burger was magically delicious!  Not in the Lucky Charms kind of way but in the it's-so-non-typical-it's-almost-like-eating-a-plate-lunch-with-bread-instead-of-rice kind of way.  (Plate lunch:  A mixture of different food items, laid out on one plate and usually includes rice, macaroni salad - did you know that Hawaii has the highest per capita of people that have diabetes?  Now you know why.  We eat starch with our starch and then put more starch on top)  Where was I?  Oh yeah, it's like a mini plate lunch but in sandwich format.  The beef was delicious, the sauce was good and the sweet potato fries gave it a nice compliment.  All I needed to go with it was a Korean bar lady saying, \"Buy me drinky?\" and I would've had the full experience.  \n\nIf you're open to trying new types of burgers, this is the place to get one from.  ^_^
