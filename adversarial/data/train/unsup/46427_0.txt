I love love LOVE this cafe \nIt's at a lovely location near desert breeze park,  next to Koma Sushi. \n\nThe interior\/decor is is really unique and adorable. Great place to grab a refreshing drink and chat with friends. The peach tea is my favorite drink as of now til I try the other things on their menu and they have a broad selection!\n\nFriendly staff and they also add a cute little toy to your order and the drinks are served in cute glasses~\nAnd they have the cutest stamp cards to boot!
