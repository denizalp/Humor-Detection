Food is very mediocre, nothing to drive home about. The vegetables were lousy, clay pot was lousy, steamed fish was decent, shrimp was dull, and service was typical of a Chinese restaurant and the guy who took our order didn't speak Chinese which is always welcoming at a Chinese restaurant right? \n\nAfter 8 dishes, the bill came out to $160 and we had about 6 people and asked if they included gratuity and they lied and said no so we paid 15% tip on top of gratuity. My mom was curious about how it came out so expensive so we took a menu and did the math and turns out they did add gratuity so that's great as well. \n\nSteer clear friends. \n\nMy family told me not to be surprised since Chinese restaurants are notorious for cheating their customers. Always check your bill before paying!
