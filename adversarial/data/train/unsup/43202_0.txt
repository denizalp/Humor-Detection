I live in Chicago. I've visited Rome. I don't dream about places like I do Il Bosco. I'm not a chit-chatty person, but I always find myself wanting to talk to the owner. Everyone that works here makes the experience impeccable. You really can't go wrong with any pizza here, my favorite is probably the Carmela. Also, if you ask the owner he'll make this salsa cheese dip (pictured in my photos. Please go out of your way and ask, he makes it and is never annoyed with the request. This is hands down the best place in all of Phoenix\/Scottsdale for pizza and I feel strongly about that statement.
