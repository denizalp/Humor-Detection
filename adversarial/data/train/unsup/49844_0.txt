I called this office a few months back. I spoke to the receptionist and asked if I could speak to the vet before I booked my initial appointment. My dog has some preexisting health concerns and I wasn't sure if the vet was specialized in this area. The receptionist was rude, but took my information anyway so that the vet could call me back. The vet never did call me back. I was disappointed with this. And they lost a potential client.
