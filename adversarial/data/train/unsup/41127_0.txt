Found this place while walking around the Venetian. This is a very fancy place. Great vibe, really nice couches. The music is REALLY good--old school R&B (Isley Brothers). The waitresses were extremely nice and attentive. I know it's a cocktail bar, but I opted for the beers. I will definitely be returning.
