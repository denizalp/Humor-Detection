I'm definitely going here again. The cucumber water was refreshing as a start. However, the strawberry lemonade could have had a little bit of sugar. My friend's spaghetti and \"meatball\" had a little kick to it, which brings out a burst of flavor. However, the \"meatball\" aka eggplant was a little dry. I had the spinach and artichoke flatbread and it was really good. I kind of wish the spinach was less dry. As a side for my flatbread, the waitress recommended, fingerling potatoes and it was phenomenal!! I savored every bite. Last, but not least the Ice Cream Sandwich. Overall, it was delicious but I wished that the cookie was warm and soft to melt the ice cream, so that the dessert melts in my mouth. If they can make these change, it would have been a perfect meal! I'll be looking forward trying other things on the menu next time I come here!
