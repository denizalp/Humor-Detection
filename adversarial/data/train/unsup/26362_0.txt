This is the new location of TYS from 2 College St. While I will miss the huge space and ballroom-vibe of their old studio, this one is very close and convenient too (2 mins. from the subway station). \n\nAs Michael M. mentioned, the space is a lot smaller. There is a larger and a smaller studio, but even the larger one is not that big. I did not experience the overcrowding he mentioned, but I also went in December (before the new year's crowds...). \n\nThe studio offers a similar schedule as the old one, with a good variety of classes and teachers. I especially appreciate the detailed cues and interesting sequences from Sue R. She somehow knows just the right alignment instructions to give at the right time to make familiar poses feel totally different (and more challenging... how is it that when you really focus on the right alignment, even the 'basic' poses become really hard?! :P). In general, I appreciate that is studio keeps it simple. Not a lot of bells and whistles. Just good solid, room-temperature, ashtanga\/vinyasa-based classes. TYS has been around as one of the first yoga studios in the city, with a well-established teacher training program, and it shows. \n\nThe change room is a little cramped, but not a big issue. I like the feature of lockers for your valuables. Props are showing a little wear and tear. It's not a fancy\/spa-like experience like YYoga or 889, but it is a welcoming and unpretentious place to come practice.
