Recently every time I go, the service is really slow. Even when its not that crowded, not sure why. \n\nAlso it is kind of disappointing to only get the burger with no sides (you have to pay extra to get any kind of side).\n\nBut the food is still consistently good. Their guacamole is unusually spicy which isn't great, so I don't recommend that but they have amazing burger - both vegan and their meat options are very good (according to my meat-eating companions) \n\nVery casual atmosphere, usually has kid's shows playing on the big tvs.
