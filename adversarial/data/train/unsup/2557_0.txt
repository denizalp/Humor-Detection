Waffles, donuts and cupcakes with Bats, Dinosaurs and Bears too! OH MY!!!  \nJust based on the food alone, I give Friday Night@ the ROM a SOLID 4 stars!!   It doesn't stop at sweets though as there were sandwiches by Fidel Gastros (hubby approved)  and baked potatoes with all the fixins.  Don't even get me started on the wicked waffles (smothered in fruit whipped cream and caramel) and decadent Ferraro Rocher'ed donuts!\n\nThere are enough ROM bucks (the currency you use to buy food & drink) booths scattered about so I didn't have problems queuing for tickets and the line-ups for the food\/drinks moved fast enough.  Cocktails were rather watered down though so it's best to stick with beer (good selection of local craft beers served on the second floor) or spirits straight-up.   \n\n The crowd who attended was a pretty good looking if not well behaved and mature group, save for the odd old pervert \"(F)art enthusiasts\" trying to get some upskirt action.  All-in-all though it was really enjoyable as there was so little, if none of the usual douchebaggery, and assholiness associated with clubbing, *cough* cough* I'm looking at you King West, Yorkville and entertainment districts.\n\nThe dress code, that I could tell was for the most part downtown dressy\/casual \nI overdid it, maybe, in a leppy dress & tall boots, but I have a huge wardrobe that I need to put on rotation,  and oh yes make sure you wear something with an elastic\/flexible waistband as you'll want to have space for all the yummy noshings ;)\n\n The music was meh, and there wasn't much dancing save for hubby and me \"Vogueing\" in the Tanenbaum's China Gallery.  The night we went we had DJs \"Tigerblood\"  and Simon Jain on the decks and the Tech-House tunes were barely winning at best, but people for the most part looked like they enjoyed themselves amongst the cultural artifacts and epicurean delights anyway, and that's what matters most.\n\nTip, If you get stuck with extra Rom bucks, no worries, you can pawn off your odd tickets to other revellers ( what great way to segue into a conversation with that handsome somebody *wink*) or save them for future events as the tickets issued Oct 12 expire on November the 30th.\n\nBig-Up to my man Bobby N for posting this event!   A top-drawer night out and definitely worth repeat visits!
