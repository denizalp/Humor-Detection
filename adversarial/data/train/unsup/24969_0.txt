We all had a doughnut craving so we headed to Fractured Prune, which is extremely close to my house. I had heard rave reviews about the place. At work, I heard people talking about how amazing it was to create your own doughnuts. I also went on yelp, and again encountered highly positive feedback.\n\nWhen I went to the store, it was totally empty. It was a ghost town. There were only 2 employees- one behind the counter and one sitting and eating doughnuts with a date (?) Anyways, the employee behind the counter explained the idea behind the place and we got to ordering. He took quite a while to make the doughnuts, and watching him make them was sort of painful to be honest. Didn't seem like he quite knew what he was doing. \n\nWe ordered a dozen doughnuts- one cherry, one orange, two lemonades, three salt caramels, and the rest plain glazed. The doughnuts were fresh and warm, and also pretty to look at. But that's about it.\n\nWhen I finally bit into a doughnut, I realized a GLARING problem. The texture of the doughnut was all wrong. It was the texture of those packaged powdered doughnuts you get at Walmart. There's a reason I don't buy those. The only flavors I found edible were sea salt caramel and honey glazed. The fruit glazes were strong and artificial tasting, which is inedible in my case. Why eat a doughnut that doesn't even taste good? \n\nTo be honest, I don't understand the hype about this place. The concept is good, but the doughnuts are terrible. I feel like the only reason people like this place is the fact that you can put bacon bits on your doughnuts. And I don't even eat bacon. So there's really nothing here for me.\n\nThe worst part about this experience is that I STILL have a doughnut craving that has not been satisfied at the slightest. I guess I'll be driving over to Bosa doughnuts later today for some cheap, delicious, fresh doughnuts.
