Absolutely amazing service. I called the company at 10:30am on a Saturday asking if they had a used pool table within my price range and they happen to have one that was the right color felt and style of table I was looking for in immaculate condition at a great price. I also asked if they could do it same day and they had it set up within 4 hours working around my schedule, not theirs. The owner came out personally and setup the table himself. It's perfect and I would and will recommend this company to anyone interested in billiards. Thank you for your great service prestige! The name fits
