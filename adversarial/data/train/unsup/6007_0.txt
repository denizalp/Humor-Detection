I've had nothing but First Class treatment and service at Mayo Clinic Family on Thunderbird.  My old doctor has moved on to Australia, but the staff is great as is my new doctor.  \n\nExcept, for their poorly thought out scheduling system which sets up appointments without your input.  Sorry, I'm still venting this one!\n\nI'm still giving them 5 Stars!
