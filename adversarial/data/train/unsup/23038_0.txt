it's scottsdale, what did i expect. this newest \"it\" bar is just that...it's certainly popular. especially if you like threadbare designer t-shirts, fitted ball caps, perfectly \"messy\" hair, and big boobs. \n\ni have to give props to the decor....really like the wall art and the floral\/dia dos los mucho gusto tengo hombre meuertes (or something like that) theme. and if it's eye candy you want, come here. not an ugly person in the whole joint. \n\nwe were however, seated immediately, even at happy hour, but had to wait 10 minutes to get value on our living social coupon. i liked my margarita, but as a lightweight, i usually get buzzed after one, but i never felt that old familiar feeling. my lady on the other hand got the skinny margarita and it was mucho flaco on the tequila. good thing i was driving. \n\nwhen we were finally able to order, i got the mushroom street tacos and the ceviche dish. i have to say, my food was good. small, but good. we probably would've done better price wise to eat and drink on happy hour, but no matter. my lady had the salad....big disappointment. first off, they ran out of shrimp....shrimp? there's a Fry's less than 2 miles away. second, it was just lettuce (ehem, mixed greens), about 2 small handfulls, with a few corn kernels and 3 pieces of plantain....for 9 bucks! thank goodness for no shrimp...then it would've cost 12! you know at oreganos, you can get a salad for 9 bucks that could be eaten for 2 meals! el hefe's salad was more like an appetizer. and our waitress, bless her heart. absolutely gorgeous but didn't know how to pronounce ceviche.\n\nbut what i just can't get over is the music....unbelievably loud. so loud in fact, i can just move my lips and pretend to talk and you would laugh and agree and nod your head because really, you'd have no idea what i was saying anyway. so it's not really a place for eating....more for clubbing. \n\noverall, i liked my food, not impressed with my lady's food, and would go back, but i'm too old for that loud stuff...i like to actually listen to my gal talk. and i don't own any ed hardy\/cool fight gear\/designer jeans\/fancy shoes.
