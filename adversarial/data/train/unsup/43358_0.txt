Awesome Service and Excellent Value! I needed my car to pass emissions, and I am so glad that I went to Pete Kelley's Automotive. They fixed my car and even took it through emissions for me. My car was not an easy case either, but they figured it out and got it fixed for a great price! And, they made time for me and all my questions. They really do care about you and your car, and they go above and beyond the call of duty. I highly recommend Pete Kelley's Automotive for all of your car repair and maintenance needs. Thank you Pete Kelley's  and James for all your help and excellent customer service. So happy you're in the neighborhood. You're making it a better place! If I could give you more stars, I would!
