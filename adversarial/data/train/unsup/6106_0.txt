Decided to give this place another try and my\nsecond time here was definitely better than the first. And I gotta owe it all to the dude that worked there that day. Like damn boi. He was so welcoming and nice. There didn't seem to be an ounce of rudeness in him. Unfortunately, didn't catch his name BUT YOU ROCK DUDEE YOU ROCK!!!! \n\nI went here during the happy hour thing, and it seems like the menu has slightly changed. This time I got the:\n\n1. Avocado Crabmeat Rice\n- which was pretty good\n- I absolutely love avocado with rice so this was an instant like for me\n\n2. Sea Salt Edamame\n- hated this\n- i thought it was just salt sprinkled on to the edamame, but there was also like some kind of sauce and sesame seeds on it and yeah, doesn't taste good altogether \n- i personally think they should've kept it simple by just adding salt to the edamame \n\n3. Iced Rose Calpis\n- was smart this time and got this\n- pretty good\n- not too sweet; slight rose taste \n- rose is not too overpowering which is nice \n\nWell yeah that's it. Honestly I don't know why they took away certain items (like the takoyaki balls) and replaced it with mediocre ones, but oh well. But anyways, I actually only wanted to update my review because of the dude that worked there so MATE ANOTHER \"YOU ROCK\" TO YOU!!! NICE WAY TO END OFF THE YEAR EH AND GIRLS WORKING THERE YOU BETTER STEP UP YO GAME
