I really wanted to like this place, living in desert ridge doesn't leave you with to many Chinese take out options. Pricing seemed very fair, and the menu has a great selection. Delivery took an hour which is understandable, my house was built in 2012 and doesn't show up on google maps yet.\n\n-General Tso's chicken was disappointing. \n-they forgot our chow mien!\n-Kung pao beef was fantastic!\n-chicken egg rolls were good. (but I ordered spring rolls)\n\nSorry for the 2 stars China Jade, but you guys still owe me some chow mein... How dare you!
