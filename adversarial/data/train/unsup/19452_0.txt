Oh man, this show is a strip show...a really really bad, trashy, over-the-top cheesy strip show.   My first trip to Vegas someone told me this was a \"family friendly musical, like Broadway\" so went.  Thank goodness we were 22-year-olds, and didn't have any kids with us!  The girls wear lingerie, talk in exaggerated sexy porno voices and say things like \"My name is Cinnamon, but the seamen who explore my dark caves just call me Sin.\"  Yeah, don't bring your children to this.   The first time it was mildly amusing in the way that James Bond's one line sexual innuendos are amusing, but for some reason that is unclear to me, I've now seen this stupid show 3 times (and it has not changed at all since 2008).   In addition to the pole-dancing and sexual innuendo, there are two \"musical numbers\" that last 30 seconds each and have some of the worst dancing since that Pussycat Doll Audition show, and some explosions and fireballs that are the coolest part of the show.  The crowds are insane (god only knows WHY) and so you are pressed up against other people, getting sweaty and smoky.  Just don't!
