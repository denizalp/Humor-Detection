I just stayed at the Venetian this weekend and here are the pros and cons\n\nPRO:  Close to the major hotels.  Walking distance to Mirage, Treasure Island, Wynn and Arias. \n\nHotel itself is alot of fun with the Grand Canal shoppes, the amazing Bouchon restaurant and other top notch restaurants.  You also have access to the Palazzo.  The shops there are awesome!!  TAO is a hot club.\n\nIf you are into AZN girls, there are tons of them here!\n\nCons:\n\nVenetian is pricey.  We did use priceline which helped.\nThe hotel rooms are varied.  We booked three rooms, my room has sink noise, the doors doesnt close properly in the restroom and the toilet doesnt flush right.  \n\nIt is clean, the bed is soft and the TV is flat screen.\n\nOverall, Its a fun and exciting place to stay!  However, the price doesnt justify it.
