Soul Food gone Gourmet!!!\n\nWalking by Mert's on my way to the Epicenter, then on my way out of the Epicenter I decided to eat here and am very glad I did!  It was a hot day and I asked for a lot of water - She brought me TWO!!!  I drank almost three!  They were real busy and I sat at a table with two ladies I had never met before (very cool and bold for the waitress to do instead of making me wait)! Though the place was packed the service was \"Faster than a Speeding Ticket\" and great!  Everyone was very friendly and seemed to be happy to be there!\n\nHere is what I had for lunch today:  Corn Bread like CAKE with butter!  Jerk Seasoned Chopped Pork Barbecue with their \"Secret Sauce\".  Macaroni and Cheese (the Baked kind) and Collard Greens garnished with Onions, Tomatoes, and Bacon.  All made \"with Love\"  It was all Incredible!!!\n\nFor Dessert I had Fried Chicken!!!
