Working here was one of the reasons I was \"festively plump\" during high school.  Although I worked at the Glendale location before (a loooong time ago), this one is equally as bad.\n\nMy family used to be enticed by anything with \"buffet\" in the name.  Oh geez, the stories we have about this place are endless and none of which fall under appropriate topics for dinner conversation.\n\nThe food isn't that great, as it's hard to ensure quality when you make food in such large quantities.  Plus, the eating habits of some of the clientle will make you worry.  I fail to see the point of eating a salad drowning in ranch.  \n\nTwo stars for their dessert selection.  Hot, piping bread pudding a la mode was my guilty pleasure..just don't eat too much.
