Dropped by Wanda's Belgian Waffles on a Freezing -20 C winter evening...\n\nGreeted by this nice gentleman... who treated us like VIP since we are the only patrons.\n\nBasic Waffles with Vanilla Ice cream tasted A-OK. Yes the texture is more dense and can be heavy. But it was perfect to be shared with a friend as a light after dinner snack.\n\nI really can't stand the plastic containers they serve their waffles... if we are eating in.. can it be on a plate???\n\nGreat hours though, they close at 2 AM on weekends!!!
