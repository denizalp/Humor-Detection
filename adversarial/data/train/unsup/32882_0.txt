My girlfriend and I ate here recently and we really enjoyed everything !! The restaurant itself is stylish and up to date .. Our waitress was just adorable she was very helpful and very nice !! She was a cute little blonde, maybe early twenties ...  I think her name was Robin ... The menu had so many good options so I asked her what she recommends... She suggested the Sin city Burger which was a great option and she also suggested the cocktail walk of shame which made me giggle a Little ... And I will be back for that one !!! My friend ordered a philly and a beer and she said everything was good she considered ordering another to go but was too stuffed ... We will for sure be back !!!
