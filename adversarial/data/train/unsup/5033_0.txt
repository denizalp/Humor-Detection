Big difference between when I went during their soft opening and when I went this past Saturday night. During the soft opening mode the fish tacos only had red cabbage. My fish tacos from Saturday night had cabbage, pickled onions, crema, and pico de gallo (everything the menu states). I really wish I would've gotten a picture of my tacos from Saturday because they look significantly different than the picture I already have posted from their soft opening. I've stopped by a few other time, but just for a drink. I'm really glad that Taco Chelo has found their groove and adjusted well past the soft opening\/grand opening stages.
