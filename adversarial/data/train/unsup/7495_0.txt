Recently opened, this new Herb Box location is doing some business!  I went for lunch today with a friend, and we had to wait 30 minutes to get seated!  Aside from the hostesses being a bit clueless (they didn't know if the menu at this location was the same as the other or not), we enjoyed our meal.\n\nThe location used to be Cafe Citron - they did a great job fixing it up.  One side is the eatery and the other is the market... and an outdoor patio is a plus!  They've still got some kinks to work on with service, but the food is just as good as the other location; especially those sweet potato chips!\n\nMy friend had the 'Urban Market Steak Salad' and I have to say, it looked much better than my 'Albacore Tuna Salad Pita' was... I think that the rent may be higher in this location since the menu prices seemed even higher than those at the other location too.  Not positive though.  \n\nI recommend this place if you don't mind spending $12 - $20 on lunch... amazing sweet potato chips, chicken chile, sandwiches, salads, and baked goods too.  I'm sure they do a great job with catering, but I don't know that from experience, just a hunch.
