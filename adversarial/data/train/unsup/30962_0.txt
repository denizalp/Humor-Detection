Let start by saying I am a tough person to please and can smell b.s. a mile away. My four dogs are a huge part of my life I love them like children. I am not willing to settle for so so care with my animals...period! Cirara  simply put, is absolutely the best! She really cares about each little heart that she cares for,watches and walks.She seems to always be on her \"A\" game and goes above and beyond consistently (which is tough to do when life gets in the way)I have been a small business owner in the vally for 18 years  and am also a 5 star rated Yelp company for both Better Than New Furniture Repair and Better Than New Kitchens.It is not easy to keep everyone happy and boy do I know! This energetic, full of life, professional, humble, confident woman is the real deal. Your animals would be blessed to be walked and be cared for by her. I have been having her walk my dogs twice a week for a couple months now.She sends a report each day and sometimes even a video and a trail map of the route they take. This really builds confidence for the pet owner (me)who is busy at work,but has my 4 little ones on my mind and want them healthy and safe. She even home made special dog treats for my crew for Thanksgiving..what! You might find cheaper..but you won't find better so do those four legged friends a favor and hire Ciara at Bark Dog Care LLC, but please not all of you yelpers because I want her to keep time in her schedule for my babies too!
