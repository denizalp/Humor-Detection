I stumbled on this studio through Living Social and I'm so glad I did.  It's a small studio with only one room but it's really the perfect size for me. Although I typically look to yoga for the mental practice as much as the physical, this is more PHYSICAL than I realized I could do.  The classes in the A.M. have the same poses and flows daily but it does NOT make it easier.  It increases my heart rate and has me pouring in sweat and sore the next day but it's not too much that it should scare off any other newbies like myself.  I'm absolutely addicted and really dig the instructors.  I will say I liked the studio the first week I went prior to the new decorating. Although the mural in the studio is lovely it just had a very modern and clean feeling before. I also liked it without the curtains.  Either way, it makes zero difference, the classes are great!
