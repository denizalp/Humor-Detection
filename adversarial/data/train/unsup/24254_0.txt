Being a lover of all things Halloween, i had to check out this place. Thinking I'd beat the crowd and come on opening weekend (Sept 7th), we were the only ones there. Anti-social success! \n\nThe maze, our main reason for our hour trip to this farm, was pretty awesome. At 8 dollars a person, you can get yourself lost anywhere from 45 min to 2 hours. All depends on how good your sense of direction is and your Baseball trivia as there are signs along the way to help guide you out faster. 2 hours 45 minutes later, I made it out alive. Woo!\nThere are kid mazes as well so kids can have a good time without being lost for too long an amount of time as it's a much easier maze. But if you want to have your child lost for a few hours and\/or permanently, by all means, send them in the adult one. \n\nThere are a few things for children to enjoy - as it is more of a child place. A few animals here and there, a corn-box (instead of a sand box - genius). Wagon rides, etc. I didn't let that stop me from trying each and every slide, swing, and toy. \n\nBottom line - a cool place to check out at least once during the fall season - fun for the whole family! Unless you suck at baseball trivia. \n\nNote - every year, they change the design of the maze along with the trivia, but if you go this year, freshen up on those home runs, leafs, oilers, and bunts!
