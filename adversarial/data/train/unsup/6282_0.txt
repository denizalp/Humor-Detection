Having to move from Kansas to Arizona for work in a two week period can absolutely be a daunting and overwhelming experience. The staff at Skysong were nothing but extremely friendly, understanding, and knowledgeable of the community. After looking at many different properties in the area, Skysong gets you the greatest bang for your buck. The floor plans are more than spacious, the kitchens are beautiful, I'm usually not one to use community amenities but the common areas (pool, lounge, gym, etc.) are highly above standard, and the price is exactly what I was looking for. I am thoroughly excited to call this place my new home.
