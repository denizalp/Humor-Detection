We visited this new Henderson spot for breakfast over the weekend and had a pleasant meal. The wait was a little on the long side but tolerable. \n\nService was a decent. They were busy so food came out a little sporadically. Everyone at my table received their food a food 10 minutes before I got mine so I had to play catch up. They ran out of clean cups so they had to bring out our drinks in styrofoam cups instead.\n\nThe food was good and we enjoyed our meals. They're relatively new to this location so I'm sure they'll work out all the kinks soon.
