This sushi place isn't up to par. The sushi pieces are so small, and there isn't a lot of variety on the menu (although there are a lot of choices, the ingredients are pretty repetitive). I ended up ordering the Three Set Mini Combo and got spider, shrimp tempura, and dynamite. The dynamite had waaaay too much sauce on it, and the tuna just fell apart when I was trying to pick it up. The shrimp tempura and the spider were okay. In general, the pieces were just too small though, and there was too much sauce on all the rolls.
