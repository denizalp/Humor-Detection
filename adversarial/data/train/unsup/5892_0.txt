It's practically right underneath my hotel and I loved it.  Usually in hotel areas you can't find stuff like this - and as a frequent traveler I find myself getting room snacks at Walgreens and Starbucks and such.  Unlike those places, this place has everything your tongue and tummy could want - in a tiny cramped small package.  REAL FOOD.  Veggies.  Fruit.  Juice.  MILK.  Fancy cheese.  Fancy crackers.  Chocolate covered almonds.  Locally made granola. I passed by it but i am pretty sure they have a deli too.\n\nPro-tip: use your sink - with the drain open - as a cooler.  Put your perishables like milk in there and fill it up with ice from the ice machine in the hall.  Ohhhh don't fuss.  You can use the shower faucet for things.
