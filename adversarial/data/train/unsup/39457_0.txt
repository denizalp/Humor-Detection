Above & beyond expectations. We are in town for our honeymoon and had a reservation at Liverpool House last night and a reservation for Joe Beef tonight. Honestly, the basis for our trip was to try these two restaurants. \nWe had an excellent experience from start to finish at Liverpool House. It should be on everyone's list when coming to Montreal. \nThe service was excellent - our server took time to explain the menu, as we are not French speakers, so don't be intimidated! The lobster spaghetti was unbelievable...a must-try!! \nVery much looking forward to Joe Beef tonight!
