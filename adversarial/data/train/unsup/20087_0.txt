YAYYY I *heart* Wet Republic! \n\nIt's a biznatch to have to walk through the entire MGM to get here, but sooo worth it. \n\nBoth times I've been here, I never had to pay cover. Come with girls, your bikini, and get yo' drank on! \n\nFYI, they make you empty out EVERYTHING in your purse that COULD be potentially harmful, i.e., hand sanitizer, tums, etc; so just be wary of that. Once you're in, doesn't matter if you get a daybed because most people are just frolicking in the water anyhow. Drinks are standard priced, around $140 for 8 mixed cocktails. \n\nThe last time I was there, the weather was partly cloudy, high of 70, and it was around 4pm on a Friday.  WR closes at 6pm so there were a ton of empty daybeds that my girls and I used for freeeee =) The London boys next to us offered us some of their fried chicken nuggets\/fries and the LA boys behind us offered us some of their booze - so all bases were covered.\n\nALSOOOOOO saw some nip slip action going on in the pool - but nothing we're not used to, amiright? ;) \n\nThe only downside of the day was when the bouncer didn't believe one of my girls was using her real ID. She took out her CC, showed her FB, and he still didn't believe her but eventually let her in. TRIPPPPPPPINNNNN'!
