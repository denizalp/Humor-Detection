I am not quite sure why people love Lux so much. I mean its good... Great coffee. I pick up beans on the weekends sometimes when its not so packed. But the baristas are inconsistent, there is always a line 20 miles long, and the my dirty chai latte is always and I repeat, always lack luster... \n\nIt's beautiful inside and if you like standing around waiting for a place to sit or crowded around the register then this is the place for you! The decor is shabby chic which I love and the teal typewriters give such a cool touch. The small windows inside allow the light to shine in, just so. If you do so manage find a seat, this is the kind of place you want to sit and write music or to your diary, sketch, or do something of an artistic nature. AKA hipster heaven. \n\nBreakfast here is really good though. I go to church across the street and sometimes we stop in here after for a bite. The bacon and eggs with a croissant are the perfect little tummy fill for a day of meandering around midtown. \n\nThe thing I really appreciate about Lux (and what ultimately bumps it to 4 stars for me) is that they are a late night coffee stop. While most of the shops in the cenpho area close their doors at 7, you will continue to find the lights on at Lux.
