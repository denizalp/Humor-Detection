I subtracted a star because the waiter spilled hot read bean soup on my friend's pants and some splattered in his eyeball... Thankfully he was alright and not hurt!!  The waiter apologized and brought us napkins and another bowl of dessert but I feel like part of our meal should have been comped... Oh wells it's an Asian restaurant.\n\nAs for the food we ordered the braised tofu with veggies, spicy sausage stir fry, yang chow fried rice, and the honey garlic spareribs. So nothing was that great or flavorful. It was decent... But missing either some spice, salt etc. the tofu definitely needed some flavor. The honey garlic ribs were very sweet. I like sweet meats but my friend didn't. The spicy stir fry was not spicy at all and the fried rice was not salty enough. Things were pretty bland.\n\nThe saving grace.. Free soup and dessert with meals!  Hopefully they won't spill it on you. I also like the vibe of this restaurant because it reminds me of places my parents and I would go eat at... Kind of gritty, hole in the wall chinese restaurant.
