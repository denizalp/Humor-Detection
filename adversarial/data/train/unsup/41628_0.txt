Visited Qpolish during a family visit to AZ. The salon is very clean and pleasantly appointed. The staff were very friendly and efficient. Prices are fair. \n\nI needed my existing gel polish removed and was very happily surprised when they took the time to properly soak it off my fingernails instead of scraping it off. I usually remove my own gel polish at home, after having my nails destroyed from my local salons rushing and scraping. \n\nI received a thorough and leisurely mani pedi with sugar scrub, callus removal, massage, and paraffin. I left feeling relaxed and pampered, with my fingers and toes looking great. I would definitely come back on a future visit.
