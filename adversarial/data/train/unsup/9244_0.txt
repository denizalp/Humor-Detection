When you first walk into this place you'll not smell the delicious cookies baking but of something wet and rotten.. kind of like old gym socks.. was pretty nasty.. so nasty we walked back out but the Mr persevered.. he ordered us a ice cream cookie sandwich and ya know what? It was fucking amazing! 2 super soft and chewy freshly baked cookies with an x-large scoop of vanilla ice cream.. sheer awesomeness! Only 4.75!
