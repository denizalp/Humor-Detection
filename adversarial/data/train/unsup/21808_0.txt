I always joke about going to this place for \"dinner & lunch\". The portions are huge! I always get a take out container to enjoy the meal the next day. \n\nPros: cheap prices but no sacrifices in the quality of food. I have never had a dish I did not enjoy.\n\nCons: Service is below average, the staff is not nearly as attentive as they should be. The wait to get in can also be quite long and frustrating.\n\nAll in all I do thoroughly enjoy desserts plus. I recommend trying it out for lunch (not as busy) and with a mind set of patience!
