I came there today to get rid of a bit of volume from my hair.\nI speak Japanese but there was no need as my stylist's English was really good. \nI was given some juice as soon as I stepped inside which felt really welcoming. I didn't get too much done to my hair but I was very satisfied.\n\nI used to go to Kamiya but I wanted to give Maya as try. Maya is literally half the price of Kamiya. I'm growing my hair out and will come back in a few months.
