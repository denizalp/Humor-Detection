Oh Gawd, I've been hesitant in the writing of this review. My sister and I have a running joke that we always bring up during conversation when a statement is obvious. It's always the same, \"Oh, I caught a disease at The Orleans\" in a monotone, haughty, theatrical voice we call \"regal.\" (For the record, we didn't catch any disease, we just say it because The Orleans looks old and run down.) For example, \"That hooker at school wore lucite heels to class.\" Response: \"Oh, and I caught a disease at The Orleans.\" \n\nWent here for the first time on Monday, 1\/31\/11, with my sister for dinner. You'll get to read that review later. The parking garage is a ghost town, yet there is a security guard that sits in a truck by the entrance. I wonder if they ever stop anybody to search their vehicle. When we were leaving, my sister, who rarely gives out compliments, complimented a guy in the parking garage elevator by telling him \"you look like Chris Brown.\" \n\nThe place is clean enough. It's old, it's tacky. Whatever. My sister and I got loyalty cards. An old grandmotherly-like lady signed us up and gave us Christmas calendars and springy key fobs for our cards. Jackpot. These calendars are hillarious in a \"my humor\" sort of way. The four women on the cover have that \"I hate my life\" look on their faces in their Santa costumes while holding different martinis. Inside, are tons of pictures of say, the bingo hall or the poker room here. \n\nWe were followed around by some security guard who kept smiling at us. I don't know what that was about. Luckily, he was of some use to us in helping us find a restroom. My sister, at the sink, said, \"Oh, this shows how spoiled I am. I assumed the water would come on if I put my hands underneath the faucet\" as she flipped the handle on. \n\nWhen we looked lost, there was always an employee asking us if we needed any help finding XYZ. Service is good, place is shabby but it's all good. The joke will still stand.
