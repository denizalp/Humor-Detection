If you like pain and want to get a pedicure by Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Kruegar then my friend this is the place for you!\n Firsr they have u sit on a dirty massage chair and place your feet in a lukewarm foot spa that doesn't work. Then the slab on some sort of sugar scrub, then proceed to scrub your feet with the sugar scrub and pumice sponge. They scrub your feet as if they were catholic nuns in a convent and your the promiscuous knocked up teen being punished for being a whore.\n After the scrub they clean off your feet and take a dremel to your toenails!!! Are u kidding me?!? They use the dremel to cut back your cuticle and straighten your nails.. Then they use that little clipping tool to remove those hangnail type growth's on the sides of your nails. That was seriously so painful and they made my toes bleed!\n What's even worse about this place is that I watched them and their 'sanitizing'. It's non existent. I seen them use the same pumice sponge on other clients along with other tools. Kind of scary. \n So needless to say I will not be returning here ever.
