Come for the great medical care, STAY FOR THE FOOD!\n\nLuckily, my health insurance paid for an overnight sleep test here at the Mayo Clinic Hospital, and as usual, the medical care was great.  Staff was attentive and helpful, and I even got to watch streaming movies on their TV (Harry Potter...no Adult channels tho)\n\nHowever, their cafeteria is top notch!  The next morning,  I stumbled out of my sleep test at 7AM into the cafeteria and was amazed at the great selection of breakfast choices at such low prices.  I had a made-to-order omelet and two pancake breakfast with Starbucks coffee, all for the low price of under $5!  They also have affordable lunch and dinner specials.\n\nI'd feel uncomfortable recommending people to go to the hospital only for the best, cheap breakfast this side of Denny's Grand Slam promotions, so I won't.   Instead, check to see if your health insurance covers Mayo Clinic care, and then you can eat here any time (gosh forbid) you or your loved ones need hospital care.
