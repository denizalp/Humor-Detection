After our hike at the Wetlands, we came here for our after hike snacks and drinks.  The park is very nice and new.  This used to be just an area you pulled in to park with a dirt lot.  Now there's a large parking lot with several picnic tables and benches and bathroom facilities.\n\nThe tables are mostly shaded but that depends on the sun and the time of year.  It was a pleasant place to spend our after hike time and plan our hike for next week.\n\nThere are two trails leading from the parking area.  One of them splits into a third and they end at an unpaved trail that is the south section of the Wetlands Park Loop Trail.  You can take any of these trails from the picnic area to the Nature Center at the Wetlands Park and then come back here for a picnic.  It would be a nice family outing!
