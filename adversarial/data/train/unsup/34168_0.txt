After having lived in Phoenix for two years, this is the closest grocery to my house and I keep coming back hoping it will be better .  Last month , I could t find pillsbury frozen biscuits and after 1\/2 hour looking I asked the manager who said it was considered a \"seasonal \" item but they didn't bother taking the word biscuits off aisle 15 sign because they thought rolls were biscuits !   I am fatigued at having to fight off pan handlers and the homeless in the parking lot or they guy in the wheelchair by the door asking for spare change.  Today was about the last straw as an able bodied youth who appeared early twenties in a new baseball hat asked me for a gas can on leaving with my bags which seemed an odd request for someone without a car and when I ignored him, he wondered aloud what was wrong with people in this city.   It wasn't until I put my groceries in the car and started to back out that I saw this thug standing directly behind my car to block my exit .  I stopped and rolled down the window and asked what his problem was and he said I came with inches of hitting him.   Now the scam and thuggery element was clear.   No security in the parking lot, no cameras , and I thought 7th st and MCDOWELL was scary, at least they have security .    I'm not so easily intimidated but what customers should have to suffer this at the hands of their grocery.   Do I have to have a concealed carry to go grocery shopping now?    I felt like I was in the \"hood\".   Next time AJ's!
