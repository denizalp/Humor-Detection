Gas is gas.  This location tends to have cheaper prices, even compared to Arco and Costco.\n\nI wouldn't use it on my personal vehicle but I did for my rental.  Easy to get in and out of off the strip. \n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to get here though.\n\nDon't spend a gallon of gas to save 10 cents!
