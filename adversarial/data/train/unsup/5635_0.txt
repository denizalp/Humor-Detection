There are no words to describe how awful the ER is. I was in the ER for 25 hours. I had to teach myself how to unhook my IV and telemetry so I could go to the bathroom and get water. When I unhooked myself, no one even blinked. No alarms went off, nothing. The staff just does not care. I was constantly lied to and the doctors, when they did visit me, acted like they were doing me a favor talking to me and barely came inside the curtained room I was in. They talked really fast and left before I could absorb what they were saying. \n\nThis is a good hospital to die in, not one to get well in.
