A huge thanks to Julia S and Tonya P for turning me on to this place. I'm ashamed I hadn't written this review earlier, this place is fantastic. Despite my love for Indian food, I can never remember the names of anything I eat, so I'm just going to say that it all tastes great. Especially the curries. And the dosas. And the naan. And the samosas. I am so hungry, let's go back please. \n\nDon't mind the location and decor. Service is great and food is delirium inducing.
