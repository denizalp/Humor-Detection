Phil in plumbing explained everything so well to Dad.  He was knowledgeable and friendly.  Afterwards, Dad shook hands with Phil cause he was awesome.\n\nPlumbing cost $13.55.  We learned something new, certain items don't get the Veterans discount or it would've been 10% cheaper.\n\nAlso Christmas here we come... I always say this... Already!!  Lol!
