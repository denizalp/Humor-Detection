We were extremely pleased with our stay at this KOA.  The staff was bilingual, friendly, and helpful with references to tourist attractions and restaurants.  The park is conveniently located close to Montreal sites, yet still maintains a camping feel.  The park was clean, quiet, and well maintained.  Highly recommend.
