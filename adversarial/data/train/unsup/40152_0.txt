Very enjoyable meal.  Recently my husband & I met a friend for dinner.  She had never been to Black & Bleu, and we wanted to try out the new dinner menu.  The appetizers we ordered were great (we are huge fans of the pretzel bites and the Ahi crudo), and the dinner selections were delicious as well.  My husband and friend both ordered the Alehouse Burger, which they enjoyed.  We have ordered the filet & the short ribs in the past, and both have always been well prepared.  I would suggest checking Black & Bleu out soon  They have new lunch and brunch menu's if you can't make it in for dinner.  They also have live entertainment several nights a week, as well as lots of TV's for all of you sport lovers!
