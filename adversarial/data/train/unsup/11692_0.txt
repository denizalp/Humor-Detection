I had such mixed emotions about this place after my experience with them.\nSo here's the story...I bought a Groupon for an exam, massage and adjustment. When I called to make a appointment, they couldn't get me in for 3 weeks, it was okay, I'm flexible with my schedule.  A few days before my appointment a couple friends told me they were going to get married in Vegas, they planned on the day of my appointment, so they made sure to make it early enough so I wouldn't miss the wedding or appointment. The wedding was beautiful, then I rushed to my appointment, I noticed a missed call on my phone from them, but no message, I figured they were just confirming. I get there and they tell me the massage therapist called in sick, said they called me, I threw back that they didn't leave a message. They were very apologetic and made another appointment for me the next week. I had been dropped off for my appointment, so I had to wait for my ride, it was 110 degrees out so I waited inside. I was parched after rushing around, they had a water cooler, but no cups in the whole office. Since I was there and waiting and the Doc wasn't busy he did a few x-rays and a quick adjustment for me for free.\nOn my next appointment day, I got a missed call from them, but they left a message this time. Saying their massage therapist called in sick. Really!? So I call them back and they tell me they just got a cancellation for an appointment later today if I would like this appointment. I took it. My appointment finally went without a hitch. Had an awesome massage by Allison and another adjustment from the Doc. Sadly there were no cups in the waiting room for water again. All of the staff were nice. The facility was clean.\nStill on the fence if I will go back again. Only time and back pain will tell.
