We went here for brunch, it was a very pleasant atmosphere over looking the summerlin shopping area .\nThe place was clean and had a great theme going it really did look like school.\nThere's lots of drinking games and fun to be had and would be a awesome pre drinking area although we went for Sunday they did do bottomless mimosas they didn't look that appealing and they hadn't quite crated the right atmosphere for a raging good Sunday sesh.\nThe food was good the shorty bowl was potatoe crunch thing which goes great with the short rib.\nI can't remember the name of the burger however it was good too and the ketchup was awesome.\nAll round for the price and theme that the place is going for its worth 5 stars.
