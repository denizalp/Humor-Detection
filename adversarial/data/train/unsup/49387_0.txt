This place is crowded, but best after midnight and a lot of beers on Mill. Get adventurous and try different types, they have quite a few types.\n\nYou a dude? Get 2 slices! Trust me on this. Their food isn't bad, it's average pizza. For the walks home after the bars close, this pizza in 12 stars of delicious pizza heaven.
