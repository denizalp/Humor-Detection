From their business bio;  \"...we've always had low prices and exceptional customer service.\n\n\"Our customers are not just a number. We look forward to getting to know you and seeing you on a regular basis.\"\n\nOK, let's address the second point first.  A friend and I went into this place, and halfway down the first aisle, I saw a t-shirt I was interested in.  Without removing it from the pile, I touched the one on top to feel the fabric, and looked at the tag for information.\n\nFrom behind, I hear \"Tsk tsk tsk\".  What the ???  I look back, and there is an employee looking at me and tsk-ing.  He points at a sign and says \"read the sign\".  The sign said \"Please ask employees to help you with the sizes.\"  OK, fair enough.  I wouldn't want to mess up the obsessively neat and folded piles.  I don't mind that.  But he \"tsk-ed\" me.  I'm not 9 years old.  GREAT customer service.\n\nThe first point - On another pile was a nice quality, made-in-Canada, RCMP- themed t-shirt.  It was 29.99.  That's a lot for a t-shirt and I doubt the price here is any lower than anywhere else.\n\nSo...\"low prices and exceptional customer service\".  Eek, methinks not.
