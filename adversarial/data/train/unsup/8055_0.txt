This review is very blinkered, and really only has to do with the wildly overpriced, scorched and watery coffee in the downstairs lobby bar. Everything else about this hotel was fine, the lobby bar is comfortable, the private salon on the top floor has a great view and is corporatecomfortable. But man, a bad coffee at whatever price is enough, on some days, to make me want to flip tables... or lie quietly under them and weep. A nice hotel, huge international chain, fairly expensive with friendly staff a should take an interest in quality at every level. Take the coffee seriously is all I'm saying. It's important.
