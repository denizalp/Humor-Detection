I feel like this was a nice place, though nothing extraordinary.  I have a list of restaurants in Pgh to try and this was on my list...I would be fine with going if someone else wanted to, but I don't think I would specifically choose this place again.  \n\n We had the crab grilled cheese appetizer, which was very good!  I saw another table get calamari and it looked very good as well. \n\nThe salad was fine.  \n\nI got the fillet and it was good.  As good as we make it at home but not amazing.   Which to me is a bit of a let down.  We cook pretty well at our house but when we go to a nicer place we expect it to be better than what we can make at home since these are professional chefs.  \n\nMy husband was very excited about the Local Game Duo until he tasted it.  I had a bit of each the venison and the bison.  They were both terrible cuts of meat, incredibly tough.  I couldn't even finish the venison bite.  He said his whole meal was like that.  \n\nMy husband LOVED his dessert (Banana Foster Napoleon).   I got the Elvis bread pudding as the server said it was his favorite.   It seemed different from anything I'd seen before which is usually a good omen*.  It was interesting, not something I would get again.   I'm sure the other desserts are good. \n\nSo overall a decent place, but I'm not in love with it. \n\n* We read something a long time ago that said if you ordered the most odd or out there item on the menu, it will most like be the best thing you've ever eaten.  I would say that is true about 90% of the time :)
