Like walking back in time to the 1940s, it's sort of like a hipster-Mitchell's Ice Cream. Definitely a cool place to satisfy your sweet tooth with your sweetie! MUCH better than the one they installed at Progressive Field, where the line is too long, the prices are inflated, and the selections are minimal. At THIS location, you at least get better ambiance. The ice cream is divine, though they do have old-time candy and some interesting sandwich selections, like their PB&J. I'm always a sucker for their coffee ice cream or salted-caramel ice cream but will have to try their malts the next time we go.
