As someone who has previously worked in the carpet cleaning industry, I can assure you that Hurst Carpet and Tile Care knows what they're doing. They arrived right on schedule and were able to clean all of my 2 story home in a short time period. First time this carpet have been cleaned after 3 years of use and they look brand new. Of course, there were some pets stains that wouldn't come out, but that's on me for not catching them when they happened. Hurst is very reasonably priced. I have a neighbor that recently had two rooms cleaned for the about the same price as my entire home (2 dens, 2 rooms, master bedroom, stairs & hallway). Give these guys a shot, you won't be disappointed. Support local businesses!
