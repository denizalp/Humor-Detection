Rented from Hertz Rent a Car through Priceline. Horrible customer service. Rude. When returning car they charged $100 stating that it was not in the same condition because it needed to be vacuumed. It may have been because I got a low rate on Priceline. I called to talk to manager and my call was not returned. Don't rent here!
