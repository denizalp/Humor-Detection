First of all: donuts! They are hot, fresh, and come in a variety of tasty flavours. This is reason alone to visit this great new spot in Mile End. \n\nHowever, Sardine is about more than *just* donuts. Try the house-made cucumber soda (also available in apple), allong√©, espresso, or even the \"boring\" cafe filtre (which is anything but boring...and worth the brewing wait time, I promise). Grab a window seat and check out the queue of people clamouring to get into neighbour-shop Boulangerie Guillaume and the collection of Mile End regulars. \n\nIt's the perfect spot to finish reading that great book, in a sunny spot, with a sweet treat.\n\nThey're open into the evening and have a small selection of beers on tap and a tiny menu of things other than donuts. Definitely a new spot worth checking out.
