We used to go to all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants frequently before finding this diamond in the rough in Anthem. We decided to try a new place on the eve of our annual engagement and discovered our favorite sushi joint in Las Vegas\/Henderson. The fish is fresh, the portions are phenomenal, the atmosphere is tremendous, presentation is beautiful and the service is incredible. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!\n\nP.S. The five course meal (better than any all you can eat we have had) fills you up and lets you leave with extra food! It offers you:\n\n1. Beer, House Sake, or any Fountain Drink\n2. Choice of two appetizers\n3. Choice between multiple salads (tuna poke salad included)\n4. Choice between six nigiri, six sashimi, volcano, OR choice of any two rolls on the menu, OR  hot combination (we have not tried this yet)\n5. Dessert choice of mochi, ice cream, twinkie, and some other stuff I probably forgot to list\n\nWe have been here three times in 11 days. Here is everything we have tried to SATISFACTION (from drinks to appetizers to main course to dessert): \n\nIced green tea\nHouse sake (part of the 5 course meal menu)\nMiso soup\nHouse salad (part of the 5 course meal menu)\nTuna poke salad (part of the 5 course meal menu)\nMixed tempura (part of the 5 course meal menu)\nKimchi fried rice (BEST I have ever had)\nMushroom stuffed w\/ chicken (part of the 5 course meal menu)\nBacon wrapped asparagus (part of the 5 course meal menu)\nSalmon skin hand roll (BEST we have ever had)\nSalmon and assorted nigiri (part of the 5 course meal menu - see photo) \nSalmon Lover Roll (part of the 5 course meal menu - see photo)\nAssorted sashimi (part of the 5 course meal menu)\nVolcano (part of the 5 course meal menu)\n\n... And probably a variety of other foods I have forgotten to mention. The owner, Julianna, really cares about the customers, food, and restaurant. I'd recommend trying any of their specials as well!
