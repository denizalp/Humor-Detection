Don't stay here....\n\nWe \"upgraded\" our room at the front desk to a Deluxe room...\n-It smelled as if it hasn't had any airflow in months. We constantly left our door open to air out the unit, didn't help at all.\n-Everything seemed to be broken: lamp, dresser & drawers, table, AC unit (fan was obviously going out and was loud as heck)\n-Stains all over the carpet - my feet were dirty just from walking around the room\n-VERY muggy\n-The \"view\" (we upgraded to) was of a parking lot and roofs of other buildings...\n\nFYI, Classic rooms haven't been renovated in 20+ years, and the \"Deluxe\" room was approximately 7 years ago (according to the front desk girl, who was very nice though)... Oh, and don't park in the lower levels of the garage, it floods apparently all the time (YouTube it)\n\nExcited to start the night, we ignored the initial issues and started to unpack. My boyfriend wanted to iron his shirt... Bad idea. Something was burnt onto the iron, and without us looking (I didn't think I'd need to check the iron!?) he burnt the plastic looking stuff onto his shirt. The hotel didn't do much except argue that it wasn't their area to help with. 45 minutes of arguing, they gave us a $20 credit for room service (not what we wanted, but better than nothing I guess). Just saying, if a customer is unhappy, you should make sure they want to return... Not happening.\n\nWe refused to lose more money at the hotel and didn't gamble. \n\nIF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN INEXPENSIVE PLACE to stay on the strip, go to Circus Circus or elsewhere.. It's a bit further, but Vegas has a monorail for cheap that takes you up and down the strip, or grab a cab. I'm sorry we didn't do the same.\n\nPS - the smell got worse
