First time coming to Field Table and we had a spectacularly poor experience. \nOur waitress was incompetent. In our first hour, she checked in on us twice, once to get us water and 20 minutes later to take our food and drink  order. This was especially problematic because she  failed to put in our food order. \nAfter an hour and 15 minutes without food, flagging down the manager to explain the situation resulted in extra bad news - they had sold out of the steaks which each of us had ordered. This was after them being out of another menu option and two drink options that we had tried to order and were not proactively told about. \nThe manager did his best to make amends but we still waited another 15 minutes to get the replacement food after being promised it'd be out in five minutes and had to flag him down again to get that. \nThe waitress never followed up and we were switched to a different server who did well given the circumstances. The food was good; I'd highly recommend the chicken and  the mussels  if you have to go, but I will never be back based on a poor front and back of the house experience.
