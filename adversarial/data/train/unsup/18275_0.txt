Before coming here I thought how good could a crepe be? Now I will forever compare future crepes to the crepes here. I definitely found this spot to be a five star based great food and great service.\n\nAs soon as we arrived we were greeted and handed menus to help us make our selections. The same man that greeted us also found us a table where we could settle in after placing our orders. I believe the owner is the one that took our orders at the counter and he was very friendly as well. \n\nI ordered a sweet crepe to take back to the office after lunch which they held off on making until I was almost ready to leave. The man that helps find the tables remembered that my co-worker and I had ordered sweet crepes and offered to get them started as he noticed us finishing up our savory crepes. I was impressed that while checking on all of the tables and greeting everyone that he was so on top of this. Sure enough our crepes arrived right as we were ready to leave. Everything was packaged well and they included silverware. \n\nThe actual crepe was the best crepe I've ever had. The taste was excellent and I loved the way it was prepared. For lunch I had the Sonora which was steak, avocado, salsa, and cheese. It was very tasty and I loved the flavor of the steak inside. My dessert pick was the Perfect Combination which was strawberries, chocolate drizzle, and whipped cream. Yum! It was probably enough for two people to share, but I ate the whole thing because it was delicious.\n\nThe restaurant isn't huge, but they offer indoor and outdoor seating. It's nice that there is someone to help find tables for you during busy times. The restaurant seemed clean and inviting. I also loved that they have cucumber water and lemon water. \n\nThis spot is definitely a winner! I'm so glad that I gave it a try and I'm already thinking about when I can make it back for more deliciousness.
