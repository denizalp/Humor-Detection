Food is great here but it's too very small and can be hard to get a table.\n\nService is not wonderful and if you sit at the Sushi bar (don't) don't get Daniel. He has no interest in bing friendly with the customers. Meanwhile on the other side of the bar the Asian guy who I think is the owner had the people laughing and smiling. Daniel was very quiet and ignored us other than handing us our food.\n\n\nWe probably won't be back. Just as good of Sushi in the area and this one is a bit of a drive from Chandler.
