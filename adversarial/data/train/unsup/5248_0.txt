I find the Taco Palace to be somewhat confusing.  It may look like a hole-in-the-wall authentic tex-mex place, but it is actually a very contrived  theme restaurant brought to you by the Food Fight folks.  Coming from CA, I'm used to going to places that look like this for authentic cheap grub.    The Taco Palace food is good but the prices don't match the atmosphere.   Three bucks for a small fish taco is two dollars too many.  Fifteen minutes to wait for two tacos to go was ten minutes too many.  Nevertheless, the food was decent and the atmosphere was pleasant so I may come back with friends in the future.
