Hands down my favorite place to stay in Vegas! I've stayed here with just my hubby, with a big group of friends, and with all girlfriends and no matter what I have a great time.\n\nThe rooms are super clean (I've never had a problem), the pillows and beds are SOOOO comfy and soft and they just expanded so the casino is even bigger and has more variety now too.\n\nOne thing I will say is that don't open the wrong shampoo bottle! I wasn't feeling too well the next morning one time and went to shower and opened a slightly larger shampoo bottle. They charged me $50 for it! Yuck! But I guess its my fault since I didn't see the paper on it marked \"You will be charged $50 if you use this shampoo\".\n\nI could be a little biased seeing as though I know 2 VIP hosts there and they ALWAYS hook me up when I stay here. No long lines at Rehab, table hopping at the clubs and no cover, free steak dinners at Rare 120, I could go on and on. \n\nThey have been having some great room deals too lately. Whenever I visit Vegas I always try to stay here - highly recommend!
