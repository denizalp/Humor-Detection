I stopped by here a couple of times and it was great (and free)!\n\nI felt a little bit weird about the whole idea of lions in a habitat in the casino, but I felt much better when I learned that it's super-fancy so it's perfect temperature\/clean air, they don't hear or smell us, and that the ranch that they're coming from has a lot of lions so each lion is only there for about 5 hours a week. Not sure how much they like being loaded up and transported, but.... it made me feel better.\n\nThe first time they were sleeping (which apparently they do 18-20 hours a day, especially when in a comfortable place) and\/or being lazy, but the second time I was happy to see one awake and moving around.\n\nI love how they seem to enjoy laying on the see-through(ish) portion where the walkway for the humans is. It's pretty crazy to be standing right under a resting lion!
