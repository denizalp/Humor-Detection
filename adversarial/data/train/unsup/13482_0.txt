Who knew there was so much history lurking underneath the sidewalks? \n\nAfter several days of wandering the cobblestone streets of historic (and not so historic) Montreal, eating and drinking, it was time to get some learning in our systems. That, and it was a rainy Monday with a lot of other attractions closed.\n\nFrom the outside of the facade, this museum looks pretty small. At first, I thought we went into the wrong one, as it appears more like a modern art gallery than a history museum. Just go in the main entrance, pay your fee and get ready to be amazed.\n\nAs many have mentioned, there's a video presentation before exploring the city's archaeological discoveries. It covers several centuries' worth of highlights, including the triumphs and tribulations of the city. Spoiler alert: there's definitely some tension between the French and British.\n\nWandering the underground ruins was incredibly interesting. There's signage everywhere to explain what you're looking at (in French and English) and arrows on the floor indicating which exhibit you're nearing. If you get lost, it's your own doing.\n\nAmericans like myself don't really get much Canadian history lessons growing up. Or at least I didn't in school, beyond knowing the names of all of the provinces. So this was a fun history lesson that helps put the rest of our Montreal visit into context. An afternoon well spent.
