Woodman's = Dirty, bad produce... oh, and now no mental health coverage for employees\n\nTrader Joe's = Limited selections & everything prepackaged, frozen. No fresh selection for meats, etc.\n\nWilly St. = Membership? No thanks.\n\nJenifer St. Market = Limited selection\n\nWhole Foods = Way too expensive, and not incredibly better by any means.\n\nCopps comes close, but haven't been able to find several items that I have been able to find at Hy-Vee\n\nHy-Vee has everything and then some. The staff has always been extremely helpful. I have found things there that I have been unable to find elsewhere in Madison. The place is clean, accessible, and I'm willing to pay a bit more for the convenience of being able to get everything I need in one stop. That's something that can't be said for some of the places I've mentioned above. Totally forgot to mention that it's 24 hours...\n\nObeseiogenic society? Go home dude...
