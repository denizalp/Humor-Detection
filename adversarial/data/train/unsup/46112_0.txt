Surf the Musical takes the audience back to a more innocent time yet is just as relevant today. First, the Beach Boys' music is timeless and like Momma Mia, this is a true musical with some original song with the rest the Beach Boys' music.  The story captures the angst of young love, broken dreams and the loss of someone that is deeply loved. The choreography is great and the stage settings is done with hi-def tv screens and it really works. This is great for those who lived in the 1960s as well as those who only experienced this on the TV and movies. Go see it!
