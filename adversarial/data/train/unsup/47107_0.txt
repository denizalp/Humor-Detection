So the best part about Fibber Magees has to be the atmosphere inside! It does feel a lot like an Irish pub and I would even say that the atmosphere is better than some of the other places that I've been to that were similar. Other than that the dining experience was just okay for me. I was really looking forward to getting the fish & chips here before arriving which I did manage to get, however I have to say that I was rather disappointed with it. The chips (fries) were not very good at all and based on that I will not get this again. At least the fish was pretty good however the outside texture was too crispy in my opinion and I've still had better at other places. They also forgot my utensils when the food came which I don't mind that much as they brought them before I even asked.\n\nThe atmosphere here is awesome but I'm not too sure if I'll come back here other than maybe the happy hour deals that they have throughout the week.
