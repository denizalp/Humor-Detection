There is such a lack of employees here. I asked an associate for help finding an item and their response was \"good luck I'm helping two other people so make it quick!\" Excuse me? Flat out RUDE! I tried another employee who told me, \" I'm busy right now I'll help you soon\" who then walked to a register and stood there. (Keep in mind nobody was in line) WHAT!! I finally gave up on asking for assistance and walked away to find it myself. Once I finally found what I was looking for I go to check out and hear the \"manager\" answer the phone telling another person \"they are not hiring\" word of advice Michaels.. hire some more FRIENDLY, WILLING TO ASSIST employees. Definitely won't return to this location. No words could explain how rude SEVERAL employees were.
