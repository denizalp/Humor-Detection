You know those people who hate all of the excess of America?  Don't bring them here.  \n\nYa know how some places will give you a sprig of parsley or a twisted orange slice to garnish your plate?  Here they give you a small apple.  Yes, a small apple.  And it looks quite proportionate.  Yikes.\n\nThis is a great spot to come with friends.  If you have one of those friends who claims they can eat anything and still be hungry - bring them here.  When you walk in it feels like some old lodge with a large stone fireplace and stuffed animals on the wall.  So don't bring your PETA friends here.  No like-y.  \n\nNot only is everything ginormous (yes, I spelled it that way on purpose) but it's actually pretty darn good. This isn't inspirational cuisine or anything, but they do a pretty mean meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  The girlfriend's favorite is their Chicken fried chicken.  Dear heavens.  It's \"needs it's own zip code joke\" worthy.\n\nDon't come here on a hot night with plans to go out afterword.  Come here after something else so you know you are on your way home.  Because there WILL be leftovers.  Enough for one or two days most likely.  And so far everything we've tried heats up quite well the next day.  \n\nEnvironmental note - Feel free to bring your own Tupperware\/storage from home.  Use the big purse.  Bring one for everyone if you want.  Because not only will you using them mean less boxes in the old landfill, your food won't dry out or pick up any other fridge flavors.  And since this food may be dinner for the next few nights - these things matter.
