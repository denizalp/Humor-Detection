We've been to streets of New York before at the centennial hills location and it was good.  Our experience here was poor.   Easy location to get to.  We walked in and the place was empty maybe it was the warrior cavalier game but empty nonetheless.   I ordered Caesar salad and pasta.   When the salad came, the lettuce had started to rot (turning red and black).  So we sent it back for another.  One would assume that the next when would come back in excellent shape but it came back worse than the 1st.   So I nixed the salad and had my pasta which was ok.   Don't know if we would give this location a 2nd chance.  The only reason we would consider is bc we had a much better experience at the other location.
