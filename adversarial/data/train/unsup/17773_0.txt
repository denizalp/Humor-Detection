Amazing! Delicious! Came to have breakfast for the hubby's birthday celebration. The service was great! Servers always very attentive. By far one of the greatest places I have ever been to for breakfast. Definitely beats IHOP. Even though it was pretty full we did not have to wait long for our food! Definitely wonderful!
