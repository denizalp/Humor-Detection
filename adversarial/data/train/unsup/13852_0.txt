This review is strictly for the doubles.\n\nA friend introduced it to me as a staple food of living in Kensington\/being vegetarian but didn't quite explain what it is. After scouring the Internet, I learned that doubles represent the Indian in \"West Indian\" and apparently are a Trini thing. They're pretty much channa masala (spiced chickpea mixture) sandwiches that are bright yellow. They are delicious. There is some sort of spice blend that I can't identify (Jamaican jerk spice?), but even in my most hungover moments, the spice is just what I need.\n\nDoubles cost $1.58 with tax and are the perfect size for a snack. Get two if you're really hungry.\n\nI doubt I would ever buy anything else in the bakery, but doubles are on my unofficial tasting tour of Kensington and I love them. I am extremely not Caribbean, did not grow up in Toronto\/anywhere with any sort of Caribbean culure, and was introduced to doubles by a white girl from PEI. So all that said, doubles are the best.
