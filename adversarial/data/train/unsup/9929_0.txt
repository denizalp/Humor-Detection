I don't know what I was expecting when I got a bus all the way down the strip to check out some rides.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there's some awesome rollercoasters in here, well they look awesome. I didn't go on because I was over-run with children. That basically means that I reached my child quota for the day and there's only so much squealing I can take before I run for the hills screaming myself.\n\nThere are a range of games that you can play. From the usual throwing balls, hoops and other assorted items to win prizes. There are the lazer tag ones (which I thought was a great inclusion btw!) and there was a batman one, however I couldn't figure out what the game actually was.\n\nThe toilets were a wee bit hard to find. It was tucked off in some underground bunker kind of deal. They were clean at least, so one can't complain too much.\n\nFor an indoor theme park they didn't do too badly.\n\nMight have to revisit when I'm actually feeling 100% with ear plugs to see if I can't try any of the rides. This might up my star value by one.\n\nIt's free to get in however you pay per ride or game. There are all day passes you can get or you can go one ride at a time.
