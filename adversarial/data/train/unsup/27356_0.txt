I went here for holiday shopping. I wanted to buy a telescope. EVERYTHING on the shelf was gone. I asked if they had back stock. Not sure when it was coming. I found a pair of binoculars. They were priced for 70.00. I looked them up online from my phone , the website said 35.00.... wtf. Come to find out they put the wrong price on the shelf.\n\nI would have liked a telescope.
