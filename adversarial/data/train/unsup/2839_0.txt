We had a 14 group reservation and upon arriving they told us they weren't seating anymore people and that their kitchen was extremely backed up. When inquiring about the fact that we had a reservation they eventually told us that another large group took our reservation by claiming to be us and that we would have to wait over 30 Mins to be reseated. \nWe called Ocotillo who accommodated us immediately. Safe to say I won't be back to Jewels.
