It took a free pass to see Julie & Julia to get me to go to this theater, but I'll for sure be back...\n\nI am not a huge fan of going to crazy big strip malls like Tempe Marketplace.  But, every time I do go, I realize it's not so bad... yes, parking sucks, but anything and everything you could possibly want is in this mall.  But alas, my review is for the movie theater - and I have to admit, once you get inside, it's beautiful!\n\nSpacious isles, comfortable seats, amazing picture, crystal clear surround sound, decently friendly staff.  Yes, this theater is indeed a winner.  I did not treat myself to movie theater popcorn tonight, but it looked and smelled amazing... I will for sure purchase some for a post-wedding movie (when I'm less concerned about fitting into a wedding dress!) \n\nOh - and for those wondering about Julie & Julia - it was really cute!  I never read the book but I really enjoyed the movie... it officially opens tomorrow!
