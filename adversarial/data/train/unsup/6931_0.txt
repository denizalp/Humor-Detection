i will extend this review in future times, however... for now I will say that 'The old Spaghetti factory' provided me with the Worst meal I have ever had in Toronto, without doubt.\n\nFor the first time in my life, I honestly could not eat my main course, unless I was ready to face the punishment of sitting on the ground of an 'Old Spaghetti Factory' toilet cubicle.\n\nDon't even ask why I did eat here, just please listen to what I am telling you.\n\nHorrible. Like Chuck E. Cheese, without games, prizes, and people dressed as animals.\n\nSlainte\n\nConor
