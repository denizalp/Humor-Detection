Wow, what a disaster. Not only do they not have AC it also smells bad and I would say at least 50% of the shops are shut down. We even asked one of the store owners about the AC and they said the owners don't do anything about it. What a mess! The stores that are in there are nick nak shops so it's a bunch of junk. Thank you Amazon!
