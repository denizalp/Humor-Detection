Easily accessible from freeways or surface streets, relative ease renting and returning cars, lots of parking, kinda clean terminal: I'm a fan of my new home airport. \n\nYes, it is large. Security lines have not been an issue, but I have TSA Pre Check. The one ding I have is that their scales always add extra # to my luggage. I even like the local restaurants in Terminal 4. \n\nI've flown in and out six times since March, and my biggest gripe is the lack of charging stations for devices. Not too shabby.
