Being from So Cal, I've always taken good mexican food for granted because it was so accessible to me. Since moving here 3 months ago, I've been craving carne asada fries for so long but just didnt know where find one here in Vegas. Then one day making a wrong turn, I bumped into Roberto's Taco Shop which was 2 blocks away from my house.  My life just took a step up in being satisfied.\n\nThey are not selfish with their servings here. I ordered a carne asada fries and burrito and let me tell you, they did not miss even a millimeter of space in that box!  Not only were the servings big, but it was pretty good too.  Man that hit the spot! Best thing is that they're open 24\/7 and I hit the gym around 1am so this is the new spot I will definitely be hitting up after my workouts.  Yea I know its a bad diet but I'll work out even harder to make up for it.\n\nService here is nice and very clean environment. From what I've been reading on yelp that other Roberto places arent as nice as this one.  Best thing is it's mexicans making mexican food unlike another place i went to where it was asians making mexican food and the other way around.  Biggest fail was a Pho restaurant ran by filipinos and let me tell you, their Pho was Phocking nasty! Keep the menu within the race and you get my thumbs up.\n\nFriends are telling me to try their Lengua as well. Don't know what that is but i'll be sure to order that next.
