The whole point about this restaurant is experience eating in darkness. Dont expect much from food. \n\nIts good for testing your senses while siting in darkness. But even that, vanishes after a while and you would want to leave at your earliest.\n\nIts also expensive: you pay a premium (really) for the experience, not food.\n\nIdea of darkness is good, but only for the first 20-30 mins. No more.\n\nThis restaurant is good for experiencing once. But not somewhere you go often.
