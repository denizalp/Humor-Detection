As a fellow New Englander I was so happy to see this Vermont Sandwich Shop. I actually learned about it from a flyer that was sent to us through the mail giving a nice discount. However, they are not open past 5:00pm and that was pretty disappointing considering how yummy their sandwiches sounded on the menu. The first time we went there it was Veteran's Day. I had a wrap with some fantastic chicken salad. It was to die for. My husband had the Italian Stallion Sandwich and it was terrific. They have some great combination's and everything there is very fresh. I have been there three times since Veteran's Day!! I tried their chilli today and a taste of my husband's french onion soup with homemade croutons. The sandwiches are definitely hefty so I agree with the others that you need to go here with an appetite. I also enjoy the New England\/Vermont-like decor with it's Ben and Jerry elements of the 70's tie-dyed shirts and Dead Head posters. Great spot to get a nice lunch. Their only downfall is that they probably are not getting the exposure that they need because it is so tucked into this plaza. This is definitely a place that I will be frequenting quite a bit!\nPS- Try the cookies!!
