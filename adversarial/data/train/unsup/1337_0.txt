Came here on a Saturday night with 15 of us.  LOL!  We roll in large groups when it comes to food.  Our table did our own ordering, I took a lot of pics.  These are the things I remember eating:\n1.  Pork and chicken dumplings:  Very good but I wanted the special soy blend instead on the regular soy on the table\n2.  Beef noodle soup:  Beef has good flavor, the handmade noodles were not bad, the soup base needed a tag bit more flavor\n3.  Green onion pancake:  OK, that was good not too greasy\n4.  Pork and green bean stir fried noodles:  Love it.  Not greasy with the right amount of flavor\n5.  Pan fried chow mien with assorted meat (don't know if that was the name):  The flavor was there, just wish we had more noodles\n6.  Moo Shu Pork:  this is not the one that is wrapped up in the rice paper, it is stir fried.  It was very good also\n7.  Soy bean milk:  was good you can ask for unsweetened\n\nThe service was OK.  Check on us here and there, but we had to wave them down for things.
