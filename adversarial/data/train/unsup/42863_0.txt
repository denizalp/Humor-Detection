The absolute worst service.  We were told 45 min for our order.  An hour and a half layer we call only to be rudely spoken to and hung up on! We finally get our pizza and it's completely wrong and to boot the poor delivery man is mrdd and can't seem to understand so we politely ask him to take it back and call again to which we are again treated rudely and hung up on. If our credit card is not refunded promptly, the bank will be calling this absolute unprofessional \"establishment\" . Horrible.
