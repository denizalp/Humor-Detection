THE CHEF WENT TO THE BATHROOM AND BURNT MY LAMB CHOPS....I have never seen such pathetic lamb chops in my entire life...for 24 dollars, I got 4 tiny chops, 50% of them were burnt...BLACK in color...had to cut off 50% of the meat so that I could eat them.  Hey guys, if you don't want to go out of business, increase your portion size..charge what you want, but at least give us our moneys worth. You only have one chance to impress your customers..if you don't, they won't come back. We paid 10 bucks for a Taj Mahal Beer...the highest price in the United States..have had this beer in many restaurants all over the US....never paid more than 7.00 for a large bottle...the salty lassi was more water than lassi...the prices are ridiculous..i honestly think you guys won't last long...but good luck to you.
