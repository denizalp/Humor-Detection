Dr. Hopkins was the first Family doctor to have a diagnosis to several pretty obscure issues of mine! I think I was 5-6 lol  he & his wonderful Nurse made all the tests and needles a little less scary. He was my family Doctor for yrs. somehow we ended up seperated, I think perhaps when his practice left Sunnybrook?? I ended up having a series of very serious heath problems and losing faith in doctors for several yrs...when i ended up need a family doctor not knowing where to turn I asked friends ....one girlfriend suggested a doc she had had since childhood (wow sounds great right?) Imagine when she told me it was Dr. Hopkins!! lol I was thrilled to find my favorite childhood doc after all those yrs..btw. I am 49 now. He has always made time for me, reasonable in his approach to treatments or test. His Office Manager goes above and beyond.
