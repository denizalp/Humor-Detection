I guess I came on an off day.? Everything looked sooo old.  Everything I browsed was not gently used at all. I wanted to check out the black dresses and they all had a distressed black color.  Oh the shoes were very scuffed and dirty. \n\nMaybe I'll try a different location that someone recommends to me.
