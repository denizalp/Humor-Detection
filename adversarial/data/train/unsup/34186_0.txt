I'm so excited to find a great Thai restaurant near my house with take out and fair prices. I tried this place for the first time today after searching on Yelp for Thai. I ordered the Thai Beef Jerky (Yelpers recommendation), Chicken Pad Thai and Sticky Rice with Mango. Everything was excellent but the only thing I would do differently is order my heat level less than a 3. I don't know if they messed up but I'd hate to see what 10 is if 3 was burning my mouth! I almost ordered a 5 and I'm so glad I was being conservative. I still ate it because it was delicious! I also appreciate that they took my peanut allergy seriously and listened to me when I stressed, no nuts. I can't wait to go back and thank you Yelpers, I would have never tried the beef jerky if not for you and I'm so glad I did.
