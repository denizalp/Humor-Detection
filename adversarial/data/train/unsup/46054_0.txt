Honestly, I can't even begin to find the words to express how wonderful my experience with Chenin Orthodontics has been! I started this process at 20 years old. The rest of my family had just moved away so I live here by myself. Knowing what I was about to endure (2 major surgeries (Dr. Glyman) and a long road of braces ahead) was scary to say the least. The friendly staff and knowledgable doctors made me feel right at home! Being raised in Las Vegas I know how difficult it is to find a business that truly cares. The attention to detail, fine tuning and encouragement of the office is genuine. You are sure to be taken care of in their hands! During my process I would receive phone calls after molds were taken so I would get the latest updates of how close I was to be being ready for surgery. I would get personal post cards after each appointment. I even have some hanging because of how kind the words are! The office is clean and inviting. They usually have children's movies playing and even though I am an adult I enjoyed being able to focus on the subtitles while they pry and tweak away at my mouth! The orthodontic assistants are awesome- I especially loved Ilene. She was so fun that I looked forward to my appointments! The whole office is so interested in your process! It is almost unbelievable how they all remember you considering how many patients they see. My brother had gone to them years prior. He came with me to an appointment once and they even remembered him! I am just a couple weeks shy of my 23rd birthday and finished with my process. My results? Perfection! With a space that is as inviting, friendly and genuine as this office, how could you (or why would you) go anywhere else!?
