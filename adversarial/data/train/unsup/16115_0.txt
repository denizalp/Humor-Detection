Coming from a diehard baseball fanatic family, having visited every 'classic' ballpark with my Dad over the years, I was thrilled to learn that my BIL works for the Diamondbacks, so \"letter section\" tickets are frequently available to us gratis. My PIC, equally a fan, surprised me with a trip to a Dodger game recently. \n\nSince it was during the unforgiving heat of summer\/Monsoon season the roof was closed, I was pleased that it was actually relatively cool inside. Definitely feels like a newer park, though it is nearly 20 years old. Liked seeing local PHX favorites such as LoLo's and Paradise Valley; they also have wraps, a Gluten Free stand, typical ballpark fare, chains (Subway, Panda Express, Cold Stone) and an array of beverage options. We enjoyed waiter service at our seats: I only had Crackerjacks and a Sam Adams, but Scott enjoyed a hot dog, fries, ice cream and popcorn. \n\nThe crowd was really engaged, lots of Dodgers fans represented, and nobody hassled us for sporting Yankee gear. Can't speak to parking fees or difficulties as we stayed at the Hyatt Regency nearby that night. There's literally dozens and dozens of local restaurants and bars in the area, and the Light Rail is close, too. \n\nWe will definitely return: it is great to live in a city with professional sports again! Absolute fans :)\n\n* friendly workers throughout park *\n\n** they do a great job engaging fans **\n\n*** according to flyer: 30 food and beverage options ranging from local favorites to chains and typical ballpark fare ***\n\n**** waiter service available in certain sections **** \n\n***** clean restrooms! *****
