My daughter and I visited their store to get ideas for my granddaughters wedding. Not only did we find exactly what we were looking for but more! What a gold mine of silk flowers, trees, flower arrangements, and more. Prices are very reasonable, store is clean and organized and the couple working there are friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back and highly recommend !
