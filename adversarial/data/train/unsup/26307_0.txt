While I like the Doctor that I was treated by, I was not pleased by the staff.  I take sublingual allergy drops which require a number of special requirements.  I asked to be treated via this method because of my busy travel schedule.  \n\nHowever, it has proved to be NOTHING BUT TROUBLE for me.  I have been asked to provide a consent form each and every time I re-order the drops (AS OPPOSED TO MORE EFFICIENTLY AND CONVENIENTLY ASKING FOR ONE CONSENT FOR ALL FUTURE NEEDS RELATED TO THIS MEDICINE).  I was told by the lab it is a legal requirement to do so.  As a lawyer, I wished to verify the requirement so I asked the lab manager to provide me the reference to the specific legal requirement.  She simply gave me a website (AAAAI.org) and told me I would have to look for it myself.  Well, I have spent two hours of my Sunday afternoon trying to find any such reference.  Many of the site's instructions and forms require a medical office membership.  I have not managed to find any such legal requirement.  \n\nWithout this validation, I will be required to consent before I can refill my prescription.  Or, I will be forced to go to another physician to go thru the testing and validation that I have already done for months with this one.  Or, I will be forced to go without the script (the most plausible option at this point).  \n\nI also tried to find a phone number or email on which I could leave a message indicating my wish to further request information on this so-called legal requirement or otherwise request an audience with the doctor I see to understand my options.  Neither seem to exist.  ANOTHER INCONVENIENCE.  \n\nAt this point, I am inclined to contact the applicable medical board to ensure the \"legal\" requirement is valid or make a complaint that my script is being inappropriately withheld.\n\nI WOULD NOT ADVISE ANYONE GO HERE.
