I rode a mechanical bull for the first time, so there's that - otherwise the music was too loud and I almost lost my voice from trying to have an actual conversation with people. Of course, there was also karaoke, and a group of folks who went on stage and totally nailed Outkast. It was amazing, and I shook it like a Polaroid picture. So yes, a good night, but that was because the place was reserved for us and QDoba was catering. Dancing to karaoke is a whole experience of its own.
