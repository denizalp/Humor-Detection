I came here for lunch on a business meeting and I enjoyed my experience. I agree with some of the reviews that these guys are on the \"gourmet burger bandwagon\" and while my burger was not the greatest I've ever had on my forty years on this planet, I enjoyed it.\n\nThe service was friendly, if a little slow, and the atmosphere nice so even though I don't think I'd make the journey from Central Phoenix up here for a burger, I think everyone could do far worse.
