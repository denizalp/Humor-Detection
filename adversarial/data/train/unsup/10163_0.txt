It literally used to be the Heinz ketchup factory. They were a 4 star, but because they got rid of the hot tub and infinity pool I'm over it!\n The place is a huge maze with paper thin walls and tiny hot water tanks. Parking on the street and in visitor parking is cut throat. It's super easy to get lost in this huge maze trying to find the diff high end amenities(sans pool and hot tub now*whimpers*). \nYes the views and location are great, it's a classy place.
