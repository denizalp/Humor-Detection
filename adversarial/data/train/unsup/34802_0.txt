I was on Adelaide and saw their big bright yellow sign, which caught my attention.  They're located inside the Richmond-Adelaide Centre ground level, beside The Keg.\n\nAfter looking at the reviews, I ordered the caffe mocha and it was amazzzzing!  It was $4.30 for a small, which is more expensive than the other coffee places considering the size.  I would say it's about the same small size as Mio.\n\nThere are plenty of seats outside the store, which makes it really convenient.  The only problem was the couch didnt seem too secure because the couch seat just came off when a guy was getting up.  He ended up slipping and fell on the ground.  Kinda scary..\n\nOther than that, I would come back for more coffee :)
