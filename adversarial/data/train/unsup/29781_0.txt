This was one of the best experiences I've had. Being able to put your bare feet in the grass and have goats running around you while you do yoga is amazing. It really centers you and makes you extremely happy! I would suggest trying this out if you get a chance. The best part was feeding the baby goat and getting to hold them. Your not really doing yoga but rather taking tons of pictures and maybe doing a few yoga poses.
