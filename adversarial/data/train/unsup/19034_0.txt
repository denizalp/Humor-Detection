A little personal for me, speaking of annuals & breast exams as a woman, but woman-to-woman understanding your body & who is examing it is very important.  \n\nI was alittle sketchy pulling into the parking lot, but my parents were w\/ me & they googled him lol.  After being buzzed in, I felt safe & soothed by the large beautiful aquarium & HGTV on TV in the lobby.  The facility was very clean & all of the doctor's certifications were on the wall.  I've never had a male OBGYN so was nervous.  My original female Dr. became the medical director & is no longer practicing so that's what lead to my OBGYN hunt for a new doctor.  Not an easy one.\n\nThe new patient paperwork was straight to the point, I paid & not long after I was called back.  The patient room was a bit old, but clean & they had a pretty cool island scenery lit up behind a light panel on the ceiling to relax you as you lay down, along w\/ a crib mobile type of thing.  \n\nThree positives about this office:\n+Uninsured patients $150 for your annual & the Doctor teaches you how to do a self-breast exam if you don't know how to. I thought I did.\n+Immediate appointments.  As I searched for the right Dr., all priced about the same, they couldn't get me in until next month or even later.\n+Dr. Kernes was so thorough & made me feel comfortable.\n+Add four positives to the wonderful staff.  The receptionist, woman over the phone who I scheduled the appointment w\/ & all of the nurses were super friendly & helpful.  I will be back for my next annual to this doctor.  I highly recommend Dr. Kernes.\n+Ok so add one more positive, I went to pick up my birth control which was $121!  The Dr. recommended an app called GoodRx & I got 3 of them for $48!  Thanks Doc!
