I will start by saying I drive over an hour to get to this shop.  The building is older but shop is clean and organized.  The owner Frank is honest.  His prices are very fair.  I have never been upsold.   Recently I went to the dealer to look at my vehicle.  My estimate was over $1,200.  My final bill at Cool Cat was $485. Frank told me that many of the items on the dealer list was not needed.  They even changed my oil for me with no charge. \nThe drive for me is worth the honesty.
