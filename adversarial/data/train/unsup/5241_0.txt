After having dinner at rincon de buenos aires my buddy had noticed that the rest of this plaza was fairly dead. Being the curious guy that he is, he spotted Mr. Z Tea Co and was saying how this could be a secret gem, a mecca of boba deliciousness. To me, Mr. Z sounds like a weird name for a boba place. Like Mr. Z computer repair or Mr. Z kids store sound more appropriate but lets see how it is. \n\nSetting: Already stated pretty dead plaza minus rincon, the store itself still smells like construction with ok seating but not really for hanging around at. Business seems very slow since when we walked in, the employees went to the back and turned the thermostat on lol (must be the owner's kids). I don't like that the garbage can's have lids that you have to pick up to throw away your boba, more work, makes my hands dirty. \n\nDrinks: The employee wasn't sure of a lot of the drinks and just said \"oh yeah thats good, oh that's good, yes that is very good\" I know it's a business but as a picky consumer i like honesty. My friend got the chocolate milk which was just powdered chocolate and coconut milk, pretty disappointing. I got the amazon which was passion fruit plus a kiwi syrup swirl and shredded boba. This was quite refreshing and the idea of shredded boba is an awesome idea. More boba places should think about having shredded boba as an option since people like myself hate having to anticipate the whole boba and then chewing chewing on it...\n\nOverall: I'm not sure about the future of this place... It's really quite dead and to travel this deep into chinatown for boba when you already pass so many other ones. It's tough to say if Mr. Z will survive.
