I'm a fan.\n\nGot gas at a decent price, I was practically the only one filling up.\n\nWent in because I was paying cash, and the young man behind the register was nice.\n\nProbably one of the nicest people I've ever encountered at a gas station.\n\nHe asked me how I was, instead of just grabbing money out of my hand.\n\nI Likey!
