They seem to have a lot of food items, but I'm only reviewing drinks.\n\nMy friends invited me here, so I somewhat woefully detoured from my intended dessert. I'd been meaning to start trying the teas instead of the smoothies at the boba shops of Las Vegas, and I figured this would be as good a place as any.\n\nFresh Cup is a standalone structure in front of 168 Market and across the street from China Mama. They have decent seating, and it wasn't too crowded at our off-peak visit in spite of the summer heat. They also play a lot of Korean pop music and have posters of various girl groups all over the walls.\n\nOther than the non-Asian smoothies and the specialty smoothies, the drinks (flavored teas, milk teas, jelly juices, smoothies) are cheap. The medium is currently $2.77 and the large is $3.15. Apparently, these drinks are all cold\/iced since \"hot\" is a 50 cent extra, as are boba and many other add-ons. Puddings and some other toppings are 70 cents.\n\nI had passion fruit green tea. I also unwittingly sampled my friend's taro milk tea, which was strongly (but not cloyingly) sweet, making it a candidate for future ordering but with the \"less sugar\" option. They have a \"no sugar\" option too (ugh, why?) and also less ice (ooh) or no ice, but I'm not sure if the cup will look as full without the ice.\n\nSo the sweet taro ended up throwing off my palate for the rest of my passion fruit green tea experience. Meh. From my first sip of my own drink, it seemed balanced with a little sweetness and non-overpowering green tea. The boba didn't seem quite as tasty as I've had before, but the chewiness was fine. Not the best rendition of this drink ever, but it'll work if I somehow don't find a better spot.\n\nThey have the typical buy 10 get 1 free stamp card. When I asked, an employee responded to me that they don't use all fresh fruit in their smoothies, so I'll probably stick to No. 1 Boba Tea if I'm in that kind of mood. However, I wouldn't mind giving them a few more visits when convenient.
