I have to admit, Main Street Casino Brewing Hotel surprised me. When I think of properties in the Downtown area of Las Vegas, old, dingy, smoky comes to mind. Did I mention old? \n\nWell, Main Street is situated in the Downtown area and it's an older property. But during the holidays, for a family member's birthday, I wandered in and was pleasantly surprised. I didn't find Main Street to be as bad that I had thought it would be. I actually like the place.\n\nIt's away from craziness of the strip and if you know the area, away from the traffic. It wasn't a foggy haze as I walked through the property and it wasn't so busy that I had to prepare myself for elbow checks if someone didn't make way for me. \n\nThe employees were friendly and helpful. It wasn't so big that you could get lost and wander around aimlessly forever. And the buffet, the reason for my being there (for my cousin's birthday), wasn't too bad at all. There's also the Triple 7 which I guess is their adult beverage watering hole and there's of course, all the gaming. \n\nMain Street is an okay place and I'm sure I'll be back because I've heard that more and more people from Hawaii, including my family, are staying there now. Gotta see and be with family when they're in town and I'm around.
