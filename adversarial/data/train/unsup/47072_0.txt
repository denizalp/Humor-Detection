Groupon junkie...\n\nRead the reviews to expect and clarify: the 'bad service' really comes from the seating hostesses, to confirm they do have that I-hate-my-life look on their faces, but I personally don't care since they won't have anything to do with my visit after I'm seated. I did go at 2 in the morning so I don't expect fully-rested associates. Our server Shae (spelling?) was awesome! A little slow but very informative. There is a HUGE difference on that Mac n Cheese. It is served as an appetizer, but is also offered as an entree. The $17 Mac n Cheese is prepped with different pasta, different ingredients, different portion. I shared the appetizer, yummy! Boyfriend got steak and I got the jambalaya (it's spicy, and the name warns you!). We also shared the lollipop goblet, you're paying for the effect and the fact that it's portioned for 2 people. Overall it was as great as it can get, and our server didn't mind us cashing in on our Groupon (saved us $25).
