I came here for a replacement automotive M14 metric bolt. The associate in the nuts and bolts section was currently busy assisting another customer, so I asked him to call someone to assist me. After 15 minutes of waiting I saw the same associate walk down the aisle I was in. When he saw me he turned around and walked away. When I finally did get someone's attention I was told there was no comparable replacement in stock. He didn't even try to size the bolt he just looked at it and said no. I left and went to another ace hardware on McDonald in mesa, and got exactly what I needed with no hassle.
