Madison Magazine got me again!  After a spread on the 13 best pancakes in Madison I had no choice but to accept the mission before me.  Our first stop?  Marigold Kitchen!  I have had this place bookmarked for a while and was happy to finally get the chance to visit it.  There was tons of parking and the location was easy to find, well after the GPS got involved. \n\nUpon entering the restaurant I noticed that there was what they called 'seating etiquette' which basically said, order with the cashier  then you'll be guided to your seat.  Though this place was jam packed we were able to order right away and did not have to wait to find a seat.  I ordered the blueberry and apricot pancake with bacon as that was the item featured.  Well let me tell you, this place sure did not disappoint.\n\nThe pancakes do not look like much just 3 smallish\/medium pancakes with a few blueberries on top and a slice of almond butter. Man!  Those pancakes were pretty incredible!  They were really light and just freaking good.  I also ordered the bacon which was good as well, not as standout as the pancake but still good.\n\nI am really looking forward to coming back to this place.  The layout is a bit crammed but in a really cute way.  They also have an awesome menu, I already know what I'm going to try when I go back.  If you haven't been to this place, do yourself a favor and go!  You won't be disappointed.
