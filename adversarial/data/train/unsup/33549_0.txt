I brought my 65 lb. Standard Poodle in to do the self serve wash.  The tubs are hydraulic and can be raised and were so much easier on my back than doing it at home!  The sprayers made it so convenient and they supplied the shampoo, conditioner, face wash, ear cleaner, towels, and force air dryer.  All for $14.  The staff was incredibly helpful and nice!  We will definitely be back!
