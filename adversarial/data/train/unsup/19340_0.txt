Probably the worst of all Walmart locations not located in an hispanic neighborhood. There are rude, inconsiderate low wage employees that are very unhelpful. One of them is a guy named Wyatt, a balding paunchy man, with no people skills who somehow is an assistant manager (not saying much at Walmart). Other employees will harass you if you look suspicious (even if you are white) and avoid an employee named Rudy at all costs, who looks like he belongs in jail, not Walmart. They should redesign the whole walmart and knock it down and start over as this location is just a dump.
