Seriously, people? Maybe if your only comparisons are McDonald's and Burger King, you might think Freddy's is in a league of its own. But if you've actually eaten at some of the far superior fast food chains like In-N-Out or The Habit Burger Grill, you'll probably be disappointed with what they offer here.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have eaten at Freddy's several times over the years. Each time, our opinion drops considerably.\n\nFirst of all, if you're going to get a steakburger, ordering a single patty just isn't logical. You must order a double. The reason, is because they smash their patties so flat that the meat is void of any juice or flavor. It's just an ultra-thin slice of what I'm assuming was actual meat at one point.  \n\nThe French fries, with the addition of their sauce, are admittedly not too bad. However, they are very thin, which is very similar to what you'll get at the similar Steak 'n Shake chain that is more commonly found in the Midwest.  \n\nTheir frozen custard is a complete disgrace. I've ordered turtle sundaes on two occasions. Both times, the custard was so runny and milky that I would have been better off drinking it with a straw. If you've ever been to Culver's, you'll know that frozen custard is supposed to be creamy and dare I say, not much different than traditional ice cream.\n\nPrices are too high for what they're giving you. Strangely enough, they seem to have quite a few fans, as the place was jam packed with the post-church crowd on a Sunday afternoon to the point where I was somewhat disturbed. Clearly they see something that I don't.\n\nTrust me. If you want a fast food level burger, there are far, far better options available in this city. That is, if you're willing to venture outside of the bubble that is Bell Road.  \n\nNot recommended.
