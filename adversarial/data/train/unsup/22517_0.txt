The show overall for me was mediocre.  I got seats in the mezzanine upstairs.  They do a lot of close up magic, which it makes it nearly possible to enjoy and it's hard to see.  I paid about $65.00 for my ticket, but have left feeling ripped off.  Some of the tricks are really good and mind boggling, but the most annoying part of the show is the constant non-stop commentary from Penn.  After about 15 minutes I was thinking to myself dude STFU and perform the trick already!  I did like the bullet trick and the ball trick.  Everything else I have seen before and was sadly just not impressed.  I have seen way better magic, but at least it was better than Chris Angel (anyone is better than that fool), which is why I gave three stars.
