Shhhh. Stop telling people how good this place is.\nTop quality cuts of meat cheaper than the supermarket?\nShouldn't that be a secret we want to keep to ourselves??\n\nGreat source of meat. If there is a specialty cut you are looking for, let them know. I was able to buy skin on pork belly here that I was unable to buy in town ... because very few places actually butcher the whole animal. If the ratings could go to 6 I would give them an extra star just for being able to fill a non standard order request like that.
