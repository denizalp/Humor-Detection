Excellent service. I've been here for dinner and also Sunday brunch (which comes with bottomless rose). \n\nSalmon tartine (4\/5): I didn't like the cream cheese at the bottom. too heavy\n\nChocolate macaron (3.5\/5): The chocolate sauce is over the top. This dessert can feed 2-3 people. \n\nFrench onion soup (4\/5): Very flavorful.\n\nCroque Madame (4.5\/5): The croque madame comes with a creamy white sauce on the top which I didn't care for. Otherwise, it was delicious!
