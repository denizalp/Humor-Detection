Worst experience ever! Never ever coming back to Mandalay Bay!!!! \nI asked for a non smoking room and as soon as we get in the room, I smell smoke everywhere!!! Stupid front desk lady gave us a smoking room.  I called the front desk to complain and got switched to a different room in the non smoking floor.  As soon as I enter the room, the room is DIRTY! Used bar soaps, used towels on the floor, used wine glasses, etc.  I've been to Vegas many many times but this is by far the worst experience in Vegas.
