My first experience here was an ok one.  It was on a day when there was a live jazz band playing, which were phenomenal.  Since moving to the area Carly's Bistro has become one of my local favorites.  I find myself coming back time and again for lunch or dinner.  \n\nI love this place so much because even though it has more of a bar feel than a restaurant they have some amazing food.  The place itself is a bit small but that is part of its charm.  The smallness of it gives the place a cozy feel. He wait staff recognizes their regular patrons and are just as friendly to new comers. \n\nThe menu is limited to mainly appetizers, salads and sandwiches.  Thus far I haven't tried one item that I haven't liked.   My favorite appetizer is the feta rosa The combination of feta cheese and red peppers into a humus style dip is a tantalizing tasty experience everyone should have at least once.  Served with warm flat bread slices, I find a lot of times that I have this alone for dinner.  My favorite sandwich thus far has been the turkey melt. Not your average sandwich.  Served with turkey, Swiss, avocado, and red peppers served panini style.  Sometimes I think there are a few too many slices of meat on the sandwich but the veggies add a perfect compliment to this sandwich. This place is refreshing in that they do not offer the traditional fries with your sandwich but rather offer chips, salad, or orzo. My favorite hands down is the orzo. \n\nIf your ever downtown and looking for a chill quieter place to have a couple of drinks or a small meal I highly recommend checking out Carly's.
