I stopped by last Friday for a quick lunch. It was very crowded but I found a table in the bar. The server brought a menu fairly soon and I ordered before she walked away. She brought my drink and salad quickly. But then it took 25 minutes for the two slices of pizza to come (at least 15 min after a person who arrived after me got his-I really don't like that.)\n\nThe salad came in a small clamshell container - your basic pre washed salad mix. The pizza slices (one veg and one cheese) had obviously sat for some time. The server was over extended and was having trouble multi tasking. I felt pretty invisible for a time.
