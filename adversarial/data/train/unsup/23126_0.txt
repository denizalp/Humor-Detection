I love meat.\n\nIf you know me at all, you know this to be true.  When I moved to Leslieville (or Riverside, depending on where you draw your lines) I went to Rowe Farms a few times but always left with a much lighter pocketbook and a bad taste in my mouth.  Enter George, of Meat-ing on Queen.\n\nThe good:\n1. George makes 24 kinds of sausages in house.  The best is the (mild or hot) Ecuadorian, which involves green peppers, onions, garlic and coriander.  There are some lighter ones too, like turkey blueberry.\n2. He has great prices.  I bought big, beautiful, butterflied pork chops from him for $4.99\/lb after rejecting Loblaw's pathetic offerings at $7.99\/lb. (see: http:\/\/twitpic.com\/gufaw)\n3. He has everything you need for dinner - sausage buns, a small but really nice produce section, desserts (from Dufflets!), slaws and salads\n4. Super friendly staff, they always recognize me and say hey\n\nThe bad:\n1. There are no small cuts of meat here.  I bought two of the smallest steaks he had once, and they were both as big as my face.\n2.  I wish he had deli meats, but honestly he doesn't have room to add another counter.\n\nThe weird-and-AWESOME:\nOnce they were BBQing outside and selling sausages and hamburgers, and I asked them if they's BBQ me up some ribs and they were like, hell yeah! and they did.\n\nWould I go back here again?\nIn fact I walked over here yesterday.
