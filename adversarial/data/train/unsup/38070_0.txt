This place was a MESS. Walked in and waited 15 minutes for my order to be taken (there was only 2 people ahead of me). Apparently they were having system issues and their computers were down so they were writing down orders and telling  the customers the bill would be brought to the tables. I ordered the original burger and a side of skinny and a side of fat fries. The food was brought to my table pretty fast. The burger was okay the fries were also okay. After the check was brought over to my table I got up and went to the register to pay and the manager standing there tells me to wait for the cashier because she's in the bathroom. So I wait. 10 minutes pass and I'm still waiting and he's still standing there trying to reboot the computers. 15 minutes pass and I'm still standing there without acknowledgement as 3 more employees are trying to reboot the computers. At 25 minutes the manager says: \"so are you paying cash?\" And I say \"YES\" and he says \"Ohhhh\" . So you're telling me I waited 25 long minutes standing up waiting for your system to work when allll along I could have payed cash? The least the manager could of done was apologized for wasting 25 minutes of my time but that wasn't done nor any sort of discount was applied. Talk about horrible business. Fat Burger is a Never Burger for me!
