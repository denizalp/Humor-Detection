Firstly, I'd like to say that when I first entered the salon I felt like I didn't belong there but all the staff had greeted me very kindly and offered me a drink which made me feel very relieved. I was quite nervous because I didn't know anything about dying my hair or any of the terms for it but Olivia was very understanding and patient when I had bombarded her with questions and concerns.\n\nObviously, my hair was virgin and a few minutes into bleaching my hair, I had a chemical reaction and I was told that it was cause I had used drug store shampoo and conditioner. Any one in the salon can tell you how messy it was and how it looked like a volcano had erupted and to be honest it felt like it was a miracle I was able to get my goal hair in one session but I knew I was in good hands. Olivia, with the help of April, quickly worked together and handled the situation with ease. Overall I'm very pleased with how my hair turned out and it was definitely on point with my goal hair I had asked for. These girls are so talented and will work to their full potential to get your goal hair. \nIt was worth every penny I spent.
