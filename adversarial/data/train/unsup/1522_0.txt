Came in here for Saturday night dinner.\n\nLocated just on W Indian School Road (in Avondale), just off Litchfield Road.  Lots of available parking and not difficult to miss with good signage.\n\nThe restaurant was very clean including all tables, with good lighting, and little on the noise level.  The inside is a bit on the small side (-1) but not a huge deal. \n\nStaff were welcoming and friendly.  Very quick and attentive to take either your drink or food orders.  Wait times for the food was minimal and acceptable.  Very helpful with any questions we had. \n\nFood portion sizes were great and more than adequate for even one person.\nFood was very tasty, fresh, and had lots of flavorful ingredients. \n\nI ordered the ginger chicken entree that came with a side of rice (white steamed).  The rice was piping hot and sticky and was a perfect complement to the dish. \nThe ginger chicken dish was filled with lots of chicken and fresh vegetables and not too overpowered taste of ginger. \n\nThe menu is not that overwhelming and was very easy to comprehend. \n\nWill definitely return as we thoroughly enjoyed the Thai food, the service, the atmosphere, and the location!\n\nWould recommend!
