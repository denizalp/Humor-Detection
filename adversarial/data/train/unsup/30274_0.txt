The venue itself, the Arena was great for concerts. The food\/snack bar was pricey although expected. What was not expected was poor quality of the food. I ordered a $7 hot dog of which wasn't available\nSo I settled on a $6 pretzel and a $5 twenty ounce Dasani water. The pretzel was pretty much inedible it was so dry. My daughter got the $7 nachos and a $4 Coke. The chips were stale and not only was the mystery cheese cold but there certainly wasn't enough of it for all the chips. You'd think by now they would have all the glitches out. It seems they are spending their money on operations and the food is just something to soak up a $13 beer. Seriously any mall in town has way better food than this place. Best advice: EAT BEFORE YOU GO.
