All I can say is wow. Somebody knows what they are doing in this kitchen. But even before that, we had trouble finding parking so we called and one of the owners stayed on the phone and guided us in all the way to the front door. Talk about service!  Friendly, laid back but attentive staff. But the food...  take some traditional Asian and local ingredients, add some serious genius, a helping of creative inspiration, and a dash of extra love and you've got Futo Bota!  I would make the trip to Charlotte again just to come here. Simply amazing.
