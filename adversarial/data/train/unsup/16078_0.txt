Someone brought me a pretty damn strong half-hoagie from PaGE this evening. The meat was sufficient, the veggies were fresh,  the bread tasted to be newly baked, the house dressing possessed snap, and it was nine inches long! A whole hoagie is 18! \n\nPaGE also offers fried chicken, sliced-from-the-spit gyros, pulled pork, meatloaf, wedgies, shrimp scampi (!), onion petals (hell yes!), whole wings (with drumette and flat intact), and a 24-cut Goliath pie! We're dealing with a pizza joint that differs a little bit from the norm. \n\nNow I have another excuse to visit my sister in McKeesport.
