We came in around 1 this afternoon, I tried calling them while walking around to see if they had the flavor I wanted--they didn't answer, so I assumed it was closed. Anyways, we walked in and it was pretty busy. I kind of felt like I was pressured to order even though I was still looking at what they had and the flavors they offered. There wasn't really a true line, so I was like ok, umm, I'll take the strawberry and cream. They should post the daily menu or something on a large board somewhere so everyone can see what's there.\n\nThe gelatos were good, we had 3 scoops for 3 people and it came out to like $11? That's actually cheaper than I thought it would be. The scoops were fair. There was only one regular table in the place, and like 3 large couches with tables in the center. \n\nHonestly, upon reading reviews I was expecting a little bit more. But, I think I'll stick to Art of flavors for gelato.
