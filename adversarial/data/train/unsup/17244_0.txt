Second time trying such a restaurant and if it was not for the crowd and the service I would have left feeling rather disappointed.\n\nThe set menu we tried was the Japanese version of tapas dishes but smaller and more variety but still meant a stomach which was not at full capacity at the end.\n\nI had absolutely no clue what I was eating so I am looking at the reviews below to name the ones that I liked. \n\nThe Beef Tataki, the Nigitoro and the Halibut were really nice, so much so I made many futile attempts to steal them off Jen K's plate. \n\nThe layout, the feel of the restaurant and the service were great. Waitresses were attentive and hot and they managed to remember everyone's drinks orders. \n\nMe and Brian went for some sake bombs which were pretty pricey considering its a shot of weak sake with little amount of beer. How about some sake bomb offers?\nThe beer on tap was good, always a fan of any place that serves Sapora \n\nThe little things:\n\n- televisions around the place make it lose its authenticity because they are showing poker and sports? Cheesy samurai movies or anime would be better or even some Japanese music but not sports please.\n\n- the men's wash room has only one but also biggest urinal I have seen it looks silly and results in too much splash back, please get rid and put something normal in there.\n\n- some sort of bench seating outside which means people sitting around smoking giving it that pub look from the outside.\n\nThis place gets a Samurai Chukanbushi ranking from me.
