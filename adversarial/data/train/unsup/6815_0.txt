Great idea, but not worth it. \nI was excited when I found out they were opening up a Magnolia Ice Cream shop with all the yummy Magnolia flavors. Finally got the chance to come in today and it's a cute tiny shop inside Seafood City. I'm giving the place 3 stars because it was nicely decorated and clean, plus the workers were really nice too! I knocked 2 stars out because prices were waaaay too high! For one scoop it's $2.49... One scoop!! Plus, we ordered the Halo-Halo and tbh id rather just get it from Chow King or Jolibee. Here, they use snow shaved ice rather than the regular crushed shaved ice, which makes it really hard to mix around. Also, the topping to ice cream ratio was off. The texture just so different than what I'm used to. The only thing that was good to me what the ube ice cream. \n\nI would recommend people to just go into Seafood City and buy an actual tub of Magnolia ice cream for practically the same price as a single scoop!
