Conveniently located, at least for me. But that is where the positives end. The store has definitely initiated some cost cutting measures. They eliminated self check out and there are never more than two or three open registers. They have re-merchandised at least half a dozen times in the past year, expanding medical and cold supplies and shrinking premium grocery items. They added a few dilapidated shelves near \"express\" checkout with odd items like carton-sized gold fish cracker boxes and adult diapers. It has more of a Walmart feel to it now and even the in store Starbucks has picked up stakes. It is my friendly neighborhood grocery no more.  I'll be shopping elsewhere.
