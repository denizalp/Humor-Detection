There aren't any standout BBQ options in Calgary, but this was good, honest food. Had the chicken and ribs, and the chicken was actually better than the ribs. Dab a bunch of different sauces on your tray and try them all.\n\nYes, most of the sauces are vinegar-based. You won't get that Memphis-style sweet taste if that's what you're looking for.\n\nThe rootbeer shake was really good, but a little overpriced for what you get.
