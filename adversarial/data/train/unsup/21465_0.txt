I have a love-hate relationship with The Forum Shops at Caesars.\n\nI love this place because of the architecture and the theming. I'm a sucker for theming. I also love this place because there are plenty of stores I can afford.\nAlso, certain stores like H&M, Sephora, Tiffany & Co, MAC cosmetics (this is a pro store for all you MAC fanatics) and Victoria Secrets are \"Vegas-out\". Meaning these can be the flagship, larger than typical stores and is usually fully stocked with merchandise.\n\nNow...I hate this place because there are plenty of stores I cannot afford. -__- Or if I DO decide to shop in these $$$$$$$ stores, there goes my paychecks and it will drain my bank account in 5 seconds. \nI've told myself if I ever won the lotto or if a $50 bill is equivalent to a $1 for me, I would totally blow all that cash here!! Imagine the possibilities....ahh, a girl can dream...
