YAY SCIENCE!\n\nI'm really a kid in an adults body. Anything interactive and science-y will get my attention. Including those science-based subscription boxes for kids - those look so cool!\n\nSo when I was perusing cool museums to check out with the boyfriend the Arizona Science Center was right up my alley. \n\nUnfortunately, the day we planned our excursion happened to be free museum day. As our Uber dropped us off we say a line that extended from the door out halfway across the city block. I should note that it was something like 110* outside that day with 90% in direct sun. \n\nBig NOPE. \n\nWe came back the next day when schools was back in session and there was no line. Yay! We were able to walk right in and check out most all the exhibits without a wait.\n\nThe Science Center was cool, and took about 3-4 hours for us to check out most everything. Some of the exhibits were a little worn and needed some repair. One or two were entirely broken. You could tell some of the exhibits had been around for quite a long time. It definitely needed an update. \n\nWe didn't get a chance to check out some of the additional extra attractions, but I'm sure that's what most people check out anyways.
