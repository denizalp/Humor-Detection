I have often wondered why so many retailers do not properly train their retail staff on human dynamics.  They teach them how to fold shirts and sweaters, how to clean up displays and how to cash out purchases but give them zero direction in dealing with John Q. Public.  At the best of times I hate chain retail stores especially ones that consider themselves a step up the ladder from their counterparts.  Banana Republic would fit into this category.  \n\nA few times a year I wander into the BR looking for some office wear, primarily slacks.  I'm often baffled by all the different name fits they put on the pants so yesterday I asked one of the sales clerks about the fit and the rise.  Her response to me was \"well...big people like you usually wear.....\"  I looked at her and said \"big people like me?\"  Holy crappy doodles....I wear a size 12.  How big is that?  I blinked.  I gave her a good look and realized that I was being served by a young 21 year old chick who looked like an emaciated version of Paris Hilton, a human bamboo pole.  \n\nA few minutes later as I was rifling through another rack I am approached by literally a clone of the previous sales clerk I had just spoken to.  She asked me if I needed any help and I said \"well, yes, actually I have a question for you.....if you are a size zero....are you really here?\"  She blinked several times, kind of rolling her eyes up in to her head as to actually ponder my question, obviously completely oblivious to my sarcasm.   \n\nI never did get a pair of pants.  They had six pairs of size 0 or 2 but none of size 12.  Guess I'm just one of the big people.
