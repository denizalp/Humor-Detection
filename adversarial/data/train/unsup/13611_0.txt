The services were fantastic. I got a gel manicure and a regular pedicure with Salina. She was sweet, professional, and extremely thorough. I am beyond thrilled with my nails. I'll post pictures of the masterpiece that is my manicure. \n\nWhat I didn't like... Being MADE to write a review for checking in and using the discount. After they rang up my bill and I signed my copy, Peter insisted on seeing my phone to prove that I wrote a review to get the discount. Nowhere on the check in discount does it say I HAVE to write a review to get a discount. I told him I was on my way to dinner and I would write one later. Then he insisted on getting my name to make sure I wrote one. Even telling Salina, 'make sure you write down 10% next to her name so I can check it later!' The upsetting part, he said it in front of the whole shop. That embarrassed me. And all for $7. \n\nWell, here it is. I'm taking a star away just for that. Pretty unprofessional to force a review and then check up on me like I'm a liar who wouldn't write a review when, just to reiterate, yelp reviews are not mandatory. I've been yelping for 7 years and have never been forced to review a business for a discount. \n\nYes, I wrote the review anyway because I don't know if they're going to try to come after me for the $7 I was discounted for checking in. Who knows what kind of mess that would turn out to be. In the end, I was going to write one anyway because I loved Salina's work.
