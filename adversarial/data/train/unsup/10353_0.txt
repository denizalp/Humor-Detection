The food is amazing this we already know and it never disappoints.   The service last night was once again was amazing, not only was our server on top of his game, everyone was acting as a team helping each other out.\n\nOur glasses were never empty or at least not long enough to really notice.  The manager is very visible in the room as well talking to many of the tables to make sure the experience is a good one.\n\nThis is the second time we have been in at night, the place was very crowded and like I said, the staff were all over and helping each other out and making sure all guests were happy.  The kitchen staff is amazing as the food comes out pretty quick.  For most foods to basically be made to order with some exceptions obviously to be put out at the speed they do, with the presentation, the quality and the quantity, El Dorado Cantina is running like an amazing business should be ran.\n\nI said it before, KUDDOS to the manager, he is doing an GREAT job.  I HIGHLY recommend this place.
