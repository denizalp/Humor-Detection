The food choices here are great. I tried the teriyaki chicken bowl and you can tell the quality of food it had. I came back a week later and had the Ninja Bowl that I was waiting to try. I wasn't disappointed at all and it was better than I thought. I had it with bacon on top and the combination is fabulous. \n\nFriendly staff and a must place to eat at if you want different from the same boring stuff. Favorite small place to eat here in Phoenix as I just moved here. \n\nPeace :)
