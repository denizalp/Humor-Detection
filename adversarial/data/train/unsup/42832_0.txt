There once was a great idea that two very real people came up with. Best part is, they acted on this idea and we all get to enjoy the benefit. This place is a gem, a gift to uptown. Pastry and coffee  selection is delicious and drink selection\/creation is unspeakable!! This isn't your average hangout. It's above - way above average. Stop in whenever you get the chance. You won't be sorry - at all!
