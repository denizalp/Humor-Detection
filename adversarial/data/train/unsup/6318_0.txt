The ribeye steak was amazing. The bake potato was a little undercooked. I couldn't take it back because I ordered while watching for the fireworks. The bartenders are great... Made the night fun once I was able to get there ATTENTION that I was sitting waiting for 5 to 10 mins just to order a drink.
