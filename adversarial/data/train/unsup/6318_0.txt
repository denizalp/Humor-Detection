Located off of Rainbow and 215, Soyo always leaves me feeling satisfied with my meal. \n\nAmbience 5\/5 -- the atmosphere of the place is extremely comforting. The overall interior design of the place as well as the atmosphere makes this a good place for my friends and I to casually go. I love the lights :) after 11pm the music gets a little louder and seems to be more of a bar than a restaurant which is cool too. \n\nFood 5\/5 -- I am a fan of Korean cuisine and have tried many of the dishes as Soyo. I love them all! They are all well-cooked and delicious. My favorite dish is the L.A. gaalbi. I recommend this dish for first-time Korean food eaters as this is a very safe yet delicious choice if you have not tried any of the more unique dishes. \n\nI also ordered the cheese corn for the first time last visit. A must if you're a fan of both corn and mozzarella cheese. When they brought it out, the presentation reminded me of a pizza and I wasn't sure what to expect but it was surprisingly pleasing.\n\nThe side dishes are also always yummy... Love the radishes & potatoes when they're available. They switch it around every time I visit. \n\nI love the barley tea they start you out with -- it is very refreshing. I think it's very cute how how they give you bowl-like cups to drink it out of. Our server recommended us Hite for the beer and that was also a very light yet refreshing alcoholic beverage that  went hand in hand with our dishes. \n\nService 5\/5 -- I have nothing to complain about in terms of service. They're very quick to change the small side dishes to new ones as well as refilling the tea. Awesome job on staying top of this!\n\nOverall, my go-to local Korean joint!
