Tacos and tequila go hand-in-hand like peanut butter and jelly!\n\nIf you don't like tacos, I'm nacho type.\n\nAfter such an indulgent weekend full of rich and heavy food, I really wanted a salad but the salads at T&T are gigantic so getting that for just myself made no sense.  Instead, I ordered a Tortilla Soup and Street Corn.  The Tortilla Soup hit the spot.  The chile guajillo-tomato broth was truly satisfying. I didn't even need the generous amount of shredded chicken in it.  Just give me a generous dollop of cr√©me fresca and a shower of cilantro and I'll be happy.  The avocado and panela cheese made for interesting texture and the tortilla strips stayed crispy for the most part.  As for the Street Corn, it was a miss for me.  I was expecting the stuff we get out here in Phoenix but what I got was more reminiscent to a corn chowder.  Eeks!  Also to be tasted was the #4 combo with had a chicken enchilada, carne asada taco, and a shrimp quesadilla.  For a place that has tacos in their business name, their tacos were a letdown.  \n\nT&T is located on the second level of Luxor, right off the escalators by the front desk.  It's brightly lit with ample seating.  While I enjoyed the soup, I wouldn't be going out of my way for this place.  The price-point for Americanized-Mexican food just ain't cutting it.  You can get better eats elsewhere!
