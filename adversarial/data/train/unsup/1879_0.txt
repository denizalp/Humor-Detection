National was the chosen spot last Saturday for some birthday shenanigans. Thank goodness we got here by 8pm because there was already a lineup forming at the door! Craziness!!\n\nWe found a spot at the benches and squeezed 6 of us into a 4-person spot and reassured the troubled-looking waiter that \"we'll be fiiiine!\". Cozy is good, right? But soon our group grew and the group at the table next to us left, so we gradually expanded and took over both spots. This was probably a good thing because most of the people in my party were partaking in some kind of unofficial alcohol olympics, and would very likely scare off innocent leisure-drinkers if they found themselves in our proximity. \n\nI liked the menu! The food list was big and varied, and looked delicious. The beer list was even bigger! Too bad I was the DD for that evening or I would have tried several of them! \n\nThe place is modern, fresh and energetic, yet still keeping the 'beer hall' feel. Absolutely loved the huge windows and slim white brick walls with slim chalkboards with beers listed on them. NICE work on the decor! The patio is also huge! It wraps all the way around 17th ave and 5th St! \n\nThe service was decent, nothing to complain about! \n\nNational is all in all a fun place. I would go back and try more of their beers. And split the 'Deep fried Mars bar' with said birthday boy because although I promised that to him at the beginning of our meal, it was all quickly lost in a frenzy of Steamwhistle, He'Brew, St Ambroise, Jamesons, Jaeger and pickle juice.
