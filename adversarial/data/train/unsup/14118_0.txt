Save yourself the trouble and find yourself another OB. \n\nI found Dr. Goodhead through my insurance's website and she had a decent rating, so why not give her a try?  The only good thing about her clinic is that you can schedule later appointments if you are busy during the week.  But after going to her for the first trimester, I decided to switch out of her care for many reasons:\n\n- Appointment times mean nothing.  Schedule it at a certain time and you won't be seen til at least 30 minutes after your scheduled time.  It was a recurring theme at EVERY appointment.\n- When you do finally get seen, the appointment is about 5-10 minutes long.  \"I waited an hour for this??\" She doesn't ask questions so she doesn't have to spend time with you.  All she does is check the baby's heart beat and says you are good to go. \n- Dr. Goodhead is not very pleasant to talk to.  My first visit, she didn't care to explain anything.  I asked her questions on what is\/isn't okay to do and eat during pregnancy and all she did was hand me a couple of handouts and told me to read it.  No explanation, no congratulations, nothing.  The only thing she asked was if the father was going to be a part of the pregnancy and moseyed on her way. \n- I had to ask her if she can prescribe me prenatal vitamins.  If you don't ask, she really doesn't do anything.  She prescribes these $50 vitamins and when I asked for a generic prescription, she had the audacity to ask why is $50 too much? As a pharmacist intern, I know that there is NO DIFFERENCE between getting brand vs generic, so why spend that much money on a month's supply of vitamins when you can get generic for free? She laughed a bit and said she would send a script since I insisted. \n\nI wish I had read the reviews for her on Yelp. I would've done things differently.  Go somewhere else!
