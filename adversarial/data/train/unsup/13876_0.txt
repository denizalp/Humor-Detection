my butter chicken flatbread tasted like tiny chunks of cold chicken in ketchup on toast. my \"large green salad\" was about the size of a tennis ball. seriously I got a LARGE SIDE SALAD and they served it to me on a massive plate when the salad only took up about 1\/20th of the space. hopefully nobody drags me to this poorly named restaurant ever again.
