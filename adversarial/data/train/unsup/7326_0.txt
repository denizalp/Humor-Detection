**This review is for Saturday nights only. Any other day is like your typical dive bar**\n\nHaven't been here in 2 years. Nothing has really changed. Went last Saturday, the wings were decent not like they use to be though. Maybe because they were overly fried. \n\nSame Saturday crowd as I remember. If you're uncomfortable around a lot of \"hood\" people I use that term loosely on a Saturday night stay away. \n\nIf you don't like\n1. Rap music being played loudly\n2. Being at a place with no dress code\n3. Around more urban people (being politically correct here) \n\nStay away it's pointless for you to come just so you can complain. \n\nDrinks are cheap they have drink specials all night. Kitchen is open until 1am.\n\nThey have a dance floor and people usually dance and have a good time. They don't start charging at the door until 9pm. So if you get there before 9pm no cover and they give you a band so you can leave and then come if you want. \n\nI don't know what the waitress name was but she's been there since I've first went there 3 years ago. (she's the thicker one w\/ brown hair) if you get her please give her a nice tip she's the best one there. \n\n\nOtherwise I already know I'll be back no time soon though lol I might see how it is during football season on a Sunday they have plenty tv's there.
