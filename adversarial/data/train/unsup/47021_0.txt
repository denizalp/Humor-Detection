Service ia horrible . Food quality and tastes are very good but Coffee! don't try to drink.  No one is looking around and care with u. It was not like that before. Server was coming and asking coffee milk or hot water and also controlling the quality of coffee . Now it is changed . Buffet concept is one of the most important signature of 5 star Vegas Hotels and Bellagio is below than average unfotunately
