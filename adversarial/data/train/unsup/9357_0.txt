THE GOOD: Ridiculously cheap rooms, speaking $35 a night. FAT TUESDAYS cheap giant everclear drinks....I may not remember much after that.  The beds were super comfy and it was clean.  Hairdresser Elvis.  \n\nTHE BAD: No one included the $5 a night \"resort\" charge in the quoted price.  Only 2 staff members were polite to us.  One actually laughed at our friend over the phone, when she asked for more towels.  Far from the strip, but close to downtown Vegas, which we liked better. \n\nTHE HIDEOUSLY UGLY:  The topless pool at the top of the hotel.  No bar and it was full of what looked like midwestern pro-wrestler guys.  And large...LARGE women wearing no tops and thong bikinis.  I guess if you're comfortable with your body, go for it?\n\nNot bad, but I'd prefer to stay somewhere more expensive, get a nicer hotel\/staff, and save $$ on the cab fare.\n\nP.S.  Why do people take their children to Vegas?????
