I don't know much about cheese stakes but this place is the bomb dot com... Staff is polite and friendly and food is great.. it also affordable. I like spicy so they offered me their secret habanero cheese steak! it was amazing. The food is fresh and made in front of you. The only negative thing is that they are not open sunday. stop  y this place and try something new it is the best philly cheese steak stop in chandler for sure. Also, i get the red sauce on the side. It is a tomato base however it seems to be better when dipped in to or poured on, if you like how it tastes.
