This place was amazing! It had an amazing atmosphere and everyone was crazy friendly.  I just moved out here and was looking for a new place to go to and stumbled upon this place.  I booked an appointment with Cassie Yeager, and she was absolutely incredible .  She was very personable and fun to talk to and knew exactly what to do with my hair.  She threw in tons of suggestions, but still let me make all the decisions.  Just an all around great experience. Definitely my new regular place.
