My sister and I don't come here often at all but when we do, the employees always seem to remember us. It still surprises me but it makes me want to dine here more often. \nI have never had a Japanese\/Italian fusion meal before and Trattoria Nakamura-Ya definitely sets the bar high for this type of fusion (to me haha). \n\nFor appetizers, I have tried the sausage ratatouille and all I can say is that it was good. \nFor the main dishes, I have had the Spaghetti Kurobuta and Kinoko and the Fettuccini Salmon and Ikura but I tend to order the latter out of habit. \nNow for dessert -my most favorite part of the meal- I would say the black sesame blanc manger is amazing. It's quite similar to a panna cotta but there's a difference in thickness. The blanc manger had a thin layer of strawberry sauce on top which I wish they also serve on top of their soy milk panna cotta. The only dessert I don't like is the tiramisu just because the coffee is stronger and very bitter compared to what I have had at other places.
