So now they've nixed the potstickers, the asiago dip, the portabella sandwich, and the fried mozz appetizers.  They also changed their fries away from the thinner variety to a more traditional & common medium thickness.  They just can't get it right, can they?\n\nBeers are the only reason to come back.  Who knows what they'll do with the menu next?!
