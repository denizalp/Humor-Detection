This park is part of my community and I am so happy it is. I run and walk the loop and there are actually 2 parks on Vista drive and they are both pretty cool. The parks are always so clean. I've used the bathroom before and it was surprisingly clean. They have everything you could really want; sprinklers, BBQ's, picnic tables, playground, etc. It's a really nice place, and there's usually plenty of parking.
