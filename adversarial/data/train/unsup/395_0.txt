Dear Rehab...you've stolen my party heart!\n\nBy far the best time I've had in Vegas EVER...and I'm a frequent visitor! We were guests at the Paradise tower that overlooked both the strip and the pool 07\/25\/2010. AMAZING!!! If you are a guest of the hotel you get your wristband priority status...so no need to rush downstairs and wait in the long ass line. \n\nHot men...even hotter chicks...strong humongous drinks (if you tip the bartenders well!! ;o) Camers are rolling the entire time so make sure you look your best!\n\nIf you are planning on coming here to lounge and get a rest from the wild Saturday night you had....you are DEAD wrong!!! No sleeping allowed here!!! Music was bangin', there was enough room in the pool to dance around, surely a cute guy can cozy up to...or a VIP cabana you can join if you have a smokin' HOTT group of girls with you. I recommend you do! :o))\n\nBest Sunday day party in Vegas hands down. If you have a chance to go....don't miss it!
