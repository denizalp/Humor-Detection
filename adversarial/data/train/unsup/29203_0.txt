David held a LinkedIn Training class for a group of us business owners.  He said we would give us two \"Ninja Secrets\" to boost our LinkedIn rankings.  They will make the difference!  He also showed us how to add 100+ people to your LinkedIn Network, provided each of us with a LinkedIn Checklist, and why and how you should utilize \"Pulse\".  I left with one goal, to work on my LinkedIn 1 time per week.  I would recommend all business owners to take a couple of hours for training with David or at least speak with him on the services he provides.  He has been very valuable to our business.
