I purchased a used Prius from this dealership in August. The purchasing experience was pretty awful. The salesman actually fell asleep twice during the test drive. The only reason I purchased the car from them was because all of their paperwork had it listed and priced as a base model when it was actually a Prius Five. They didn't even know the model of the car they had on the lot so it was priced way under the value of the actual car. I was tempted to take it straight across the street to the Toyota dealership to see what they'd give me as a trade in value.
