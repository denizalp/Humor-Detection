Decide to get the membership and haven't regretted once. Going on 3 months that I've been coming here and each time is a great experience. I usually go to Perla but recently got my haircut by Alondra and both do amazing work. That is why it's become a weekly thing to comedown and get a haircut by these experts. \n\nOverall it's a place to get pampered and relax because who says us guys don't deserve to spoil ourselves every once in a while. I strongly recommend getting the membership and taking full advantage of it.
