I came here for my birthday. I thought the food was pretty good. I ordered a mango martini of some sort to start. I loved it! Though really, any sweet cocktail floats my boat.\n\nFor starters, we ordered the calamari. I had wished it were a little more fried. It wasn't the best part of the meal, but it wasn't bad. I think I'd try something else for appetizers next time.\n\nI ordered the NY Strip (I think) for my entree. It was made very well. The green beans that came with it were seasoned surprisingly well.\n\nThe ambiance is great. Perfect for a date night unless your date is super into sport since they show ball sports on the TVs.
