Flight delayed so here I am...\n\nIt was right across my boarding gate and I came here because it was convenient  and I didn't want to eat any of the fast food chains. I was seated immediately and I ordered their New York Steak to share with my mom since we weren't that hungry. The steak was cooked just the way I asked for- medium. The steak was juicy and I can see that they use the right amount of them to cook it. I am impressed by the quality given that this restaurant is inside the airport and still kept their cooking for their customer's liking. $30-40 for a steak is not bad at all and I would rather eat this as a meal than some burgers and fries which I can easily eat that any time since I'm in no rush. I'm glad I stepped in here since my flight was delayed.
