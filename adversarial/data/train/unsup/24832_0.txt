I read the reviews and even then I thought, hmm won't happen to me. I was wrong. I took my suit to get dry cleaned. It was in a carrying bag and a suit hanger I had bought, they took it and said come back tomorrow. Here I am today and they lost the bag and the hanger. Their excuse? \"We probably threw it away... it was just a bag...\" horrible customer service skills and horrible dry cleaning place. Heed the warnings, stay away.
