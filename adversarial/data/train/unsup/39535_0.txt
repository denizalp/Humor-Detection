I have been visiting Red Robin for years and am constantly pleased with it. Having been a customer here on countless occasions I would say the 95% of my visits here have meet my expectations and 5% were a little under. As I have said in a few of my other reviews everywhere has its off days.\n\nBeing a frequent customer here I walk in knowing what I am gonna get. I always sit down order my drink and a few baskets of their BOTTOMLESS Steak Fries which come with any burger order. I almost never order an appetizer but when I do they are a taste treat :) I have tried 90% of the burgers on the menu and my all time favorite is the Bruschetta Chicken Burger. The Garlic Fries are a great addition to the plate and the burger itself is amazing. Another good choice is the Royal Red Robin Burger. I love eating here the price is right and I always leave stuffed of what I was expecting!
