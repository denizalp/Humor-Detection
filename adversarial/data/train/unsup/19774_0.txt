We came in after church on a Sunday afternoon. Its the same concept as Pieology, make your own pizza to order. Choose the pre-suggested pizzas or make your own selections. My kids were excited to choose their own crazy wishes and when it came to me I choose the same way. I didnt see an option for gluten-free pizza crust but we were distracted cuz of the amount of choices. They have racks on the wall of premade pizza dough, smaller 4-sliced for the kids and larger 4-sliced for adults. I choose my sauce, toppings and the creation went into the large pizza oven. Our friends ordered a pre-suggested pizza and unfortunately, the young man and middle aged lady didnt remember all the toppings that went with that specific pizza. I could hear the guy reading off the list to the lady who was making it. Kinda tacky guys! Also, they asked our name for the pizzas and they heard something completely different. Like if it was supposed to be Jeff she wrote Barb on it. I tried to correct her and she said \"oh, thats ok\". Right. Then why ask my name? The pizza was quick to cook and had a good flavor. I had alot of toppings fall off my pizza but it really didnt look very loaded. Strange. They have a nice patio and the place feels comfy. I'm not sure I'll come back. I'd be concerned they forgot to refrigerate something properly or wash their hands. Just saying.
