I lived in Bridgeland for about 8 months, and never once got the chance to visit Boogie's. It was always something that I meant to do, but I was never convinced enough to make it a top priority. Just a week or two ago, I found myself in the area hungry and exhausted from a day of cupcake baking. Accompanied by a friend who had never been either, I decided to cruise up Edmonton Trail to this lovely little joint. \nUpon arriving, it was very difficult to find a parking spot which indicated it was pretty popular. In fact, there was barely even a place to sit, so we decided to take our food to go. While waiting for our order, I wished we were able to stay. The setting in Boogies is rad as hell, not so unlike a Quentin Tarantino film or something. While sitting at the bar, the gentleman who took our order engaged in friendly conversation while multitasking, and all the other staff were charming as well. Crammed into a corner were old school videogames. \nI wanted to dig into our food right away upon reaching my car but waited til we arrived at my friend's place. My veggie burger was absolutely gigantic, to a point where many \"that's what she said\" jokes ensued. The yam chips were tasty, and my friend's food I was told was delicious as well. \nDefinitely worth stopping in when you're in the area. Adorable little place.
