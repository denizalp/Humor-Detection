First time trying this restaurant. It's pretty bad, expensive and the dishes taste like plastic. A last resort only, well, maybe you're better off with convenience store snacks instead. Salads are garnished with all types of peppers NOT mentioned on the menu. Caesar is laughable. Mixed lettuce with peppers, assorted veggies and a few Parmesan shavings do not a Caesar make. Design your own pasta was warmed up pasta with a bland sauce. Crispy crust on the pizza was anything but. Dessert cake was pre-manufactured and tasted full of chemicals, making me wonder exactly how long it had been in their fridge. Very disappointing, as was the 87 dollar bill before tip for lunch for three people.
