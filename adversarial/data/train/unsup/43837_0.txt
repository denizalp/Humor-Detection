We have been to Hu Hot on many occasions, it was filling and reasonable at lunch time. Last month we visited and were seated next to the food bins. We notice one of the staff filling up the bins then patting down the vegetables with his bare hands. I thought it may have been a quick pat, but no he filled up most of the bins and used his bare hands to move the food around, even stopping to get more food from the fridge. We also noticed he had a band aid on one of his fingers. This was enough to cause us not to eat anymore. On the way out we did talk to the manager and he just said that he should have been wearing gloves. The place is not that big and it was not that busy a manager should have noticed. I don't think we will go there again.
