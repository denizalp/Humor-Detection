Fist and foremost, my sincerest apologies to anyone who was at Caffe Siena last night, and witnessed the loudness of our table. We were 13 ladies having too much fun, and there isn't such thing, right?!\nWe had large table at the back, and I didn't feel that Caffe Siena's staff were annoyed our loudness, they were really patient and kind, yet very slow (because of our big group?) \nI personally had the Short Rib Pappardelle, which was okay, just okay, and it didn't impress me.\nHowever, here are the things I've learned about Caffe Siena that I'd like to point out:\n- It's considered a Mediterranean Fusion.\n- Weekdays express lunch Buffet specials:\nMonday: Create Your Own Pasta.\nTuesday: Southern Comfort.\nWednesday: Fiesta Latina.\nThursday: Mad Italian.\nFriday: Big Easy Cajun.\nP.S: Don't forget to ask about their frequent diner card to earn a free lunch.\n- Daily drink specials:\nMonday:  $5 Local Craft Beer and Infused Martinis.\nTuesday:  $4 Miller Lite \/ $6 Jim Beam.\nWednesday:  $4 Sam Adams \/ $6 Finlandia.\nThursday: $4 Yuengling \/ $6 Signature Cocktails.\nFriday:  $4 Coors Light \/ $6 Jack Daniel's.\nAll Weekend: $3 Mimosas \/ $4 Bartender's Beer Special \/ $6 Jalapeño Infused Bloody Marys.\nSunday through Thursday: Half Price Appetizers from 4pm - 6:30pm.\n- Going to an event at Blumenthal Performing Arts?
