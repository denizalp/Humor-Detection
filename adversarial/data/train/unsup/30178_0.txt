Why don't I go here more often!? TBH- I've only ordered the tortilla soup & Brussels sprout nachos but it is all you ever hoped and dreamed of. Tortilla soup has allllll the flavors..creamy avocado, perfect amount of cheese, chicken that Melts in your mouth, and the right broth. I can't even get started on the nachos, just do your table a favor and try them. Also, go wild with their sauces. Simply sauceome!
