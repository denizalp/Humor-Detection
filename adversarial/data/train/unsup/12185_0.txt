I considered myself a loyal Sinaloa customer since at least 2007.  \nWe average 3x visits a month plus special occiasions, etc.  \nI have introduced dozens of people (from friends, family, and co-workers).\nI rarely eat alone and almost always have 2-3 friends with me.\nThe servers know what I order before I say hello.\n\nSo why do I plan on never going back, and why the one star after all these years?\nWas the food particularily bad that day? No.\nWere the servers at fault? No, they are always great.\n\nI wish it was something as benign as the above, since anyone can have an off day.\n\nUltimately I feel a sense a betrayal by being treated like a 2nd class citizen after years of loyal patronage.\n\nIs it a small thing in the grand scheme of things, of course.  Most things are.\n\nIt is Tuesday May 11, 2016 - we decide to stop by after work.\nPlace is busy so we stand in line for our table. \nWe wait ~20 minutes. \nPeople in front of us are seated.\nNow we are the only ones in line.\nThen a group of 3 customers come in behind us.\nTo our surprise, they are seated ahead of us.\nOf course we were confused and I talked to the manager.\nHe said they were there before us.\n\nIt did not seem reasonable to believe that Sinaloa holds your place in line and you can leave and come back after 30 minutes.\n\nThis could very well have been a simple misunderstanding - but the manager did absolutely nothing to clear anything up.\n\nHow could the manager have handled that better?\n1) Could have just asked us.  \n\"Excuse me, would you mind if these 3 were seated before you? They are elderly - They are the boss' friends - They are our regulars\"\nBeing asked would have changed everything.\n\n2) After seeing that a customer got a bad perception or even the wrong perception, the least the manager could have done is apologize.  \nAn apology would have changed everything.\n\nThe manager made us feel like a bunch of doofuses - you are going to treat me like a 2nd class citizen, then expect me to spend $60 and thank you for it?  No.  We were disrespected and that is unacceptable to us.\n\nOk - so we walked out and plan to never return.\n\nSearching for 'Mexican Seafood' yields many good results.
