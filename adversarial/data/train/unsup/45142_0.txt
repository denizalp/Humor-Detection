What happened?  This used to be a great bar.  I stay at Harrah's because of this bar, but this past week, I was sorely disappointed.  The drinks are really expensive, the staff seems pissed off, the bar is getting run down, and overall, it isn't what it once was.  The bands were pretty good, except early in the week.  However, the DJ music on breaks was ear drum splitting loud!  Now, this bar is just another overpriced, dark, dingy bar with pissed off staff.  I used to \"love this bar\", but no more.  There's a better bar two blocks north.
