After researching several professional window cleaning services, some with extremely high prices, I contacted CCC at the recommendation of my housekeeping service.  I was able to effortlessly receive an estimate and schedule the service.  On the day of the service the crew called to ask if they would come earlier than promised which was nice.  They quickly went to work cleaning interior and exterior as well as removing and treating my solar screens.  The windows are, well, crystal clear and sparkle!   The screens look new after the conditioner was applied.  All this for a very, very reasonable price!  I will be hiring CCC again at least after every monsoon season, if not more often!  Thanks guys for a job very well done!  I will never again attempt to clean with Outdoor Windex - what a mess I made!
