I went to see a doctor on a Saturday recently as a walk in.  I went in at 1:30 P.M. and was quickly ushered into a waiting room BUT was left there for an hour!  No one came in and checked or gave me any information as to when I would get to see a doctor.   The waiting room was almost deserted when I arrived and it was not a busy afternoon.   I could hear the doctor talking on and on to someone on the other side of the wall and wondered why I was being ignored.  Finally I went out and asked if I would be seen, was told that I was next up, went back and waited some more.   It was almost 3 P.M. and I walked out of the clinic without seeing a doctor and will not be going back.   My records are there but I have not been properly taken care, routine check ups etc.   I will be looking elsewhere for a family doctor and clinic to go to.
