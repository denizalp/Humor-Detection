After we were seated they brought out a complimentary cup of soup for my son, which he proceeded to grab and dump in my lap. Luckily it was only luke warm and didn't do much damage other than irritate me and soak my shorts. Despite that unfortunate beginning, we had a good time at Lindo.\n\nI've only been to Mexico a few times and can't speak to the authenticity of the place. But, judging from it's location in Spring Valley (btw, thanks Misti for finally establishing the neighborhoods for Vegas Yelp, otherwise I would have thought this place was in Summerlin ; ) and the surrounding neighborhoods I'm guessing they cater to a gringo audience. Since I'm a gringo myself I don't mind.\n\nThe service was excellent. Our order was taken promptly, food came out quickly, water was refilled frequently, dishes were picked up right after we were done, and the waiter(s) stopped by often to check in on us.\n\nThe food was pretty good overall. I liked the chips, salsa and bean dip. The guacamole is made tableside to your desired level of spiciness and it was some of the best guac I've had in a long time. The amount was more than enough for the three of us and would have been good for four adults. We got an order of flautas (3 beef and 3 chicken). The beef was a little dry and not too flavorful. The chicken was tender and tasty -- definitely the better of the two. We  also got a beef tamale. It was oversauced and too mushy for my liking. My son had the cheese quesadilla, which he liked.\n\nThe atmosphere is great for families -- and there were a LOT of families there. One side of the restaurant had a mariachi band and the other side (near the bar) had a guy on keyboards singing. There was even a little \"dance\" area where kids were getting their groove on. This is definitely one of the better family-friendly restaurants in the area.
