Why is it they can make frozen yogurt taste like ice cream, but can't make regular yogurt taste more like a milkshake?  Sure, the regular yogurt people concoct all these flavors like key lime pie and apple turnover, but I'm not fooled.  I'm still eatin' yogurt and am left wanting a real piece of pie when I'm done.\n\nBut the frozen yogurt people, sheer genius.  I actually almost think I'm eating soft serve ice cream.  And I think the TCBY people may have to change their name now.  Are they really the country's best?  I don't know.  The Land of Yogurt is pretty darn good.\n\nAnd at a mere 30 cents an ounce, I could have a 55-gallon drum for only $2112 (did you do the math?), discounting the weight of the drum...and assuming there was a 55-gallon drum available at the counter.  If not now, there will be soon.  This is America after all...or at least it was; and we like big food, big hair, big guns, and if you're in Scottsdale, big busted women carrying even bigger designer handbags with strangely small dogs.\n\nLots of flavors, lots of toppings.  No complaints except the layout of the store.  The parking lot entrance opens right up into some tables and then the yogurt dispensing area.  So you've got people coming, people going, people eating, people dispensing and people waiting to dispense all through the same area.  \n\nBut other than that, I'm a fan!
