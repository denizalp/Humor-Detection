Their diner is the best. I frequent Jokers Wild almost every other day and enjoy \"the best breakfast\" which is 2 eggs, hash browns, 2 slices of toast, 2 bacon or 2 sausages...And its less than $2 !!!!!! Worth so much more at an incredibly low price. Service is fast and the servers pay close attention to your satisfaction. Whenever i order coffee, the server fills my cup every time I drink from it so that my cup never gets empty. That was a first for me! The wait for the food is about less than 10 minutes. Clean environment. The atmosphere is very comfortable and relaxing. I would definitely recommend eating breakfast here if you want a fulfilling meal for a low price, with exceptional service and great servers. Bravo Jokers Wild!!! You deserve every star from me.
