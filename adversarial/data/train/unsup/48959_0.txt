This was probably the third time we ate @ this buffet. The experience was still the same AMAZING!  The food was delicious & the service excellent!  Champagne brunch totally worth it!  We got a food deal off of travelzoo $26 for two people champagne brunch.  We brought  a large group of 15 & they seated us pretty quickly. The best buffet in Vegas ! Great variety !
