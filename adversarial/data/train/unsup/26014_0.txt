Shared, tapas style plates might be old news downtown, but a welcome alternative in sleepy Etobicoke.\n\nWent on a Tuesday night and it was surprisingly busy with families and couples of all ages. My brother lives in the area and tells me it's pretty packed Thursday-Saturday with a fun, youngish crowd.\n\nThe plates cover all the bases; veg, pasta, meats, seafood and are interesting without being daring or risky. Who doesn't like a nice bit of Montreal Smoked meat? Or a fish taco? Or a charcuterie plate with Prosciutto and Asiago? \n\nIt's a nice room full of big B&W prints of old family gatherings, flattering lighting and  comfy booths. The front of house team is sociable and chatty, and, combined with the room and art, makes it less like dinner at  \"Nonaa's\" and more like an Izakaya run by your cool \"Zia\".
