I thought I'd give Spectrum Dermatology one more try, with Dr Thosani instead of Dr. Kim. I realize it doesn't matter who you get - it's how the practice is run. I made an appointment to have a skin check and to look at a suspicious spot on my chest and a spot on my nose. They looked at the spots but didn't do the skin check\/assessment because the scheduler didn't book it that way. Translation: I have to go in again, pay another co-pay, and they bill another visit. Sad that it's all about the money. I went through this with them previously during an appointment requiring a biopsy and treatment for actinic keratosis. They couldn't take care of all the spots (which probably would have required an extra minute of time) in that visit because insurance doesn't pay any extra once you go beyond a certain limit. Crazy that clinics like this don't put the patient and their needs first.
