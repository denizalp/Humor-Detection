Wow ,  got way more than I should have. Bought a microdermabrasion , facial and wax and it was not done properly. They did not hold my skin while using the wand, I have large hickey type stripes all over my face. I gave them 2 stars because they are refunding my money! Never should you have marks all over your face EVER! also when they waxed my brows and lip they did not hold the skin and caused bruising and welts on my face.
