Wanna get a high score in mom\/dad points? Wanna earn that bonus round with a date? Get Rec't! As in, take them to The Rec Room! Occupying a sleek loft in a prime location, The Rec Room is the perfect way to kill a few hours. Sure, you have Dave & Busters which has a similar model, but there are some things that completely blow D&B out of the water. \n\n- READY, START - \n\nThe first thing you notice, of course, are the flashing lights of the arcade. No, it's not the biggest, and they will definitely benefit from expanding this section. Around the corner, however, is the main attraction: VIRTUAL REALITY. It's an experience that's operated separately from the Rec Room, which means you pay an extra $25 but it's something you HAVE to try. VR is the future, and the one here is amazing! Spoiler alert, you bust ghosts. \n\n- LEVEL UP -\n\nWhen you're getting a little tuckered out with throwing balls, beating scores, and whacking buttons, there are 3 different areas you can recharge. There's a fast food area with your usual pizza and fries, an indoor bar\/restaurant with reliable contemporary fare, and an outdoor patio. We chose the indoor restaurant and there were 2 things that stood out. \n\n1) They have the BEST salmon burger I've ever tried. On top of that, they have a good range of bar options. We got a blackberry mint julep and grapefruit sangria, which were both tasty. Yes, I would consider coming back just for the restaurant portion. \n\n2) The waitress taking our order paused and said to me, \"Sorry, I got distracted. You're so pretty!\" WHY THANK YOU! GUESS WHO'S GETTING A BIG TIP? :D\n\n- FINAL ROUND - \n\nOk, I'm not gonna say I had the typical experience here. On that day, I was blessed by the game gods, who bestowed on me the coveted, unthinkable MEGA JACKPOT in one of those ball drop games. Yeah. I got like, 7000 tickets. In any other arcade, that might've gotten you something useless\/irrelevant to your life, like a giant plushy or a crappy karaoke machine. \n\nAt the Rec Room, you get prizes you want. Well, that I want. Like Michael Kors, Kate Spade, and Coach. I also saw Swell bottles, shirts with actually cool designs, and a drone. The one time I walked into an arcade and walked out with a suitable return on investment in the form of a brand new Coach wristlet. \n\nGotta say, I had a great time here. This is a top choice to bring out-of-towners, or bored in-towners. Games were typical but staff were engaging, VR was phenomenal, and that burger was ughhhh.  Yep, I got Rec't. And I liked it. \n\n(91\/100) - 2017
