So last night I had the honor of meeting Helen Y and Jan W on a windy First Friday evening. \n\nAnd this time I had a scoop of the chocolate rosemary.\n\nAnd also a scoop from their secret stash. \n\nAnd again, incredible.\n\nI don't need to ramble on for paragraphs on end because those dollops of ice cream speak for themselves. The sweet ladies of Sweet Republic know their flavor combinations and their ice cream. The way the chocolate and the rosemary complemented each other was perfection. Each friend who tasted it got those big eyes. You know those eyes. The \"Hot damn, that's SOOO GOOD!\" eyes. \n\nScrew my trying to Twitter a Korean taco truck in LA. I'm tweeting this orange ice cream bus with insane magic inside from now on.\n\nI'm a fan.\n\n5 more stars.
