Hey blonde haired girl working the shoe return..I am sorry that you clearly hate your job, but because you do, that does not give you the right to huff and puff like the big bad wolf when I go to exchange a small pair of shoes for the next size up.  If you are incapable of basic human contact at your place of work perhaps go work in a factory or a graveyard...
