I was shocked - SHOCKED - to see butterfish on their menu. I asked our server about it and I said \"is that the fish that gives you intestinal issues\"? She said \"oh no, our chef is world class and he wouldn't have something like that on our menu. Butterfish is escolar.\" I responded \"YES! Escolar is the fish that causes explosive diarrhea!\" I then Googled it on my iphone and sure enough I was correct. Why on Earth would they put this on their menu I do not know. \n\nI thought the restaurant was beautifully decorated and very warm and inviting. The service was somewhat knowledgeable and very attentive. However they did the thing that I hate the most and scream \"corporate concept\" - our server asked if we'd like sparkling or still water and when he asked for still she asked if we'd like Fugi or \"Charlotte's Finest\". It's a terrible attempt at upselling. \n\nWe had the pork belly skewers, blue fin tuna maki roll, king crab leg & salmon roll, tempura veggies, tenderloin and asparagus skewers, pork dumplings, tofu, edamame, etc. We had a wide range of dishes and overall they were all just good, but not exceptional and certainly not memorable. Especially not so for the price. \n\nI'm still shocked that they have escolar on their menu. For that reason, and the lack of a wow factor, I won't be rushing back.
