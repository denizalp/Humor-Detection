They flatten their bacon here. Amazing.\n\nNo, really, they throw those bad boys on the grill and put what appear to be iron presses on top as they cook so they come out perfectly long and flat. None of this shrivelled wrinkled crap.\n\nPrices are definitely very reasonable - for about 8 bucks you can get 2 slices of french toast (or pancakes), eggs, bacon AND sausage (don't you hate when they make you choose? It's freedom here!).\n\nThe brunch options here are not mind-blowing by any means, but they definitely hit the spot for a well-made, proper breakie. Agree with Kat F. on the busy factor. We swung by around noon on a weekday and the place was bustling with families and couples abound. Doesn't anyone work anymore?
