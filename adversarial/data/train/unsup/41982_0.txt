This is my favorite place for all the traditional Jewish Foods my grandma used to make for me. The Matzah Ball Soup truly is Jewish Penicillin when you are sick (and even if your not). And their Bagel, Lox, and Cream Cheese is complete with Capers,Tomatoes,and Red Onion! And their Bagel selections are complete with Bagels and Bialys( not sure if that's spelled correctly) Delicious!!\nThe bakery section is complete with everything your heart desires.\nI love this place.
