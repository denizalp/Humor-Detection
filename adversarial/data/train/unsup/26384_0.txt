My wife and I and another couple tried this restaurant for the first time last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, food and service.  John was our waiter and he did a great job in telling us the history of the ownership, how the food is cooked, etc.  We are big fans of O.H.S.O. And were happy to hear that the owners of O.H.S.O also own The Covenant.  I would highly recommend this new restaurant!  I had the short ribs and my wife had the ceviche - both dishes were prepared to perfection and again the service made the evening!
