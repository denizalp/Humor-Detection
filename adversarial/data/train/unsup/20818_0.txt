I found Lou's Diner by accident.  I was in their parking lot to answer an e-mail, starving, and noticed their sign.  I pulled up my Yelp app, read a few of my Yelp friend's reviews, and made up my mind that I'm having eggs for lunch.  I walked in and it wasn't busy at all.  I sat myself and was a little concerned that the service would take a while since no one noticed me walking in.  Within 10 minutes, one of the waitresses attended to me and gave me a menu.  Their menu is mainly a traditional American breakfast (i.e. omelets, sandwiches, burgers, soups, etc.).  I kept my meal simple and had their 3 egg cheese omelet, 4 slices of bacon, well done extra crispy hash browns, and some toast.  This breakfast combo was very affordable at only $8.  I also added a cup of their homemade chili, which ended up being the highlight of my entire meal.  The chili has a bit of a kick, hearty, and had enough meat to satisfy my protein needs.  A cup of their chili is good enough to make me a repeat customer. If I had one gripe, it's the cheese in their omelets.  I prefer shredded cheese in my omelets, not sliced cheese. Lou's Diner was able to add shredded cheese to my chili.  Why couldn't they do this for their omelets? In the future, I'll request it.  It never hurts to ask, right?\n\nThis diner has been around a very long time.  It's nice to see businesses from the 60's still thriving.  It's also obvious that Lou's has its share of regulars.  The service was great and the price per dish is better than most.  I'm sure that I will be returning soon, especially if I'm craving their chili.
