The first time we ate there this place was new. I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich and it wasn't what I expected in taste and it was sparse on the meat. Tonight we went back and they seem to have a better grasp on things. Ordered the meat ball and Mozzarella sub and it was first rate. I'll order that from now on. Good people and they work hard to please the customers.
