Nice, medium-sized airport staffed by nice people. Decent shopping and dining options. I've travelled through this airport several times and have never encountered problems with security, flight delays, car rental complications or any other normal pain with traveling. There are also plenty of electrical outlet options. Too bad all airports aren't this easy. Please note that I have never travelled through this airport in the winter. \nLookout for the old beaten up massage seats they are NOT comfortable and should be removed.
