Sir Elton John- I think not. My niece and sister drove ask the way down from Idaho for a special birthday. They planned this for months. We joined them, driving from California. We find out only hours before that the concert was canceled. First Caesars Palace tells us that he was sick. (A lie by  the way- thanks  Caesars. You should fire your public relations person for this one). Than e have to find out he cancels because he wants to make a publicity appearance for Whitney Houstons funeral. If it were so important for him, where was he when she was sick before. My niece was heart broken, and we have list respect for the disrespectful Mr. Elton (He doesn't deserve Sir today) These divas have to remember there fans first-- we got them there, not their agents and assistants. We would ask for a public apology but it wouldn't be sincere, and  someone else would probably have to  wrie it for him. 4000 disappointed fans-- noone can afford that.
