I wish I could love this place... It's just tough. \nI've eaten here several times and just haven't really LOVED anything. My sandwiches have always been dry and kind of bland tasting. Salads have been ok, but I usually feel like I can make them better. Hummus - dry. Dolmades - tasted like the ones from the jar. Ahh, so sad, because it's food that I do normally love. \nHere is why I gave this a three- happy hour prices are good ($2 or $3 for small plates). With prices like that, I can forgive some of the food quality a bit.
