Woah, this is a nice Starbucks.\n\nVery spacious, interestingly laid out, and has a small faux-fireplace with couches surrounding it in the back right corner. Also has window seating facing Cedar Rd., so there's a lot of seating options here.\n\nThe coffee is normal; it's Starbucks, after all. You can't really complain.\n\nReally a solid place to hold an interview, or to study. It's close to my current residence, so it's nice to go and read a book there.
