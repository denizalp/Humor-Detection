Hurleys at YUL is located in the US departure section of the airport.  Used to be the sports bar now completely renovated with a great selection of on tap and bottle beer and whiskeys - food menu has lots of choices - I had the fish and chips - delicious fries and great tasting batter... sports screens all over to watch the game before you take off! Have a great flight !
