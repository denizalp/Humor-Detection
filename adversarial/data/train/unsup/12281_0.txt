DISGUSTING!!!  and the folks here in charge JUST DON'T CARE!!!\n\nWent to take a shower, pulled the curtain, and a woman's thong underwear fell down off of the rod. There were also hairs in the tub. All of this from the previous customers in the room. My daughter and I have two more nights to stay in this hotel and were more than a little disgusted!!!\nCalled down to the front desk. We were offered free breakfast and a credit on the \"resort fee\"for one night. $23. NOT a refund for the night. NOT a room upgrade.  They claim not to have any available. I call BS!!!!!\nNOT impressed with this place or their customer service and would NOT recommend!\n\nDAY 2: We just returned to our room at the end of the day and wouldn't you know, Those THONG UNDERWEAR are still on the bathtub, along with hairs on the floor.\n\nDAY 3: The cleaning lady made the beds with the bottom sheet put on about a foot from the bottom of the mattress, leaving the mattress exposed to our feet. And the desk in the room had not been wiped down. There was a water ring from where a glass had been sitting and visible dust allover the desk and lamp.\n\nWe ate at the buffet last night ($25). All of the food was either cold and\/or stale!\nOn our way back to the room at 8:10pm we notice all of the shops were closed.\nReally! Saturday night in Vegas. Closed!\n\nCONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED!!!!!
