First off, $188 for a quality inn on a weeknight....  that's just stupid. Right off the highway so you get the lovely sounds of traffic. No Wi-Fi so that means you get to watch the awesome 20 inch tv. Feel like your in a 40 dollar a night place. Completely not quality. I will do everything I can to not get put up in one of these again!\n\nAlso manager has a printed note on his door that stated that the next person that the next person that enters his office will be terminated, no excuses!!! How professional \n\nHad to get a receipt that I forgot when I stayed. Called the front desk and they said they would email it right away, called three more times and waited over an hour and still nothing. Decided to go in person and said I needed the receipt for just the first night of my three night stay, he said he could only print off the whole stay, ok no worries, after I get the receipt I notice it doesn't state the charges for the first night, I tell him that is the only night I actually need. The guy gets visibly annoyed hits like 4 more keys and happens to print out just the first night, exactly what I asked for and exactly what he said he couldn't do. And of course with the most about of attitude he could he told me next time I should get the receipt when I first checked in.... what a dick. \n\nThis was the worst hotel and most disrespectful staff (other than the nice night shift) I have ever had to deal with.
