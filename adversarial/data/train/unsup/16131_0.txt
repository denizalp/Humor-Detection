My weekly pilgrimage to Hy-Vee keeps my household well stocked in produce, meat, other foodstuffs, and beer.  After not finding a helpful smile in any aisle in 5 years of living away from the midwest, Hy-Vee is a refreshing welcome home. \n\nI convinced myself for a few weeks that Hy-Vee was more expensive than other area grocery stores, but after watching receipts for a few months, Hy-Vee is definitely comparably priced, and a much friendlier environment.  The produce is always fresh, the store is clean and well maintained, and the guys in the liquor store are friendly!  Actually, everyone I've interacted with is friendly. The butchers have advised me on cuts of meat a few times, the deli-ers (is there a better name for this? probably!) are fast and accurate, and again, the liquor store staff have always been willing to help me pick out a few new beers.  It's good for me (new beers!), it's good for them (doubles my purchase!), and it's good for my liver (well....).  There are also occasionally tastings, so hey! Free beer at 10am? That will keep me coming back.
