Recently contacted A1 Garage door service. They were on time and diagnosed the problems with the door correctly and made sure everything worked correctly.  The office people were nice and courteous. The owner whom I spoke with was passionate about fixing the problems with the door. The other company I used prior to this several times never mentioned any of these problems caused by the weight of the door. I will  only use A! service from now on.
