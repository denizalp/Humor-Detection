WHO: Whether you are an elite athlete, have been an athlete for years, trying to loose weight, trying to get back to exercising, or trying to up your boxing\/kickboxing\/mma technique, come right on in! This place is for people of different fitness levels (unless you need a doctor's note).\n\nWHEN: There are classes going on 7 days a week, so get on their website and check the daily schedule and see which time may be convenient for you.\n\nWHERE: There are 3 locations in town, but this location, to be exact, is on Blue Diamond and Arville (inside the same vicinity as Target & Ross, but more West of the plaza).\n\nWHY: Why ask why?!! If you are curious, try it out yourself!! There is a \"First time's free\" deal for everyone!! So if you wanna try a class before actually dedicating a whole year to payments, feel FREE to try it out beforehand. (If you want to go hard during the free trial, try Todd's class!!! Definitely worth your time!!)\n\nWHAT: It all started when an LA Boxing deal popped up on Groupon. My friend and I were in this whole \"I want to try all types of fitness classes via Groupon!\" With that being said, that is exactly what we did. We bought a month-long deal over the summer and got hooked. Yes, we signed up for an entire year because of that intense month of boxing\/kickboxing.\n\nThere are a handful of instructors that teach the hour-long classes. I recommend you try out all the different instructors to find out which is best for you. Each class is comprised of intense cardio, boxing\/kickboxing 250 lb bags, technique, plyometrics, and or stretching, so HAVE SOME FUN WITH IT!\n\nIn conclusion,\nI LOVE LA BOXING!!! If you're hesitating... summer is just around the corner ;)!!
