Amtrak is a great way to travel from NYC to CLE. Huge comfortable seats that recline way back with nearby power outlets. The Cleveland station, however, is a dismal mess. I don't have an issue with the location even though it's tricky to find. It is not in a dangerous area, but is dark and unwelcoming with terrible seating and no amenities other than an assortment of vending machines. The Amtrak station at Albany is much more like an airport terminal with a big newsstand and a coffee and sandwich place that sells beer too. The Cleveland station has none of this.
