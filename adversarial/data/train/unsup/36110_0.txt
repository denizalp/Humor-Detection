Steve is awesome!!  There are so many \"deals\" out there on Groupon, Living Social, etc for carpet cleaning, but what they forget to mention is all the add-in's you need.  You think you are getting a good deal, but in the long run you aren't.  Steve is the best out there and you won't have to worry about him trying to sell you anything.  It's upfront, honest, reliable, on-time and does an outstanding job.  I have now used him 2 times and this time I had him clean my couches.  Everything just smells and looks amazing.  I highly recommend Carpet MD for your carpet needs!
