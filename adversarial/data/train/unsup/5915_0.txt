This is for the pizza by the slice. 1st of all, they consistently burn it. Looks great in the window then they burn a third of it. 2nd the part that's not burnt tastes mediocre at best. At over $4 a slice, I expect better quality, and I've gotten better quality at chain pizza places and the food courts at Sam's Club and costco. 3rd the service. I understand if you're busy. And I usually don't even talk about service in reviews. But when your actual food is bad and expensive (for what it is), then I don't know,  maybe I should expect you to give my pizza to someone else and make me wait even longer to burn my other slice. \n\nInstead of here, go to Naked City Pizza. Better pizza,  better prices, better service. They're not speedy, but they're good. Maybe their interior isn't as well designed but that's all that's lacking
