It's-a nice-a! Spiceh meat-a ball-a! *De Niro face*\n\nNow that I've got THAT out of the way, let's talk business here. I'm lingering somewhere betwixt a 3 and a 4 on this one -  but the weird thing is, I've got all positive things to say. But at the end of it all, I just didn't feel an overall enthusiasm towards the place. It's like in the dating world - a person can look good on paper, but sometimes you just don't feel that THING. Well I'm sorry to say, Scarpetta... it's not you, it's me.\n\nThe service was splendid; despite having a fafillion hosts\/servers\/sommeliers\/kitchen dudes lingering about at all times, it was never invasive. I'm not used to dealing with sommeliers, so it was hilarious to me that as soon as Tara A started eyeing the wine list, he was creeping up from behind to offer suggestions. And then once he poured the wine, he took it away. Is that a fancy sommelier thing?! \"NO. ONLY I MUST POUR THE WINE.\" I'm sorry, I'm only accustomed to eating at brunch spots. This is all new to me. Not that I minded it - I liked having him be the master of all wine. \n\nOur servers were deee-lightful and very accommodating. Speaking of accommodating, they have a separate Vegetarian menu! POINTS!! I ordered the Bibb lettuce and Braised Lentils with Rosemary. The salad was meh - I mean, not a cost-effective selection. The lentils were KILLER! Such flavour! Such sassiness! Topped with kale and sun-dried tomato, mama mia!! I tried a bite of my friend's house-made spaghetti with a FACE SLAP of basil - SO. GOOD. I'm telling you: when that plate comes, you're like, \"come on. I could eat twice that amount.\" But nobody at our table finished their spaghetti, cause it was crazy filling.  \n\nI asked for my lentil-y leftovers to go (about 1\/3 of a cup) and the lady brought them back in a giant, Whole Foods-sized paper bag. So comical!! \n\nWhen the next reservation was waiting for our table, the hostess moved us out to the lounge and brought free glasses of Prosecco (I just typed 'prosexxo'.) Nice touch, and delicious. The lounge is a fab place to sit if you like feeling fancy, free candied almonds, watching dolled-up ladies mack on rich men and some chairs that serve fashion over function. I wouldn't mind hitting up the Thompson every once in awhile - it's very chic, and I think a terrific idea to include 3 eating establishments.
