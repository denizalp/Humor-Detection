OMG!! IT'S LIKE...SO...BRIGHT & SUGARY IN HERE! \n\nI feel like I'm at an 8-year-old girl's birthday party. But not one of the girls I grew up with (rural small town, with shared bedrooms and hand-me-down clothes)...a wealthy girl with the latest cool clothes and her OWN room, decorated perfectly to a theme. This isn't a bad thing, necessarily. So why the birthday party feeling, not just hanging out in this girl's perfect fantasy bedroom with a miracle soft serve machine? There are screaming kids shotgunning frozen sugar e-ver-ree-where. \n\nI like \"Pay for what you'll eat\" concepts. Although the cups are giant and most of the patrons take advantage of this by just heaping the froyo and toppings in, I covered the bottom of mine with yogurt and chose a light amount of 4 toppings (3 cheesecake cubes, 6 chocolate-caramel mini turtles, sprinkles, and rainbow non-pareils). As such, my total was a little over $3. The girl who paid ahead of me? Here's was almost $7. You are charged by the ounce. The 2 flavors I chose were red velvet and raspberry cheesecake. Tasty, although I'll probably just go with cheesecake if there's a next time. I like the toppings to be the star of the show.\n\nThe spoons are really cute too. I think there were about 18 flavors of frozen yogurt (and you can swirl the neighbors too), and probably about 30 toppings. There are nuts present...careful if you're allergic. Parking is available behind the strip where this is located.
