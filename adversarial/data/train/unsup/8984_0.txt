I'm surprised this place doesn't have any reviews yet. \nI had my surgery 2.5 weeks ago. \nI've been thinking about fixing my vision for many years but was absolutely terrified to go for it so a month ago I got a bit of courage and went for a consultation. Also, I have to say, I'm super pain-sensitive. This specific clinic was recommended to me by 2 different optometrists so shakily, I made an appointment :) \n\nThe two pre-surgery consultation and mapping appointments were 1.5 hr each and were totally complementary, I learned A LOT about my eyes and thankfully, they told me that I was a good candidate, so after a lot of nervous soul searching, I made my surgery appointment.\n\nThe actual surgery lasted 25 min for both eyes, they gave me freezing eye drops and made me feel very calm and relaxed, the staff are really amazing and compassionate, if they weren't, I'd make a nervous sprint for the door, anything to do with eyes absolutely terrifies me.\n\nThe surgery was totally painless and fast, I had a bit blurry vision at first but it 100% improved after my first batch of eye-drops, I felt fully healed 24 hrs post surgery and continued all the prescribed eye drops for 2 weeks. My vision is pretty clear, a nice thing after wearing glasses since age 3, I'm still feeling overwhelmed when I think about it.\n\nI do have a side effect post surgery, all of my weather headaches and all the usual migraines are gone, I used to get at least 5-6 per week.  I didn't expect this at all and I don't think they mentioned this as a possible bonus post-surgery.\n\nEdited to add: One month passed after I wrote this review and I had another post-surgery check-up, my eyesight continued to improve, it's now better than 20\/20 in both eyes.   \nAlso, I'm still absolutely free from headaches. I know, this might not be a big deal to someone but it's huge to me, I still can't believe I don't have to constantly pop extra strength Advils, my liver is finally recovering from daily pain medication.
