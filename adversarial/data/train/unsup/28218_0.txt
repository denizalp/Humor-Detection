The food was good per usual at Popeyes however the service was lackluster. They were very slow to help, I stood at the counter for about 5 minutes trying to get some ranch before anyone acknowledged me, they even made eye contact with me several times, they were all to busy conversing with each other, which in turn made my food cold by the time I got back to eat it. The cashier had a hard time putting our order in, and there was another lady complaining about the shrimp they gave her. Overall not impressed.
