There is a lot of hype about this place in the area. I went with high hopes after reading the glowing reviews online. \n\nI guess for the area it is an exciting addition. Unfortunately, I found it to be one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. \n\nFrom the brightly lit atmosphere to the white dense bread and what tasted like vegetable oil for dipping to the overly oily french onion soup and completely tasteless overcooked entree, the only good thing I can say about this place is the bartender makes a pretty good slightly dirty martini.
