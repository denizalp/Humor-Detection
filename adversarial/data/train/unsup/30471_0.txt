Last year, I bought 2 new tires for my 2011 SUV at Superior Tire in Summerlin.  This year I went to their Rainbow\/Spring Valley location to buy 2 more.  I specifically asked them to put the 2 new tires on the front & move the 2 tires from last year to the back.  When I paid & checked out, I asked if they had done that & they confirmed that they had.  When I got home & looked at the tires, it was obvious that the new tires were on the rear.  (Guess I should have checked before I left).\n\nI called the store manager & was told that the new procedure is to put the new tires on the rear.  I said that (1) - you could have mentioned that you were doing that & (2) I also wanted the older tires moved to change the wear on them - as you do when you rotate your tires.  No response or offer to fix my complaint.\n\nI suspect that not moving the two tires saved them labor costs.  Or, they just didn't feel like doing it.  At the very least, I would hope that in the future, Superior Tire will advise their customers before they just do what they please.\n\nTheir prices were good & the waiting room comfortable, hence the 2 stars.  Sadly, this a field rife with cheating customers so I can't guarantee that you will have a better experience elsewhere.
