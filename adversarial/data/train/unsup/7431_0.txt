As if our Yelp reviews will curtail visits to this big blue giant... One can only hope, right?\n\nWhen television shopping, what I want from a salesman is a greeting, and a request to assist. If I advise I'm not in need of assistance - it's time to scram, Sam! Oh and don't be a jerk to me. Is that too much to ask?\n\nInstead, Best Buy has decided to take a different path. They allow employees of a different company - a Cable Provider - to harrass me while looking at their products. Who in their right minds thought this was good for ANYTHING but coporate contracts? Are they THAT desperate to stay afloat in this internet dominated era?\n\nI do my research online, but there's something to be said for viewing a TV. I know the specs, and I know my taste. It's really offputting when a Direct TV employee asks if they can help you find what you're looking for and then scoffs when you tell them. \"A Plasma TV?\" Their idiodic retort: \"Why would you want that? And 2.25 inches thick? You're confused - that's an LED TV. Plasmas aren't that thin. But who do you receive cable from? Can I interest you in Direct TV?\"\n\nGo back to making cold calls and stop hastling me. If Best Buy trusts you to stand in their TV department they should force you to understand some basic information about the products you're quasi-representing. Talk about killing two birds with one stone. I'm not interested in supporting either company. \n\nLong story short: I found exactly what I was looking for and ordered it elsewhere.
