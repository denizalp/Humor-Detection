The coffee here? It's like unicorns dancing on your tongue. I would marry this coffee, have a messy divorce, pay it alimony, and then marry it again. They also have the most lovely baristas who always appear to be laughing and smiling at work which is awesome! Definitely makes having to go to the mall a better time. If there were 6 stars? You'd get them.
