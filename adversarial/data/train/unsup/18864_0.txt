Just like the reviews before mine I was there June 25 and needed a cigarette lighter charger for car, it was overpriced but I didn't want to leave the strip in search of one. I was sold the charger, an iPhone 5 cable, and a solar charger for $100 it turned out to be all junk and a scam in the end. My solar charger didn't work initially and exchanged for another one that didn't work when I got home and the IPhone 5 cable now doesn't work either. This place is a RIP off and they're scammers! They're located in the Miracle Mile Shops in Planet Hollywood. Stay away from this place!!!
