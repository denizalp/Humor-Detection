I was here for a business dinner on Monday night and the restaurant was pretty empty so the staff was super attentive. Perfect atmosphere for good conversation since you don't have to yell over music or other people. I didn't get a chance to look over the wine menu but whatever was brought to our table was delicious.\n\nWe started with the Warm Brie, which I still think about two weeks later. Cheesy goodness paired with Apricot Spread, Hummus, Grilled Vegetables and Grilled Flatbread. Great choice for a starter.\n\nFor the entree, I got the Poached Salmon with Citrus Risotto. It thought it was just okay. The sun-dried tomatoes were a little too heavy in flavor and it didn't go very well with the citrus risotto, IMO.\n\nCute place overall. I definitely want to come back to check out their happy hour.
