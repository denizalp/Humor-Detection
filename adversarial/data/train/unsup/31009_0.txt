Worst moving experience ever. They have the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The movers were not careful and rude. The \"head\" mover was very shady and disrespectful. Nothing out of his mouth was professional once the contract was signed.\n\nAfter they get your contract the last thing they seem to care about is you. It was one excuse after another as to why it was taking twice as long to get our things as they said it would. The office does not return calls. We had originally contracted through Worldwide Vanlines who apparently subcontracted these guys. Our things sat 3 hours from our new house for more than a week!\n\n\nOur things arrived on the day that the contract stated if they were any later would be a breach. As they unloaded our things we noticed many dings and scratches. Dining table was cracked, ping pong table had lost 3 wheels, my new $800+ barbecue grill was severely damaged, plasma TV was damaged and unusable, and those were just a few. They ended up delivering items that were not ours but didn't want to take them back.\n\nTheir claims department is the biggest joke ever! Two years and I'm still dealing with it.\n\nSTAY AWAY! I would also not use Worldwide Vanlines as they are the ones who subcontracted this company
