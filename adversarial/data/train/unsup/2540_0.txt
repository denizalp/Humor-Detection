Taiwanese franchises do it right. Liang Mama does it right too, for the most part. It's clean, stylish, and the service is good. \n\nMom and I ordered appetizers: cucumber, tofu (hot and cold). The restaurant provided a small dish of spicy pickled vegetables. We also order garlic stir fried vegetables, beef noodle soup, and \"snow vegetable\" (mustard leaf) noodle soup with handmade noodles. I loved the texture of the noodles.\n\nI ordered the beef scallion wrap for my better half to eat when we got home. He seemed happy!\n\nI was pleased with everything but my mom's beef noodle soup, which was too sweet. The location is a little weird as well, but maybe it'll bring some life into the area. \n\nI will definitely come back here!
