Ahhhh man, I really wanted to like this place more than I did. I guess I would really give it a 3.5 versus a 3... but we all know there are no half points here.. \n\nAs everyone else already mentioned, the parking in front of the rest\/bar is all valet, so I just parked across the street behind the payday loan place (NO ON PROP 200!!). \n\nI met up with a friend and we got a table at about 730 immediately, and I never really saw it get overly packed. Because I am feeling lazy I'm going to just list out some pros and cons versus my standard paragraphs. \n\nPro's... \nThe artichoke dip. Amazing. \nThe tortellini with Alfredo sauce. The best part, by far! \nThe decor. \nThe cute waiter. \nThe people were friendly. \nIt was not as 'Scottsdale' as I was expecting \n\nCon's... \n\nIt was loud. We had a table near the bar and at times it was real hard to have a conversation. \n\nThere was a plasma screen playing college football.. not really a fit and I found it quite distracting \n\nThe booths are significantly lower than the table, so short people have a hard time reaching the table unless they sit on their feet. Or a phone book. \n\nSomeone was smoking outside and within ten seconds my allergies kicked in. Luckily it was at the end of the meal and time to go. \n\nThere were MANY dudes with V-neck T-shirts which I do not find flattering, in the least. \n\n\nOverall I had a nice time and really enjoyed the food, but there were a few little things preventing it from being a really great place.
