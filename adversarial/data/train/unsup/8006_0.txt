If you're wearing one of those long wool coats and enjoy hitting on cute bartenders you'll enjoy this place. Even if you're from out of town and are with your girlfriend, you'll also like it.\n\nI really know almost nothing about wine. My knowledge of wine is like a caveman's knowledge of Justin Bieber. Even so, I enjoyed the flight of random wines I tried. I think it was something like $9 for a flight of three wines. Not totally sure, but the prices were quite reasonable.\n\nThe long wood bar and wine imagery all over the place melded well together. Even though the space was large, it was quite cozy and warm.\n\nIf you want to impress your girlfriend I'd take her here. You don't even have to mention you found this place on Yelp!
