I think Seoul Jung, which was the restaurant I believe was here was two restaurants ago, had the best food.  \nFor Seoul Korean Grill, they've updated the place so it looks modern and have gotten rid of the mediocre sushi because Americanized sushi really doesn't have a place in Korean food.  \n\nI took a friend and her two kids to introduce them to Korean BBQ.\n\nWe ordered the marinated ribs and chadol (brisket).  \nWe also ordered the pancakes and seafood soondoobu soup.  \n\nThe side dishes weren't very good, no one touched theirs after tasting them.  \n\nThe chadol was pretty bland, but that's always a hit and miss wherever, unless you're in LA and everyone really does use Angus beef.  \n\nThe marinated ribs were supposed to be my savior but they were overly marinated in what tasted honestly like beef jerky marinade.  The used so much tenderizer, usually pear juice, that the meat lost all sense of what natural beef is supposed to feel like in your mouth.  They all felt like moist teriyaki beef jerky in your mouth.  Also, the grill doesn't get hot enough to char the meat or the marinate.  Therefore the grilled flavor is missing; which I think is an important piece.  Another important piece missing from the table were the lettuce.  Nothing to wrap the meat in before popping them in your mouth.  They were also missing the shredded green onion \"salad\" that usually accompany Korean BBQ.  You add it with the meat, ssam jang, and rice into your lettuce before trying to stuff it all down your throat.  \n\nIt's all very overpriced, so if you're feeling like mediocre Korean food in a nice, clean, modern atmosphere....  Seoul Korean Grill is for you!
