I just had a chicken burrito and it was out of this world.\n\nI've always be reluctant to try Como En Casa though I walk by it often, thinking it would be just an unauthentic fair with dry chicken and tasteless rice. \n\nBut no, it offers the EXACT OPPOSITE. The burrito was moist and each component that went in was very well seasoned. They also put it on the grill and flattens it out, the end result is a burrito that just warms up your stomach. Payed 10 for mine with extra guac.
