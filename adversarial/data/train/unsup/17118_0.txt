DON'T GO HERE!!   It's the most ghetto place I have ever stayed and as a native of Las Vegas,  I have stayed at most of the Budget Suites  from one time to another..  Big issues with these guys starting with the poorly maintained and dirty property in general. Then of course we have the RUDE and callous staff, and last but not least, YOU ARE MOST LIKELY TO GET ROBBED HERE more than any of the other properties!!!  I spent 2 weeks there and it made me sick to my stomach.. My FIRST WEEK I got nearly $200 worth of jeans robbed within 20 mins. of using their laundromat without a care from staff. .2nd week my truck was broken into and vandalized, for a bag of paint brushes & stereo..  Apparently, security would rather play PRIVATE DICK on petty shit and spy on you over the rooftops of cars for for crap like where you are going to park your small 5x8 work trailer (was only there for a couple days) in areas where there is plenty of room because nobody wants to be there anyway....  If its not a miserable walk on the other side of the property, with kids and groceries at hand, they are not doing their job of making you feel like a miserable low life piece of shit for being there and it doesn't matter that your personal property is getting stolen and broken into right in front of their power playing, high on their horse faces.. Not even worthy of the one star I had to give to leave this comment..  You have been warned.. DON'T PUT YOURSELF THROUGH WHAT I DID, even if for a short amount of time.. If convenient go to the  W. Trop location instead.. Much nicer, cleaner, better environment, & friendlier & even though they don't have bbq's which was my only gripe,  you will find its much more worth buying one or making one as I did than going somewhere where it costs you a lot more in the long run..
