It happened! It happened! The dreaded\/desired McDick's has opened at the corner of Ossington and Bloor. \n\nI'm currently on a Big Mac high and am thrilled to have it on my block, though I'm fairly certain if you ask me in 30 minutes I will be pissed about its existence... until tomorrow morning when I realllllly want to go in for a hash brown. Or a McGriddle. \n\nThey have free wifi, are open 24 hours and the seating is pretty swank for a McDonald's. I should know, I have sadly been to a lot. One time I even had McDo in Versailles. \n\nPEPPER POINTS for their Grand Opening coupons. You got me! You got me good. \n\nPEPPER PLEADS: It's tasty. It's consistent. But please don't let it keep you from supporting the great local greasy spoons on the block, because we all know it isn't as good as those treasures.
