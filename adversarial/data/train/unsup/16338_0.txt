I first stayed at this hotel for my 22rd birthday with some friends. At the time, this was one of the top hotel\/suites to stay in along with the Palms. I loved everything about it. An awesome buffet, starbucks, gambling, clubbing ECT. \n\n8 years later the boyfriend and I return to stay here for a night. Welll actually we booked this for a \"napping place\" before heading home, but instead stayed an extra night in Vegas. The Rio does have some amazing deals on the weekday. If I can remember, it was $ 55.00 for a night. In addition, they do not charge a resort fee like the other hotels do, which makes it a hell of a deal. Make sure you have a Total Rewards card the more points on that baby that better you will be later on. However, with such a good deal comes the pit falls.......................\n\nWhen we arrived, a tour bus just let off a bunch of international tourists who had just came in from the airport and were eager to start their own Vegas experience. So picture this, a full lobby swarming with adults, kids, and granny's all with their luggage waiting to check in. Since I am such an amazing girlfriend, I let Minh stand in line to check us in while I watched our stuff.\n\nIt seemed like the staff at the Rio was working double time to get everyone checked in and moving onto their rooms. It probably took Minh about 20mins or so to get everything squared away and we were off to our room.\n\nOur suite was on the fourth room, okay not too bad. Highlights included:\n\n-600 square feet of spaciousness\n\n-Floor to ceiling windows. Our view was of the delivery area (awesome) at least we have curtains to cover that up!\n\n-Lounge area (One chair and a couch that turns into a bed)\n\n-25\" Television. You have to pull it out and twist it around to watch TV in bed. Make sure you push it back into the entertainment center otherwise; you will knock yourself out walking into it in the middle of the night. \n\n-Normal king size bed, with a down comforter and some flat pillows\n\nNow the not so great things:\n\n-Super paper-thin walls. They were so thin that we could hear our neighbor to the left of us sneeze and cough.\n\n-The guest who stayed to the right of us setting the alarm clock and it going off while they were not in the room. We were woken up to the beeping of the clock, which went on for almost 2 hours before we figured it was the room to the right. Called the front desk who apologized and sent security right away to the room. Within 15seconds, all was quite again.\n\n-While lying in bed talking the guest staying above us must have had either a pet or a small child staying in the room. As we kept hearing marbles rolling around the floor at all hours of the night.\n\n-After coming back from having dinner with our friends and finally falling asleep around 4:45am I was woken up to the sounds of high heels clicking up and down the outside hallway. This went off and on for about an hour.\n\n-Around 6:00am our neighbors above us have a heavy footstep and I honestly feared my life as the ceiling above our bed creaked and made scary sounds. All I kept thinking was I was going to see feet poking out of the ceiling pretty soon.\n\n-Water pressure in the shower was horrible along with nonexistent hot water. \n\n-No free WIFI. It was a pay per day deal which kind of sucked!\n\n11:00am was our check out time. Minh and I are not early morning people but we were eager to get the heck out of this hotel fast! We were pretty much zombies driving back home!
