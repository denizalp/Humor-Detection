Addicted to #28\n\nFinally made it in to my Summerlin neighborhood L&L!  So glad they opened this new convenient spot.\n\nLocated in the old 50s diner style restaurant you will find all of your favorite items and with plenty of seating and parking.\n\nWe ordered #28 Pork with cabbage and an order of the fried shrimp.  Both orders come with the creamy macaroni salad and some rice.  I love that the food is made fresh to order and it's still hot when you get home.  The shrimp is my favorite indulgence, perfect for those stressful days when you're craving some much needed comfort food.\n\nThis is a great spot that we will be coming back to over and over again. \n\nToday was a very warm day and it was a little warm in the diner, so I'm glad I got my order to go.  But I'll be back. I'm bummed I missed all the \"grand opening\" deals but look in your mailbox for coupons.  Go now.
