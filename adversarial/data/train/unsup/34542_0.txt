I called ahead to see the wait time for a smog check. I was told nobody was there but could change at anytime since it's first come first serve. I come by and still nobody. Yay for being first. \nI'm told pass or fail it's $23.95 for smog. I say ok. The guy asked if I needed help getting out of the car since I'm 9 months pregnant. I say I'm fine and head to the lobby. It only took them about 5 minutes. \nI've been getting my smog here since 2010. Usually it takes 15-20 minutes. I like this location since it's easy to get out of the plaza when they're done. Also my contact info is in their system so checking out is quick.\nI wouldn't come here if they're busy though. There's only 4 seats in their lobby area. So always call ahead.
