I'm surprised this place has such mixed reviews. I've been here for both lunch and dinner a couple of times and have never been disappointed.\n\nService is fast and friendly, I LOVE the menu and the quality of food is great for an AYCE. \n\nGreat chicken dishes, maki rolls and pad Thai. The best ever green dragon rolls are here, it is a must on the menu!\n\nThe price is above average for AYCE but I think is worth it based on menu and decor of the restaurant. \n\nTip: very busy on weekends and no reservations policy. Arrive early or plan to stand around the hostess table as there are only two chairs.
