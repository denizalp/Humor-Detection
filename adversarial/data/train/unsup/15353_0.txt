The Frozen Yogurt gods have answered my prayers. \n\nI've been a fan of this style of frozen yogurt since 2004 when I discovered Red Mango in Seoul, Korea.  It's more tart, less sweet and hella delicious. The craze for Red Mango and its rival Pinkberry has been spreading through the States faster than a Malibu brushfire, so it was only a matter of time before TO caught on. And it's here now, bitches!\n\nProps to the Blushberry crew for knowing how to launch an opening; invite a bunch of Yelpers to get the word out. We totally got the VIP treatment from the staff: free small fro yo with as many toppings as I wanted (plus a T-shirt cuz I'm elite!), then samples of other yogurt flavors and a smoothie on the house. I started with the original yogurt with strawberries, blueberries, and granola*. It tasted exactly like Red Mango and all the toppings were fresh. I also tried their signature Blush yogurt (infused with Pom Wonderful pomegranate juice) and was pleasantly surprised to see how subtle and lovely it was.\n\nBlushberry has a cute sidewalk patio covered in bright, green astroturf. In fact, the whole store is adorable but not cloying. If Hello Kitty grew up and developed some edge, her shop would look like this.\n\nPrices are reasonable:\n2.50 (small)  3.50 (medium)  5.0 (large) for the original fro yo\ntoppings are: 0.95 (one)  1.20 (two)  1.45 (three)\n\nGo there now! I'll prolly see you there cuz I'm mad for this stuff!\n\n_________________________\n* Choose from toppings such as...\nfruit: banana, mango, strawberries, kiwi, pineapple, oranges, raspberries, blackberries\nhealthy: walnuts, almonds, granola, dried cranberries, shaved coconut, dark chocolate chips\ndry: Cap'n Crunch, Fruity Pebbles
