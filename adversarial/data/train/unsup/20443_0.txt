I hate this foresaken place. To go from one terminal to the other you have to walk for two days and get blisters on the palms of your feet!!! It has the worst set up, no trams what so ever, the waiting areas are tiny tiny tiny; there is no where to sit, you see tons of people sitting on the floor. Not a lot of places to eat either and the restaurants all serve their beer in plastic cups, how classy is that for a $10 beer? I can't rate check in or security check thru's because I only experienced a connecting flight but my experience was a 0 star, nightmare!
