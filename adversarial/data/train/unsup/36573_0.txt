It's actually a 3.5 stars rating. Everything was good, but not that spectacular. \n\nThe place is very spacious and casual, with a big outdoor area. We came here for dinner on Black Friday, the place was pretty filled yet our wait was not too bad (about 10-12 minutes). We picked indoor seating, where I felt the lighting was a bit too dark. We ordered the Atlantic Salmon and the Free Range Chicken, the salmon plate looked very neat, but for some reasons, I did not like how the chicken was presented (see pics) . My salmon was juicy and flavorful along with the roasted beets and potatoes. Didn't try my friend's chicken since I wasn't impressed by the presentation at all.\n\nThe service on the other hand was excellent!
