If you're a fan of deliciously unhealthy sandwiches, you'll love Twisted Meltz. After trying the double James Harrison, I'm going to have a hard time finding a more flavorful and filling sandwich. Burgers, bacon, and onion rings complement each other unsurprisingly well. It's fairly heavy, so not something you'd want to order every day, but it makes for the perfect cheat meal.\n\nThe battered fries and fried pickles, although a bit soft because it was a takeout order, were still on par with the sandwiches, and both were reasonably priced. For the not-so-health-conscious, I'd definitely recommend Twisted Meltz for classic melt sandwiches with a creative twist.
