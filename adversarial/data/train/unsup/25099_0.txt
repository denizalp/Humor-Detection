This review pertains to the breakfast buffet. I have been to several breakfast buffets in Vegas and so far this is my favorite. TONS of options. Omelets, eggs benedict, waffle, pancakes, sausage, bacon, etc. Their fresh fruit selection was fantastic! I was also amazed at the HUGE selection of muffins, rolls, and pastries to choose from. Free beer and wine was also great. Everything was kept fresh and nothing had that sitting there buffet feel to it. I loved it and would definitely come back, especially considering the price.
