I met two friends for dinner.  I have been wanting to try Ramsay's BurGR for some time but never got around to it.\n\nI ordered the chanterelle burger, rare, and an order of truffle parmesan fries.  The two friends got different burgers and another order of the same fries and we shared both orders of fries.\n\nService was good.  There was a wait for our burgers, but it was quite alright as it gave us time to catch up.  We hadn't seen each other in about 10 years.  A lot of water under the bridge.\n\nThe food arrived and it was cooked the way I like it, juicy, red, and very tasty.  The brioche bun was perfect for the burger.  The truffle parmesan fries are a wonderful accompaniment.  I also got an iced tea and it was refilled a couple of times without me having to ask.\n\nWe skipped dessert because we had a good amount of food between the burger and the fries.  I'm definitely a fan of Ramsay's burger joint.
