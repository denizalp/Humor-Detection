I'll keep it short and sweet because I really wanted to like this place celebrating a special occasion, but in the end I just couldn't. Just a preface, there were about 3 - 5 tables in the entire restaurant (not busy).\n\nPros (kinda):\nCoursing menu overall was great minus the bland entree, which included large amounts of broccoli (the only item I asked to not have). Looks like other reviews complain about similar misteps, one of which required an epipen.\n\nAmbience is very nice.\n\nCons:\nThe coursing menu took 3 hrs 15 min and we rushed our way at the end. That's fine if expected but insanely slow on an obviously slow night. To be honest this was the overriding factor which basically ruined the night.\n\nSat for 20 min until I flagged down the hostess to get a drink.\n\nNoticeably frustrated, the staff was unapologitic. That sealed the deal to write a review.\n\nFor the price point just not worth it. For the $$$$, simply need better service.\n\nSorry, I rarely ever review, but maybe this critique will prepare others or get the restaraunt to speed their coursing up. There's a lot of options in Phoenix and at this point your money is better spent at many other establishmemts.
