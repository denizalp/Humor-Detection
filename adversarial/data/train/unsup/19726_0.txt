Huge props to J-WoW for orchestrating and inviting Linh and I to do something new.  This week, it was Vino & Canvas, a wine and painting party, which contained no wine, unless it was in the acrylic set we were using.\n\nBeing from the hood, I thought I'd just roll up with my spray paint tag-banger set, which is marketed as Crayola Airbrush Markers, also known by their street name: Blo-Pens\n\nBut no, they dont allow outside food, beverage, or spray markers with stencil sheets... and that's okay, because when you walk in, you'll see your station, ready to go, with some sparsely drizzled colors on a Styrofoam plate.  You'll use all that real estate, like Foofa, for mixing up colors!\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h_SvDFPG6tc \n\nAfter taking some fun photos, we returned to our stations as the instructor was preparing to start.  Once it began, J was a woman possessed.  I had to stop and gaze at the wonder of her perfect circular strokes on canvas.  She flowed with speed and grace, and it was noticeable right away, that she is a talented artist.\n\nBut I'm an artistic \"leper\", or \"lemur\" at a quick glance.  So I listened to teacher and followed directions, not jumping ahead, and though my painting lacked the aesthetic qualities of J-WoW's or Linh's... mine was the only one to feature SpiderCat.\n\nAnd super bonus brushes... guess what other Yelper was all up in the mix?  Chris H was, and we all got a photo together holding our finished products!  Yelp Represents!
