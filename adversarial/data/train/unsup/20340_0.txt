The worst Sushi \"place\" I have ever been to in Clark County.  Absolutely not what one would think is a Sushi bar.  There is no sushi bar. YGS is more a Coco's that serves sushi but the service sucks.   That is the big beef for me, service, and not so much the sushi, which was a three star experience.  The service sucked.  There was two waitresses and the joint was not busy.  More content with BS'ing then serving, thoughts of making a mistake and never returning ran unabated through my head.  Once again, A-OK cuts of fish but the atmosphere and complete lack of customer service means I will never return.
