Wow.  Just wow... \n\nTucked away in what seems to be an industrial area at Eglinton and Laird, Adamson BBQ lives up to the hype!  I read several reviews from various sources (Yelp included) and I've been waiting for my chance to experience this place firsthand! \n\n4 adults ordered the $100 platter which included basically everything on their menu.  We wanted to order the beef ribs too but, sadly, they ran out while we were still in line.  Note to self, go EARLIER next time!!!  They open at 11am but close when they sell out.  You never know what the demand will be so why take the chance?  We did add the chicken (half for $12) and were not disappointed.  \n\nI was really impressed with the meats!  Everything was moist, well-seasoned (not overly salty or sweet) and just delicious!!!  Even the turkey was good and that can be a hit or miss at other places!  I think our overall favourites were the ribs, the brisket, and the sausages though.  The potato salad was excellent and the beans were tasty too.  The coleslaw was probably the weakest link of the sides, but it felt good to eat some bites of veg in between those mouthfuls of meaty goodness!  \n\nTheir house made dessert was a sweet, but not too sweet, ending to our meal.  Coconut cream pie!  It seems like their desserts change regularly.  They have cookies too!\n\nYou can pre-order 3 days in advance (minimum spend of $100) and save yourself the process of lining up.  We enjoyed eating in their \"warehouse\" (for lack of a better word). It felt extra authentic sitting on a bench, fingers all sauced up, you get the picture!  \n\nIf you're a meat lover, a BBQ fan, or just want to try something different, you need to come here!  5 stars for sure!
