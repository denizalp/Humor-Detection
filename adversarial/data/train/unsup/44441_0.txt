WHAT TO EAT?\n\nI like the dinner and brunch options at Summit Garden. I've been coming to this restaurant for many years, and I don't have much to complain about the quality of the food I get. Most recently, came here for dim sum after over well past 5 years. If you have trouble visualizing the dim sum and require pictures, this restaurant might be the place to eat when you're craving dim sum. Still utilizes dim sum pushing carts, you can go right up to the cart and ask to see what kind of steamed or fried dim sum the cart has to offer. Some like this personal experience of opening the lid of the steam basket and seeing what kind of scrumptious deliciousness lie underneath. The dim options are really vast and great!\n\nLAST TIPS?\n\nDim sum? Go on a Saturday or Sunday to see the full extent of dim sum they have to offer. I highly suggest their spring rolls and their roast pork if you liked fried food! Their roasted pork is one of the best in the city! Crisp pork skin with a great crunch and pork looks fresh. You won't regret getting anything from their barbecue menu, I can guarantee that! ;)  \n\nTheir roasted duck too!! Try the Peking duck dish!
