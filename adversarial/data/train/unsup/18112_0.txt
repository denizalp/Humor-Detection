Came here for Late night griLLing|grub sesh after waLking the strip.\nGood reviews on YeLp and them cLosing at 3AM made this a no-brainer. [AYCE was the cherry ontop!!!] \n\nOur party of two arrived @ about 1:35 and was toLd that Last caLL was at 2AM. WompWompWomp. \nAt this time in the night and due to the hangry-ness that was kicking in, we gave it a go anyhow and just hoped for the best.\n\nJayden was our server and he was poLite and extremeLy patient. I urged my man to just order an ish-Load of food and caLL it a night since we were given such a smaLL time constraint. Our server kindLy stepped in and mentioned that we were free to order whatever we wanted but there wouLd be a charge at the end with whatever food was Left over [keep this in mind peopLe].\n\nThe banchan came out first and aLthough everything was good, the fish cake (which is normaLLy my fave) was simpLy ok and there was no japchae offered [Boooooo!!!!].\n\nThat being said, the other foods that came out were AMAZING. Meats were weLL marinated and I didn't need any dipping sauces. The absoLute highLight of the night were the buLgogi and Korean ribs. \n\nWe'LL make a trip back, especiaLLy to try the Affogato ice cream with Korean coffee. \n(We were bummed to find out that this item was incLuded in the \"Last CaLL\" notice too). UntiL next time Hwaro.....
