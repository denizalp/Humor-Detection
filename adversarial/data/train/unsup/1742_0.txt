I love SiVousPlay but the lawrence square location is the only one I cannot recommend due to the staff, mainly the manager. He is racist towards caucasian males and doesn't make eye contact when speaking. If you'd like to try something on you're out of luck as the manager does not allow access to changerooms due to theft issues. He says it's the company's decision but after speaking to a manager at a different location I was informed that it is up to the manager's discretion. Even the Jane and Finch location (Yorkgate Mall) is better and even they allow access to changerooms...
