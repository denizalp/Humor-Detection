I've been to Renee's twice and both visits were incredible. \n\nMy first appointment was with Cathleen and when I made my second appointment I couldn't get in with her and was bummed, but ended up with Kelly who did just as incredible a job! They really work with you based on your needs. The atmosphere is incredibly relaxing from the time you walk in the door. I walked out of there feeling more relaxed than ever!\n\nLooking forward to trying out some of the package deals in the near future! I can feel the stress melting away just thinking about it.\n\nMy only gripe is parking - be sure to think that through depending on what time your appointment is, downtown Willoughby can be a pain.
