RED VELVET PANCAKES with whip cream and mini chocolate chips!! \n\nI'm a sucker for red velvet pancakes!\n\nFinally went to Babycakes this past Friday :D\nMy friend\/high school classmate was visiting from Florida so I wanted to take him to a yummy breakfast spot! I've been wanting to try Babycakes for the last 2 months and have been waiting for someone to visit me in town so I could experience Babycakes with someone else. I didn't realize that Babycakes is 8 miles north of me... but it was worth the drive!\n\nCame in around 10am... no wait.\nWe both ordered the portuguese sausage, eggs and rice... I got the red velvet pancakes and my friend got the white chocolate chip mac nut pancakes. Both pancakes were delicious and you can't go wrong with the local favorite portuguese sausage eggs and rice.\n\nI would love to come back again... when more friends visit me in town again. \n\nPay your bill at the counter. casual dining. stress free parking. good customer service.\n\nIf you're visiting Vegas or a local... make Babycakes on your to eat list!\n\nI'll be back for more!!!\n\nAloha...\n-Miss Yelp 2011
