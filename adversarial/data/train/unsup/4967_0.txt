This review is for the \"nightclub\" portion of Lavo, as we did not eat here... \n\nI despise the lines, the douchebaggeriness, and the crowds of all clubs in Vegas in general, as I'm the kind of guy who actually likes to dance when I go to a club. But Lavo makes everything significantly worse. Except the lines, because nobody wants to go here. Neither did we, but some of the girls wanted to dance and nobody wanted to venture out into the freezing blizzard outdoors to get to a better club. Alas, we walked over from our room at the Venetian and decided to check this place out. \n\nThe first thing you'll notice is that this place is tiny. I mean TINY.\n\nThe second thing you'll notice is that it is ridiculously crowded. Let's make this very clear: you will NOT be doing any dancing here. If you're one of those creepers who considers \"bouncing up and down while trying to grab a little bit of anything else bouncing up and down\" dancing, then you might have a good time. If you've got any real moves, you'll be really sad because you'll never get to use them. And I'm freakin' fabulous, so I've got some serious moves.\n\nThe third thing you'll notice is that it's hot as all hell because of all the disgusting people packed in like a can of sardines. I'm not a stickler for rules, but Lavo managed to actually make me say (and this is the lamest thing somebody could EVER say at a club): \"Dude, we need to get a fire marshal in here...\" And I meant it. I don't think I've ever thought that in any other situation in my life. Ever. \n\nI might be able to comment on more things about Lavo had I decided to stick around, but I did one walk around and decided I'm out. Save your effort and go somewhere else.
