This is the Panda Express that is located on the west side of Rainbow Blvd, just south of Arroyo Crossing. You will actually find it in the same strip mall as Capriotti's.\n\nI remember when I first moved in the area at the end of 2014, I tried to buy food here once about 1\/2 hour before closing and there was literally 2 items to choose from. They apparently started prepping for their closing a bit early. I walked out without getting anything because even those two items looked pretty disgusting. I was wildly unimpressed and only recently decided to give them another shot.\n\nStill wildly unimpressed.\n\nGrabbed the 2 entree\/1 side combo and went with the orange chicken and angus beef with the fried rice. The Angus beef was good, but I didn't realize they add a couple of extra bucks to your bill for that as a \"premium\" item. Okay. Wish tht was clearly marked, but whatever. This actually tasted good. Fresh and tender.\n\nFried rice was pretty bad though. How do you screw up rice?? It was very stiff\/stale and I could not finish it.\n\nThe orange chicken was alright. Some parts were overcooked. Other pieces were good.\n\nService was pedestrian. Food was not good, except for the portion I paid extra for. From now on I will just go back to the Blue Diamond location. I usually get solid service and definitely better food at that location.\n\nNo mas for me at this location.\n\n2 stars.\n\nMeh. I've experienced better.
