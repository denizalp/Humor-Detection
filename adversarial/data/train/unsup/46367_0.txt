Don't say it! I know it's Denny's. But it's never been this bad. It's 1:30 am and 4 tables, I've been waiting for 45min for my French toast. Best part when I walked in they gave me the menu and said to grab a table. I have to be nice since I just came from church mass. Just heard the cook mess up a egg order and call her self stupid. My dad says they should close early since they can't handle 4 tables, total of 8 people... funny! Good news our waitress went back to make our food. My French toast was ok and the staff was friendly, can't ask for much more. Merry Christmas Denny's thanks for opening 24hrs!
