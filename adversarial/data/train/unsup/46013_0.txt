Stayed here this week for work for a conference.  Was here 4 years ago as well!  Rooms are small and bathrooms even smaller ( I was in a standard King room).  We had food catered all week and the breakfasts were horrible (cold very few fresh selections), lunches were good and our gala evening dinner was excellent.  Today I asked for a late checkout as I had to present at 2 PM and was denied anything later.  I understand that this is the norm but no flexibility provided whatsoever.  I'm a member of many other hotel points programs and have status at other hotels and with my status I can get late checkouts.  Alas with Fairmont I'm a nobody so that's how I was treated when asked!  Location is great but there is lots of selection for downtown hotels in this price range and area!  Benefit of this hotel is it is connected to underground mall and train station with Place Ville-Marie.  Downside is it makes a good warm home for some homeless people in the underground as I saw last night!  Hotel was very busy with lots of different functions going on this week.  Experience was okay, nothing wow great, nothing extremely bad!
