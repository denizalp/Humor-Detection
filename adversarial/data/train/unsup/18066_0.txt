Came here at 9:30am today, which was Good Friday and we waited about 15 minutes for seats, which wasn't too bad. The seats were fairly spacious, for three people, we were given a six person table, and the newspaper came along when we ordered the tea.\n\nRegular price (because it is considered a holiday): \nS $3.38, \nM $3.78, \nL $4.18, \nSP $4.38\n\nWe ordered a total of seven dishes. The Chiu chow styled dumpling and chives and shrimp dumpling tasted average and we're average in size, the Chiu chow dumpling is usually massive anyways. I liked that they had a solid filling. It wasn't like those places that would try to put less ingredients in the filling.\n\nThe chicken pie was good, but since a lot of dim sum places offer this, it wasn't anything especially new to me. We also got a shrimp rice roll, which was standard to me. The rice roll though is quite smooth.\n\nI really recommend the green onion and lap cheung pancake because it's delicious when it's freshly made. In addition, their honey braised 牛仔骨 was quite tasty. The meat seemed a little overcooked, but it counted as a special dish, which isn't that expensive compared to many other places that charge $7.\n\nI didn't really like the radish cake. There was a lot of flour, there wasn't a lot of radish for me to taste and it wasn't crispy enough for my personal liking.
