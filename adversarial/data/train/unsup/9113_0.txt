victor did my tattoo, first he did not want to do what i ask for , i think it is because he simply did not know how to do it.  i then settled on a black widow, now i grew up around them and i know they do not have clear heads, and red hourglasses  on their backs.  but that is how it was tattoo, i lied said it was great so i could get the hell out of there, told all my friends don't bother, and then had it coverd up as soon as i was able, man that thing was ugly, but now i have a beautiful lotus flower thanks to dougie howard.  i would never retun, and all my friends that do not know; we soon find out.  and we all spend a lot of money on tattoos , so as you said chip we were paying your car off,  we'll go pay some one elses car off!!!!  when someone pays for a service, and they didn't get it; you as an owner should refund their money.  when they call you personally because this has happen more then once, if you really want to keep their business maybe the next time they call you,  your anwsering serving at sin city will be on meds.  Do not bother they will take your money, and go what ????   RIP OFF
