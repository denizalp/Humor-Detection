I've ordered food from the restaurant just one time.  This was the typical Chinese restaurant with 'not bad' food.  We ordered the Kung-Pao chicken (Yes, if you've read my other Chinese restaurant reviews, Kung Pao chicken is clearly my benchmark of quality) with steamed rice and a spring roll.\n\nThey prepare their meal in a relatively light sauce, somewhat runny.  It contained the typical vegetables and wasn't anything to shout about.  We did ask for it extra-hot; however, it was nothing more than spicy BBQ potato chips --and nowhere near Andy Capps hot fries.\n\nThe restaurant inside was pretty clean, and they were very efficient at making the food in the typical 5 minutes.\n\nIf I eat here again, it will only be because the Lotus Cafe down the street is closed due some freak event.
