Dining solo always can bring precarious dinners, even in the best restaurants.\n\nThe bar\/waiting area...lovely, busy, with the feel of the main dining area, however I was sat in the basement...with the bad kids at the wedding it seemed.  I was first sat at the worst seat in the house I assume, and asked for a different table...in the basement.\n\nI went for the Burrata appetizer, which was really wonderful.  Huge portion of a lovely cheese. My waitress tried to sell me the 20 dollar glass of wine and I  told her that if she sat me upstairs with the adults I might buy it.\n\nThe Cosi pizza was tasty,but not mind blowing.\n\nAn app, the pizza and two glasses of wine with tip, $85. If I had sat in the lovely dining area, ok.  As it was, just alright.  Thankfully I dined alone at Canoe the night before and had at least one evening on  my business trip where I was treated like a princess.\n\nNote to Terroni.  Solo diner at your place, not so satisfied, $85.\nSolo diner at Canoe $200 dollars and thrilled...use your little tables better.  Sometimes the solo ladies have money at home yes?
