I ordered the mac and cheese du chef. \n\nIt had Doritos sprinkled on top and it tasted gross. \nThe mix of their cheeses was great (Monterey Jack, Cheddar, and Poutine cheese) but it kinda created a mushy consistency and after a while I was kinda over it. It also came with bacon but I did not taste it at all.\n\nPrices are high but not so high that you feel like you're getting ripped off (depending on what you order. My Mac and cheese was overpriced (17$) good thing I had a coupon)\n\nIf you visit at lunchtime, it's completely empty.
