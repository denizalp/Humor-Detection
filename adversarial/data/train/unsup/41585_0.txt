We needed coffee beans and headed down to Lola's.  We noticed Centurion and decided to try it. \n\nWe got to sit at the \"Chef's Table\" which is just the table next to the postage stamp sized kitchen.  Chef Eric was fun to watch and talk to while he worked his magic.  \n\nCole was knowledgeable about the menu and wine.  While he wasn't quite as sophisticated as the menu he made up for it with his engaging and eager to please attitude.  The rest of the staff were all smiling and focused on making our experience a great one.\n\nWe had 5 of the tapas - the Risotto of the Day, Papas Bravas, Pancetta Wrapped Gnocchi, Chef Eric's Bolognese.  And for dessert we had the flourless chocolate tort - I mean the decedent chocolate creation that I will crave for a long time or until we need coffee beans again.\n\nThis is a must try restaurant!
