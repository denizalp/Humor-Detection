I'm so bad. I've been here more than a handful of times. And this is the first time I've gotten around to writing a review.\n\nHOH NO.\n\nNo bueno Irene.\n\nBig spots for Me?\n\nFrank & Alberts \"High Five\" Happy Hour. \nWait, you're not shocked right? There's major food and booze involved in my review. \n\nYes, yes. There's the pool And I'll DEFINITELY GET TO THAT. \n\nThe bathrooms have wonderful showers and the beds are like heaven sighed. Even if you stay near an elevator you'll never hear it. Room service is impeccable. (And they will go out of their way to deliver something special for birthdays.) The main lobby area is a special place to come for a fancy evening cocktail. You can come casual or dressed to the nines. \n\nSo...right. Happy Hour. 'Cause I like to drink and eat. \n\nUh...tucked right into the cutest bar you'll find a hub bub of activity come happy hour. Guest flock here. Locals flock here. \n\nFive bucks buys you a CORNUCOPIA of blessings.\n- Glass of house red or white wine\n- Four \"bar bites\" (really delish restaurant food)\n- Domestic beers\n- Some fruity cocktails (honestly you'd have to pull the menu for that. All I hear is mwah mwah mwah :)\n.... and appetizers are half off. \n\nNO JOKE! \n\nIf calories were no issue (or if I could exercise forever) I would eat here ALL.THE.TIME.\n\nI'll come back and write an entire review on Frank & Albert's one day. Just know this is a special treat should you visit the Biltmore.\n\nBefore POOL TALK a shout out must go to Keri Christian. \n\nWho is this? My favorite Concierge. \nYOU CAN HAVE ONE? Yep. I'm sure they're all wonderful. This one has a sense of humor. And carries a supply of bandaids.\n\nOk. So the pool area. Bring a floppy hat 'cause you're never going to leave. \n\nEh. I suppose that could be the review. But then I wouldn't be fair to explain how much FUN this place can be. \n\nCheck it. They will pull in DJs to rock out tunes. On Sundays in July and August the music is full on party mode. AND there are Happy Hour prices at the bar. \n\n(Just be sure to (a) ask for the happy hour pricing menu and (b) remind the bartender to give you the pricing each time you place an order. So as an example, draft beer is $3. But ask for it! Otherwise it will cost you eight bucks.)\n\nAlthough I've been told there is an \"adult\" pool. I'm not entirely sure where that is. All three pools in the Paradise Pool area were sprinkled with adults, families, kids ... and everyone seemed a-ok with the wild amount of booze. Hey, works for me!\n\nIf you're a local, this is a great place to have a staycation. If you're visiting, heck ya. This is spaceballs amazing. You'll never forget it. COME HERE!
