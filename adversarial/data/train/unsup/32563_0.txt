As a frequent business traveller, I'd been to the Molson Pub a fair bit for both breakfast and dinner. The Hearth has replaced the pub and with respect to appearance and food, this new restaurant is far more upscale and delicious but the service is still disappointing. \n\nI waited far too long at the podium before someone even addressed me, had to ask for a menu, had to ask for water, had to wait a long time for the bill and worst of all, when I asked for cream for my tea the waitress took the pitcher of cream from the adjacent table where a patron had just eaten and left! The cream was an small, uncovered pitcher! Very gross!\n\nThe stars in this review are for the food that came out fast, perfect sunny side up eggs, crispy potatoes and perfectly grilled tomato. \n\nI would suggest Chef Lynn Crawford think twice about associating her name to this place until they retrain or rehire the staff!
