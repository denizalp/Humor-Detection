These are salads, people, salads.  What did you expect?  Well, there are other options, such as rice bowls, wraps, and some soups that don't seem to justify the pricing.  And although I'm loathe to fork over a ten spot for my lunch, I frequent this place on a regular basis.   \n  The good?  I'm in the know with the ordering process.  The bad?  The menu is confusing and gets the newbies all flustered, holding up my lunchtime routine, and I'm a force not to be reckoned with when I'm hungry.   \n  I forgo the varied options and instead, attempt to toss in as many non extra charge items into my salad.  A number of protein choices are found on the list, as well as finely chopped up veggies, seeds, and a few fruit items.  Salad dressings are categorized to the suggested frequency of consumption, inducing a slightly guilted feeling when eyeing up a double serving of blue cheese.  Pffft.  However, I like the low fat Ranch, and the half serving I request doesn't send me in this direction.                   \n  The portion size is substantial, served up in a big recyclable tub.  Swishing down the street with said salad, stuffed with freebies and a pricey $2 bit if chicken, I like to think I illicit looks of lunch envy, as if I had an ice cream cone on a hot day.  Probably not.  But, a girl can dream, no?
