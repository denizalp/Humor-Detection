Not what we expected. We were visiting Charlotte and decided to try The Yolk. The dish I came for was sold out so I settled for a veggie omelet.  The omelet was overcooked to say the least.  The orange juice tasted spoiled and grits were just ok.  The waitress was incredible, that's why I gave it three starts.  Otherwise, it is definitely a two star restaurant.  Won't be returning.
