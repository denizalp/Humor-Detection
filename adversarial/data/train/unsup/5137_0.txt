BALLS!!!!!!!! This lady LOVES me some balls! Chocolate rum balls that is. I've never had them this good anywhere! Semi sweet chocolate on the outside, soft, deep chocolate with bits of fruit (raisins??) and just enough rum to register up some trouble on a breathalyzer. Yes, this is the place. I've been trying to buy a macaroon because I hear they are to die for. I've made 4 trips and still no cigar- sold out! I'd rate this place higher, but they are always out of things making a trip out there really hit or miss. \n\nCons- the store has a whole lot of things I'm not quite sure anyone would want to buy. It is strange. Nivea lotion, bakery items and preserved meats just don't go together. I get it- the whole German thing........ but ick.
