Kitchen Table made me feel like a true Yelper today. Tucked away in a random, hidden corner of a strip mall with not much visibility means it relies highly on strong Yelp reviews and word of mouth. The 25 minute wait they gave me also meant the food needed to blow me away. And it did. \nCommunal tables, Pinterest worthy decorations, clipboard menu, hipster mugs and a full pig being roasted in the back right before your eyes. The customers almost seemed fake and placed by the restaurant, I've never seen anyone in Henderson dressed this cute! Atmosphere, check. \nBreakfast\/brunch food that are all Instagram worthy, check. \n\nWe ordered the traditional benedict and the Shorty benedict. The pork was too good to pass up on, order the Shorty over the tradiitonal. \nThe pastrami hash had thick slices of pastrami that made me want to munch on pieces plain. It went perfectly with the potatoes and eggs. The toast that it came with was PERFECT. I consider myself a bread connoisseur and the bread was as soft and delicious as plain toast can get. Don't bother asking for butter or jam- ya won't need it. \n\nCome too late on a weekend and they'll be out of monkey break, coffee cake and biscuits. Kitchen Table was packed. I guess it just means I'll have to come back to try their pastries.
