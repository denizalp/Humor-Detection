I have to say I the sides were really good, I had onion rings and the mac-n-cheese. The burger was ok at best. I was excited that I could get beer cheese on my burger, but the meat was so dry and flavorless. At first I was confused so I tasted just the meat on its own and it was pretty bad. I hate that because I tried the sides first and was pretty excited for the burger. I would consider going back for the mac-n-cheese but it is unlikely. Oh well. I would say overall a good looking swing but a miss.
