A little glass of heaven! \n\nSeriously this new brewery is amazing; it feels like so many great SoCal spots, but smack-dab in Las Vegas. The style of shop, the knowledgeable bartenders, and the huge list of beers and wine is what really makes this place special. \n\nThe location is definitely a little sketchy, but the parking lot is gated and huge so there no need to worry about street parking. The inside has both seating at the bar and tables for larger parties, along with an outdoor patio and a tasting area that has a great view of the actual brewery. \n\nMy beers of choice for the first and certainly not last visit were Tenaya Creek Old Jackalope Barleywine, Abominable Pale Ale, and Tenaya Creek Tandem Double IPA. The Pale Ale was a solid first choice; very light and great way to kick start my palate. The Tandem looks light, but it has a subtle kick on the back end of flavor, this was definitely a beer that I could sip all day. \n\nThe final beer was total palate crusher, in a good way.  Tenaya Creek Old Jackalope Barleywine, this 10% beauty had a very bold flavor and an even stronger aftertaste and in most cases this is a one and done type of beer, personally though I loved it. \n\nThey don't serve food, but you can have food delivered, so it's all good. Yes, come here, drink here, and stay here.
