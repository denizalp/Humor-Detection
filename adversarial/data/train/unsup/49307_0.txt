I came in here yesterday with a friend to try this place out. I'm giving it a 3 star rating because of a few things that might be due to my American ignorance. We split an order of the veggie Samosas. The flavor was overall amazing and a bit spicy. (No complaints about that one bit). The only draw back was when I took a bite, I bit into a cold chunk of potato. Other than that it was pretty tasty. My entree was the Chicken Makhani. While the gravy was quite tasty, I wish they would have strained it because every bite I took I either was spitting out a clove or other spice. The chicken was a little burnt and made some fat or cartilage attached. I also ordered some garlic naan too. That was tasty but it too was also burnt badly around the edges. Overall it was an average experience but I'm going to go back and give it another shot.
