We went to this restaurant after a cousin recommended it to us. We have no clue what they saw in this place because the food was mediocre and the wait staff, while very friendly, were extremely overworked. I put the blame on management - not our server - forgetting to bring our drinks. The pancakes looked and tasted like they came from pancake mix and my omelette was way overcooked. Food was overpriced for the portions and quality.\n\nThere are only two redeeming qualities about this place. The space lets in a lot of sunlight and it's very wheelchair friendly.
