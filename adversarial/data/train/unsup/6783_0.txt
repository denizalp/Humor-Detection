You would have no idea that place was called Velvet unless you tried really hard to figure it out and it's awkward telling someone to meet you at the question mark place. Their motto is something to effect that their food is better than your mother's, which might be true if your mother's only cooking implement was a deep fryer. Although I will admit that their prices are pretty reasonable for this kind of food. \n\nA pint is $6.50, which isn't that bad, but also isn't great considering there is no real atmosphere or ambiance on offer at this place. They also only have four beers on tap (Amsterdam, Big Wheel, Keith's and something else). The service is also slow and aloof. Wouldn't recommend it.
