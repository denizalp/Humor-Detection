I love Indian food for its bold flavours and textures, but that is not something you will find here. If you are looking for an Indian food restaurant that tones it down on flavour, then this is your place ... Easily the most bland Indian food I have ever tasted. Sauces are much to watery\/runny too ... never again.\n\nUpdate: Apparently, someone from the the restaurant has called BS on this review...  See response below this review... Guess one person's opinion is meaningless if ownership disagrees with it. That's fine. But, I assure you, Amar S., I do not work for your competition. I am simply a customer that was very disappointed in your product.
