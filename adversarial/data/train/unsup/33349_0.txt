I always get the 7\/11Q with black beans and chicken fried rice. I love it. My mom and brother are also obsessed with this place. The snickerdoodle cookie is good but the volcano cookie is amazing, wish it was available all the time or at least every weekend instead of every other. All the different options allow you to change it up every visit if you want to.
