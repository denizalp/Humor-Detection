My son and I stopped at Be's and were very pleased with the experience. I ordered the number 7 combo and my son had the number 9. The pho was very flavorful and all ingredients were fresh. The portion sizes are huge and well worth the price. Very nice staff we recommend a visit and we will be back as well.
