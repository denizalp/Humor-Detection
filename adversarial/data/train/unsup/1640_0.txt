Hopped off the plane at McCarren with a dream and my cardigan...\n\nWe checked into our hotel at the Venetian and got settled in. By the time we decided to step out for dinner- I was pretty tired and just wanted something in my stomach.\n\nWe walked down to the Grand Canal Shops to see if something would catch our eye- and we found this place. The fact that they made their pasta in house was appealing to us.\n\nWe ordered the fettuccine alfredo with chicken, and vegetable pizza.\n\nWOW!\n\nI'm just going to say it... the pasta was probably the best pasta I've ever had. The texture and flavor was incredible. The texture was thick, yet chewy. Pasta typically doesn't have much flavor, but this one was def different than any other I've had. The alfredo sauce was creamy and delicious. The chicken was the only part of the dish where I was like- eh ok. \n\nThe pizza... wow. All kinds of flavors and textures going on in my mouth. It had onions, red bell pepper, zucchini, and mushroom (I believe they were shiitake, but I could be wrong?). \n\nI really want to come back for another pasta dish before I go home, but hello! I'm in Vegas! There are sooo many other amazing eating options... but this place was so good... we shall see!
