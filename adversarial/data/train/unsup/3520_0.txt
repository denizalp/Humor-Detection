Worst hotel experience ever.\n\nPulled into front of hotel.  No valet.  Went to front desk:  \"Just leave the keys in the car and the valet will take car of it, sir\".  Ok, I wasn't born yesterday and I'm not leaving my car with the keys in it so that anybody can drive away with it!  Should've known right there that this was going to be bad.  \n\nMy wife and I loaded our luggage and bags into the luggage cart, but no bellman.  Waited for 5 minutes but figured that I HAVE TO PUSH THE LUGGAGE CART INTO THE ELEVATOR AND INTO MY ROOM!   I've never had to do this myself.\n\nHotel is OK, room was OK, view was not so much.  Exercise room was old and decrepit.\n\nWorst part of my experience was checkout.  Checked out on Labour day at 6:30, called for my car.  By the time I pulled the luggage cart to the lobby at 6:45, no car.  I had to leave by 7:00 am to drive my mother to the airport.  6:50, 6:55...7am....no car.  My wife and I took turns biaotching out the front desk.  WHERE'S MY BLEEPING CAR!!!!??!?!  It was 7:25 by the time i got my car. It's not like they were busy, we were standing around yelling at the front desk and we were the only ones there, being that it was Labor day monday.   I threw a dime in the direction of the valet and proceeded to yell out some fine four letter words with it.  I paid $35 for this crap.  My mother missed her flight and was charged $300 for missing the flight.\n\nNEVER, EVER stay at this shiet hole.
