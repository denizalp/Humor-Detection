Great food for a chain....\n\nI especially love the jalapeno talapia and chocolate tiaramissu.\nuntil recently I would have given them 5 stars...but I got a rib eye that was tough...guess I should have said something....I'm pretty sure they would have fixed it as they have good service...but we had so much food I just enjoyed other things...I realized that Steak is probably best at a steak place and Italian places are best for pasta and other Italian.\n\nService is top notch,,,,nice atmosphere\nreasonable prices\nportions are kind of big...could easily share a plate with someone
