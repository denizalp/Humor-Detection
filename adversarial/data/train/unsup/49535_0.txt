I just purchased a dozen donuts for the family. We purchased multiple varieties (glazed, chocolate covered, speciality). I want to say that they were probably the best donuts I have had in a very long time. The ingredients are very fresh, and the quality of the food was top notch. The store had a nice atmosphere. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend for a nice baked goods breakfast. Buy your donuts local! Enjoy!
