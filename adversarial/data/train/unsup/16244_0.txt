2014 YELP 365 CHALLENGE - 95\/365\n\nWe saw this show on Friday night and it was a ton of fun. I am a huge Britney Spears fan and we were so glad that she performed all of her greatest hits. The show has had a few changes since it first started. Her outfits are a little different, and she no longer changes wigs throughout the show (which is a good thing). We weren't there for the singing, we were there for the amazing choreography, the spectacle of the entire show, and to enjoy her greatest hits and she delivered what looked to be a solid average show. Unfortunately, she is always one step behind or one step ahead of her dancers. And some times I would look across the audience and every single person is just standing idly with a blank expression on their face sort of trying to figure out if she knows what she is doing or is enjoying what she is doing? Some of it was awkward but the overall experience was fun. The bartender poured us some STIFF drinks, and we had a fun time dancing, jumping around, singing along. I think some people are confused about whether or not this is a concert or a Las Vegas Show. We treated it more like a concert and most of the people around us did as well. But looking across the audience, a lot of people were just standing or sitting and watching. Grab a drink and get into it people! The ushers were really fun too. Two of them told us to look out for her dancers in the audience which was cool.
