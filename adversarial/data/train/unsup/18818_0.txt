I bought a voucher from livingsocial here for eyelash extensions. BAD IDEA. The place is not hard to find, it is tucked behind the TIm Hortons. But once you head upstairs to the \"spa\" it is dark, deserted, and there were no other customers except for me, my friend, and later a gentleman?! (see below).\n\nThe actual eyelash were half-decent and the entire application was quick - around 30 mins. The eyelashes eventually fell out as usual compared to other eyelash extensions  I have had before so it was nothing special. \n\nThere were very 2 disturbing events that have made me questions this place:\n1) After completing the eyelash extensions - the cashier had the audacity to ask me to tip $15-20! I was appalled! I tipped what I felt was eligible which was obviously met with a scowl! \n2) I had brought my friend with me and she was graciously waiting outside for me - she later reported she saw a man enter the spa \"room\" with one of the spa workers than around 15-20 minutes the same spa worker came out in a robe and half-dresssed?! My friend told us this when we were well out of the spa and WE ARE NEVER GOING AGAIN! Thank god I did not use any credit\/debit cards as transactions as I would be very concerned for any illegal activity.\n\nBEWARE of this place.
