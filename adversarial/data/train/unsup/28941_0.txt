This was a great place to visit on the whim (especially if you don't feel like having to dress all fancy like me) nice variety on the menu and everything was reasonably priced for being mr pucks food in the middle of mgm. I started with an awesome salad! I can't remember the name but It was the freshest most delicious caprese version salad I've ever had. I of course got the vegetarian ravioli (was a corn stuffed pasta) was iffy on ordering it at first but it was very tasty and flavorful. I'd definitely come back here again. Great food that doesn't empty your pockets (completely, it is Vegas)
