I was dragged back to Wild Mango and, wow, it got worse. I tried the pesto-crusted salmon with coconut curry and vegetables. Clearly this restaurant sees vegetables as a garnish--the medley of potatoes and greens were diced so small I thought a spoon might be better to eat it with. The salmon was nice, but it--like the duck I tried previously--was stacked on a mound of inedible, starchy microwaveable Uncle Ben's sticky rice. The curry sauce, in an attempt to be artistic, was smeared on one end of the ridiculously long plate, though that was actually tasty. The mango cheesecake was passable, though I doubt it had ever seen an actual mango in the kitchen. \n\nTwo of the plates I received had large chips in them. The coffee mugs are ridiculously elaborate and made it difficult to drink from. The velour-ish chairs, again, were unwieldy and pressed you right up against your neighbor. It's just an unpleasant experience in the middle of suburbia.
