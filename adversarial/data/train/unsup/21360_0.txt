Happy to see a new sandwich joint open up close to home. \n\nIt appears that Mad city is owned by someone that owns a meat market! North Oak Meats?? Anyways, it was good to see them serving high quality meats. I ordered the mad city sandwich....what a bummer the first bite was! Bread was so very, very average. The amount of meat they put on the sub was disappointing to say the least. Add some more meat... I guess I didn't know I was ordering a sub roll with A Slice of meat on it, but in all seriousness. There were like 3 slices of meat on it, but not really. I also ordered a bacon ranch pasta salad.. Once again, average. \n\n\nAnywho, I will go back and try a hot sandwich as they looked pretty good. I want this place to do well! Stay tuned for an updated review. \n\nDid I mention how little meat there was on that sub?! \n\nUpdate- I will keep my rating the same. I had better food this time, but the service is so disjointed. They ask for your name when they take your order, but then they just yell out the sandwich name....um yeah, I'm pretty sure there are 4 other people that ordered the same sandwich. There was a couple that was waiting as they gave their sandwich away two times!! Hopefully they can iron out their production line. \n\nGood luck to this place.
