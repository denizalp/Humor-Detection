Wow great place and a great Cajun vibe. I've only had the shrimp and seafood jambalaya dish, but it was awesome! The only thing is the pricing. The menu that is on here with yelp must be an old one because there is about a $7 difference on site!! I paid roughly $20 for the jambalaya dish!! But great place, only thing negative is it is a little pricy for what you get
