Went here for a wedding reception dinner, and was pretty pleased with my food. The menu is set up for sharing and is kind of pricey, but they have tons of options. Me and my friend ordered the chicken teriyaki with purple mashed potatoes and it was super yummy! The service was good, but the food came out sporadically and took a while to come out, other than that everything was good.
