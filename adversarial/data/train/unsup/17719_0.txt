Took the family from Tucson, and we are all very picky when it comes to Mexican food. It's hard when you're Mexican and come from a family of Mexican restaurant owners. \n\nRed sauce=no bueno \n\nCarne asada= bomb \n\nSalsa= good\n\nBeans= good\n\nRice=ok\n\nTortillas=bomb \n\nCarnitas= eh...kinda dry\n\nAll in all, we will return. Staff was super friendly and on their game!
