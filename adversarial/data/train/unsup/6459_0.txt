Customer service was pretty bad. No, VERY bad. Not a single person greeted me as I walked in. In fact, I got stares that made me feel unwelcome or like they thought I was going to steal something. I was the only person in line and yet I felt the cashier was still rushing me.  I guess getting back to her text messaging was more important than satisfying her customer. \n\nThe food itself is nothing to go crazy for. It's just your average, what-you'd-expect Chinese food. I can honestly say, I'll never having a craving for this stuff. \n\nI received the same unwelcoming stares as I walked out. I even said \"Thank you, bye!\" too. I don't get it. How are they even still in business?
