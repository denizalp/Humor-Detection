I love this spa so much.  I love the fact that the resort has an adults only pool because frankly, kids get on my nerves.  \n\nI also love the hummus here so much I have dreams about it. But I'll get to that.\n\nThe spa is amazeballs.  Quiet, quaint, relaxing as every spa should be. I've had mani\/pedis, facials, massages here.  The attention to detail is spot on for a high end resort.  One cannot help but feel like a princess while you are in the spa as the staff are courteous, helpful, and friendly.  The treatments are all relaxing and pampering. \n\nAs I said there is an adults only pool.  Sweet!! No offense, but I really don't want to end my spa day listening to screaming kids or have them running around me.  No thanks, grown ups only please and the Biltomore offers such.  \n\nThey have a great pool menu and prompt poolside service. The hummus. Get the hummus.  They put a basil oil in it that just amps up the flavor. However, you have to ask for extra pita because they give you a lot of hummus and like 5 pita chips
