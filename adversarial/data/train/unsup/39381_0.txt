Food: I am no ramen expert, that being said everything tasted fantastic to me. Came out within 10 minutes for 2 bowls of ramen. \n\nService: Excellent, were greeted as soon as we walked in and directed to a table. Server was attentive and polite throughout the meal. One recommendation though, I was not able to tell it was debit\/cash only (did not see any signs). I had alternate forms of payment but I can see this being inconvenient for others. \n\nDecor: It's a small restaurant, seating was comfortable and did not feel crowded.
