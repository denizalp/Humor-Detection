I'm not sure where I read that Enrico Biscotti was the place to get to in the Strip District but wow, were they right. These are some magic dang biscottis. Crisp, flavorful and very, very tasty. Well made, they hold up well despite a brief dip in the coffee cup and then a munch. Perhaps a little crumbly but that's what a biscotti is supposed to do.\n\nI got an assortment. Walnuts, chocolate, almonds, all sorts of great stuff. I don't have a favorite - they were all excellent!
