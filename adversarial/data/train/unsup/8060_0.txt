I'm pretty certain the only reason this place has so many good reviews is because of the price. It's $20 for your basic massage for one hour which is very, very cheap. But as always you get what you pay for. There are mostly no private rooms and also the guy that gave me my massage didn't seem to have any training. His technique was reminiscent of mine and I have no idea how to give a good massage. Honestly, I don't think it was even worth the $20 (plus tip). It wasn't relaxing at all for the most part and at one point he was laying his fists into my back and legs like a sledgehammer. Very weird. Oh and he was clearly sick as he was hacking and coughing the entire time. He was also wiping his snot onto his arms. Gross. Lastly they have a sign at the front advertising a Yelp elite discount. The lady says \"oh we don't do that anymore!\" when I asked about it. Then why have the sign up? Kind of false advertising there.
