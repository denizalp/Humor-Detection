Love this place. I've brought my car here twice, and found these guys quick and honest. For my emissions test they checked first with the computer to make sure it would pass before charging me. Turned out my engine light was on which would mean an automatic fail, so I resolved the issue and returned later that day. The second time there was a very loud grinding which I guessed to be a bad wheel bearing. They quickly found some hidden bodywork which had come loose and was rubbing when the car was in motion. They could have made anything up to pad the bill but instead they quickly fixed the issue and charged me $40.\n\nI seems to be a small family business of three brothers which is also always nice to support. These will be my go to guys from here out.
