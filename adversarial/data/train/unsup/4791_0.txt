Cheap and friendly are the two big selling points for Big Wong! We were planning on Ramen Sora, but there was a wait at lunch time. I was too hungry to wait, so we decided to give the Beef Ramen at Big Wong a twirl. \n\nWe were greeted super warmly and given two big cups of steaming, delicious tea. We didn't want to go all in on the ramen, so we ordered one ramen ($5.99) and one garlic stir-fried choy sum ($4 and change). \n\nJust to be clear: this is not beef ramen. It is really more of a beef noodle soup prepared with thin ramen-like noodles. As beef noodle soups go, it is decent for a quick, cheap fix. The flavor is pretty rich, and the beef is definitely tender and tasty. Overall, the soup is very simple: broth, beef and noodles. \n\nThe vegetables were delicious, just like I like with heaps of garlic and not too much oil. Granted, there are only 2-3 green vegetables to select from, but any green is delicious when prepared with this much garlic. When the chef brought it out, he told us next time we should order the vegetable \"Thai style\" because he is Thai. I didn't get the specifics, but given his warm smile and clear passion for preparing the dish, I definitely want to go back and try.\n\nI would consider returning just for a lunch of well-prepared vegetables! I took my glass of tea with me, and as we were leaving, they were eager to top off my glass with hot tea. Such attentive, happy service makes you feel great about supporting a business. Thanks, Big Wong!
