This location in Pineville has EVERYTHING you could possibly need to prepare an authentic Indian meal. It is a proper full service grocer that has it all (though I may have overlooked their butcher section). Tons of frozen including vegetables and full meals. Loads of dry goods and at least a dozen varieties of rice from small boxes to fifty pound sacks.\n\nAisles and aisles of boxed and canned and jarred items. Sweets, savories, sauces, powders, veggies in bottles and cans.\n\nCoolers containing fresh produce and some unusual looking vegetables that I've not seen in the local Teeter. Again, if you're making an Indian meal then here's the spot.\n\nEverything had clear prices on it. Some of them a little high, but it is imported. That tends to add to the cost.\n\nThe place is super clean and the service was friendly.
