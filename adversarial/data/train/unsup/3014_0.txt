Alex our bartender, also our server at our booth in the bar was fantastic, probably the best that King's has ever had.  Immediately got us our drinks, bread, took our order & thanked Dad for his service on Veterans Day 11.11.17.  \n\nKing's doesn't give any kind of Veterans discount, which was disappointing, but Alex made up for it w\/ exceptional service.  Thank you!  \n\nGreat personality & right on top of everything such as the A1, extra ginger & side of avocado.  I ordered the Sake Sashimi, Yellowfin Tuna Tataki Sushi.  Mom's Fish n Chips w\/ Fries were great & dad's Top Sirloin was cooked perfectly, as well as the grilled asparagus.  The Spinach was a bit salty.  \n\n We will definitely be back!
