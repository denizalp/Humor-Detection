We ordered take out from Dragon Palace last night. My hubby went to pick it up on his way home from work and it was ready on time. Since this was our first time, we opted for the Mandarin Dinner for 2 so we could try a few things. I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food because it tends to be too greasy and salty for me; however, this was Seriously SO delicious! We were pleasantly surprised to see the take out containers packed full. The Mandarin Dinner comes with 2 Egg Rolls and 2 Pork wontons (greasy but that's kind of just how they are - the taste was good tho), Wor Wonton Soup (so delicious) with fried crispies on the side, Mongolian Beef, Sweet and Sour Pork, Pork Fried Rice, 2 Fortune Cookies and 2 Almond Cookies---all for $30! What a great deal! Let's just say we have leftovers for lunch (plus some) today.  \n\nI'd never had Wor Wonton Soup before and this was packed full of chicken, shrimp, pork, veggies all in a clear broth and it was so flavorful! I normally add soy sauce (actually I use liquid aminos) but that would have made it too salty. It was perfect just the way it was prepared! This was my favorite dish and definitely ordering that again.\n\nMy husband loved the Mongolian Beef - just all beef and green onions in a yummy brown sauce. Lots of beef!!\n\nThe Sweet and Sour pork was perfect! Sometimes I order S&S and there's overkill of too many onions, peppers, and pineapple, but not this one! They really focus on delivering you the pork! The only change is next time I'll probably request the sweet and sour sauce on the side because by the time we got it home the pieces in the middle and bottom started getting a little soggy.\n\nThe Pork Fried Rice is packed with pork, veggies and eggs. We were very impressed. So yummy!\n\nWe will definitely be coming back! :)
