I have been here now twice and have loved both experiences. They truly cater to your senses and needs. He massage therapists are friendly and ask if you need a more firm or soft massage throughout the process. I like that. The rooms are so clean and very quiet which is nice as well and the oils they use are great. The only reasons I can't give it a 5* is because of the distance from where I live in Henderson(you can tell they're great though because I make the trek) and because they kind of pressure you too a certain amount and quite personally I'd probably tip more if it wasn't so awkward. I can forgive them though because the massages are great.
