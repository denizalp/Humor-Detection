this place has all the allure of a stick-it-to-the-man DYI local bike shop.  If only the guy that ran the place wasn't quite so rude and elitist.\n\nIn the spring I got a flat tire and took my bike in for him to look at.  I left after the guy told me that fixing a flat tire was so easy his grandma could do it\".  Sadly, we don't all have the same knowledge of bikes.  \n\nI ended up fixing it myself, which is incredibly easy, but it would have been MUCH easier if he'd offered to show me how OR if he'd suggested i do it myself in a nicer, or more supportive way.  \n\nI should have known better, but a few weeks ago i needed a new rack for my bike, so i called around and Bike Fix had the cheapest ones.  I went in and bought a rack, the guy offered to put it on, but after the grandma incident I said i could do it myself.  I took the rack home and realized my bike was missing two hole necessary to install the rack.  I called bike fix to see if I could return the rack, to which the guy said \"ya, I knew you'd be back\". \n\nthanks, that really made me feel like a worthy human. \n\nI returned the rack, and bought the identical one, WITH a $3 Piece that would allow me to attach it to my bike, a few  blocks away.  then I intsalled the rack in 5 minutes. \n\nSO not only has bike fix never been able to help me with SIMPLE   bike issues, every time I've gone in I've been degraded and shamed.
