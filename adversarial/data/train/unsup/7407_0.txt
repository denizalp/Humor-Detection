I get more pleasure giving a one star review for this place than I did actually eating the meal.  Nice setting, great for kids, but the food is outrageously overpriced and on the level of a bad TGI Friday's.  I went once because of the kids.  If I go again, it will be because I hate myself and may be contemplating suicide, so if you see me, stop me.
