The food is decent. I got the Kim chi chigae and my cousins got the pork bone soup. I also got the spicy rice cakes. The food was pretty standard\/average and almost good. \n\nI didn't really expect much from a restaurant like this so was happy and satisfied with the food and the price point I guess is relatively standard.\n\nMy reason for such little stars was the upon asking for the bill I had requested a box for my rice cakes. She brought one out and my cousin asked for another box as she wanted to take the pork home since she didn't eat it and only drank the soup. I handed her my large box and asked the lady to just replace my box with a small one. She insisted to get a soup container for the pork but I explained that there is no soup we just want to take the meat. She rolled her eyes and went to the back and got me soup container anyways and the started to clear the table very rudely. I don't really know what I said to offend her so much but for that reason alone  I will not be returning because the food was not worth the terrible attitude. \n\nHaving said that, prior to this incident they were as cordial and friendly as one can imagine a Korean establishment with nonenglish speaking people to be.
