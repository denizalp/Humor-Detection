My wife, Grandma and I came here for Sunday brunch. I got the beef hash Benedict and it was very good. Everything was very clean tasting and not overdone with spices or too much cooking oil. I ordered a freshly squeezed orange juice and it was the best I've ever ordered at a restaurant. My wife and grandma shared the chicken pizza which was delicious as well. Nice view overlooking the falls too!
