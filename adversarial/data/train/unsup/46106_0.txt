I did a quick google search to find a company to ship my car across the country and basically chose the cheapest option. After setting everything up, I looked up the reviews and began to worry after reading some really bad reviews. I have to say that I did not experience any of what some of the reviews said. Booking the pickup and delivery was quick and easy, I was able to contact the guy who booked it for us via email with questions that I had after booking it. They charged our cc the day it was picked up. I took a bunch of pictures when we dropped it off to cover all my bases. We received a few emails letting us know where the car was and 15 days later we got a call saying it was ready to be dropped off. I scheduled a good time for them to drop it off and they were right on time. I inspected the car and everything looked good. I had a few things in the trunk and they were all still there, no damage to the car whatsoever. I'm very grateful we did not have the same experience that a lot of people did. Overall $804 total to ship my car across the country turned out to be a great deal.
