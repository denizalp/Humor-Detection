There Gyros are huge! Super Delicious. I wish they offered a combo plate with a Greek salad, Gyro, falafel, pita bread, and hummus. Or maybe a build your own combo? Greek fries were ok. I had expected them to be better though. It looks like a typical quick grab your food and go kind of place. A few booths to sit in and a few tables. Lets just put it this way, it's not a nice sit down restaurant. Their food is bomb though so I don't care.
