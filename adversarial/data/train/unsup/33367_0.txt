snapdragon salon is in my opinion the only place to go for a routine cut or a new style.\n\ni would encourage and recommend that you book an appointment with janelle.  she has been doing my hair for over a year and a half and she always does a perfect job.\n\nhowever, all the hairdressers are friendly and i'm confident anyone of them would give you the look you are looking for.\n\nthe salon is clean, stylish and very zen... so go relax and get a great hair cut!
