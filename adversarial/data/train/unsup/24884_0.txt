To all the people that are worried about their bodies when they go to a Vegas pool party...just get drunk and have fun because no one cares!\n  \nTips:  \nThere is always a free guestlist for ladies.  Ask around to promotors.  \nYou must be wearing \"fashionable swimwear\".  Security will turn you away if you're wearing regular street clothes.\nThere are lockers at $40 for the day to store your stuff in.  They have all types of cell phone charges inside the lockers too.\nFood and drinks are expensive but who cares.  The food is actually pretty good.  And the servings are pretty large.\nYou can't bring big bags or purses in.  Only tiny clutches.  They make you check large bags ($5) at entry.\nYou can't bring in any type of drugs, even OTC like asprin, ibuprofen, nothing...not even eye drops!\nYou can't bring gum, mints or breath spray.  Security said \"nothing that can go in your mouth\".\nThe security is way more strict if you go in General Admission or Guestlist line on the left side..  If you're getting a daybed\/cabana or have a hookup, and go in on the right side, they don't check your stuff as strict.\nGet one of those plastic cups with covers filled with liquor.  The slushy drinks are so good and they will get you f*cked up.  They're $40 and totally worth it, especially if you want to go in the pool with your drink.  Everyone starts splashing and you don't want herpe pool water filling your cup.
