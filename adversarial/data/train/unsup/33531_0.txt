For real review! First time ever eating at Border Grill, loved it and will be back! It's Mexican with a twist. For starters had the guacamole and tamales. Excellent! Next had chicken tacos, skirt steak and chicken Norteno. All three were dishes were truly amazing. My favorite was the chicken taco. My husbands was the skirt steak. The chicken Norteno was superb but we were stuffed. Server, Autumn was amazing. She is top notch server that should train other servers. Thank you for such an dinner and dining experience
