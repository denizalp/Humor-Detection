I am a fan of Thai food, and when I had lunch here it was very good.   Service was quick.   The hot tea was tasty but they never refilled it.   When lunch arrived it was well cooked but not quite as spicy as I had asked for.  But all in all, this was one of the better Thai place that I've found in Mesa.
