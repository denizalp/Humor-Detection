This is a small airport very close to downtown Toronto. As far as I could tell, it services Ontario and Quebec provinces (possibly other areas but I didn't check). It's a long walk from the entrance where your taxi\/Uber\/Lyft\/bus to the departure area but they have slidewalks to make it much easier. The lady at the Air Canada counter couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. She made the check-in process very easy and pleasant. She also told us that coffee (including lattes and cappuccinos) were free in the departure lounge. They were quite good! Another thing we REALLY liked was the the chairs in the departure lounge were very comfortable and had AC outlets on the floor next to them. Lastly, we accidentally met the pilot on our way to the plane who was also quite friendly and helpful.
