We stopped here on a recent Saturday for lunch and really enjoyed our experience. We've been to the one in Dilworth but this was our first time at this location. I am cool with both places. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered some burger that's like bacon on top of bacon with more bacon. I am one of the few people in this world who isn't over the moon about bacon. I mean, I like it but it doesn't blow my mind. Anywaysssss, he loved the burger. He had a side of chips that he really liked. They were a bit over cooked for my liking but good nonetheless. \n\nI had the pittsburgher with pimento cheese instead of American cheese and no ketchup. It was really good. The fries on it aren't really fries but more like potato sticks. They gave a good crunch though so I was digging it. The tater tots were also quite delicious. \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our experience.
