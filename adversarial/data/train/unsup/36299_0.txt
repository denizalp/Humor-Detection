Went to this place for the first time a few weeks ago, even though it's right down the street and I pass it fairly often. They have a very cute outdoor area in the back, with comfy chairs that have lollipops behind them! There are also large chalkboard walls, which can be quite entertaining after a few drinks. We didn't eat anything, but don't worry, we plan to this Thursday (I will report back then). I heard they have some pretty good buff chicken quesadillas! But I have to agree with everyone else, this place is quite corky, and a South Hills gem. The bartender did remember everyone's name, and was extremely friendly. Not the place to go to if you're looking to get wild though. They do a good job of keeping everyone in check.
