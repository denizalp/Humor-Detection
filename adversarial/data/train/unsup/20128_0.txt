Customers place orders at a counter on one side of the house (a store-like setting jamb-packed with various pricey food and gift items).

There was one busser that was being kept far too busy this Sunday afternoon.\n\nFor what they're charging you can get about equal quality at a place like NYPD Pizza and experience actual table service.

It's the perfect way to tell everyone in Arcadia that you have $38 to spend on a sports bottle.\n\nThirty-Eight dollars.  . .
