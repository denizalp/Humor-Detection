Well Bonjour, C'est Macaron!\n\nI'm only new to becoming a macaron connoisseur, but I can safely tell you one thing: Diana knows what she's doing. Not just in her macarons, but all the pastries and delectable treats at this Parisian style bakery (ask her for the chocolate salami, its literally the best). Diana just moved her location from the 5th Street Arcades to a pop-up shop at Legacy Village; so make sure you are visiting the correct location!\n\nThis is a fantastic bakery to bring friends, or treat your favorite little human to a special dessert. It's hard to not instantaneously fall in love with the vibrant colors and her French themes. C'est Macaron makes a gorgeous gift, and you can purchase a pre-packaged set of fresh macarons, or create your own unique bundle. I adore the earl grey, pistachio and lemon... you CANNOT go wrong there. \n\nBe sure to follow this bakery on social media. There's usually a deal running, and it doesn't hurt to check out the inventory of flavors before you journey over.
