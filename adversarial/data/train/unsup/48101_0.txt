I've had a lot of massages in my lifetime, but I've NEVER had the consistent results that I have from Yadi's massages. I'm kind of a gym rat; always working out and always doing endurance events etc. and frankly, I don't know where I'd be without her healing hands. Yadi has a very strong working knowledge of the body and if that's not enough for you, guess what? ... she's really fun to talk to during the massage!
