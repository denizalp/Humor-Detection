The great reviews on Yelp led me to this location while here in Arizona for work. I'm pretty picky about who does my nails so I was hoping for the best and I wasn't disappointed in the service, but I did leave with a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nI was warmly greeted upon entering and given a thorough explanation of the service. The salon is inviting and very clean. Soft music was playing and the temperature was pleasant. \n\nThe front desk staff joked that it would cost $1000 for a full set and I would soon find out he was joking, but not really! \n\nAngela was the nail tech assigned to do my set and she was friendly and professional. \n\nIt took her about 1 1\/2 hour to complete my set, and it's honestly one of the best sets I've EVER gotten. My acrylic is thin and natural and she shaped my nails exactly as I asked her to. \n\nHere's my problem and the reason I cannot give them 4 or 5 stars. When I started, I was told my price would be $60...35 for the full set, $15for the ombre and $5 for the shape. \n\nI agreed to this price so imagine my surprise when I was washing my hands and I'm told in my ear oh I have to charge you $5 since your nails are long,my boss is making me charge you. \n\nNow I'm not one to fuss, unfortunately this is a standard practice at nail salons and alot of the reason why I try to support people I know and trust and not just go to anyone. \n\nI went ahead and paid the $65 and left her a $5 tip because as I stated, she did do a GREAT job. \n\nWill I come back? I want to, but I don't like the switch and bait and added cost at the end. It's unprofessional and a bit unethical.  What's ironic is the front desk guy mentioned it being hard getting customers and getting them to come back. I see why and hopefully if he reads this, he'll know why. Your service isn't the problem, it's your business practices.
