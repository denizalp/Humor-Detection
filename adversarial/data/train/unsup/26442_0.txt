I absolutely love coming to KAYA.  The food is amazing! AMAZING!!! And they have a nice Beer selection on draft.  Id suggest making reservations if you're going to be eating dinner there any evening or lunch on the weekend. \n\nI've been there perhaps ten times now and the food and service are solid 10s.
