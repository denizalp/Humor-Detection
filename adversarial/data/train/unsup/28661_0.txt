Great place to live. Been here 2 years and never been happier.  Big draw for me was security gate.  When I first moved to Phoenix 3 years ago I lived in a complex without a security gate and unfortunately my car was stolen from it's assigned parking spot.  That's when I found Silver Creek.  Management team is fantastic, maintenance spot on, grounds well maintained. I also like having my own washer and dryer.
