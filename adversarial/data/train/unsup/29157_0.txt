I visited several months ago and enjoyed our meal so much with friends, I decided to bring the SO a week ago. Although I had loved the sharing menu that was designed for me for $60 then, I decided to ask the waitress what her favorites were this time around and I am glad I trusted her. Although we tried 5 dishes total there were two that really stood out.\n\nThe Japanese Wagyu beef gyoza with kabocha puree and su-shoyu dipping sauce was an excellent choice as a starter. The main attraction was the Ishiyaki hot stone, with dipping sauces was terrific. This dish was definitely on the pricey side so be prepared to pay a premium price.\n\nI knocked off one star due to the tightness of the tables. It's so tight that's it's impossible to have a private conversation and it's tough getting in and out from the side of the table. Although this will not deter to me from revisiting. \n\nThank you for an excellent creative menu and being a must go for sushi lovers.
