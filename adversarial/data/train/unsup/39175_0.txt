Dr. Ballard is without a doubt the best family doctor I've had in my 61+ years. I initially went to his office in Summerlin many years ago when it was called Lifesigns, and have been with him for at least 11 or 12 years.\n\nScheduling an appointment is very simple online. The exam is by far the most thorough exam I ever had at a doctor's office. Chest Xray, EKG, bloodwork, hearing test, lung function test, and ultrasound of all major organs, plus the exam. All this in about an hour or so. \n\nThe office manager Sarah Waghorn is an angel, and every single staff member is friendly, patient, and professional-wildly beyond my expectations. I do not do well with needles, but the girls always get me through it painlessly. They even retest my extremely high blood pressure again ten minutes after the blood is drawn, and I generally come back normal after the stress of the needle is over.\n\nDr. Ballard and Sarah and the rest of the staff treat every patient like they are family. I cannot even imagine ever going to a different family doctor.
