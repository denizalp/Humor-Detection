DO NOT GO HERE. This place is trash, should be put out of business. Went there to get car wash. When i got out the guy said something about my car being scratched. Wasn't sure what he said so went on my way. When I got out of my car I saw that the car wash destroyed my front bumper. Returned the next day to discuss the damage to the manga get. He denied any damage and said that it was there before. The kid who told me about the damage lied about his story to save his ass. They refused to fix my car and only gave me a number to call. Completely upset!!! This place has ruined so many other cars from what I read in previous reviews. They should be shut down. If you want to keep your car in good shape, I'd recommend staying away from this car wash!!
