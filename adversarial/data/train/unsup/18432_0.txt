Coming from Hawai'i, we only have a limited number of \"good\" clubs and dance venues.  \n\nSome things my friends and I look for in a good club:\nGreat DJ or DJs\nGreat atmosphere\nNice people\nOpen areas to dance\nGreat drinks & Bartenders\nA great club would include: all of the above X 10! And that's what we found here at Surrender. \n\nThis was my very first trip to the vegas lights and all that jazz so luckily I was with a few veterans, my boyfriend, a few of my bests and their significant others.  \n\nSurrender is one of my bf's favorite clubs on the strip, my bestie and I were excited to get our dance on!  Cover was a bit pricey, but I suppose that's what you gotta expect from Vegas clubs, but I do have to say, their clubs DO deliver on that price tag of $30 entry!\n\nWe walked in and the place was still bumpin at 130 am! There were a lot of people for sure,  when you head outside it's an open pool area with cabanas all around and couches in the pool!! Our first thought: it's so pretty!! The lights, the pool, the fountains, and of course the beautiful night sky!! \n\nThe people here were nice and friendly too, it was refreshing! Nobody fell in the pool on my watch, but we did see a guy try to jump to one of the couches in the pool! This place has a niche for everyone, you can gamble, relax on the cabana couches, sip a mixed drink, dance, or chat! There's room to move and talk! This place is a winner!\n\nJust like we do at home  in Hawai'i nei, it's mo betta to pre-game before goin to these clubs for drinks, one or two is good, anything more and you'll be wishin you bought those new pair of shoes instead.  \n\nLooks like I'll be going back to this club a couple of times this year, and I can't wait to Surrender  and dance the night away! =)
