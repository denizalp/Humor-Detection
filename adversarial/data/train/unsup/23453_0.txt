Like most Marriotts, your stay will vary depending on your status with the hotel chain. Presently: \n\nGold = Free Breakfast, Free Internet \nSilver = Free Internet \nEveryday Joe = $13 for Internet! A day! \n\nAll hotel-goers are not created equal. While this is commonplace, the lack of free wi-fi ANYWHERE in 2010 shocks me a little bit. \n\nBeyond that, this Marriott is pretty nice. In addition to all the standard Marriott-ness you've come to know and love, this particular Marriott is well-located right in the heart of downtown. \n\nHungry? There is a bar-slash-restaurant on the first level and a convenience store for all your snack and forgotten-toiletry needs. (Plus, free breakfast... if you are a bad-ass).
