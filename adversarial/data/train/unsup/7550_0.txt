It was meant to be. Walking along the rail trail with my hubs and pup, we stumbled upon Futo Buta's patio. They welcomed all of us and sat us immediately and brought out a water bowl for our thirsty pup. We enjoyed looking at all the Lynx riders and everyone passing by. It's a great place to people watch!\n\nThe service was great! Every employee was so friendly, attentive, and hard at work. I didn't see anyone standing around or walking around without something in their hand. This is how every dining experience should be. \n\nThe food is made from scratch, in house. Terrific! I got the Tonkotsu ramen and the hubs got the vegan ramen. Pork add to the depth in flavor in the broth. Ask for the Japanese 7 spice to add a kick to the meal. Slurp away! And for dessert, YES. \n\nNow we don't just have to watch the travel or food channel for a ramen bowl...we can get one in our own Queen City!
