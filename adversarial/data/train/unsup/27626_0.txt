Amazing pizza. I like the concept of the pay by the pound. The crust us amazing it is heavenly. The only bad thing is when they run out of the pizza you want. So yeah it is 20 different kinds of pizza (or whatever the number) but they often do not have all 20 throughout selling the pizza during the day.
