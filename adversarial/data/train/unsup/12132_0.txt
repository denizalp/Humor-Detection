This place is a little like the white kid in Scottsdale who listens to way too much rap.  It's in AZ center which will always have a pretty corporate feel.  Second it's in the old Pizzeria Uno and there was enough of the old decor left to still feel like one.  They did do some updates and the bar looks great, but the updates do just enough to make it feel like it's trying to be something other than what it appears.  The music that was playing was great and I heard plenty that was on the playlist I had going before I walked in.\n\nThe service was fair.  It started off a little spotty but quickly picked up.  Servers are definitely the stereotypical hipster  type.  Take that as a positive or a negative but it definitely goes far in setting the tone of the place.\n\nThe menu looked incredible.  I had a white pizza with jalapenos, onions, and chicken.  It was tasty but I felt the jalapenos were a bit overpowering and I love spicy food.  I saw lots of items with pork belly which is exciting and my update will definitely include something along those lines.\n\nAll in all I will give it another chance but was a bit underwhelmed the first time out.
