This is where my brother and his wife got hitched. Gothic as gothic gets and the pews were built for short people. When you sit down, your knees will bash into the pew in front of you. My little cousins said \"Its a castle!!\" when they walked inside so I told them there was a dragon in the basement. Apparently they nagged my poor aunt the entire hour long wedding about seeing the dragon.
