Supposedly considered to be the best pizza in all of NY. So I guess I came in with really high hopes. Went with a bunch of yelp elites after a long weekend of partying hard in Vegas. So this was our last meal before LA and we were quite excited. \n\nWeird location being in a mall, though you wouldnt notice until you walk outside. We ordered 3 large Pizzas. Pesto, White (garlic and cheese) and sausage and pepperoni  (cuz Dre hate veggie pizza). \n\nService was slowwwww. In fact they messed up our order, however they were extremely courteous about it that we got the original order as well as 2 small ones and 1 extra large for a total of 6 Pizzas! \n\nPizza was pretty good, I wouldnt say the best but still good and the fact they gave us extra helps. My favorite of the three was the white and the sausage and pepperoni. Crust is thin and foldable, new york style.
