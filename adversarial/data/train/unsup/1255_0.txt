It's about time to add my Yelps for The Strip. \n\nIt's just over 4 miles from the Stratosphere to Mandalay Bay. It will take you about 1.5 to 2 hours to walk non-stop. To be honest I've walked from The Cosmopolitan to The Wynn at a leisurely stroll and it was an hour (1.5 miles).\n\nIf you've ever been to Times Square in New York, it's the same insanity. Neon lights, tourists in all versions, and packed at night. \n\nIt's impossible to drive from 12:00 pm to 2:00 pm. No longer free valet parking at casino hotels, so walking and ride share are the options. Know you cannot hail a cab from the street. Taxi stands at casinos is the only way to catch a cab. \n\nI do enjoy a morning walking trek on The Strip. Less crowded with a few gals with their heels in their hands walking in shame. As few street folks up and about. \n\nAt night, consider the crowds marching like a heard of livestock. Armed with 3 ft frozen libations, you will encounter the Batchelor and Bachelorette gangs. The lovely slow moving elderly couple from the Midwest are always a stopping for no apparent reason. Discount tours, shows, happy ending massage, and strip club hawkers abound. \n\nThe police and county sheriffs are at every street keeping a watchful eye. Safety first!\n\nEnjoy the excitement. Viva Las Vegas!
