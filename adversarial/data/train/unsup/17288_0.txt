Steak for Christmas!  Great idea!  Stripsteak for steak--not so great idea... =(\n\nWhat i liked:\n\nThere were out of the Australian Tomahawk on this day.  Really?!? OK, fine...  Me and my buddy each got their filet.  Good crust captured flavor of the steak.  Yum!  Meat lovers, enjoy!\n\nWhat i didn't like:\n\nMy wife got the Kurobuta pork duo.  Dry as the Las Vegas Desert!  Bland as the desert sand!  She didn't want to finish so I gave a stab at it.  I didn't feel like finishing it either!  They should go back to the drawing board on this entree! \n\nSlow pace of the staff!  It was xmas and about 30 - 40% full.  Too much idle time between greeting us, taking our drink order, taking our food order, etc.  Timeliness, people!\n\nA big swing and miss for my choosing of this steakhouse.... =(
