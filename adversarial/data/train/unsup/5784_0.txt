If you're trying to eat healthy this is not the place to go. Not any healthy options on the menu. I got the Turkey Devonshire- the turkey was excellent, but it was swimming in the sauce. Everything is extremely salty as well. Another in our party got the smoked corn side - it was good, but would have been much better without all the spices. We also tried the \"Piggy Ears\" - again way too much spice.  Best choices in our group were the pulled-pork sandwich and the dirty fries.
