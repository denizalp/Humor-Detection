If I had more space in my tummy, I would've given this 5 stars.  However, I just couldn't enjoy all the yummy food they had there.  I was just STUFFED.  For $30ish??? all this gourmet food?   Incredible deal.  My favorite - the pesto mashed potatoes.  YUM YUM YUM.  They also had sushi (rainbow roll, salmon nigiri, etc.)  It was very delicious!!
