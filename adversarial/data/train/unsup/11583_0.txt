10:00pm and the place was pretty packed, but I managed to snag one of the few bar stools available.\nMy wife was wearing heals, so being the gentleman I am, I gave her the seat and stood just behind her.  \nI feel a pair of hands touch my sides, and then lovingly glide gently down to my hips. \n\"Oooh La La...\" a gentle voice whispers in my ear.\nThe hands grip more firmly, yet in a teasingly manner. Was that a gentle squeeze? \n\"Kenichi Wa...\" that same amorous voice...my heart tingles...\nThe tender hands push me slightly to the left, a warm body brushes  against my backside.  \n\"Pardon moi...\" that sweet feminine voice sings to me again.\nI turn my head to the right to see face of this mysterious and seductive voice...\nThough its dark inside , I could still see her beautiful face is flawless, perfect eyes, smooth pale white skin, plump ruby lips...Madame Mado herself? \n\"So sorry handsome, I just wanted grab a drink before I go on!\" -Mado\n\"Oh no worries, you're good!\" -Chun P.  She's real good...if only my wife wasn't around...\n\nIts a $13 cover charge and so worth it! Even though the show is about 80% in French and only 20% in English, the music, performance, and sexiness of the shows don't need any translation and are 100% awesome.  The friendly bar staff spoke perfect English, and cocktails are only $6-7 each(I'm talking Canadian dollars, so its only like $5-6 each in US dollars!).  Good times!
