Wonderful place. The shrimp starter was absolutely the best item I had, South End Shrimp!!! I could eat the whole bowl! The servers are fabulous! Friendly, polite, personable ! Very impressed!  I usually don't like champagne- but the prosecco was very delightful! \nMy negative would be the VERY dim lighting. It was so hard to see the menu & the food. The beautiful presentation was lost in the darkness. Literally had to use the flashlight on my phone to read the menu. \nEveryone was so pleasant- what a great experience !!\nVery busy place on a Tuesday night! \nFree valet parking \nAnd should it matter to you- they have 2 single use Unisex restrooms. \nThis would be an excellent date location.
