It's such a shame that the service doesn't match the food and decor...  This is our third time visiting.  Service has left a lot to desire each time, but the food is what has brought us back - until now...\n\nEarly this afternoon, it was apparent that the owner\/manager was not there.  Staff was clearly heard complaining to eachother as guests where trickling in.  One example:  \"Oh Gawd, they just keep coming in.. We are trying to leave!\"    Umm.. Really?  \n\nServer didn't know how to make a latte.. brought me an espresso with cream floated on the top instead.  He had the audacity to say, \"Well, what did you want then?  It's a latte.  There is cream on it, but we are out of large cups.\"  Really?  The latte cups are stacked adjacent to the machine.  He then told me that he's never made one before and would find someone to make it for him.  I should have known better and cancelled the order there.  Instead, watched someone show him how to make it on a filthy dirty machine...  the frother is crusted over.  Neither one of them bothered to clean it off when they were finished either.  The water bottles can be a nice touch, but they need to be clean and water spot free, in the bright daylight greasy fingerprints from crappy waiters man-handling them look disgusting.\n\nServer only came around when it was time to give us our check.  He was really charming when we were getting ready to leave a gratuity.   We left just 15%.\n\nAgain, the food is really good.  The cooks seem to be the only staff that gives a damn.   \n\nThe waitstaff doesn't have to worry about us being a bother to them by coming in for lunch\/dinner\/or brunch again.\n\nTo the owner: \n May we suggest some customer service staff training?  We are a very laid-back and loyal repeat-customer type couple.  This is the 3rd time sh*&+y service for us.  We won't be back!!
