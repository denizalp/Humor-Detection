Been to Holsteins quite a few times and it's a great gourmet burger place located at the Cosmopolitan. It's in the East Tower second floor. You can reach it straight from the East Tower parking structure. \n\nYou have the option of dining at their bar or small lounge area with full menu or sitting in their dining room. It can quite busy sometimes so don't be surprised by a wait. \n\nTheir menu isn't all burgers and fries. There's a wide selection of apps and milkshakes! They're also known for their fun \"adult\" aka alcoholic milkshakes. These shakes are no joke! I saw one that has an entire ice cream cookie dipped into the milkshake! I've tried the birthday cake one and it was quite tasty but very very filling (and I can't help but cringe at the number of calories with each milky sip)!\n\nAs for burgers I've honestly only gotten one thing, the Rising Sun. Kobe beef patty with tempura avocado and sweet potato shavings. YUMMMMM it also comes with a side of fries which you can upgrade for $2.50 to onion rings or sweet potato fries. \n\nI've wanted to try the other burgers but why stray from something I already know I love?!
