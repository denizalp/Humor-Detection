When your all buffet-ed out and you want some good izakaya style Japanese food, I recommend Ichiza. Open kitchen with cute Japanese waitresses that serve you Kirin on tap. Awesome.\nLots to choose from. Everything on the menu plus added menu items on the wall are all available to order. Anything from vegetable croquettes , albacore carpaccio, ramen to yakitori like tsukune and tebasaki. \nSome noted yummy dishes include: yamaimo (mountain yam) tempura, deep fried squid cartridge, red snapper carpaccio (don't eat the lemon slices with it), ikura oroshi, unagi kakiage roll, and of course the bread toast thingy with honey and ice cream :)\nGreat service and the food was on point. \nWill be coming back
