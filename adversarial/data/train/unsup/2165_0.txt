\"All this time you were pretending. So much for my Happy Ending!\"\n\nIf you searched \"happy ending massage Las Vegas, NV\" on yelp and it lead you to my review. Tisk tisk!! \n\nAww yeah, I was in Vegas doing my thang... Okay maybe my Vegas adventures are not what they use to be, but a few friends of mine were convinced we could get a relaxing massage for $20 to $40 dollars for full body. I didn't believe them. So after a nice bowl of Pho, because that's how we do.. (There's only so many buffets you can eat in a trip) we decided to get a massage before heading back to the craziness that is the Las Vegas strip. The first massage place we walked in to was right next store. It was a little questionable.. The price was $80\/ hr and the lady working at the front desk insisted on showing us her girls. So like the gentleman we were we bounced!\n\nPreviously, we got a tip from the Pho restaurant that Jackpot Foot Massage has the best message just ask for *blank* (I forgot her name) and you will get the best massage ever for $80. That's funny, because about an hour later I did a little yelping around while my friends were get restless. I also stumbled upon Jackpot Foot Massage only they offered $60\/ hour for a full body massage. My friend bust out the Chinese and I didn't under what he was saying, but I'm sure he said something like this... \"COME ON... COME ON\". So the girl on the phone quoted $55\/hour and we told her we had a group and then she gave us $50\/ hour after some wheeling and dealing.\n\nI have to say that this $50 massage was easily one of the best massages I have ever had. I like how my masseuse (the girl on the phone earlier) really put a lot of pressure on my back. Afterwards, I did not feel any neck or back stiffness. I just wanted to chill and do nothing. I felt like Peter Gibbons after getting hypnotized in the movie \"Office Space. It was awesome!! I want to ask for the same girl again, but I didn't get her name. She kind of reminded me of the girl from Funemployed the girl that was head over heals for KevJumba.. only she is prettier. I really hope I get her again next time I visit.\n\nThere were a few bad things that almost wrecked my Chi moment. The phone kept ringing.. and my masseuse would sometimes have to answer to phone, but she was nice enough to ensure that I will get extra time because of this. Next time I should ask for a room away from the main door, because opening and closing of the door with a little chatter is a bit distracting. I love the soft couch and how she worked my entire body, no pun intended. Note to self -Learn Mandarin.. well remember something from the class I took. \n\nRecommended! Ideally try to go here when it's not too busy. Prepare to relax and enjoy yourself and don't forget to tip.
