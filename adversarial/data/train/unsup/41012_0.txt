I just moved into this neighborhood, and I've already been here twice. This is the best pizza I've had since visiting Italy.The staff is SO friendly and informative, and the food is fairly priced. The wines are fantastic but aren't cheap. They take pride in using the best ingredients, and really know their Italian culture (and don't shy away from telling you all about it). This would be a great date spot. It screams authenticity. I can tell this will be my go-to Italian joint from now on.
