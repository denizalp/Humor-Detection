Really enjoyed checking out their holiday light show.  Lots of fun for all members of the family, from cool floral displays to toy train sets and from interesting facts on the plants to interactive displays. It also helped that Mr and Mrs Claus were there.  I think the displays work well in either daytime or evenings. \n\nI love buildings like this, lots of natural light.  You always just feel comfortable in LEED Platinum buildings.  Looking forward to visiting at other times of the year.
