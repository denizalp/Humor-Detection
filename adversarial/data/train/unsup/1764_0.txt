Since I'm a student, this place makes me feel sooo poor. Its okay though because I'll get there one day to be able to afford it but I won't need it.\n\nThis mall literally has all designer brands that you can think of. If you're going to spend some money, let me know so I can plan ahead and perhaps give you a list of what I want haha. I will say is that they have really beautiful artwork throughout the mall. I'm a huge fan of artworks because it gives the surrounding place a pop of refreshing atmosphere. To be honest, I could literally just go and look at artworks in the mall. Its that enjoyable.\n\nIf you're in the area, come check out this place because why not right? There's so much to see in Vegas but if you're more on the low key for the night then this is the place for you. I'll definitely come back when I can afford something!
