OMG!!! Shaina is the best! I've been coming to her for almost 4 years now, Shaina is very professional & personable all at the same time which makes getting a Brazilian Wax a piece of cake, you're in & out. And I love the way she's very flexible with your schedule, squeezing you in last min. or changing appt. day or time.  And I just LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! Her new shop  \"Pink Cherry\" it's so warm & cozy, she also carries \"FHF\" (Farm House Fresh) products for your skin. I can say I'm a very happy client who will NEVER shave again!
