I feel like this place just raped my day. The waitress obviously doesn't know how to do her job due to the lack of customer service and understanding that she actually have to check up on the tables she is serving. When we asked to speak to the manger she seemed more perplex by the English language than comprehending our compliant. Food was crappy and falling apart. The only good thing about this restaurant is the UofA flag hanging outside, do not come here.
