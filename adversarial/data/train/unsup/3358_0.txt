Walked in on Tuesday 3-15-16 at 5:20 PM to place an order to-go.  This restaurant is located on 3rd street just off Charleston.  The restaurant is decorated with old music albums and all the food has a cool music-related name.  I immediately got good vibes from the young man who took my order.  He was whistling the whole time he was helping make the food and seemed to genuinely enjoy his job.  I like that.  \n\n$34.88 got me a \"ray of light\" pasta, a \"rappers delight\" wrap, a \"bitter sweet symphony\" salad, and a lemon bar.  Two delicious pieces of garlic bread, ketchup, some grated parmesean cheese, greek salad dressing, and some tasty sauce was included in the bag without me having to ask.  \n\n$11.25 \"Ray of Light\" had penne pasta tossed with pancetta, pine nuts, asparagus, white wine and lemon juice, finished with a heaping handful of fresh spinach and parmesan cheese.  My eyes were bigger than my belly so I ordered the full portion and had a lot leftover.  The flavors were delicious and light.  I found the pasta to be a bit toooooo al dente for my taste and wish it had a little sauce but it was still mighty tasty.  \n\n$8.50 \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" salad is a traditional Greek salad with tomatoes, Kalamata olives, red onion, and feta cheese which is served with warm pita chips.  Their tangy vinaigrette was not my favorite but thank goodness it came on the side.  The romaine lettuce was fresh and crispy and there were lots of delicious toppings.  My favorite part was the pita chips on top which were undoubtedly deep fried yet chewy.  \n\nIt was ridiculously fast to get a to-go order (about 10 minutes) and it's right on my way home from work so this is dangerous.  I'll definitely be back to try all of their dishes!!!!
