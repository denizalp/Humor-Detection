I've been going to Lisa Dinh Hair Studio for about 1.5 years. I've been blonde for about 4 years now so I had my share of ups and downs with salons all over the city. Lisa Dinh Hair Studio is by far the best salon I've ever been to!!! Astecially it is beautiful, the staff are amazing and friendly, and the work is top notch. I have never been disappointed with the work there, it always goes above and beyond my expectations.
