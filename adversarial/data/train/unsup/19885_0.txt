I really wish there was an option for zero stars in times like these. \n\nI will never, ever return to Yosi. Here's what happened. I wanted to get my girlfriend a Manhattan mod because she really liked it and her clone is falling apart. The vape shop we usually go to was sold out and we found out that Yosi had some left so we had them put one on hold. Everything seemed legit until we got home and my girlfriend posted a photo on Instagram of her new mod. \n\nIT WAS FAKE. the owner of Amerivape Technologies contacted us on Instagram asking where we bought the mod and informed us that they were clones. We were assured by Yosi that they were authentic and they were charging the authentic price. \n\nWe were instructed to return to Yosi and return the fake mod and get our money back. Well, when my girlfriend went in they were super rude to her and kept insisting the mods were real even though she literally was on the phone with the owner of Amerivape. \n\nLong story short DO NOT TRUST YOSI VAPE. I'm very disappointed in their attitudes and ideas of customer service. How rude and inconsiderate of them!
