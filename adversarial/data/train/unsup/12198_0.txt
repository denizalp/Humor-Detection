Walking in on a Saturday night and their was no wait, wow! Service was very attentive, on his game with the refills, friendly etc. \n\nOur cook was Geo, he was amazing. He was friendly, making jokes with my children, asking repeatedly if we were ok or if we needed anything. Food was cooked to perfection and their prices are not bad.
