Out of the hotels I've stayed in Vegas - I really think this is my favorite hotel.\n\nWhy?\nThe Bella suites are awesome! In both the Palazzo and Venetian! It's two queen beds, a pull out couch, a seating area,and a great bathroom. Their bath products are ok, but who really cares about that? So you can really cram a bunch of people here. We got two bella suites next to each other. And you know what? We all fit and everyone had a bed. It was frigging awesome!!\n\nThere are four or five different pools that you can go to. The largest one is right next to Tao beach where you can hear the music, but not pay for the entrance (except I've gotten in on guest list), and not deal with the hellish drink line. There are pools that are closer to Palazzo or Venetian, but since it's a shared property, you can go to either one. Just make sure that you have your key card. You get asked EVERYWHERE to show your card. I guess people try to sneak in or something. hah.....\n\nEasy check-in, check-out.\n\nEasy access to Encore\/Wynn for XS, Surrender, Tryst, Encore Beach club. \n\nLook out for deals on Jetsetter, their website, and a few different voucher sites for better deals. \n\nI do wish they had a fridge in the room - but it's ok, there are ice machines.
