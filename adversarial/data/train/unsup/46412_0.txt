My friends and I went for an introductory glass blowing class here. It was great! They had very simplified instructions and helped us make cute little glass cacti. The instructors were funny, entertaining, and safe. I would highly recommend I'd you're interested in trying something new to try a beginner's class. We found them off of groupon and the price was very reasonable.
