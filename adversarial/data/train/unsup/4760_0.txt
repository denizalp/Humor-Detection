Used to go every year but skipped the last 4 years and went back for the 2014 show\/auction.  This was fun in the past but it is just impossibly huge and expensive now.  You have to park , wait for bus, wait in line at entry, walk about 3 miles to the main auction arena, push through crowds of people with huge bags of purchases, avoid golf carts, strollers and wheelchairs, then can't get near the cars or auction platform.  Take a break and some fries and snacks cost $20, a small glass of wine, $10 a cup of coffee $4.\nThen walk, walk, walk, walk, noise, bands, drunks, kids, shoving, shouting, loud machines and games.\nThis is so NOT a car event, just a huge circus of shopping and high priced everything.\nGo to free car show at Indian Bend any Saturday.  That is well worth the time.
