Neighboring communities should come a see the White Oak DOG PARK.  None in the area come close.\n\nIt's a huge fenced in area, with a separate access and yard for the littles.  There is a cemented pavilion with picnic tables for the humans, a supplied hand sanitizer dispenser, water access in the warm months, poop bags and well-maintained garbage cans.\n\nOur dog loves this park and so do we - we have to travel 25 minutes to get here, but it is totally worth the travel.\n\nA+++ Way to go WHITE OAK!
