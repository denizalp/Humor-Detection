Bacon wrapped jalapenos. That's all you need to know. Carry on. I'll wait while you go order them.\n\nBy now you should know my rule of thumb when it comes to Charlotte: if Frank Scibelli's name is attached, it's going to be damn good. I love their smoked wings. Usually, I'll get those and a bunch of sides. We already addressed the BWJ. I'm also a huge fan of the smoked veggies and creamed corn. True story: they took the creamed corn off the menu for a hot second and so many people got upset that they had to bring it back. I don't ever order pulled pork anywhere I go, so for me my go to proteins are the ribs and brisket. I just had burnt ends for the first time last week and they were fabulous. This is going to sound random, but the grilled cheese is great here as well. \n\nPretty good beer selection. You can also order online for pickup. Parking is not great, but there is a lot behind the building as well. Just pay attention to the signs.
