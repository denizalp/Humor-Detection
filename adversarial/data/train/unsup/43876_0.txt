This review is for Goodman. I strongly suggest he change his name to Badman because no one should should use the word good in a sentence with him. He will lie to you. He doesn't care about you. Only wants your money. Trust me he is not on your side. Only his side. If you were the buyer and the seller offered him $100 to screw you out of $20,000 I bet he would do it no questions asked. That's just my opinion with me working with him. He helped (I use the word very loosely here) me buy a property.
