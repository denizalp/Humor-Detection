AWFUL!!!!  I have been taking my 12 year old yorkie to Bark-N-Babies for close to 5 years now and I've always had a wonderful experience.  Even my dog, who is very finicky and nervous with groomers seemed to love them.  Not the case today!  After calling to reschedule an appointment that I blanked on, I asked if I could still bring my dog in, they said yes, 30 minutes later I received a phone call from the owner and she stated that I was \"Screwing up her day!\" ... a polite, \"It's too late for you to get in today, would you like to reschedule\" would have suited just fine (my husband was actually on his way to the groomer).  She promptly followed with \"we talked over an hour ago...\".  No offense, but in the world of technology, my phone log wins over your memory anyday.  It only took a split second for me to realize that this is not an establishment I wish to do business with.  Keep your over priced not so fabulous haircuts!  My fur baby deserves better!
