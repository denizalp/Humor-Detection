Horrible staff, we had to ask 3 time to find a sales person and wait 30min just to talk to him. \n\nWe had to walk in the office to find anyone who would help us. The manager was nice, but could not help is. \n\nThis young man he got us was horrible, he is as bad as a used  car sales man in a movie. He lied about the price, coverage, and giving us a discount if we bough 3 of them. Then when we picked out an utv every thing on it was an up charge after what we asked what the cost of that exact unit was. He also said their was a 3 year warranty that was changed to 1 year when he wrote it up. \n\nThis place is 20% to 40% more expensive then anyone else around.\n\nIn addition, give no discount if you buy more then one. \n\nAll of there used units are the same price as new ones from anyone else. \n\nBuyers you have been warned.
