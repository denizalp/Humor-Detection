Burger or sushi?\nWhy choose? How about some burger-sushi mashup ?\nDuring my stay in Charlotte, few people described Cowfish as one of Charlotte's attractions. I was anxious to give it a try. \nI ordered the All- AmericanDouble CheeseBurgooShi (without bacon), and I wasn't prepared for a burger and sushi to be combined in this creative and, seemingly, crazy way. \nThe seasoned all natural beef was wrapped in in soy paper & potato curls like a sushi roll, then topped with ketchup, mustard and dill pickle. Honestly, I'm not sure if I enjoyed it as much as I hoped I would. It was overwhelming. Also, I'm not sure if I'll have it again- cool concept though.\n\nThree Yelps.
