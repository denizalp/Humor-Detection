This is super fancy pants Vegas dining, and what you'd expect from the Wynn. It's an absolutely beautiful, dramatic space, lavishly decorated and the tables near the waterfall view would be perfect for a date. \n\nWe ordered several dishes for the table, but nothing knocked my socks off. A friend and I are on a budget so we got a few Philadelphia rolls (don't judge) and at the price, the amount of salmon was pretty sad and it wasn't the best I've ever had. Nothing was the best I've had, especially for the price, and we ordered several robata plates as well as specialty rolls. \n\nThe servers weren't very nice to us, even with as much as we were ordering, and I thought it was strange that there was no music playing at all. The restaurant was mostly empty and very, very quiet and dead. A few friends and I left to grab sandwiches at the caf√© because we were still hungry and didn't want to drop another $15 on mostly rice. \n\nI've never been very impressed with high-end Vegas sushi restaurants. This restaurant is gorgeous, I'll give it that, but that's about it.
