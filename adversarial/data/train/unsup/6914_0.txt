$12 for a Mint Bliss. \n\nMaybe I'm cheap. Probably. Maybe I shouldn't expect to walk into Ghirardelli thinking it would be wallet-friendly. Yea, probably. But let's take a sugar-ridden step back. $12 for a scoop of mint, a chocolate bar, some chocolate syrup, and a fudge(?) base.  5 bites later and I'm done. Sorry, my cute-cat-wallet-I-bought-from-Target. \n\nThe desserts are great to take pictures of but the price... Man, I told myself to visit every Ghirardelli store that I come across but darn, it's getting too expensive. But great news, 5th location is checked off.\n\nAnyway, free chocolate when you enter. Don't share that but do share anything else you order.
