This is by far the best buffet I've been too in Nevada. People told me it was expensive but it was only $22 for breakfast and I thought the price was completely fair. The quality and assortment of food were both fantastic. My favorite thing being the pancake station where someone makes you fresh pancakes with your choice of toppings. It was at that point I fell in love with the buffet. Next time I'm in Vegas I will be back.\n\nMy one complaint is what the hell if up with the outfits of the hostesses. They look like women's suits from the 80's. Tacky as can be.\n\nIf you're not a cheap ass and are willing to pay more for quality than eat here.
