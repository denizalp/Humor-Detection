Been going here for a little over 2 years and keep going back. The reason is simple. They have great food at very reasonable prices. The portions are very good, and the service is good too. I don't understand any negative reviews. In over two years, I have never had a reason for complaint or been disappointed. My wife enjoys the food here too. I will keep going back until they are gone, or I move far away. I think I will go there for dinner tonight. Just writing about them makes me hungry!
