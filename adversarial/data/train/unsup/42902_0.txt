EVERYTIME I come here it's a bad experience. Cashiers are slow and look like hey don't care about their jobs. Who ever is managing this store needs to do a better job of teaching their employees the importance of customer service! People\nOn the floor don't know much either. Asked 4 people in grocery where the panko was and no one even knew what it was of bothered asking someone else! Smdh!\n\n3.15.17\nWhoever manages this Walmart needs to train their people better! If there are 25 people in line and only 3 registers open, you need to have the common sense to open more registers! Always a bad experience here. People are way too slow.
