Honestly, it was my first time coming to Tacos El Gordo and when I walked inside I got overwhelmed quick. The lines were so long until I realized that the way the ordering system was set up is brilliant. They separate the lines by the type of meat you want on your tacos. Perfect! I didn't want asada tacos which was the longest line. I wanted to have the lengua (cow tongue) tacos I just had to have them. I was saved from one of the employees who was super friendly to go to the other line were they also have lengua tacos. \n\nThe wait was worth it! The meat was fresh and served when you order it just how you want it. It's a simple place that gets it and I like that. When you are done ordering you head over to the cashier and you pay there for your food and drink (if you get one). I loved that they had the lime and radish for you to get as much as you wanted. The tacos are priced at $2 a taco and I found it to be a good deal. \n\nWill I go back? Most definitely its a must!
