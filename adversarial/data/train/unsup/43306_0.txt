Been going here for years and I think they do a great job. I think it is a little pricey but they do do a good job. The only thing I think is a little shady is they have a wine bar. They offer you wine and there's no price list anywhere and they don't tell you that you have to pay for it but they don't say it's complementary either. They just ask you if you would like a glass of wine... Then when you get your bill you find out you were charged $5.  I have mentioned this to them before but I still see them doing it to people and they haven't put up any signs.
