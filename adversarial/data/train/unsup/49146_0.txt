Ordered the Black Tie Pasta while my husband ordered the Classic Burger well done. My pasta was over cooked while my husbands burger was burnt!!! My server Jessica was very nice and the manager Lauren was understanding so that was a relief but I think because their menu is so overwhelming it causes issues in the kitchen. But that menu is OVERWHELMING
