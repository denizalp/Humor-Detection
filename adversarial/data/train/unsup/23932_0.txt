I've been meaning to try this place for a while, but now I'm not sure why. \n\nTex Tubbs was loud and hectic. The ridiculous \"salsa bar\" made it more hectic. There is no reason whatsoever to set up a special area for four salsas. You could just put them in squeeze bottles on the table. To add insult to injury, none of the salsas was particularly good, and the \"hot\" one was not hot at all. El Dorado serves one salsa, and it is far, far better than any of the four at Tex Tubb's.\n\nThe dining room was not only extremely loud, but also pretty filthy. Trash remained on the floor for over ten minutes. It was gross.\n\nOr at least I thought it was gross until I got my food. I had a three taco platter:\n- puerco meatballs: This one answered the question of why you don't make a taco with tiny little round meatballs (hint: they roll out)\n- chorizo black bean: dry and extremely salty\n- traditional carnitas: this one was almost passable.\n\nMy wife had a taco salad that came with what appeared to be an entire tub of sour cream dumped on top. \n\nWe won't be back.
