What is all the hype for this place? Came here for breakfast and was so disappointed!  Obviously breakfast is not their forte or I there would be more reviews here aside from their evening menu....\n\nThe chilli con carne.... overrated.  Yeah, I said it. The meat tasted like it came straight out of a can. \n\nThe toastada special was alright, but ive had better. Unfortunately for everyone at my table it was the only thing with flavor. \n\nThe home fries tasted like they sprinkled cheezeits on them. What are these batteted with?\n\nThe breakfast burrito was just OK. \n\nHonestly if I were here again I would have to save my appetite strictly for dinner only. But breakfast? I'll pass.
