Sometimes a hole in the wall gets recognition on yelp...well, just for being a hole in the wall. I can't stand it when people give anything over 3 stars to a place like that. Their Yelp accounts should be banned and writing privileges revoked. So let's sum this up dish by dish.\n\nBeans and rice have the flavor of a pesticide. Not just any pesticide, but the kind used to kill only the fiercest of roaches. I have never had beans nor rice that taste this bad. The flavor is not comparable to anything, but the emotion is only comparable to that of returning to Taco Bell after not eating there for a decade. If you haven't experienced that feeling, I hope you never do. Consider yourself a very lucky person.\n\nThe camarones rancheros were mixed with french fries. Who thought to mix shrimp with french fries? And after disgusting inventions like that, people here comment that this is \"authentic\" Mexican food? Either they've been eating from a garbage can in Tijuana (in which case, they aren't lying about authenticity, but what else have you tried mixing shrimp with? A syringe?) or they simple don't care. The only decent thing here was the lengua tacos. Simple, no frills, decent lengua. For desert, tried the tres leches. It's a relatively simple dessert that I didn't think would be easy to mess up, but it was \"the worst\" (grumpy cat voice). Barely moist, tasted like a synthetic mix cake from Walmart. Just horrible.\n\nTo my surprise and to highlight a positive in this ruined dinner, they do take American Express. Most joints like this don't. However, that ended up as a double edge sword since otherwise I may not have come here. Stay clear unless this is the only thing open, then get Lengua tacos.
