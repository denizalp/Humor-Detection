I first had discovered Purple Penguin back in the day when I was in high school. It's a little truck in the corner of the gas station and it's such a hidden little purple gem of Henderson! They have some of the best shaved ice I've had in Vegas. It's soft. The flavors are really good. They don't shy away from making sure you know you're gonna get messy. And you can choose to add either cream or ice cream (or both) in it! Get the ice cream for sure! A small is definitely filling and you can always take your shaved ice to the park near by and enjoy it outside when the weather is nice. It's also something to cool you off in the summertime. If you haven't tried it you've got to stop by!
