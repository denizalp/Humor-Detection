Wanna have a near death experience over dinner? Order anything from Butter Chicken Roti, but ask for EXTRA HOT. The reviews are true, asking for extra hot is code for, \"I've got a death wish.\"  You will not continue to be alive if you eat an entire extra hot roti-- there's no way. I broke a sweat, my nose dripped only a few bites in. The spice was so intense I could feel my hairline peel backwards and recede after I rinsed w mouth wash.  You've been warned, extra hot from Butter Chicken Rotis is lava on the way in AND out. On the flipside,  the portions are extremely generous and so will the amounts of toilet paper you'll need after the meal...\n\nThis food was so spicy it was ridiculous... I'm still on that. Can't get over it.  It's been 3 days and I still have so much of it in my fridge.  How could anyone eat that much fire unless they had some sort of tastebudectomy? This spice isn't even made with the flavorful scotch bonnet peppers, it's just pure fire. The box is big and the meal is heavy and you get a lot of veggie mush with some meat chunks peppered in.  I'd say the meat, mush ratio needs improvement. After 5 tablespoons of extra hot mush, I can't even with the 4 chicken chunks.That's not a good ratio!\n\nI think this place would be great for a health nut but not your standard roti, west indian food seeker. It's kinda bland.. they've got a big menu, maybe I just haven't found the right roti for mee \n4 stars!
