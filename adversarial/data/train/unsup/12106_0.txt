I went with a group of 8 to Basil a few Saturdays ago and had an amazing time! It was my first trip to Basil, and I had no clue the culinary wonderment that awaited me. \n\nLet me start out by saying, I felt a bit under-dressed & will snaz it up next time. I quickly downed a glass of savignon blanc and a few shots of sake so I felt more comfortable in my jean jacket, target dress & boots. Once the edge of feeling under-dressed was taken off, I had a fantabulous time. \n\nWe ordered the spring rolls as appetizers, my fiance ordered the Pad Thai and I ordered some sort of tilapia (I think it was tilapia) dish that was a treat for the tastebuds. I'm not sure what the rest of the party ordered, but everyone left with a clean plate and smiles on their faces... so I'm assuming they weren't disappointed. \n\nI really enjoyed the ambiance of the place & felt like a complete baller because Angie Harmon and her husband, Jason Sehorn (I think that's how it's spelled) were sitting in a booth across from us!!! It's not every day that you see famous peeps in Charlotte, so that was quite a treat!\n\nWill I be back to Basil? Yes, soon & very soon, next time I'm hoping to see Oprah.
