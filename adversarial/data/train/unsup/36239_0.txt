There is nothing about this place I didn't like. Its adorable, clean and so delicious! I had such a wonderful time inside this store and its connected to the Paris hotel. Just take a quick wall through the bar in the back it will make you want to pass out for the perfection of chocolate overload smell...AWMAZING. The drinks are so delicious! When I think about Vegas I immediately think about the drinks I had at the restaurant. Almond Joy and Jolly Rancher. The drinks HONESTLY taste like the \"foods\" they are trying to taste like. We also had a Swedish Fish, These drinks are creepers, They will sneak up on you because you don't realize just how much alcohol they have in them!  if your a candy fan GO HERE FOR DRINKS 2 for 1 happy hour and share a fish bowl drink with a friend.. You'll  leave happy!
