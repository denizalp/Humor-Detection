My fiance surprised me with a brunch at PORT, it's a really beautiful place tucked away and close to the Marina in Pickering.  We had the pumpkin pancakes with a dollop of creamy mascarpone cheese on top sprinkled with pumpkin seeds (I think the menu said candied pumpkin seeds but they were raw)  Maple syrup and a small bowl of fresh fruit accompanied the pancakes.   Tasty!
