This place has some pretty decent donuts. Great selection as well.\n\nI especially like the glazed buttermilk donuts. I really wish they had some regular cream filled donuts or long johns. It is so hard to find any if those anymore.\n\n$8.99 a dozen seems to be the average going price in the Phoenix area, so they are in line with this price point.\n\nMy friend goes there for the Thai Chai Latte I believe is what she called it and says they make a pretty good one.\n\nThe inside dining area could be better kept and needs upgrading, but it is a mom and pop donut shop with a limited budget...\n\nThe staff has always been nice and are efficient in their job.
