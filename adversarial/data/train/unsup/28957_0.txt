C'est bon! Jardin Nelson was my stellar introduction to Montreal and I couldn't be more grateful for a singularly wonderful lunch experience.\n\nJardin Nelson is located only a few minutes away from Old Port next to a bunch of tourist-friendly spaces. At first, I wanted to sit outside facing the cobblestoned walking area, but then I noticed the outside garden in the back and I had to go for it. It was absolutely stunning - the flowers were in full bloom, the trees cast a nice shade over the area, bees and birds buzzed around everywhere, and a live keyboardist and bassist kept us company with some beautiful Beatles cover songs. I was so pleased.\n\nThe waitstaff was so unbelievably genial and friendly. The food was incredible, too - I had a diva crepe and a mojito with raspberries. Both were decently sized and excellently prepared. This place may err on the slightly more pricey side but I think it's worth it if you're looking for a meal that is the total package.
