I did a lot of research on bounce house rental companies and called a few. Celebrate was by far the most polite and professional. I also was referred by a friend which always helps. The payment process was easy, they confirmed dates and times multiple times, which I appreciate and they showed up on time. Their setup staff was helpful and polite. I'll definitely rent from them again and refer them to my friends.
