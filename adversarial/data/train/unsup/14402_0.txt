I HAVE NEVER been to a more unprofessional place in my life! My Dr's MA, was loud and  obnoxious! She called my name and says \" come on honey, walk this way\" walked so fast I had no Idea where she even went then came out of a room and says \" I said this way!\" Then she starts talking to me about my health problems while we were still in the hall... I almost felt like she was on drugs... The Doctor finally came into the room.  He had the worst bedside manner I have ever seen! He did not want to hear any of my symptoms. He wanted to run all sorts of test... how did he now what i needed? He was suppose to be one of the \" top docs' at the institute...  When we were done, I went up to the front desk and a drak haired lady was on the phone and not once did she recognize that I was waiting for her!  I would never in a million years recommin this place to my works enemy!
