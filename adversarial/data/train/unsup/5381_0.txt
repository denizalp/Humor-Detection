Sequins & Fur Coats. Ties & Sports Coats. 30-45 minute wait. Surrounded by 70 - 80 year olds. On a Wednesday night.\n\nWait. . .what?!\n\nI had little to no expectations for this very new restaurant. You'd think this would make me easy to please, no? Well, no.\n\nAll I wanted to do is meet a couple of my friends for a drink and a small bite to eat. I arrived early and grabbed an unsuspecting \"first come \/ first serve\" tall top in the bar area. \n\nIt was so busy, that although my friends were 15 minutes late, I barely received any service. The server was nice enough, but was unattainable and elusive. My friends and I felt like we could never quite get enough. Anything.\n\nMy friends and I love a quality martini and some great wine - however, with the minimal service, we ordered only a drink each. \n\nThe menu is unimaginative and very limited. I ordered the shrimp tacos, which were just fine - nothing special. My friends, disenchanted, each ordered salads.\n\nThe decor reminded me of Bravo or Brio. . .oh wait! It's the same ownership, now that makes sense. BORING.\n\nUnfortunately, Cedar Creek Grille does not give me any reason to come back.
