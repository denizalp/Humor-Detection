I missed my flight to dallas. \n\nChecked out of my hotel late.\n\nWoke up at 12:45pm with my pants half off, jacket, sweater, shirt still on, looneys strewn across the floor, camera cracked, documenting the previous night with 3 pictures of the Communist Daughter's bathroom & stairs...\n\n...and I had blood on my finger.\n\nThings got weird.\n\n My \"tour de toronto\" quest to experience all things Canadian culminated at 1:47am at The Commies Daughter, who not only allowed me to taste hip Toronto, but live, embody it and actually feel like I was it till 5:00am...\n\nPickled Eggs. Politics. Good Friends. Great Jukebox. And Labatt 50's.  It's all about the 50's.\n\nThis could stand as one of the best last calls of my life.\n\nYou dirty commies.\n\nThank you.
