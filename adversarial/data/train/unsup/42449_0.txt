Great experience at the Gwen Stefanie's concert! We\nWere there on 7\/13 on a Friday. She was amazing, real, she engaged with all of her fans that were at the standing area, took selfies with them, signed T-shirt, etc... she is very sweet and she did not lip sync. It was all her singing. Her show is cute and girly with lots of colors and themes. Tickets are way cheaper than Britney and we had a great sitting. The only thing that pissed me off\nBig time was this HUGE and tall girl who kept standing up the entire concert and I couldn't see neither sitting or standing. So for those who are big and tall be more considerate to others, we did paid $300 dlls\nPer ticket to see Gwen and not your fat big ass! Honest true.
