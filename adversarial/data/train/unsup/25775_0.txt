I'm a big fan of froyo so when I saw the 5 stars on Yelp for Yogurtini as I happened to be in the area, I had to give it a try.\n\nThe atmosphere in Yogurtini is great.  The decor is very clean with seafoam green walls and seats.  Plenty of room for big groups.  There was a girl who was wearing the exact same colored shirt as the walls because she must've loved Yogurtini so much (yes she was a customer, not an employee).\n\nAlright, down to the meaty details. I was surprised by the froyo selection. They had more variety of yogurts and toppings than most other froyo shops in the valley.\n\nThen when we least expected, Yogurtini threw a cherry on top. We started to taste samples and it was some of the best froyo we've ever had. They were creamy and rich like ice cream, but still healthy. I've been to many places where the froyo tastes like well yogurt, but these were fantastic!\n\nThe price is good, at $0.39\/lb, it is on par with others. I'm definitely coming back here for the great froyo and funny customers with tacky outfits.
