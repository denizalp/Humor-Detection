I just moved to the local area and this Smith's is closest to me, I have to say every time I visit this store it is a great experience. Easy to find items and always fast check out (usually self-check out) they had a great bar-b-q going on one wknd and were giving out ribs they were yum, brilliant most people were purchasing them as they were in a freezer right at entrance, including me :) Today my sister called she had the flu & needed items, so before work I whipped over to Smiths to get her OJ, soup & crackers, nothing better than being able to whip in and whip out, my sis lives around the corner from me, I was able to make sure she had what she needed and still get to work on time Whooot! Thumbs Up!
