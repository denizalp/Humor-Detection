This Chili's, located just off of Tyvola near the 77 exits, is about 200 yards from my office (I know you are looking at my profile picture and thinking I spend my days dangling from a pole covered in glitter at The Men's Club, but alas, I am just an office drone), so it is a frequent spot for quick lunches or takeout.  It's a Chili's.  It has Chili's food and Chili's service.  Sometimes we can get in and out in 45 minutes, other times it takes 45 minutes to get a salad. Because it is one of the few lunch spots in the area, you can expect a wait at peak times.  \n\nI do appreciate the online ordering so I don't have to talk to a human and explain my preference for no tomatoes, no onions, extra blue cheese, I want ranch instead of honey mustard, blah blah.  When ordering stuff online, you have a door\/register dedicated to takeout in the back instead of battling around the bar folks to pick up your food.  I have always found food to-go to be fine.  The folks are friendly.  My order is typically correct. \n\nIt's Chili's *shrug.
