Who enjoys seeing negative online reviews and ratings about his or her business? No one. But negative reviews are a part of the world we live in especially if I myself had an appt. and had to wait for an appointment that I must reschedule which take another whole month!You may point out that in emergencies situations, you sometimes have to delay appointments,but there wasn't from what I could see all those hours I was sitting in the lobby without someone just to check on me and say...the reason why an A.M appt. is now heading towards an Evening appt.!(besides what I noticed is that most was heading to lunch or returning from lunch)\nIt'll be grateful to know or be sure to recognize the patient's issue and apologize for the negative experience!
