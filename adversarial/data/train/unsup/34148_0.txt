Just a note but this place is all chicken broth so if you want your traditional pork broth then this is not the establishment for you. \n\nMy husband and I were in the area and wanted to grab some ramen and this was the first place we passed by and decided to give it a try.\n\nWhen I entered the first thing I noticed was so much empty space. It's traditional Japanese sitting on a booth but I think the space could have been utilized better.\n\nThe ramen itself was different because it was chicken broth so less oily but more protein flavor was noticed. The addition of shredded green onion was an excellent touch but I felt I'm more of a pork flavored girl.\n\nOverall it's a good place to try chicken broth ramen. It's new and different and I would give it a 3\/5.
