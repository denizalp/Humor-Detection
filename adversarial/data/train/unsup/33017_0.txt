My boyfriend and I come here almost every time we go to vegas, which is a few times a year. (Lately its been almost every month) We like coming earlier in the day in time for breakfast. Theres a pretty good variety of food. In the morning there is an omelette bar that my bf likes to go to. Theres lots of stuff like pancakes, waffles, sushi, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, mexican food, fruit, salads, pastries, meats, oatmeal, cereal, yogurt, mac and cheese and lots more. So we like to start with breakfast as our first round and have lunch our second round haha we like to eat! We've gone later in the day, I'm not sure if it was lunch but i think it was and it was changing over to dinner, there wasn't much of a variety in our opinion so we definitely prefer the morning.\nOne of the reasons we like to come here is because the first time we came we talked to one of the ladies that works there, Minnie. She's super funny and friendly so one of the many reasons we go back is to see her. Plus the food is pretty good and we always get great service.\n\nDefinitely recommend and will continue to return! :)
