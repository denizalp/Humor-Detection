I was excited that JR had opened here after they closed Huntersville. Totally left their retro soda shop behind. It looks like an upscale chain. Nice, clean food good, hot but they dropped a couple of my favorite foods. They changed French fries to compete with fresh cut. They good but NOT the great FF we expected. They dropped the 12 burger with special red sauce. Replaced with who knows what? \nI'll probably hit this again unless I can get to the original at South Park.
