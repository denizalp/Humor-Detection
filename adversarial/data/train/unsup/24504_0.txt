Not too sure as to why I delayed my visit to the House of Alchemy for so long, but I regret not visiting sooner and making peace with the guilt of betraying the Juice Standard.\n\nThe House of Alchemy serves raw cold-pressed juices, fresh smoothies, coffee and gluten free, vegan desserts. Because the entire store is bombarded with plants and the sun shines right through the window store front, it feels so warm and I feel even more welcome. \n\n\nThe owner and the rest of the staff are so friendly and helpful. Every single one of them has such a vibrant personality and they all make sure that I like whatever that I order. \nI was recommended the Under the Sea which consists of spirulina, coconut water, almonds, dates, cashews, vanilla bean, and Himalayan salt. By far my most favorite that I have tried. \nI also had The Love Drug which consists of coconut water, cashews, almonds, dates, cacao powder, vanilla bean, and Himalayan salt. The staff described it as a healthier chocolate milk (very true haha). \n\nThe store fills up quick and I can tell people enjoy the hip aesthetics. \nI get this great fulfillment whenever I stop by for some juice and I do hope that others will give this place a try too :-)
