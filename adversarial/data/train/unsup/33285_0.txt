One of my favorite spots of all time! Whether there is a PACKED house (weekends\/special events, especially First Friday) or just a few people chillin' (Big ups to my boy Jim!), this is one of the best spots in Vegas.\n\nThe talented ladies (its all females, other than a few male pianists) are on point. They'll throw anything at you, from old showtunes to Lady Gaga (a KILLER!), and ANYTHING in between (including Mario Bros by Spudoni..soooo awesome (sp?))\n\nIf you don't want the crazy crowds and fake ass people on the strip, or you want to see one of the best little-know spots(for a little while, anyway), hit this place up. I promise you won't regret it. \n\nAnd if all else fails, you got the Griffin, Beauty Bar, and the Colombian dudes selling hot dogs real close!\n\nThat's word.
