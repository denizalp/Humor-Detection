I just got back from this place and we couldn't stop talking about it in the car on the ride back to work that I swore i would write a review. \n\nJoe's is located on the South end of the Beltz Mall off Las Vegas Blvd (AKA Premium Outlets South). Next to 5 Guys burgers. \n\nTheir lunch special is 2 slices of pizza (pepperoni or cheese) for $8 OR 1 slice (pepperoni or cheese) and a side salad for $8. Drinks are 1\/2 off during lunch. \n\nWe walked out paying about $18 for 2 people for lunch. Not bad, not cheap either. \nBUT!!!!!!!!!! This pizza is SO worth the price. And we only had pepperoni! There were more pizza selections and subs and sandwiches too. But pizza is what they are known for so thats what we had. \n\nThe space is a little confusing but I'm here to clarify it for you all first timers. Since there is a ton of people inside, it may cause panic for some. So here is the drill:\n\n1. Walk in and head to the front counter. \n\n2. Order your pizza (don't forget to ask about the daily special)  or meal selection. They will take the pizza slice if that's all you are ordering and heat it up or you in the oven while you pay.\n\n3. Pay and give them your name to call it when your order is ready.  \n\n4. Fill your drink up with their Coca cola mutli-selection dispenser. I love this! They have Fruit punch! \n\n5. Sit where-ever you want. Your name will be called and you can come get your order up at the front counter. \n\n6. Enjoy! \n\nWe absolutely love this place. We were in and out, back at my desk in the 30min we have for lunch. The food was pipping hot when we got it and the Parmesan in their dispensers is REAL PARMESAN, not the fake confetti some places have. \n\nYou all must visit. My pizza craving has been satisfied and I will return.
