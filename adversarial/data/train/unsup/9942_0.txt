I got greedy.  I monopolized the duchess Jaime W. at Penn's Thai!  We met today for a girl's night out spicy food style, and this was quite the satisfier.  Jaime was sportin' a new 'do and of course the server and the owner greeted her like family.  Apparently her a\/c in her car is shifty and Penn's husband, owner of the car joint next door, came for her keys to check out her car while we dined.  Now that's service!\n\nJaime W. suggested trying the beef nam tok salad, pad woon sen (we got tofu), and panang curry (chicken) - though she had good word to say about everything on the menu she had already tried.  It made narrowing our options hard.  I really want to try the spicy eggplant next time!\n\nThe beef salad was very delicious, thinly sliced beef and red onions on lettuce with tomatoes, carrot strands, cilantro, cucumbers, and a spicy lime dressing.  The pad woon sen included glass noodles, fried tofu triangles, baby corn, tomato, green onion, and other veggies - deliciously spicy.  Our panang had a thickness that was sooo good (too many watery curries being served these days)  and great peanut taste, and was served with plenty of steaming hot rice.\n\nI also enjoyed a Thai iced tea which was tasty.  We had just the right amount of heat in all of the dishes (an assortment of hot and medium) and also had plenty of spicy condiments already on the table if needed.  The service was great and I talked to Penn about my trip to Thailand last year, especially about Chiang Rai near her family.\n\nIn the end, we had so many leftovers.  Jaime W. took the salad and I got the curry and noodles (load me on those carbs baby!) so I have my lunches covered for the next 2 days.  Best advice: try this place if you haven't.  Even better advice: dine with Jaime!  Lunch specials M-F, but the prices are right for dinner and there are many dishes to try!  I will be back, and hopefully with Jaime!
