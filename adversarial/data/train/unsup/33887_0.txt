We went here because the restaurant we wanted to eat at didn't have any reservations and Portofino's was recommended. We are so happy it was recommended! Everything was amazing.. the food, the customer service, the ambiance. I ordered the gnocchi with frog legs! I usually wouldn't order frog legs but I decided to be adventurous and it was great! We had tickets to see Love so they made sure we were served in prompt time to make it to the show. Can't wait to eat here the next time I'm in Las Vegas.
