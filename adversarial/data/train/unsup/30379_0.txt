THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST BAGEL PLACE IN THE WORLD!\nA must go to for breakfast if you are in the area or in Kensington Market. So my friend and I passed by here several time while we were in Toronto. We decided to eat breakfast here on our last day before we headed to the airport. \nIt's a cute place and the employees here are so nice! They have several different types of bagels that you can choose from and different cream cheese to choose from. They also have a menu of different bagel meals that you can choose from.\nI got the Lok & Cream Cheese on a coconut bagel. OH MY GOODNESS! MY TASTEBUDS JUST EXPLODED! I am huge on coconut and I've never heard of a coconut bagel, so I decided hey why not! The coconut bagel was perfect! It was toasted perfectly, and it was sweet but not too sweet. And the Lok was smokey and the cream cheese was great! It also came with a salad on the side with their own dressing on top of it. It was sweet and just tasted great with the bagel.\nThe price was also great for what you get. I enjoyed every single bite of it and will definitely be back when I visit my friend in Toronto again! I crave it! And I try looking for it around Atlanta and there are no coconut bagels!
