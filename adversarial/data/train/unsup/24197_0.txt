Okay, gotta write this quick... I may pass out...\n\nI went to ASU when the old Stan's Metro Deli was on Mill. Loved that place. But it went away like so many good places on Mill, and I moved on.\n\nSo I was shocked when I saw a sign for Stan's on Mill driving in to work this morning.  A mirage? An illusion? I had to know, so wandered in for lunch and found out today was their grand opening.\n\nI tried their #1, a triple decker combination of gastrointestinal destruction that puts both pastrami AND corned beef together on rye.  Oh yes, oh sweet yes.  \n\nThey were a little crazy on their first day, breaking in a new staff and menu, but they got us all taken care of.  The #1 is now a happy memory, and the...sleepies are... coming... so good, but sooo... mmmm...zzzzzzzz....
