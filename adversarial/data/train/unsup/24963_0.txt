Overall pretty fantastic.  Excellent, authentically French dishes, good wine list, above-average service.  The escargot could have been a bit better (after all this is a French restaurant) but most everything else we ordered was outstanding.  I would recommend the whole fish for two and the house pate.  Atmosphere very charming albeit small.  Rustic wood floors with Versailles-style chandeliers= unique and fun environment.   Sidenote:  my mother was born and raised in Lyon, France and genuinely loved the restaurant.
