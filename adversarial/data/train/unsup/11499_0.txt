I like trying the hotel restaurants and cafes. This place did not disappoint.\nWe ate brunch, my favorite meal, andvit was pretty good. We had the typical egg omelette with toast and sausages and my husband had steak. Everything was good.\n\nThe cappuccino wss however noteworthy.  Delicious. It made my day.
