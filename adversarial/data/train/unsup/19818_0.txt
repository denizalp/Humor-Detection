Pittsburgh is so friggin' cool. It's not just cool, it's AWESOME.\n \nDriving up 39th street after drinking on Butler. House, House, House...\"Oh wait, pull over here!\" Park. Easy. Run into friend in front of house. Wait for them to finish their cigarette. Go in someone's HOUSE that has lawn chairs in a living room. Meet awesome owners and sample the 4 varieties they have on tap. (Pear, Concord Grape...) Buy a brand new bottle of \"Santa's Cinnamon\" for my brother-in-law and if he brings it back (which he will because their cider is amazing) a refill is under $14 dollars.\n\nA few funny facts?\n\n1) The taps handle of their most popular cider was a shotgun. \n2) You can open your bottle in their living room with friends and share. \n3) They had a really awesome Christmas tree.
