When I saw that this place was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, I was immediately sold!\n\nThe decor felt like grandma's house. Little knickknacks everywhere and the signs are hilarious! The staff constantly bussed tables at an impressive speed. We sat at the window seat, awesome for people watching! \n\nFood was excellent! Certainly one of the best brunches I've ever had. I ordered a veggie omelette and my boyfriend got an Italian jumbot. My omelette was packed with delicious veggies and his jumbot had these perfect crispy little homefries. \n\nDor-Stop only gets 4 versus 5 stars due to lackluster service. Our waitress did her job properly. However, we did not get her name, no smile, no friendliness that you would expect at such a cozy establishment. \n\nI left feeling empty in my heart, but not my stomach!
