This was another bookmark that I have driven by a million times and keep telling myself, \"I need to check this place out.\"  Now that I had my first La Belle, I'm like, \"Hello?  What took me so long to come here!\"\n\nSince Manon (a nearby French bakery) keeps disappointing me, I am so HAPPY that I finally found a cute quaint little French Cafe to stop in and have a pastry and coffee.  I can't wait to try the lunch menu.\n\nI love that it has outdoor seating with umbrellas.\n\nThey play French Music so you feel like you're sitting in a French cafe in Paris.\n\nFrench Press Coffee here, with a FP carafe brought out to your table!\n\nWhen I ordered my coffee with croissant the menu had the item posted as, \"bread\/croissant\" so I asked her, \"Is it just a croissant that comes with the order?\" and she said, \"Yes\". So I get my order and a huge baguette was there too?  Had I known, I would have just ordered a small chocolate croissant...oh well.  She needs a little training and to crack a wee bit of a smile too. I won't knock any stars off for that because the other servers were friendly and I loved everything else about the cafe.  \n\nPlus...I got a 10 percent off with my Yelp Check-In.\n\nDespite it's location in a strip mall, it's off on it's own, so you don't have distractions of other businesses or heavy traffic.  \n\nThe case of goodies isn't as expansive as Manon but they offered Macarons and chocolate croissants as well as other savory treats.\n\nNice lunch menu too serving up traditional items like grilled Croque Madame, Soups, Quiche, etc.\n\nGreat little cafe for a nice breakfast don't miss it. \n\nBookmark it now!
