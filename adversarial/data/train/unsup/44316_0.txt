Tonight was my first time to eat at 800 Degrees and certainly not the last. I had the Neopolitan crust and the Quattro Fromaggi toppings. \n\nThe pizza was served very hot,  straight from the oven and the flavor was fantastic. Unfortunately,  I could not eat the whole pie. \n\nI highly recommend this place to any pizza lover who finds them self here in Las Vegas.
