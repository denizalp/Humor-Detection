My husband took me here in August 7th 2016 for our anniversary dinner while visiting Vegas. It's located in the Golden Nugget casino.\n   They start you with bread and dipping oil. The bread was house made and had an amazing garlic aroma and flavor, perfectly warm and soft inside and that nice crisp crunch on the outside. The garlic oil complimented this wonderfully.\n   My husband ordered a chicken Alfredo dish that was out of this world. The flavor and consistency of the sauce was spot on and the pasta and chicken were cooked perfectly. The dish was beautifully presented.\n   I ordered a sausage marinara dish, which again flavor, presentation and food were spot on. By far the best Italian food we've had.  \n   For desert I ordered the tiramisu and my husband ordered the cheesecake. Both were very good and had we not ordered the cheesecake we would have raved about the tiramisu, but we DID order the cheesecake and well we needed up being the tiramisu home and took our time delighting in this AHmazing cheesecake. The consistency was perfect and the best creamy texture and taste. We're big cheesecake fans and my husband is a cheesecake \"snob\" and we were both blown away with this one!\n   The service was equally as great from hostess, waiter and the gal who kept filling up our waters. Smiling pleasant and went out of their way to make out night special! Well done grotto!
