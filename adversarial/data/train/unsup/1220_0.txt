I really was hoping this was a great Chinese Restaurant, I just could not get that out of this meal. We had ordered a lot of different typical Chinese dishes. The best item was our first which was the Chinese Dumplings or Pot Stickers, which were just steamed but filled with a very good pork and cabbage mixture. There was a few of us so we had a couple of different dishes. We had the Beef Chow Fun, with the big flat noodles, Not tasty and not good. We ordered the Beef and Broccoli, which had a lot more flavor that the Beef Chow fun but nothing out of the ordinary. We also had General Tso's Chicken which had some flavor but was fried way to crisp to chew. My favorite dish to try everywhere is the Singapore Rice Noodles, usually with a great Curry flavored sauce and chicken, shrimp and tofu. This came with some okay Chicken, Very dry noodles, no Curry taste at all. The shrimp were scarce and the tofu rubbery. I did not like it at all. I went because people have reviewed it and said it was great and authentic, I will give it another chance but this was not a good first impression.
