My son has been asking for a few weeks to see Rescue Planes and decided it was as good a day as any. This was my first visit to this theater and it was pretty good. The girl at the ticket booth gave me tickets to the right movie but at the wrong time but she fixed it and that was the only issue. The theater we were in was empty other then a dad and his son. In total there were 4 people watching the movie. It was a bit creepy and cool all at the same time. The sound quality was good and the movie itself looked good. The seats were comfortable and my little man even got a booster so he could see better. Concession prices are average for a theater at about $6 for a large drink. Was a bit sad the theater we were in didn't have the aforementioned reserved seating but given there was almost no one watching the movie but us it wasn't that big a deal.
