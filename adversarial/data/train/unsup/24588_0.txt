So everybody who did try to apply or who has moved in, is pretty much going for quantity, not quality. Place is beautiful since they only show the model. Otherwise you get screwed if you sign with them. We even tried to test out the sound, which the leasing agent was adamant to prove us wrong. \n\nMy fiance and I were suppose to move in last month. It was a headache from the start. First, we were given a tour with an agent named kim (who no longer is there). As soon as we got back she turned us to the computer to finish the application process. When trying to do it, we were having issues trying to even get onto the application. Did kim care to help , NO! Because all she cared about was closing the deal to get whatever percentage she needed to make her sale. So some other lady helped us out.\n\nOkay, cool. Got approved, then a day before move in, all of a sudden our application was then said to be denied. With that said it made us homeless practically for a week living in hotels. If i could give them negative stars I would. It did not stop there. I called to get a refund, in which I was promised I would be getting back $200. Its almost week 6, and I even tried calling again today, where assistant manager Britney claimed the actual manager would call me when she is done. No call. Again called regional. No call. Looks like i will be seeing them in court for fraud and not running the background and credit check together. \n\nRenter beware, all they want is your money, and will not give a rats ass right after.
