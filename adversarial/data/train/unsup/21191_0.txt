This is proof that any Target can be CLEAN and not filthy like some other Target stores out there. I LOVE shopping here when I am in the area. \n\nThe selection of groceries is fantastic and I do love that they have Einstein Bagels in the bakery section...I can actually pick out my own bagels!\n\nThey also carry some nitrite-free meats too. Loving it more!\n\nI find the shopping carts to be amusing, like they are big versions of the Lil Tykes shopping carts, but in red.\n\nStarbucks is located here too, along with a Pizza Hut snack bar across the way.\n\nI wish I lived closer to this one, it's \"SUPER\"!
