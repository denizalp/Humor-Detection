I have been bringing my son here for a few years. The doctor is fine but ALL of the supporting staff is totally substandard! They don't return phone calls, they don't schedule follow up tests, they don't call with lab results. They get frustrated easily. It typically takes three phone calls, on average, to get any information on my child. As his biggest advocate for quality health care, I feel I am entitled to ALL lab and imaging results. Dr. Ching actually called me and told me my expectations for quality health care could not be met at this type of office, as they focus more on QUANTITY (volume of patients) verses QUALITY of care. I know know you must be thinking... There's no way she said that. She ABSOLUTELY DID! I wondered if she could hear herself. I wonder how she sleeps at night knowing she's involved in such a practice. She recommended that I find a smaller practice that could offer me higher standards of continuous care. They are staffed by only medical assistance, in the doctors own words, they are not qualified to answer questions. They are only able to read \nexactly the message the doctor leaves for them. If you need further information or have more questions they become easily frustrated, snippy, and generally unhelpful! If you want to go or bring your child to a place that is run like some kind of puppy mill, this is the place for you!
