Conflicted about how to write this review, since I actually ended up getting sick after my meal, and so did two of my friends the week prior. BUT still three stars because it's actually awesome. If we didn't get sick, easily a 4 or 5. Could have just been a weird coincidence! \n\nFirst of all the place is ADORABLE. The inside is great, but the outside patio is amazingly beautiful. It's right on the water and there are cute string lights and fountains. It looks like a European garden. There are misters so don't worry about being too hot during the summer. \n\nYou HAVE to try the bruschetta board. It's fantastic. The bread is so fresh and the toppings were perfect. For my meal I ordered the chicken and mashed potatoes. It was flavored really well... the only thing I wish was that the skin was crispy. And for my favorite part: dessert. We had the strawberry shortcake. Amazing. \n\nSO if you have a strong stomach, try it. If you don't, try it and bring Tums just in case. It's worth it.
