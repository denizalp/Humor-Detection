Olive & Ivy is everything a brunch spot should be. \n\nElegant, relaxed, refined, and outdoorsy. Brunch in the outdoors is just a necessity!\n\nThe BF and I got a late start on our Saturday. We became Scottsdale wanderers and became lost in the shiny retail-roads of old town. \n\nEventually we found our way to the canal, only made obvious by my recent Yelp excursion to a nearby eatery. \n\nWe took in the noon-time sights: art, people, etc. I perused Yelp for a decent late lunch and O&I was top of the list. With the gorgeous canal views I can see how it would be!\n\nWe ventured near and requested an outdoor table. Unfortunately our table was Also a favorite hangout for a local bird (apparently a protected bird). My BF and the bird became instAnt mates - much to his dismay. A few encounters later we were ushered to another table. FYI we named the bird Pippy (aka Poopy). \n\nThe views and weather were fantastic. Roughly 75* and breezy we could not have asked for better weather. The art installation at the canal made for an even better view. \n\nOur cocktails were fantastic. A Fig mule for me and a apple\/jalape√±o margarita for him. With just the right blend of flavors and alcohol we were pleased. Plus the price was right (or maybe that's our SoCalroots showing). \n\nI had the salad - which after reading a local CM's review I wish I would have ordered the warm chicken. The BF has the Tuna sandwich, which was a tad lackluster. \n\nMy salad had hefty amounts of bleu cheese which is always appreciated, but I do wish the choice of warm chicken versus cold was made more apparent. \n\nWe also ordered desert - lemon pudding cake. I found myself enjoying it, however not loving it. I did, however enjoy my fresh espresso - even thought it was received after we had finished dessert. Graciously, the server removed the espresso from the bill. Thank you for that!\n\n\nI would not hesitate to visit O&I again as the atmosphere and service are five stars in itself.
