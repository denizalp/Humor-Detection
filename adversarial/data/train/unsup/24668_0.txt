Just moved in at the end of January and couldn't imagine living anywhere else!! Tammy was such a huge help in helping us find somewhere to live. We visited nearly every apartment complex in Charlotte and nowhere compared to Solis Sharon Square. The leasing process and move were all seamless. We love the amenities of our building and the covered parking garage to keep our cars out of the elements. The pet friendly community and dog park were huge pluses for us! I don't think you can live in a better location in SouthPark. Whole foods is right downstairs as well as Dogwood, Rusty Bucket, Corkbuzz wine bar, and Cafe Mont√©. I can't tell you how happy we are to have our new home here at Solis Sharon Square!!
