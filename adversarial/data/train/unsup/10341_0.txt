I just recently entered the fun corporate world and with that fun corporate world comes my fun corporate benefits. Now, since I'm not reviewing my benefits, I'll spare you my opinion that HOLY SHIT I HAVE THE BEST BENEFITS EVER OMG LOL !1!1!!!11, and I'll tell you that my AWESOME new doctor directed me toward this pharmacy... because he is AWESOME. \n\n(benefits are kind of a whole new world for me. it's a really convenient world, and I get really excited about modern conveniences, so, there's that.)\n\nMelrose Pharmacy has the most charming layout and functions just as any CVS or Walgreen's would (except I wouldn't expect Melrose to turn down my birth control script because of the pharmacist's ethics, like our Mormon friend Walgreen's), but more charming. They also sell fun little extras, like essential oils, incense, chatchkis, and the like. \n\nThey're very friendly people, accessible and knowledgeable. I'd go there even if I didn't have a prescription!
