Literally the worst kfc !!!! If I could put NEGATIVE 5 stars I would ! I pull up to the drive thru and order with two people talking to me thru the drive thru box not taking my order serious at all.  Then I pay at the second window where the tell me to pull up and wait for 5 minutes so they can bring my food out. I wait for 10 mins & one of the employees walks out and asks what I'm doing there waiting . I told him that the employee I paid with told me to pull up here for my food. Then he asks what I order & tried saying I didn't order & accused me of not paying . He then brings out the employee that I paid with where he too didn't know what I was talking about. Literally the most stupidest fucks I've ever had to deal with . Never coming here again. All together I was here for about 35 mins.
