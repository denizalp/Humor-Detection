I have the season pass and go atleast once a week and each time I've been in the last week Ive been.disappointed. Two weeks ago they threw a rubber baby in the wave pool and entice panic and claimed iy was a training exercise. Disgusted. And today twice the pool with mushroom and waterfall in it was shut down due to adults pooping in the pool or puking dont know cant get a strait answer from any of employees. Just sad there customer service sucks.
