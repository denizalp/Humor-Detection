Because the french onion soup at YardHouse did not satisfy me and I remembered that the french onion soup at Outback Steakhouse was pretty yummy, I asked my fiancee to take me there.  Initially, he thought I wanted steak so he suggest we go to the steakhouse at Green Valley Ranch.  I told him that Outback has the 4 course meal for $15, which is a steal!  Not really when you consider the quality of food served to you.\n\nBoth Earl and I opted to pay a supplementary charge of $8 to get the 6 oz Victoria Center Cut Filet.  It supposed to be tender, but guess what?  Mine had the sinue, which made it tough and chewy as hell.  I tried really hard to cut the sinue off, but ended up having Earl cut it  off for me.  C'mon now Outback...Can you really call it \"tender\" with that piece of crap it it?\n\nI also paid the $1 upgrade to change the walkabout soup of the day to my french onion soup.  At least that was good.  Earl had the walkabout soup, which is lentil and sausage soup.  He commented that it's a good thing I didn't get that soup because it tastes like crap.  When it came time for dessert, there are only two choices to chose from, the cheesecake or the carrot cake.  We took that home and I did not enjoy the cheesecake.  What kind of cheesecake does not have a crust?  This crappy cheesecake at Outback Steakhouse.  WTF?  Seriously people.  Stick with the crust because this noncrust cheesecake is crap.\n\nNow service...CRAPPY as well.  The server breath smells bad.  Every time he talks, I have to gasp for air in a different direction.  Additionally, he happened to left his drink tray on our table while tending to other guests.  WTF again.  After he took a table's order, gave another table their to go boxes, clean some plates off of another table, he then picked up that drink tray without saying one word to us.  \n\nThe night's dinner experience was crappy, nonetheless, I am OUT and never come BACK.
