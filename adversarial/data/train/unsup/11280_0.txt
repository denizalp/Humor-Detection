Tucked inside of the Mirage Hotel is one of the best New York delis ever!! I have always wanted to try Carnegie but yet to make it out to the east coast! Minh and I needed some food in our bellies for a night of drinking. The take-out line was kind of long as we waited to place our order. After looking over the menu and waiting our turn, it was time to order. Now this is not just your typical deli where your sandwiches are on the smaller side. This deli packs on the meat, which means these babies are freaking huge, more than enough to share! \n\nWe ordered the: Turkey Sandwich- Turkey, tomato piled high .You put the condiments on when you get the sandwich.\n\nFound a comfortable spot outside of the restaurant (well actually it was the outer lobby and it was on the ground but heck I was sneaking in a couple of sip of my drink that I had)!!\n\nOur friends joined us a moment later with their food as well.  People watching is a must here (it was NYE so the place was hopping). \n\nAfter putting a little bit of mayo on my bread, I realized that my mouth could not possibly go around this huge sandwich. Darn, I had to disassemble it and eat it. The turkey was tender and not dry the mayo made it that much better. \n\nI was half way finished when I just couldn't possibly fit anymore into my small tummy. Handing it on over to the boyfriend was the best idea ever! As he was more than happy to finish the last couple of bites of my sammich.\n\nThe prices are a little high here but just think about it, you get a lot of food for your money plus you can always use your \"M\" life card and get points!!!!
