The buffet has been remodeled since the last time I ate here and the inside looks quite nice with the how it looks. It has more of a dark wood restaurant feel to it and the spacing of the tables is adequate.\n\nThe food was just ok to me as they did have decent quantity, but the quality was kind of poor as everything looked as if it could have been pre-made and just sat out for awhile. Did not look very appetizing. Even the roast beef was very dry and sat out under the heating lamps for too long. Ughh. The only thing I really enjoyed eating were the crab legs as they tasted fresh and were very meaty!!  Also they do have a great dessert area where you can choose from fresh mini doughnuts to cotton candy and also house made ice cream.\n\nThe main reason we ate here was because we got a 2 for 1 buffet pass for staying  at TI otherwise I'm not sure if I would be eating here again.
