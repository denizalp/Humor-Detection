Recently had dinner at Ruth's Chris and van honestly say it was by far the best steak and Caesar salad I've had in a long time. Pricey, but the ambience and service are unparalleled! A special treat to be sure, and not to be missed if you are a lover of fine food, special attention and elegant yet plush and comfortable surroundings.
