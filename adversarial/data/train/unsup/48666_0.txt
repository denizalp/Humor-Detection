I didn't really know what to expect. Gerry is a cool guy. Like someone I would want to have dinner with. The show at times I feel like had a lot of filler talk and I got bored. I for called out for the index cars trick and was pretty impressed. The tricks were well done. I think the pacing could be fine tuned a bit and maybe put some hot chicks on stage as assistants. Lol.
