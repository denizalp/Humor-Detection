This station serves the Red, Green, and Blue Lines in Cleveland's Rapid light-rail system.  When I lived in Cleveland, I normally caught the Red Line at the Ohio City station, but once or twice I caught the train here because I happened to be downtown.\n\nThe station itself can be hard to find if you're not familiar with Tower City.  Getting here involves a lot of stair (or is it escalator?) climbing.  But when you finally do get down here, you'll be thrilled to be in a strange subterranean station that doesn't really look like it belongs in Cleveland.  OK, maybe you won't be thrilled, but I always was.  And maybe it does look like it belongs in Cleveland, but I never thought it did.\n\nPeople made a big deal in 2000 or so because they filmed part of a (pre-West Wing) Rob Lowe HBO movie in this station.  I was less than pleased, though, because the station was closed that day and I needed to take the Red Line to the airport.
