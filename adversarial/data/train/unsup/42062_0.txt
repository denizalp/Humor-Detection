I LOVE this place!! The owner buys many of their items locally and is very involved in her community. Every time I go into the store, there is something new to look at! There is always a huge selection for all of the needs too!!\nThe thing I love most about this store is that the products are top notch quality!!\nI bought a necklace there that I wear pretty much every day a while ago, and it still looks as new as the day I purchased it!!\nThe customer service of the store is also excellent! I love how every time I go there, I feel like a VIP!!\nI would defiantly suggest this store to anyone who wants top quality service and products =)
