Great 24 hour food spot located in the Mirage.\n\n- Chances are you're in dire need of food to go with your drinking habit. Pantry serves breakfast 24 hrs a day.\n- You probably smell pretty bad from drinking, smoking, and dancing all night. Grab a bite to eat before you head up to hit the shower, your hangover will thank you.\n- Super fast friendly service and they won't even make fun of the fact that you cheaped out and got a $20 hooker, instead of a $100 hooker. Hey at least you're nice enough to buy her some pancakes. \n- Prices are moderately expensive, but it is Las Vegas the only thing cheap are the hookers.\n- Interestingly enough they have healthy organic options...in case you've endulged so much you need to offset your behavior.\n- You can gamble close by while you wait for a seat.\n- The d√©cor is very white, French country kitchen style. Nice and keeps you awake night or day.\n\nI had a nice breakfast here before heading out of town last time in Vegas.  Casinos were good to us, and Vegas paid for it...so awesome.\n\nENJOY people, and wrap it up buttercup!
