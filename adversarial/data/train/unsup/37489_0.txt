My husband and I enjoy going to the Comedy Zone and tend to get an indication for how good they are based on how sold out the show is. In this case for the 1\/17\/15 show, we got a \"False Positive.\" The material was more offensive than funny. It's wise to check out the comedian's material if you can. \n\nThe environment is the basement of a restaurant. We've walked through the restaurant but have never eaten in it. As far as the Comedy Zone the food is finger food and we've eaten in the past, but not on this recent visit. The cocktail drink I had was improved from past visit-they used to be weak irregardless of which one I got and I'm not a real drinker (usually get fruity stuff). \n\nAs far as wait staff, we had an attentive waiter. Know that gratuity is added to your bill so don't overpay. Hopefully you get a good\/attentive waiter\/waitress. \n\nWe actually enjoyed didn't enjoy the headliner as much as we did the opening comedian. The cost to go to this venue has increased since we started going here and it seems everyone is a celebrity act which cost more to see.  To be fair though other larger comedy show venues that do charge more but the environment is theater scene. Comparing the Charlotte Comedy Zone to the Fort Mill one, Charlotte is definitely better. Fort Mill's environment is like a closet. \n\nParking is a short walk and there is valet parking should you want to do that. \n\nWe tend to get free tickets but most often than not they are during the week. Our work\/travel schedules do not allow for during the week comedy shows. Even when birthday tickets are offered, it's during the week. I like to celebrate my birthday but really. I wish the environment itself was nicer.
