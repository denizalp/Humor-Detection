i love lava.\n\ntheir happy hour is pretty much one of the best in town. they have some really cheap and GOOD food along with drinks. a really good $5 burger with sweet potato fries - what could be bad about that? \n\ni've never had a bad time at this place. the staff are always super friendly. decent beer selection and the drinks are always served quickly, no matter how busy they are. \n\ni have read tons of reviews reading \"uggh, too many hipsters\". would you rather have frat boys grinding on you or groping your girls ass? i don't get it.
