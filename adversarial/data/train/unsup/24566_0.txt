This place is the definition of a diamond in the rough. Situated on Old William Penn Highway not far from the 376 Plum Exit, they have sandwiches that are not only a great value but big on taste.\n\nForget Primanti Brothers this place has got the sandwiches you crave. Sure there is something to be said for the Pittsburgh classic of fries and coleslaw on a sandwich, but even double meat at Primanti's doesn't match up to wad of Boars Head meat Minitalia is slinging out on their sandwiches. \n\nThe decor is a little discombobulated but don't let that throw you. You are sure to get a good sandwich and good service as this Monroeville eatery. I interacted with both associates working this Sat afternoon both were very friendly and helpful.\n\nIf you are in the neighborhood give this place a try. You will not leave hungry I assure you.
