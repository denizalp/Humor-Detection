Got an update after 2 days in the shop. They called me back and told me they needed 1 more day to stress test it. Went into shop after that time.\n\nComputer is still broke. They loaded to log in screen when I picked it up. But somewhere between their associate loading my computer onto my car and my drive home my computer broke again. Would go to log-in screen but with screen tearing and not recognizing my gpu again.\n\nHad to take out my gpu and load my old gtx580. *siiiiiigh*\n\nI have been reduced back to my old gaming pc again T_T
