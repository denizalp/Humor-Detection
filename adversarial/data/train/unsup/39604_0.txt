Went on Friday at 6 pm - just missed Happy Hour and the place was busy and didn't have a reservation but they were able to seat the two of us inside (one of the few cool AZ days). The Patio would have been fine if the temps were at the normal average.\nService was attentive and knowledgeable about the wine list. \nHad the BLT salad to start which was fresh and tasty with just the right balance of flavors. Went for the Vintage Burger next which  to me,  is one of the best in the Phoenix area - who would have thought a grilled shortrib\/angus chuck blend could be so moist and flavourful? Ended up with the Coconut Tres Leche dessert which was just sinful but absolutely right.\nA great selection of wines with some good value bottles. It shows a commitment and passion to bring some interesting wines to the area. I will certainly go back to sample some more.
