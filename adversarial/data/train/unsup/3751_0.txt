Bell Rd & Grand Ave Surprise location. Absolutely excellent service. I have used this location many times and each time they exceed my expectations. They are courteous, helpful, and pleasant. Yesterday I rented one of the new Ford Transit vans. It was in great condition and ran beautifully. While I was out I had a hitch installed on my car. When I returned everything was perfect.
