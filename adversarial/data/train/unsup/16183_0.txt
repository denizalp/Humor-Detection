Let me start by saying I sent an email on through the \"contact us\" on their website regarding our experience and I received no response.  I tried to keep the experience within a small circle, however, no response means \"we don't care\" which is exactly what happened when we tried to have dinner at this establishment.  \n\nWe were looking for a restaurant that we have not tried.  We went to The Hub and requested patio seating.   The hostess informed us the patio was full but they could seat us next to the patio at the open areas but the table would be inside.  We agreed.   We were seated and next thing I knew there was a big dog wondering around at the table next to us on the patio side with three people. \n\nThe waiter came up to us and said \"my name is ???\".  About that time, the dog was now 1\/2 inside the establishment seeking attention from my husband.    I asked if we could be moved to get away from the dog.  He said \"yes, I can move you to the next table\".  That was not going to solve the problem, the dog had a long enough leash to still bother us and I don't particularly care to have slobber and dog hair around where I am eating.   Don't get me wrong, we love dogs and have large dogs.   We could have stayed home if we wanted their company.  \n\nI asked the waiter why we were the ones who have to move, as the dog was still hanging around us.  The waiter shrugged his shoulders and said \"I don't know what you want me to do, I guess I could get a manager\".  Good idea.   We waited over 8 minutes and had to endure the very intoxicated owner of the dog tell us it is a \"pet friendly establishment\" and that he has been there since 11:00 a.m.   It was 5:00 p.m.    Shame on this restaurant!   This poor dog has had to sit in the sun on this patio with no shelter, no food and a little white cup that the dog couldn't drink out of because of its' size. The dog was restricted to the length of the leash.   The owner and friends were extremely intoxicated and had no clue.   \n\nAs we were getting up to leave.  A couple of employees and the waiter walked over to the dog table.   We were never approached.   We were able to walk out without anyone saying a word.  Keep in mind, we walked through the entire restaurant.  It is very clear this establishment care more about $$$$ they received for the 6 hours of people getting drunk and exposing an animal to inhumane conditions than 2 people just wanting to have a quiet night at a new restaurant.   \n\nWe can't rate the food, we were not given an opportunity to try it.
