I enjoy shopping at BCF.  Typically when you are looking for something off season (like a white suit during Winter), you can find it here.  They have suits galore and I was able to find exactly what I was looking for for a GREAT price!  The store has everything, clothing for the family, shoes, housewares, jewelry, purses, and more.  When you go, plan to spend some time looking around the store.  That way, you will find surprising bargains.  There is plenty of merchandise to peruse; you will not be disappointed.  Now, there are times I don't find anything to purchase, but then, I am in the store at least 2-3 times each month.  I am giving BCF four stars because the return line is the same line for lay-away purchases and pickups.  I waited a very long time on my last visit while regular purchase cashiers cleared their customers and moved on to other tasks vs. helping customers in the return\/lay-away line.  Fortunately for them, I really wanted the merchandise I had in hand so I had to wait in the line.
