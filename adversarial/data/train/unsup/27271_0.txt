We wanted to try burritos as \"big as your head\" however, the food there was something that tastes like it came off the bottom of your foot.  This is the WORST excuse for a Mexican restaurant I've ever tasted.   I asked if they had Carne Asada burritos and they said this is \"close\" .... NOT!!  Not sure if it was even fresh meat.  We both threw ours away and I'm not positive that we won't throw it up later at some point.  Not one thing to say positive.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED and WILL NEVER BE BACK.
