So... you know those cartoons where there is a tent out in the desert and people are trudging through the sand dunes, finally arriving at a small tent... only to find out that inside there is a massive expanse of luxury and opulence?  That's a little bit like the experience you have when you come to Dragon Court.\n\nI would NEEEEVER have tried this place on my own, had I not decided to take a Chinese cooking class through CPCC (really fun, you should check it out).  IAC, one of the classes was held in this strip mall, where we walked through the Asian grocery stores talking about ingredients, and culminating with lunch at this restaurant.\n\nThe parking lot is atrocious.  The entrance to the mall itself is set back under a pagoda-shaped sign.  Once you do enter it, everything is filthy, with leaves strewn about.  The floor is gritty, like a construction site.  It must be years since this place has been swept.  I trudged past dozens (it seemed, not sure how many) of empty storefronts, with the windows plastered in newspaper.  WAYYY back in the corner of the mall, past the empty pond and overturned shopping carts lies the entrance to Dragon Court.  It was DEFINITELY peer pressure that kept me from walking back out to my car, bc by this time I was askeered!  Once inside, however, the atmosphere was completely different.\n\nThe restaurant itself seemed fairly large, with many large round tables complete with the giant lazy susan-type things in the middle.  Chairs are cushioned and comfortable.  Everything seemed clean inside (whew!)  Our teacher ordered for us so that we could try many things.  I kept the menu so I'd know exactly what I liked the best.  We tasted:\n\nFried Sesame Seed Dumplings $2.65\/3 \nPork Roll with Oyster Sauce $2.65\/3 (loved these!)\nSteamed Roast Pork Bun $2.65\/2\nBeef Ball 2.85\/3 (nobody at either table liked these very much)\nStuffed eggplant 2.85\/3 (my biggest surprise.  Loved them!  Stuffed with shrimp)\nShrimp dumpling 2.85\/4\nTaro strip on shrimp biscuit 2.85\/3 (Yummy!  the taro strips were crispy, like shoestring potatoes)\nLittle Juicy Steamed Bun 3.40\/4 \n\nI think that the only things I wouldn't order again were the sesame seed dumplings and the beef ball.  Overall, I was quite impressed with the service for our group of at least 16, who ordered quite a lot of food.  In addition, the prices seemed quite reasonable.  I tend to be a \"taster\", forcing my poor husband to give me bites of whatever he has ordered, so the concept of Dim Sum really appeals to me, as well.\n\nShould you survive the gauntlet of the parking lot and entry, I think that you will enjoy yourself.
