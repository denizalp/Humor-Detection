I'd have to say that this is my favorite buffet in Vegas - it's very clean, organized, and it has everything that I want in a buffet and more.  And for some reason when comparing it to the Wynn buffet - this place just tastes better. Loved the king crab legs, the prime rib, and the dessert - but wasn't a huge fan of the asian dishes. . .that's okay though, I wasn't really going to the buffet for asian food anyway! haha\n\nAnd I'm not a HUGE fan of buffets so I don't give them 5 stars. . .but I do have to say that this is one of the best - expensive, but definitely worth it if you're out in Vegas!
