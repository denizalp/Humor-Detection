BEWARE.....  Over the 12 months that I lived there I witnessed two different occasions when the SWAT team came and busted down the doors of two different apartments.  The place is loaded with drug dealers and pimps, and management will lease these to anyone, and I mean anyone.  They don't enforce any of the HOA rules, people pretty much do what they want.  Pets pee on the carpeting throughout the buildings and people pile their trash near the trash chutes but are too lazy to put it in the trash. Constant hassles over parking, people just park where ever they want even though residents have designated spaces, and there's hardly any guest parking.  The worst was, two nights before I moved out a guy threw his girlfriend off the 5th floor balcony and she landed near the guard gate instantly killing her.  Interesting that none of these stories seem to be reported on the local news, but all of us residents know exactly what happens.  Such a shame because the units are absolutely awesome!  But just because there's security cameras doesn't mean you're safe.
