I called Buca on Friday night after work asking if they would accept a walk in for 2. The manager was very polite on the phone and offered one of their communal high top tables. \n\nService was excellent from the moment my friend and I got there. The manager knew it was our first time and even offered us a glass of wine to start and some type of liquor to end our evening. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave us informative yet brief historical backgrounds into some of the wines and dishes we ordered.\n\nAll of the food came out very fresh and was DELICIOUS. Their bread knots are so crispy on the outside but oh so soft on the inside. I highly enjoyed their duck pasta... my mouth is watering as I am typing this and reminiscing over the flavours. \n\nIf you like Terroni, then you will LOVE what Buca has to offer.
