This really is my favorite Starbucks, for one simple reason: IT IS CLOSE TO MY HOUSE.\n\nI love being able to grab a coffee and sneaking in 30-45 minutes of reading, writing, or work before heading off somewhere. The staff here are very warm and friendly but sometimes tend to quietly ask you \"how are you doing?\" which gets them 20-minute delayed response from me. Sorry, sometimes things don't register so quickly with Angelo folks, (a life-time of missed first-kisses down the drain)\n\nAs much as people knock the unstoppable force that is STARBUCKS, I like this one. It fits like a MY shoes. Would I recommend my shoes to someone? No, you recommend one just like it, and there is a billion Starbucks in this universe. Go get your own.\n\nYelp's 30 Day Challenge 29\/30
