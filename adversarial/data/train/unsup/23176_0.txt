I'll start by saying customer service is not a strong point here. I stood in the shop with three staff not acknowledging me at all, while I tried to make eye contact and put on my best \"I need help\" face. I gave up and blurted out \"I'm looking to get my PS3 repaired\". Sorry, but stores where the customer has to break the ice when the place is empty have room to improve. That said, they did repair my PS3 in under\n24 hours, and for a reasonable price. When I came to pick it up, they had an offer for $10 off sticker on any game, so I picked up Far Cry 2, got home, and the box was empty! I went in the next day, they gave me the disc, but there was no apology. Customer service could improve lots, but they are in a convenient location, and the repair was good, so that gets them some stars. I'm on the fence about if I'd go back.
