!!!INFANT PARENTS BEWARE & $$$ DUMP!!! Upon sign up I filled out paperwork about what my child needs and what I want done. Within weeks my child gets home with a diaper rash (1 of 3). I said every diaper change apply ointment, CLA DID NOT! Then why the hell did I fill out paperwork! I spend my hard earned money to buy my child clothes, bibs, and sleeper covers, CLA SENDS OTHER CHILDRENS' CLOTHES, BIBS, AND SLEEPER COVERS HOME WITH ME! Best of all, my child comes home with other baby's bottles. All this was mentioned to the manager, and apology after apology after apology my child is being withdrawn and I am spending $265 a week somewhere else!\nSPEAKING OF MONEY, if you want to take a 3 week vacation make sure you save 3 weeks of daycare expenses. ($265x3= $795 in addition to plane tickets, hotels, etc. WOW!!!!) That's right folks, if you want that warm and fuzzy that you child has the elusive SPOT held, then be ready to dish out money for every week your child isn't there. Go down the street to lets say Le Petite Academy and they only charge you half tuition every week, NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!
