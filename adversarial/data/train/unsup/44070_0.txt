I haven't had the cheesecake factory in the states so i can't compare the quality but here is my experiences. The wait line of course is horrible for a Tuesday (1hr 20 mins) after 1pm so i do really recommend everyone to wait until the hype die down a bit before making a visit. \nAppetizers we picked tuna tartare and crab cake bites. Both portion were actually smaller than we thought but it did fill up. \nThe tuna tartare has a balanced flavours of soy and ginger, the avocado chunk at the base separately from the fish make the dish presentable. The chips were a bit too oily. \nThe crab cake bites came with 6 pieces, mayo and lemon wedge on the side. I Expected it to be more crunchy.  theres a decent amount of crab in the little bites which is worth it. \nJambalaya pasta with shrimp and chicken came in huge portion with a mixed of regular pasta and spinach pasta. I like my pasta more al dente tho. Pasta wasn't rinse thoroughly so it was clumped a bit. Sauce was well seasoned, no complaints. \nAlmond crusted salmon salad served with kale, quinoa, dried cranberry and dressed in light sweetened balsamic. Salmon skin is crispy and the crusted is not too heavy which makes the dish overall not bad \nTiramisu cheesecake is amazing. The cheesecake part is not dense, more of a mouse texture which makes it light and not so rich to indulge the whole thing. Base is sponge(lady finger) cake soaked w coffee or kahlua just like a regular tiramisu, two of my fave desserts combine into one make so much sense, i do enjoy it !
