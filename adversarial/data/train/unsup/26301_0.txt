Wow, why didn't I discover this place sooner?! I don't live on this side of town and was searching for a Dutch Bros or a Starbucks drive thru when we stumbled across this coffee shop. We went through the drive thru and ordered two large iced mochas which cost around $10. The employee we interacted with at the speaker and window was friendly, prompt, and politely tried to up sell us on a cookie or muffin.\n\n I am uncertain how they brew their coffee compared to other coffee shops but this was the best coffee that I have had in a very long time. It was AMAZING!!! Since that day other coffees I have brewed do not taste the same. I keep craving Coffee Bean. I plan to visit other locations closer to home to get my fix.\n\n*I took one star off because the drinks though yummy, are expensive. I wish they had a stamp card like Dutch Bros.
