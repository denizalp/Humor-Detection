this place definitely worths a ten star!!\n\nI ordered the capocollo  large thin crust and it was MAD AMAZING like you have no idea how good it was! I was carrying this pizza in 10f weather and I could see the steam coming out of the pizza box. I smell it and I almost decided just to eat in the snow but I had some self control so I took it back and shared it with my bf. my bf a super picky, critical eater even decided to give it a 4.5, which is prob the highest he's given any restaurant in a while.\n\nthe people working there were super friendly too. it only took me 10 min to get my lovely pizza. what a speedy service!!
