I arrived at the Olympic Stadium quite late in the evening to try out the food trucks. Many of the trucks had run out of food by 10PM but I ended up stopping at the Landry & Filles truck who were still serving food. I tried the Deluxe Meatloaf Sandwich and it was amazing. Every part of this sandwich down to the bread, the sauce and especially the meatloaf were perfect. The texture that the toasted bread added worked really well. I haven't eaten meatloaf in years and this one did not disappoint!
