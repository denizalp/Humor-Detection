Extremely nice and new venue that I think especially hockey fans are going to love once the Golden Knights start playing. The Mayweather vs. McGregor fight will also probably be amazing here. The only thing that may be a bit weird or a sort-of hit and miss would be concerts. I'm not sure if the arena will be able to be a five star concert experience. You just kind of have to see it in person to know what I mean. Still, this is a great arena that was thoroughly thought out and is going to be a solid arena for many years. Check it out if you haven't yet and I bet you'll be surprised with what you see!
