If I could give negative stars I would.   Absolutely the worst lunch experience my two friends and I have ever had.   We all have a rough day at work, but it is all in how you handle the bad situation.  The restaurant  manager was clueless.  Sat for 50 minutes and still no Lunch   Asked them to make it to go. That took another ten minutes.  Took it to go and two of our sandwiches were disappointing at best.  No apology ... just here is your bill.
