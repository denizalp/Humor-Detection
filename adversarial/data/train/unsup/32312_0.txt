Sienna Mercato is unique in that it is comprised of three floors - Emporio, Mezzo, and Il Tetto. I have not yet made it to Mezzo (too pricey for my blood), but I have gone to Emporio and Il Tetto on numerous occasions. Emporio is notorious for their absolutely mouth-watering meatball dishes. My go-to's at Emporio are the poutine and \"Saucy Balls\" with chicken meatballs, crack sauce, and mac & cheese. If you're still reading, you deserve to know the best kept secret about Sienna Mercato: their RICOTTA DOUGHNUTS. Accompanied by a bowl of dipping chocolate and paired with a nice cup of coffee, they're the perfect ending to an Italian night out. The service is always quick and the food will leave you wanting more.
