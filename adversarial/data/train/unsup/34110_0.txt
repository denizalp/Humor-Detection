This place sucks ass!!!!! To start you are greeting by what sounds like a night rave, only to be hurdled into the main walkway we're you stand amongst others scouring for an available seating option. Good luck with that because you won't find an open seat, available seat options, or a bench!!! For those parents who choose to whether the storm because of the hundreds of dollars they have spent for their kid to be a part of this so called tournament you can find a small bit of hope by choosing to sit on the hard gym floor hoping the ball doesn't bounce  into your face!! Oh did I mention if you do happen to find a seat some random guy who's not apart of the tournament, however concerned with your choice of seating will ask you to move because the few seats you did happen to score are for the \" coaches\" only! I mean seriously, get out of here with that! We moved, but only because our daughter hadn't played yet and we didn't want to cause a scene! The lack of air in this place is enough to make anyone adult or child feel as though they are in hell itself!!! They have 4 so called fans posted on the court which are blowing; nothing but hot air. Im surprised these players haven't passed out from heat stroke!! The one good part of this experience is we finally scored seats again!! More like seats in the fire of hell!! The two seats we \" scored\" were placed in front of a metal door that upon seating down felt more like you had been placed inside a 500 degree oven, now I know how Hansel and Gretel felt. Bottom line, Hoop City sucks!! #noAIR#dont#allthis$#dontcare
