We were having a problem and they were working on an RV next to ours.  They charged us $154.00 and didn't fix anything.  In fact they caused another problem that I had to fix.  They recommended that we take it to them so they could fix it.  They diagnosed the problem, however, it was the wrong diagnoses.  Johnny Walker RV took the RV and had it fixed in a 1\/2 hour and they only charged us $54.00.  I will never use these people again and I will never recommend them.  They caused more problems and fixed nothing.
