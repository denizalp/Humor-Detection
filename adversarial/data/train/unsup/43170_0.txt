The alterations are sub par but I like that they know me when I call or come in. They were busy my last appointment and I sat for a while. Which is strange since they only do appointments. So I was guaranteed my time. They told me I didn't need a ton of alterations on the gown I purchased in stock at Poffie Girls and it fit like a glove. After paying them $170 up front they didn't change much, and it fit differently when j went for my fitting. Overall satisfied but I'm not sure the things they \"altered\" were worth $170.
