The service was terrible, even after catching the waiter it still took a while for them to even acknowledge us. The food was so-so I could've made better at home. The chicken had no flavor, under seasoned and dry. I felt I could have just walked out and they wouldn't have noticed. 4 tables seated after use were served food before they took our order. Then the food took another 30 mins plus to arrive. Not a bad place, just lackluster service and bland food. And it wasn't even busy
