You know how there are some stores (I'm thinking Crate & Barrel, Pier One, etc., where the stuff looks really great all together, but you can't really pick one thing to buy because you realize that alone they won't look as good and they ONLY look great as a set?\n\nWell, Urban Home & Garden is the opposite. Everything looks like crap, but then if you look closely, you'll find one or two pieces that aren't too bad.\n\nEven still, I didn't bother trying to buy anything. The store is way too cluttered and mismatched that I got a headache trying to make my way around. Worst of all was the \"Easter section\" in the back. Am I the only one who really couldn't ever buy a porcelain bunny, even if it WERE 50% off?
