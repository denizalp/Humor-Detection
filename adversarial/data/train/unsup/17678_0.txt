In summary,  La Pretentious\/Truly over-hyped.\n\nAnd I'm talking about both food and service. \nFor Sunday brunch, I ordered feta scramble, which came with unimpressive taste, accompanied by overdressed salad (major turn off) and a piece of whatever-grade toast - wait, they're supposed to be a bakery, right?\n\nMy bf's omelet - ugh, mentioning would be a waste of space.\nMy friend's egg benedict - ordered with the poached egg medium done. What they brought out instead was wrong kind of egg benedict with super runny yolk that unfortunately decided to spill and ran to my friend's crotch. We sent it back and they brought us newly cooked mediocre dish.\n\nPiece of advise: Perkin's omelet can give La Brioche a serious run for the money, not to mention that Perkin's also would have a lot more pleasant staff, and better Feng Shui. Who cares about the pages of brochure going on and on about the ugly decor? Give us the true good food and solid service, and that should be enough to put patrons in good mood.
