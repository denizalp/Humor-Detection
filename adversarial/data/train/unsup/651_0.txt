3.5\nReally good choice when you have a large group of people, fun and efficient restaurant for groups.\n\nGives you a kitschy feel for old Vegas, and thats a nice warm fuzzy feeling for sure.  The pastel blue toilets, the bartenders that have been there for 35 years, the junk filled walls, its all nice.  It feels distinctly Vegas.\n\nEhhh the food- good value, complete meal with wine, salad, entree and coffee- neat package.  Im just not one for uber cheesy suacey carby Italian.  Not my thing dont enjoy it.
