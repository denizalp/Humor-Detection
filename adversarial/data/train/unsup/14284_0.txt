There are a bunch of pretentious self ritiuos self entitled ass clowns. The pious smiles on those stupid faces was only topped how they were too busy to find my dogs stollen colllar. I left my dog in my car for less then 30 minutes, in the shade with the windows down and some strumpet called 911 and animal control takes my dog to this \"shelter\" who then charged me $90 to get her back, on top of losing her colar. Then they treat me I'm a villian because the reporting woman said the dog wasin the car in the sun with the windows up for over 2 hours. I guess they trust total freak show losers more than their owners.\n\nI literally rescued this dog from the woods in Texas (a kill on site state), she was 12 lb, starving, scared, and looked like a skeleton. She was sick six ways to sunday. I spent $2000 dollars getting her healthy, and got kick out of my apartment which didn't allow pets. Then spent another $1000 dollars when she got a punchured lung at a dog park . This, all for a dog I found in the woods. Do you really thing I'm going to lock it in a car to die? Am I really a villian? The crew at that \"shelter\" need to check their attitudes before treating people like Michael Vick.\n\n\nOH YEA! When I asked if there was another option besides paying this outrageous bill, the uncaring bearded rope-pusher casually said \"we euthanize, or put up for adoption, yours we would euthanize\".... I hate that place and everyone in it.
