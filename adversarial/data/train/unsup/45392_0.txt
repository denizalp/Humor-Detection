Had an excellent experience here tonight!\n\nTheir crepes and waffles are made JUST right, everything isn't overly sweet. Drinks are made with love, every hot beverage is served with a design on the top, I love it! \n\nA small little place, but just enough for you to enjoy a nice dessert after dinner.\n\nWant something savoury? They've got that too!\n\nDefinitely will be back to try more!\n\nP.S.\nService was also excellent
