Oh the joy and thrill of hanging out with newly 21 year olds and taking them to their first Fat Tuesday!  Hahahaha,  it's been soooooo long since I had one of these and a sip of these made me reminisce about my younger days.  This is a must try!  Skip out on all the other alcoholic slurpee-like places and come here instead.  Super recommended!\n\nIt's tasty and even sharing a Yarddog with someone else will get your buzz going!  I always recommend adding an extra shot as it's only a $1 so doooooo it!  I've tried several flavors, but I always end up back to my default with the Mango and Strawberry.  But more mango than strawberry for me!  After you're done and craving some more, rinse it out and bring it back.  You get a couple $s off if you do.  c:\n\nCareful about that daytime hangover though!  Hahaha.
