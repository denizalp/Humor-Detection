Vincent is mean. I DID get praline crumbles at this location on Saturday.... Even though Vincent decided to rudely say \"YOU DIDN'T GET THEM HERE\"\n\nWow Vince...... You had to do me like that? #cold\n\n2\/22\/16\nOnce again NOT A PLEASANT BARISTA IN THE PLACE! So frustrating getting the wrong drinks, and receiving old soy milk in the cup.. I'm over it. There should be a -1 rating available for places like this. \n\n6\/24\/16\nHow is that every soy drink curdles at this location!? 4 out of 5 drinks (I always use soy) will have chunks of soy @ the bottom (btw I should never have too use \"chunks\" and \"soy milk\" in the same sentence)... \nYet nowhere else do I seem to have this ONGOING problem.\nNot trying too continuously bash this Sbucks, just need too learn my lesson and stop giving 2nd, 3rd and 80th chances.
