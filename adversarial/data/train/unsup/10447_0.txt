I dont know how anyone could have given this place a good review.  \n\nSeriously, I took our staff there based on the Yelp rating and a homeless guy tried pan handling to three of our office girls at night who were scared out of their mind.\n\nThe food selection was not good and the place was tiny.  The reviews are really misleading.
