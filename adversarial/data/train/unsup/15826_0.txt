Why don't you one star  people stop bitching about the service.  It is a cheap buffet morons.  I bet you go to WalMart for the cheap prices and bitch about the long lines and poor service there too!  Most of the people who work here are illegal and making $2 an hour.  Look if you want take out this is the best deal because after 9PM EVERYTHING in 50% off on takeout!\nSo tonite,  instead of $4.95 a pound I am loading up on Salmon, shrimp, and egg rolls, chicken at $2.50 a pound! Where can you get 4 pounds of shrimp and salmon for $10?   At the market you have to pay $7 a pound and have to cook it too.  So if you live near here wait until 9 PM  run down here and load up, take it home.  Then you don't need to worry about  bad service.  Need I say more?
