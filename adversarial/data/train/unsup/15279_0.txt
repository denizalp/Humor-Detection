I'm going to title this Yelp review, \"Why?\"\n\nSo Wynn, why are you so south of the strip?  I'm spoiled and enjoy staying at the Elara where I am prime walking distance from Earl of Sandwich, Fat Tuesdays, and the Cosmo.\n\nWhy are your policies so strict--can't rearrange the snacks and mini bar, you'll charge me if things are out of place for more than 60 seconds?  Who are you?  And then why does it take you an hour and a half to send a mini bar staff to examine our mini bar when we inquired about the $200 charges we got hit with because we supposedly took items out of the mini bar for consumption...when we didn't?  Oh wait, you didn't even send somebody to sort it out and instead, why did it take like five phone calls to the front desk to get it sorted out before you decided to drop the charges that shouldn't have even been there in the first place?\n\nAnd why is it that for a luxury hotel, I can hear Surrender and XS's blaring music from my hotel room?  Do the people who stay here not have to sleep?  I understand it's Vegas and folks are up until the crack of dawn, but when I want some peace and quiet, I can't even have that?\n\nI'll give it to you for everything else because the hotel is gorgeous, the rooms are spacious, the pool is amazing, and it is nice to be able to walk downstairs and XS is footsteps away.\n\nBut why the unresponsive service and the lack of noise control?  Why, I don't understand.
