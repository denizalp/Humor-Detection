I drove over 400 miles from California to buy my car here!!! If you have looked for a Highlander hybrid Platinum, go to KBBs website & you can see in the entire US there are 19, that's it!!!\n\nI got the best price possible! I even used USAA car buying service & got contacted by 20 dealers a day, but they could not even compare! The best part was that Avondale had the exact color, style & add-on that I wanted, it was a perfect fit & perfect price! There were 2 dealers in CA w\/ the Highlander in a diffetent color than I wanted, they both said they would charge me MSRP & wouldn't let it go for less.  I got mine from Avondale for over $2,000 UNDER MSRP!!!\n\nElgin did everything over the phone to get it started. He was professional, personable, nice, helpful, kept on contact with me, patient, the list goes on & on.  We drove there to pick up my car right on my birthday, the timing was perfect.  I am SO happy that I found the car when I did.  They had a price increase on the car online, but they honored the original price (unlike any other dealer, that told me they were sitting on a goldmine & wouldn't go below MSRP).\n\nIf I lived in Avondale I would go there for service for sure.  The dealership is spacious, nice, comfortable; has wifi, snacks, coffee, clean restrooms.  The dealers close to me in California are not nearly as nice, professional or competent.  I have had a very hard time finding a good service center here, still haven't.\n\nI still cannot believe how lucky I am to have found my car, this dealership & our dealer, Elgin.  I absolutely love my Highlander hybrid platinum!!! We also have a 5 year old Rav 4, we got rid of our BMW 330xi and kept the Toyota.
