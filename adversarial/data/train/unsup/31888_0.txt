GOOD food for GREAT value! Not only are the prices reasonable but the food is yummy and the portions are substantial. Servers are friendly and the menu choices are varied. There's something for everyone. Best part? The MUSIC they play is AMAZING...deep 80s tracks that you live and don't get to hear. Overall LOVE IT!
