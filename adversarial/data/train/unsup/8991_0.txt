I kind of want to hate this place. My previous experiences with Whole Foods were all incredibly negative. But the fact is, I think I just dislike the people of Yorkville. \n\nThis Whole Foods was absolutely delightful. Their lunch counter, though incredibly expensive, provides tasty food. In fact, I think they have some sort of healthy lunch buffet on Mondays for salad. \n\nAlso, as a person who favours organic\/sustainable food and is allergic to dairy, Whole Foods can be a kind of mecca. I nearly cried when I saw their selection of Daiya products. But I was able to keep it together, thank goodness.\n\nAlso, because this isn't Yorkville, no one tried to run me down with a shopping cart OR skip the checkout line. The checkout people are incredibly friendly and fast. The lady at my counter chatted with me and asked me how I was doing as if we were old friends. \n\nDammit, Whole Foods. You may be expensive but you've got a new customer in me!
