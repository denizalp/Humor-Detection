I love this place.... Today I wanted fish and I got it.  Made to order stewed Red Snapper fish..,,\n\nDelicious!!!! The fish was moist and since it's made to order you don't get that dry fish that was made this morning and was leaning in the show case glass next to the beef patties. \n\nMmmmm! On my next visit what should I get next...
