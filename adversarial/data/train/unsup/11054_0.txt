This location is so different than any other locations than I've ever been to.  They are well stocked, well organized and you won't be disappointed with all the great prices.  I really enjoy the fact that their foot traffic is low or at least the time that we were there.  It makes shopping really pleasant and you find a lot of great stuff that you won't expect from a Big Lots.  If you sign up for their Buzz club rewards card, you'll get deals and rewards by email. \n\nLet's just get down to all the good stuff.  The have a huge selection of seasonings like basil, curry, garlic and many more and all for just a buck.  They have a great chip selection with my favorite Tostitos scoops, but I was able to find a different brand for under $2.  Maybe, I haven't visited a Big Lots in a while, but I enjoy their edibles section.  \n\nThey had nice pieces of furniture to choose from, but I thought the pricing was still a bit over my budget, however it's totally reasonable compared to most retail stores.\nThe variety of candles are insane, you got the small jars, big jars, candles without jars, and so many scents to choose from.\nThey had a great selection on shower curtains and so reasonable and as low as $7, you can change it out every few months to get a new design for the changing season.\n\nGreat location and I do drive out of my way to get here, because I read so many raving reviews.  On point, Yelpers.
