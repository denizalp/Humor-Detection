GO NOW. \n\nThis is the first place in quite a long time to blow my socks off. Every dish we tried was a flavor explosion to the extreme. The second you try a dish here you can tell they aren't taking any shortcuts in the kitchen. They ooze authenticity and quality that is lacking at so many other local Chinese joints. \n\nI've been daydreaming about this food daily since first checking it out, no joke at all. There is magic brewing in this non-descript building on Apache. The bar has been raised people. Try this place, and you will be hooked. \n\nTempe folks...if you let this place fail, I may never forgive you. \n\n5\/5
