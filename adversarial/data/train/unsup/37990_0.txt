I really like the food.  Housemade tortillas and fresh ingredients!  Portions are quite generous and service was pretty friendly.  What I do not like: sneaky upcharges.  I ordered the pork barbacoa last night and when asked if I wanted my hot sauce \"enchilada style,\" I said yes.  I mean, the more sauce the better, right?  Well, apparently spooning extra sauce over a burrito is hard work that equals a dollar.  Yup, getting your burrito \"enchilada style\" will cost you a buck.  I only learned that upon reading my receipt.  Apparently, there are other upcharges, like requesting sour cream, guac, etc.  I'm guessing that any innocuous question posed by a staff member hides an upcharge.  Just say no, kids.  Or, buyer beware.  \n\nAlso keep in mind that if you're a hands-on type of eater, you may have to develop knife and fork skills to eat here.  Not a dealbreaker in my book, but may be a shock to some folks!\n\n3* for sneakiness.
