honestly, i'm not really a buffet fan since all you-can-eat places are really a loss for people like me who can be totally satisfied by one humble plate of food. however, fiance and i went here with cousin and her family and had a great time. it was sunday champagne brunch and we got there early enough to avoid the ridiculously long lines. its all you can drink champagne so if you're thing is to gorge on alcohol and prime rib at 10am, this is definitely the place to go! bellagio's buffet specializes in breadth rather than focus. lots and lots of options but none of the specific dishes really stands out to me as amazing. \n\ni started with a breakfast course and was really unimpressed with the eggs benedict - the english muffins tasted stale and the hollandaise was bland. also, there were no hash browns to be found! however, the cheese blintzes, french toast and waffles were all tasty especially when topped with their sweet berry sauces.\n\ni then moved on to a sushi course as the bar had just started to open. the seaweed salad wasn't bad and they actually had a great selection of veggie roles. next, i had the typical buffet plate of mashed potatoes, veggies and prime rib. the potatoes were pretty good - dense but creamy. unfortunately, the prime rib was way too bloody and rare. i should have asked for the end cut or had the chef at the carving station sear it a bit longer on the grill. \n\nall in all, as far as buffets in vegas go, its definitely a winner. great ambience and free-flowing alcohol.
