LOVE Happy Dog. How can you wrong with make your own hot dog creation for a couple bucks? They have an insane list of toppings from nacho cheese to fruit loops.\n\nThe French fries are awesome. I wouldn't suggest the veggie dog, stick to the beef dog. They have a great beer selection. The atmosphere is a little uncomfortable but the food makes it worth it. \n\nThey offer trivia (which I've heard is fun) and host a pinball league (which I've also heard is fun). This is a Cleveland MUST DO.
