OK, I'll joking aside the coffee really does hold it down. I don't really need a beautiful woman in a bikini to hand it to me, because the coffee is good. But, I'm sure glad that they're there to hand it to me bikini beans espresso is like FOXNews they hire the best looking women and their sweet as can be, but then they also talked me into buying a friggin burrito.\n\nThe Burrito itself is also good it wasn't great but it was a breakfast Burrito but I never supposed to be. But they have a very good sales technique it's called sex and sex sells. I was almost a shamed to take photographs but I really wanted to. I'm sure they would've been a good sport and I whipped out my camera, as opposed to whipping out anything else.\n\nWhoever thought of this is a genius, I'm sure it's probably ended in somebody's divorce somewhere and they're not thinking so, but I think it's a genius idea it's in the perfect area and there were lines so many people seem to think so also.
