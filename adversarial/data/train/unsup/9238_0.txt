My friends got me the Black Forest cake and it was the worst cake I have ever had. I think what got me the most was the cream. The cream was a absolutely revolting. It was not creamy, it was not smooth or fluffy. It was hard and gross. As a result, it really did ruin the cake a lot. I definitely wouldn't recommend this cake. \n\nps. I AN STILL GRATEFUL MY FRIENDS WENT THROUGH THE TROUBLE OF GETTING ME THIS CAKE BUT YAH ITS NOT GOOD NO BUENO
