I hate that my 200th review has to rip a new one for Insomniac, because yes even they are the most prestigious EDM event company there is always room for improvement. I feel this EDC was equivalent to my experience at the last EDC in LA. \nHere is what I had HELLA issues with this year:\n1. HELLA UN-PLUR people..really people you are at a massive rave where people are on all sorts of crazy substances and have a culture all of their own..don't come into our community and bag all over how we are down to be PLUR to complete strangers that is the most disrespectful thing a hater can do. If someone accidentally bumps into you don't try and fight them, just smile and keep moving...the nerve of some of these wannabe ravers. \n2. WHY ARE LIGHTS NOT ALLOWED?!? How is my orbital going to cause harm to anyone?!\n3. REFUND FOR SATURDAY! I understand that due to the whether it was best for the safety of the artists and fans, but if I waited almost 3 hours to get it and got turned away then swipe my ticket to see that I didn't enter Saturday and give me a refund!\n4. UNORGANIZED!\n5. If DJs start spinning at 7pm then why do doors open exactly at 7...shouln't they be open at least half an hour earlier (pissed because I almost missed Morgan Page)\n6. Why is there an 'effin smoke shop that sells bongs if security is coming by me trying to take my blunts away! \n7. DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT TRAFFIC!!!!\n\nEven though this is my 5th EDC I did have an amazing time, and I am planning on attending EDC for the rest of my life, because overall it is definitely the experience of a lifetime. I do have to give a big thank you to Armin and the rest of A State of Trance for keeping the party going through the ASOT program on Saturday night when it shut down. Definitely spreading the love through the sound of music.
