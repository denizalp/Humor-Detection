I enjoy the private space. When you're there you're the only client. This makes for a nice relaxing experience. Patricia a lovely woman who is a pleasure to sit with. She makes sure I'm comfortable and always has fun stuff to watch on the tv while enjoying my service. Her prices are outstanding and her work is impeccable. If you love nail art then I don't think you can find anyone who does it better than Patricia. She is very creative and on top of all the latest trends. Her first time customer deal of 50% off is the best I've ever seen, so if you haven't tried her yet then get to it! You will definitely become a regular because she is amazing.
