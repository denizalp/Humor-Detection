So sllllloooowww. Ordered a fiesta plate,\nBeef kalaguen, and a spam musubi. Waited almost 50 minutes for it. So don't go when it's busy. Or order ahead.  \n\nSummary: long wait time. skip the grilled meats and get the other items. \n\nOnto the plate: Sub the salad if possible it's a throwaway and makes the fiesta plate feel like it's not worth the price. \n\nCan the red rice can be more red? If eaten with the meats it gets lost. And the meat just tastes like grilled meats. The beef and pork was tough. Chicken was the best. The chicken kelaguen was good reminded me of larb. But the best thing were the shrimp patties! Crispy outside and tender in the center. \n\nBeef kelaguen was nice (like beef ceviche) and one of the better things i had. Ordered it with yummy corn (+1$) titiya(tortilla) \n\nSpam musubi was good but again would be better if the red rice was more spiced or however they make it. Tasted like any other musubi.\n\nI'm no expert in Guam food but I didn't feel like I got a real taste of it from what I ordered.
