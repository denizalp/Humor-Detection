Randy and his TruLine painting crew were really great!  They just finished painting our entire house.  This included walls, ceilings, trim and doors.  Randy's estimate was extremely reasonable, and the start time was very flexible.  They were also worked quickly, as we were on a time restraint.  Randy helped guide me as I searched for the \"perfect\" white, and helped me choose the right color when I wanted black doors (something that could have gone very wrong).  The colors came out just right!  When his crew were finished, Randy came by to inspect the job and sent out a follow up crew to do touch up work.  Everyone was extremely friendly and professional and cleaned up after themselves after the work was finished.  I would highly recommend TruLine painting for any of your painting needs.
