Wow .... wow... We moved to the Garfield Neighborhood about a month ago and have been putting off going here, first because I was never sure when it was open and next because it looked incredibly small and over crowded every time I drove by. Turns out they're open fairly normal hours and the patio is pretty big..... my fault. \n\nMy wife and I both ordered burgers I just got the normal welcome burger (I think that's the name) and my wife got a peanut butter topped burger. The food got to us fast and my burger was the best I'm had in months! my only real complaint is that I didn't order the same burger as my wife because her burger was way better than mine! oh and also if you get fries you get about 10 ... A really tasty 10 but not enough or maybe it was an illusion and they just need smaller plates. \n\nI'll be going back soon for burgers and probably to try a few other menu items as well!
