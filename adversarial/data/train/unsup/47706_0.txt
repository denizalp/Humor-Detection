The staff at this location is very knowledgeable, especially the wonderful young lady named Mariah that helped me when I came in with the decision to color  my hair. She must have noticed my blank stare bc she lead me to the products that would get me there. I don't know what I am doing and she even went out of her way to write down instructions for me . Talk about going the extra mile , I love my hair and would have never been able to do it without her help .
