I didn't expect much since it's near a gas station, there were wrappers outside, and the clientele entering the joint looked like they'd be willing to throw down if I glanced at their wings the wrong way. \n\nEntering this establishment with my wife and son seemed as though it confirmed my suspicions: dark and only patrons at the bar, possibly drinking it up before noon. We cautiously sat down, and I wondered if we would make it to the meal. But I kept thinking: \"I can't Yelp it if I leave without eating!\" Therefore, I held firm, puffed out my chest (not literally), and ordered water for the family. \n\nHave you ever met a tattooed motorcycle gang member that looked like he wanted to kill you but then ended up being the coolest person you ever met? Probably not. But pretend you did. That's The Vinyl Pi (for restaurants). \n\nThe waitress was friendly. We only ordered a pizza, which took about 20-25 minutes, but that was okay because I knew that meant it was more likely to be good. And the pizza was pretty good. A lot of seasoning on the crust, but still solid. My wife thought it was great. Don't put it in the Brooklyn South or Tony's category, but it's strong for bar pizza. I wish I had ordered the wings, but now I have an excuse to go out for a beer or two so I can update this review. \n\nYou're probably wondering about the bathrooms. Okay, probably not, but the bathroom was spotless. We were there only one hour into service and there were only a few people dining\/drinking, which helps. This is hours before people drink too much and have the potential to urinate on the doorknob. \n\nOverall, I would recommend The Vinyl Pi as long as you're comparing it to most bar\/restaurants and not 131 Main. It's a Pizza Joint & Bar. It even says so on the marquee!
