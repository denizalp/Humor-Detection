Wow, what a unique ice cream shop! You kind of get the feeling that the product is more important than the decor\/presentation. (Handwritten signs, kind of \"bare bones\" shop,etc.) That's okay with me.\n\nMy husband and I shared a four-scoop bowl. At $4.95, that's a deal that's hard to beat for really GOOD ice cream. The scoops weren't huge, but they were a nice size and the bowl was enough for the two of us to share.\n\nWe had the peanut butter and jelly, cocoa puffs, carrot cake, and chocolate passionfruit which had a salted caramel flavor to it as well. Out of all of them, I enjoyed the chocolate passionfruit the most. It was so smooth and creamy. Many of the flavors had \"stuff\" inside. While it tasted good, it seemed a little awkward because the consistency of the ice cream was so smooth. Plus, the carrot cake ice cream with a little bit of coconut was perfect; the cream cheese chunk I got was overkill. Same with the brioche bread in the peanut butter & jelly (though I LOVED the jelly swirl). \n\nAnyway, it was delicious. Since I'm so much closer to Mitchell's and Sweet Moses, I would probably return to either of those first, but next time I'm in Tremont I'll definitely patronize Churned again.\n\nMy husband asked me to add the following:\n\"If you don't give this place five stars on Yelp, you're dumb. Also, now I regret moving out of Tremont.\"
