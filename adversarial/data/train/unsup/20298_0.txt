This is how to find Vice Presidents and Higher Ups if you have a complaint on this company: \n\n1. Go to Linked In and the Search Box simply type Payless Car Rental and all of the highest level people will appear.\n\n2. Connect with them or send them an inmail. \n\nNO STARS!!!!\n\nIF YOU HAVE A MORTAL ENEMY SEND THEM HERE!!! I am not used to reviewing anything; so imagine how motivated I am to tell you about this horror story. But where to begin? First, the website estimated a three day rental of a compact car at $75 but when we got to their office at the airport it went up to $250!!! What type of estimate is that? A crooked one.  And mind you this was without the stupid insurance and all other things they wanted us to pay. Then, when we went in Sedona a red oil light went off which shortened our trip and which after hours of waiting on the phone they told us is simply a mistake. WORSE YET, THE ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE HAD AN ANSWERING MACHINE SAYING THAT THERE WAS NO ONE AVAILABLE AND TO PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE. Furthermore, they added fuel without asking us and were pushing us to get a SUV because it was a better drive when going to Sedona, AR and it was better gas mileage. This whole company including the immoral, bottom feeder customer service must be reviewed by some type of regulatory body. If I had an attorney I would have sued the whole out of damn for fraud. This is really what Payless Rental is: A FREAKING FRAUD MACHINE THAT ENDLESSLY LOOKS TO MAKE A BUCK AT THE EXPENSE OF LYING AND MANIPULATING. ITS EMPLOYEES OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED THAT THEIR FAMILIES KNOW THAT THEY WORK THERE. I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU ALL END UP OUT OF BUSINESS. YOU LOUSE.
