This is the worst portuguese I have ever had. It's the only option for portuguese miles around and i have tried it a couple times now.\n\nChicken is tasteless. Piri piri and spices are nowhere to be found. Potatoes watery, rice just bad.\n\nOh, and if you want something you better phone ahead...the chance of walking in and getting something is rare.
