I was so sad when Monte Lago closed, so I am relieved they have reopened.  I'm particularly glad the cafe reopened and still has the best portabello fries I've ever had.  The are very lightly breaded, somehow crispy and juicy at the same time.  I noticed a few things have changed in the casino.  All the black jack tables are now automated, which I guess is a more sustainable model for their business.  My brother in law is also pretty happy about the new free soda machine in the casino area.  It's great having such a conveniently located and intimate casino with good ventilation, so it's not too smokey.
