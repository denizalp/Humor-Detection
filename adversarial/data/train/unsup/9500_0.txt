When I was younger (read: middle school) I thought Sierra was pretty cool.\n\nAll you can eat SALAD BAR (which I had never heard of before) which you got for free when you order an entree. An expanse of cold pastas (penne, macaroni, etc) mixed with sundried tomato, pesto, etc. Soup (as if anyone ever ate it. seriously. I have never seen the soup pots less than 90% full). Raw veggies, coleslaws, breads. fruits. ALL FOR FREE! My frugal asian mind couldn't stand it. It was beyond amazing.\n\nNow when I go back I see what I failed to see before (wow. lyrics to a country song anyone?) which is that Sierra really isn't that great. The salad bar contains mostly starchy stuff like cold pastas or raw unflavoured veggies that have been sitting outside under their lights all day. the meals are mediocre (the meat is always wayyy too chewy. too hard to chew or swallow. you know when steak is like that? yeah.) and not anything special.\n\nI DO recommend their brunch (ends at 2:30) because I like waffles and I like ice cream. so maybe I'm still a little kid. don't hate.\nand I guess they can get some bonus points for bringing me happiness when I was smaller.\n\nBut all in all...meh.
