What!  What's pho without bean sprouts!!!!  Yet that was what we were told when we proceeded to order the house special.  They ran out.  It wouldn't have mattered if they substituted the sprouts for other ingredients instead, but they shut that idea down.  The bowls of pho came pretty quickly, and they were generous in portions although there weren't anything too special about the taste.  Just no sprouts.   Who knew we were that attached to the bean sprouts!  Despite no sprouts and no substitutions, the prices remained sadly unchanged.
