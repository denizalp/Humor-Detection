Okay - depressing story of the year.  Maybe the most unfortunately Yelp! review I've written in ages.  Was here last night, ordered the grilled cheese with mac and cheese on the side.  IT WAS ALL SO GOOD.  I was having the time of my life in cheese land.  But then the Full Fairy said, eat no more child!  You have not the room!\n\nSo I asked our server to wrap it up - the mac and cheese that I had 2 bites of.  After he rounded the corner there was a smash.  Shortly after, he came to alert me it was my mac and cheese that had crashed and said sorry...but did not offer me another wrapped up, which I thought would be protocol.  I mean, I bought the food and I wanted to take home....I just wanted my side mac and cheese.  He said the kitchen was too busy and there was no way that he would ask them to make another.  So he took a drink off our bill.\n\nBut I was still unhappy.  I just wanted my mac and cheese -- no price adjustments.  Just go to the back and get them to throw another one together.  I found the whole interaction so weird and later that night when I was hungry all I could think about was my mac and cheese that was no more.
