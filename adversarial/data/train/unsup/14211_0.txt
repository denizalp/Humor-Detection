Popped in morning after grand opening in hopes of avoiding the inevitable crowds this place  will be having. We were fortunate to only be sharing the place  with only 5 other parties\nService was efficient and friendly. Establishment clean and pleasant. They keep their music at a very acceptable level.\nWe tried the Red Velvet  with cream cheese syrup stack and the banana stack. Both were excellent. I hope try all 12 of their stacks eventually.\nThe eggs and hash browns and were also delicious.\nThis is a great breakfast\/lunch place that we will frequent.
