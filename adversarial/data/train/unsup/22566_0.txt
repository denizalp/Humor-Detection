I have been here for dinner and it was delicious, I've been here for brunch and it was wonderful. In the summer, the back, leafy terrasse is serene and positively lovely. The menu is fresh and you can tell they shop at the market and find what looks to be beautiful and fresh and work around it. It's a place that I feel comfortable with eating dinner on my own, which says a lot about the ambiance.  They don't go overboard on sauces, so you actually taste the food and there are a lot of choices here for vegetarians and non-meat eaters. Every single time I come here, I am Sound Hounding nearly every song, I totally love their playlist!
