There's a reason The Big Easy Animal Hospital is five stars! \n\nTo start off with, this place is clean and modern (and thank you Big Easy for providing us with a Keurig!). All of the staff were very friendly, both over the phone and in person. I was a little hesitant to take advantage of their walk-in services, thinking I might be there for hours. However, everything was handled very efficiently and I was in and out in under an hour (considering I had to fill out paperwork because I was new and my dog had to get hooked up to IV fluids, I consider that decent timing!). Dr. Ruiz was super sweet and gentle with my dog. She was easy to talk to and took the time to explain what was going on. I never felt rushed or stupid for asking my questions. Pricing didn't seem too bad, although it's not often my dog gets sick so I don't really have anything to compare it to. Overall though, this place was amazing. Definitely deserving of its five stars! \n\nAlso, I just wanted to add that the street parking around here is not metered. Yay!
