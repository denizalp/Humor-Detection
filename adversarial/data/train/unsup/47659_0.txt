I have been going to Dawn for a while now and I thought I would put up a review. She is by far my favorite nail tech I've found in Vegas. She does a great job with nail art and puts up with my crazy requests. The salon is clean, relaxing and does exceptional work. Everyone is friendly and willing to help each other. Thank you Dawn!
