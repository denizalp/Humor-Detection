Lets say you are being chased down the street by a gang of knife-wielding thugs who want to lay you on the ground, split your sternum down the middle and slowly eat your internal organs while you are still alive, and your ONLY chance is to duck into Jillys to save your life. My advice? Give the gangsters some ketchup and say \"Bon Appetit boys\"!\nThis place is home to some of the most unholy \"humans\" I have ever seen. And I use the term humans very lightly. Upon entering, the acrid stench of urine and crack stings the nostrils as only \"Sex Panther by Odeon\" can. Gyno Row was empty, save for the midget that was staring into oblivion, probably wondering to himself if the 400 pound stripper gyrating her gelatenous thighs would finally fall on him and end his miserable life. \nNeedless to say it was not the best place to hold a kids birthday party.\n\nIm kidding (about the birthday party). THis place is the worst sewer pit I have ever seen.
