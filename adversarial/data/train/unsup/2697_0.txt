Wow, went there tonight, thinking my wife and I would enjoy a little night out. Yeah it's the playoffs, but it's a Friday night at 9:15. We find a place to park. As we walk up, we notice the place looks busy, but not full. We go up to put our names in, an hour and forty five minute wait....\nHoly S$@T!!!! I don't think I've ever had anyone tell me that before. My wife looked at me, and we walked away. Once back in the truck, she looks at me again, and says, \"I can't believe she could say that with a straight face...\". Needless to say, not happy. We ended up going to downtown Gilbert, even on the busiest of nights in downtown, we wouldn't have to wait that long. I don't know what on earth could be done about that, but dang. \nI'm sorry we can't review the service beyond the hostess, or the food, we didn't want to wait almost 2 hours to eat. Not sure if we will go to try this place after tonight.....
