It has been about a year since Noble Carpet Cleaners has been to my house to clean our carpet and sofas.  They came last weekend and once again were not only early, but their equipment was out, and ready to start BEFORE my scheduled appointment time.  Once in the house, they were fast, efficient, and their price again was MORE THAN REASONABLE.  Don't get suckered by other cheap companies who merely run hot water over your carpet.  Use these guys, the best in town!
