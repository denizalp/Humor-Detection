I lived there for seven months. The grounds are nice. It is a very pet-friendly community. Lots of big dogs. I have a large dog, so I liked that. They do have a fenced-in dog park, but it's all dirt and rocks. The water fountains don't work, either. If it had grass and working fountains, it would have been perfect. \n\nThe staff was friendly for the most part. I noticed a high turnover during the seven months that I was there. I had an issue with a late charge being charged when I wasn't late paying my rent, but it was finally resolved when I vacated. But, I had sent numerous emails, called and stopped by a couple times. Each time I talked to someone different who said that they would have someone call me and the call never came. The emails went unanswered. I was at the point where I was just going to write off the $35 charge as not worth the hassle. But when I was turning in my keys, I spoke with a very helpful person who actually followed through and I was returned my $35 fee with my deposit. So, that ended well.\n\nI had a couple issues where a package would get delivered to the leasing office and I would go to pick it up around 5 or 10 minutes before the office closed and no one would be there. Once, I got there 10 minutes before closing and knocked on the door. A very rude lady answered the door and barked \"we're closed.\" I informed her that it wasn't 6 p.m. yet and I was just trying to pick up a package. She told me to wait then closed the door in my face and locked it. A different, more polite, lady came to the door with my package. Rude! \n\nIt was definitely hit or miss with the staff there. But, overall, the property is clean. The staff is usually pleasant. And the gated community with four pools, tennis courts, dog park and fitness facility aren't bad for the price.
