So...my family and I went to this restaurant to celebrate my daughters 23rd Birthday. I will begin by saying that the place is beautiful. Not the traditional Italian ambiance I am use too. But, a very modern appeal. The service was great no complaints there. This restaurant is located inside a casino so it didn't surprise us that the menu was pricey starting at $17 and up. And everything is a la cart, I ordered eggplant parmigiana very disappointed for the price my local pizza place makes a better eggplant. Then came chicken Marsala for my husband mind you he loves to eat the dish had 3 thin slices of chicken barely enough. He order pasta extra money on the side or he would have left hungry. The rest of my family dishes were meh. The dessert however were wonderful. When we all get together we like leaving a place with a feeling of WOW!  I'm definitely going back. Especially after getting a bill for $450.00. But, not this place. That was our first and last visit.
