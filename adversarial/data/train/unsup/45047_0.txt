Located between Venetian and Palazzo on restaurant row. Pretty relax place with several couches to relax and sip a drink. Everything we tried was excellent. Many of the items are huge and should be shared. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars was the lack of condiments. No tabasco sauce and no spicy or smokey barbecue sauces. Also you can order a Pepsi but only in a bottle. No refills. Lots of people like Tabasco on their food. Would it kill you to have a $4 bottle there just in case?
