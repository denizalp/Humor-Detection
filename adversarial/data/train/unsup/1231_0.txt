I must say I now know what it feels like to be pillaged.  I've had\n nothing but issues with this place.  As soon as my warranty which they are trying to screw me out of is over with I will be done with them.  You always hear the used car salesmen reference but until this place i've never had to deal with the stereotype.  The big banner in front says, \"Were back!\"  What it should say is bend over here we come again!
