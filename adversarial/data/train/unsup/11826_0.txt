When I visit Las Vegas, my very first meal is pho. I don't know why. This year I wanted to try somewhere different. \n\nPho Kim Long has nice interior. It's a big place. I was sitter right away. Good customer service. \n\nI ordered #16 pho with steak & flank. The soup had good flavor to it. It wasn't too oily which was nice. It was $7 something. The price was right.
