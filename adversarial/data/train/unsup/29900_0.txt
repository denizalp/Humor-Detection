I called ahead to set up a time to have my car vehicle towed to the dealership for service. I did this so that I could plan the rest of my appointments for the following day.\n\nThe young lady that took the call was very nice and helpful. I wanted to have the vehicle picked up at 7am, however she advised that if I waited until 8am the charges were less. She gets kudos for her good customer service. It stops there.\n\nI planned the rest of my work appointments based on their arrival at 8, one of which was to get my mom to a Dr. Appt at 8:30, which was by the dealership. But at 8:05, no tow truck, no call to say they were running late. I send my mom on her way and will have to ride to the dealership in the tow truck; and get to my mom's vehicle from there -hoping the dealership will take me (yes, they did. They rock!! That would be Desert Audi). \n\nAt 8:10 I call and before I can say why I am calling I am put on hold for 8 minutes. I hung up and called back. I was not put on hold this time, provided my information to be told \"oh yea, he's 15 minutes out.\" Like it was no big deal. \n\nI then asked why I wasn't informed that they were running behind? That I had called ahead to make an appointment so that is very thing would not happen. She transfered me to Dispatch.\n\nDispatch, after going over the details again, advised they were having driver problems. I asked why they didn't call to say they would be running behind...crickets! He apologized, unsympathetically. I asked for an answer - not an apology...crickets. \n\nThe Driver shows up 10 minutes later, he professional and nice, but I don't want to 'chit chat' I am running behind. When I asked why he was late, he said, \"you're faraway from our base (maybe 10 miles) and traffic was heavy. In my head I  thinking \"Of course traffic was heavy, dumba**, it's rush hour on a Wednesday.\" I, of course clean it up, as it leaves my lips. They knew when they dispatched him at 8, yes the time of my appointment, he would not be there on time. But no call. Lazy, bad customer service.\n\nSo, no good deed goes unpunished, yet again. The paperwork wasn't even completed with the details provided on the phone, this was another 15 minutes once the car was unloaded. \n\nMy hope is to never need a tow again, but one should never say never.  My advice is to call someone else.
