I can't speak for the entire store shopping experience because I was just picking up an order of springrolls. We had ordered to pick up at 2 pm, but we called ahead the day of and said we'd be at least a couple hours later. When I arrived to pick them up, I was told they had sold them to someone else because we were late. I explained that we had called in advance to change the pick up time. The man at the prepared food counter began yelling at me and lecturing me then said I had to wait while more were made. Then he walked away from me. \n\nI was prepared to just walk out, but we had 50 people coming over and I needed to bring these apps. So I waited. And I stewed with resentment after being treated so disrespectfully. But the real burn is the springrolls were crappy.
