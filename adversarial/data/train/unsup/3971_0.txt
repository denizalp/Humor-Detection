It is really really hard to find this Amtrak station. If you follow the signs around town, you will most likely get lost. You have to be merging onto rt 2\/90 going east, then turn around and look over your right shoulder while making a 120 degree turn, or you will miss it.\n\nThe other really misleading thing is that if you go to Amtrak's website and buy a ticket to Philly, sometimes you are not taking the train from Cleveland, but rather a bus from the greyhound station to Pittsburgh, then a train from their Amtrak station. This is really not at all obvious and more than a little maddening when you have already driven around the block and throughout downtown for 30 minutes and finally find the Amtrak station, only to realize you need to go the bus station 10 minutes away. Then you must hope you have a nice boyfriend like mine who is willing to chase the bus down as it's pulling out of the bus station since you almost missed it.\n\nWhen you are actually on Amtrak, it's about 53473243% better than Greyhound (and for that reason it merits two stars), but they sure don't make it easy for you to get on the train in the first place.
