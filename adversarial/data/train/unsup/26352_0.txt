Great job applying the Golden Rule!\n\nI stopped desperately needing a brake job, as my brakes were metal to metal. Unfortunately the shop was booked up for several days, but the manager, Blaine, actually referred me over to a competing shop that he recommended. He put the customer's needs ahead of his business needs, and I am very grateful. I will definitely return here first next time I need auto repair, as I know I will receive honest service. Thank you!
