We used Tony Williams Car Service (the \"party van\") for my daughter's prom. I contacted several companies to get quotes and Tony was the first to respond and was by far the best price because he was willing to split the cost and just charge us for the time spent picking up and dropping off instead of the whole block of time. We had a small issue reserving the vehicle but Tony and company really worked with us to resolve the situation. I was very impressed with their responsiveness and communication. We, as parents, had peace of mind that our children were getting to and from the prom safely and the driver, Steph, communicated with us every step of the way. I would definitely use their service again in the future. Thank you!
