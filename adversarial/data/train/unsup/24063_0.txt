These guys were nice over the phone, but that's about all I can say is good about them. I took my jeep in because it was having stalling issues. They spent little time on it and concluded an O2 sensor was completely dead and recommended I change it as well as at least one other. They also recommended some other pricey work get done on it. I took it to a couple other mechanics and they told me all O2 sensors were in fine working condition. In fact, nothing these guys recommended was necessary. \nThey charged me $65 for nothing and thought they were being nice.\nI don't understand why they're getting the good reviews they are. They'd replace everything in your vehicle with just a chance that it will solve the problem.
