If you're looking for a local bar with good food, this is the place to go. Huge interior, friendly staff, and outstanding bar food as far as bar food goes. The cheesesteaks are the best I've had anywhere, and the burgers are close to as good. Huge menu and a decent tap list with good variety. Late hours are a big plus for after-event hangouts.
