We love the Johnston family! We hired them a few years ago to do the outside of our home after my parents recommended them. They were considerate, well priced and did a great job! I have recommended them to friends ever since. We recently moved and wanted to change the color of our huge entryway. We, of course, called Alex. Again he gave us a great price. This time I had more communication with his son, Nevada, and was very impressed by him too. He was great about communicating with me and making sure my expectations were met. I will be using this company again in the future for all of my paint jobs and strongly recommend you do too!
