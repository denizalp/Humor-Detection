I'm really torn on whether to give this a 3 or a 4!! It's between there, I'd say- I've read so many reviews on this spot, I had to give it a visit. I luuuuurve dumplings and am always in the mood for them. I happily third wheeled my friends last night to come here and was surprised our hefty meal only cost us $50 taxes in!!\n\nHere was our order-\nXiao long bao aka soup dumplings aka GOODNESS. this is my favourite and fml they were so good, I felt a special kind of euphoria!! Cheap soup dumplings? I'm all about it!! They didn't squirt all over the place (lol stop your mind right now) and burn me so yess. 5\/5\nSteamed chicken dumplings - quite large but had an off taste to them. eh. 3\/5\nSteamed pork and leek dumplings - yummy! Tastes way better than most places that make this and overload on the leek. Really juicy too. 4\/5\nThat tin foiled wrap beef roll thing - y'all already know what I'm talking about. This was a treat and my first time having this thing! Not too oily so yay! 4\/5\nBraised beef noodles - so good, beef was tender and taste was good overall however there's a lot of MSG in the soup. I was thirsty until the AM. 3.5\/5\n\nService is standard Asian service. So it'll do as long as you don't need anything extra. \n(However my friend told me she found a tile in her dumpling once... and they tried to deny that it was theirs..? I don't know, man)\n\nAll in all, it was a solid cheap eats spot! I approve.
