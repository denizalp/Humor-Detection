I finally found my new salon! After moving to the Mesa Tempe area I've had a hard time finding a salon I liked, until now. Michael did my fills and he did an amazing job and was very friendly. I'm not sure what her name was, I think she was one of the owners, but the woman who was at the front desk was very nice as well. I will definitely be back!
