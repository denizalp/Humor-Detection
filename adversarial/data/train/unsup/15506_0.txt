No complaints about the food. We had nachos, a side of their macaroni and cheese (yum!) and a side of ceaser salad. \nOk. I know the Hard Rock Cafe is more fun than your average restaurant. But I don't think the waiters should hit on you unless solicited. Mr. Waiter even had the audacity to pull up a chair, sit down at our table and say \"well I'm bored, its a slow night so I'm going to hang out with you ladies.\" Not cute. So I dropped an obvious \"boyfriend bomb\" to try and send a hint across, but no luck. As he handed me the bill he proposed a date. Hint clearly did not make the point earlier. ATTENTION CUTE WAITERS: We the customer must initiate the \"hitting on\" for it to be ok for you to return it.
