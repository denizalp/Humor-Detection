You're basically paying to get hosed on! : )\n\nNever say never.  I wasn't planning on buying anything although the sales guy was pressuring my father in law into trying the water massage. \n\nI was fine with the little electronic massage thing making my shoulders twitch. I can't think of the name of the thing but somehow in the end my father in law ended up with one of those electronic thingy and wifey and I received free massages. \n\nThe massage experience was interesting.  If you're the claustrophobic type you might want to skip this one.  Although, I would have to say that it wasn't too bad after you've started.  The water pulsates up and down your body.  When the water gets close to your shoulder area, it's pretty loud.  \n\nIs it relaxing, sure if you're able to tune people out and allow the loud noise to relax you along with the water jets.  \n\nOverall it was okay but it's such a tourist trap and it was okay.  I wouldn't recommend it if you've just gorged out on buffet food.\n\nI would learn the art of saying no as these sales folks can pressure the weakest consumer into purchasing one of their products.\n\nThe product was a High-Dow portable electronic deep tissue massager.  Retail they were attempting to sell it to my father in law for $129.00. Luckily for my father in law, he's has a great daughter who was quick to let him know on Amazon it was $51.\n \n\"You try, you buy!\"\n  \nI suppose I should eat my words about the weak consumer in this case because it's all about negotiating the price down.
