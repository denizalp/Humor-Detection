This was my primary vet for years but I've since switched due to some unscrupulous practices. Firstly I had a ferret I was fairly sure had adrenal cancer due to having had other ferrets with the disease before. I know not all vets are equipped to deal with this so I specifically asked if she could be treated for the cancer at this facility and was told yes. Once I got there and paid the $50 exam fee I was told she probably had adrenal cancer and they couldn't treat her there. Lying to customers is never good. Then after my new puppy came down with a cold they tried to push Xrays on me even after they admitted their course of treatment would be no different should I get the xray or not. When I again refused the xray they made me sign a guilt laden form stating that I had repeatedly denied their medical advice and anything happening to my pet was my fault. Another time I waited over an hour past my appointment time for vaccinations. Other times the staff has been polite but I dont really like being lied to, guilt tripped, and treated like my time is unimportant.
