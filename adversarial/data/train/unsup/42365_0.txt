Placed an order togo lastnight with the bf, ordered a 12\" stuffed pizza ( I believe that's what it is ) we also ordered baked ravioli. \n\nThe pizza was huge and looked delicious, got to my apartment ready to dig in, it was just a tad bit too salty for our taste.  The baked ravioli were pretty good, nothing to go crazy for.  My bf called them to let them know that the pizza was just a bit too salty and the employee kindly explained that because of the type of cheese they use, sometimes the pizza ends up that way.  He apologized and offered to send us a gift card for the amount that the pizza cost.  \n\nFirst time having it, wasn't too bad. I'd definitely like to try it again but dine in. :)
