This is one of my favorite micro-brewery stops when I am in Montreal. The reason is it is one of a handful of MB\"s that has a ample selection of Pilsners, Lagers and Helles unlike most MB that are predominately Ale driven. My favorite is the Cerna Hora, a Czech style pilsner which is wonderfully done and I'm told that it is supplied to the local Czech Consulate, I'd say that is a ringing endorsement. This little brewery packs a big punch and should be on your beer tour list when visiting the city.
