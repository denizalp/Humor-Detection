With all the five star reviews I honestly don't understand what all the hype is about? I wasn't impressed to say the least. We came in and were seated immediately, given menus and drinks to start. The servers weren't very friendly and didn't seem to enjoy their job at all. No worries I can deal with that, but I cant deal with bland rubbery chicken which is what came with my tasting  plate. It came with rice and beans fried plantain ropa vieja, lechon asado, and tequila pollo. The chicken was rubbery, the pork (lechon asado) was lacking in flavor and the ropa vieja just had a weird taste to it. The salad was ok but I didn't like it very much either and that's weird because I love salad. The offered us bread halfway through eating our entrees. It needed a sauce for dipping it was boring on its own. My boyfriend loved the lechon asado he ordered but for me it was one of the worst meals I had in a long time. Overall the service was subpar and the food mediocre I don't know why they're so highly rated but I guess everyone's opinion is different.
