I'm just here to let everyone know about the awful service, or lack thereof, that I received after my car was broken into and my valuables taken.  The manager never even once in the four hours that it took for law enforcement to assist me during this crime--which happened in the parking lot, in broad daylight, where my car window got smashed out and my belongings taken--came outside to see what was going on, never offered any assistance, never offered any discount, rebate, or other relief as a result of what happened.  In fact, he acted completely the opposite, as we all witnessed while he ranted at one of his employees over a hot mike walkie-talkie about how \"there's a sign posted, we don't call the police around here, you take your chances\", etc. that sort of thing.  I don't hesitate to post this review regardless of how disparaging it is, because the management of that course cannot ensure the safety of its guests and their personal belongings during broad daylight.\n\nAs a result of this, that course has permanently lost four customers who suffered through this experience.
