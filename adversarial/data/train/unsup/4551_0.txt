I'm not sure what happened to this place.  My first visit was great as their green tea egg waffle (with a generous scoop of green tea ice cream) and the snacks (sesame seed rice roll and curry fish balls) were excellent. They were sold out of Taiwanese style shaved ice at the time, so it was nice to know that I can come back for another visit.\n\nAfter last night's visit however, I now want to spend the next 3 life times studying quantum physics to have a shot at inventing a time machine - I'll call it the \"Phonewave 3000\" (name subject to change) - to stop myself from ever coming back to this place.\n\nA few things went wrong on this night:\n\nFirstly, the line up at the Arctic Bites was crazy (damn BlogTO and their up-to-date & thorough coverage of the latest happenings in the city). So my sugar withdrawals had kicked in already. \n\nSecondly, the green tea Taiwanese shaved ice came in a deep round stone bowl. I had to do a double take to confirm that I was at a dessert place and not at a Korean restaurant ordering dohlsot (stonebowl) bibimbap. That's probably me nitpicking. Fine, I'll look past it.\n\nSECONDLY, there was a mysterious milk-like liquid that came with the order. It didn't taste like milk or cream so I asked the server what he thought this liquid was. He simply replied \"I dunno.\" I'll never know what it was.\n\nThirdly, the shaved ice and the green tea ice cream was definitely made from an old stash that had freezer burn. If I wanted to eat ice shavings from an old freezer with a hint of pork and chives dumpling aftertaste, I can easily do it at home.\n\nOverall, it was quite disappointing to try a TW shaved ice that was wrong on so many levels (seriously, what was that liquid?). But, I'm still giving 2 stars because I will have to thank someone when the time machine is complete and it might as well be you, Sugar Marmalade.
