Now, if I'm going to pay $16 for a small box\/bag of artisan chocolates, this is the kind of place I'm more than happy to do so. Raspberry chipotle, Irish Car Bomb (It has a more eloquent name, but I can't remember it proper), Roasted Banana, Blood Orange...and I can't remember the other few we had because they were so promptly inhaled. All were wonderful, fine tuned like a NASA engineer's work, and only beckoned for more. \n\nI will say the raspberry chipotle was one of the best I've experienced in the field of housing heat, from chiles, in chocolate. It was a warm heat. Not an acidic heat like some tend to have, but rather a lasting and welcoming sensation. \n\nStaff was super fun as we laughed about the incredible array of flavors. A fun-loving bunch that are conversational and helpful. I'm looking forward to grabbing a glass of wine or 7 at Petite Phillipe next time with some chocolate pairings.
