Do not go here unless you like being treated rudely. I was there last Thursday, I was \"greeted\" by the front counter knucklehead, who told me I had parked in the wrong spot. The restaurant was empty; the parking lot was empty. I was not in a handicapped spot. Apparently, there was a \"carryout only\" sign in front of my parking space. Unfortunately, a four-foot high snowdrift had covered the sign. ISorrry!  But you can't find a way to tell me in a more courteous way?  Of course, I moved my car -- to a different restaurant. If they are that rude and inconsiderate at the front of the house, what the heck is going on in the kitchen??
