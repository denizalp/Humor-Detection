There is good vibes in this bar, nice interior and service. Good beers on tap, some domestics are bottle only. Did not have bud light and Guinness on tap. Will be back there again, but to be honest.... the food was not that good. I sent back a $9 wedge salad and the $15 jalape√±o burner tasted like it was grilled on something that had previously burned. I did order some fried pickles that were tasty. Still...pricey for the results. \n\nA place I'll definitely go for drinks in support of this small business, but I'll think twice about what food I might order.
