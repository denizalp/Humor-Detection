One of my favorite burgers and surprisingly chicken sandwiches too. Put it this way; this is the only place my daughter will finish the entire burger. Now that's saying something. \n\nLooks like a burger you would make in your own kitchen but maybe that's what makes them so good. It's comfort food that reminds you of home. And home is where the food is lol. \n\nThe shroom burger is pretty good too but I prefer the regular shack burger and the crispy crinkle fries. The concretes are worth a try too, hope you saved room for dessert. \n\nMy only gripe is the service; I always feel rushed with the cashiers. They definitely aren't as friendly as CFA and not as affordable either. Pricey for the size of burger you get so I don't come as often as I'd like to. Other than that, no complaints. Restaurant is always clean and plenty of tables and outdoor seating available. Great location too.
