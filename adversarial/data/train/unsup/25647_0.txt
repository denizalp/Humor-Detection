Wow, it was definitely a letdown. Portions were small and service was slow and not very friendly.  It was not a good visit, could be lack of good management.  We had a extra cup of coffee and observed the wait staff for a little while and it appeared to be some kind of conflict going on between the staff.  Waffle house will be our next choice.
