This location is MAD ghetto-ish... from most of the customers to the people who work there.  I mean, sure, it isn't located in Beverly Hills, but come on!  I actually love Target, usually, but this place is definitely an exception.  It is still a step above Walmart, but not much above... like a half-step.  If there's another Target close to where you live or work, then I suggest you go there.  Unless, of course, you like the ghetto--then feel free to come here because you'll love it.
