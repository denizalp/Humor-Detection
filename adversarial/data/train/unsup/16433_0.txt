I have dined here 2 times before and the food was okay. \n I had family in town, and they wanted to go here because they had heard its one of the best restaurants in the states, and won many awards. WELL- when we arrive we are served hot tea, the tea pot spout had some sort of green stuff stuck in the spout, it looked like water minerals that had built up inside it. We went it back. We had arrived when they first opened @ 5pm and I ordered beef chow fun. They come back and told me it was sold out already, disappointed and couldn't believe they were out in less the. 10 minutes after opening.  \n\nWe had ordered Singapore Noodles, which I've never had before so I don't know if it was good or not, but I personally didn't care for the flavor. But while eating my noodles, one was chewy, I finally went to pull it out of my mouth, it was the EXACT same color as the noodles, and when I looked at what it was, it was a rubber band!!! OMG, grossed me out, got the manager, and she replaced the noodles with a new batch, but so scary knowing that one of the children could of eaten it. \n\nThe moo shu pork was good. But after the rubber band incident, I will never go back.
