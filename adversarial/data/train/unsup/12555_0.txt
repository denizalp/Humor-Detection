We wanted to check this out since we were already in the downtown area and I thought it was OK. It was kinda chilly out so we didn't stay long. There were clothing vendors and food trucks but we didn't buy anything. The food smelled really good coming from one of the trucks but I noticed there was no place to sit and eat so we decided to pass. We will probably come out again when the weather is warmer.\n\nBTW, security will check your ID and look in your purse before you can enter in.
