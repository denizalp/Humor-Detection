I love this place. If you're just starting out, they'll walk you through everything you need, and sit you down and help you choose flavours from their pretty wide selection of liquids. They're all about helping new vapers make the switch. If you're into building, they have a bit of cotton and wick but that's not really what they cater to. They do have some pretty nice high power mods though, like Sigelei's and IPVs.\n\nSuper friendly bunch of people. When friends want to make the switch, but they're a little apprehensive, I bring them here, and by the time they leave, they have exactly what they need, and they've been shown how to fill and charge and all that good stuff. Couldn't recommend Digital Smoker enough. If what you want is mech mods and drippers though, probably not the place, but the juice selection is great. Lots of good Canadian brands.
