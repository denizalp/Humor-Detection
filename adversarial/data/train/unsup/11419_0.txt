The night we went it was sort of embarrassing. It was underwear night so if you were in underwear you had open bar.\n\nSounds good right!!!!!!!!????\n\nWell, I had to go to therapy after this day to repair the damage caused to my brain.\n\nA bunch of men on their maybe 70s, maybe 80s dancing on their underwear is not the ideal party for me. Although I'm glad they get to have so much fun.
