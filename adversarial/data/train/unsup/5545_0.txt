Place has really come around for the better.  Better beer, wayyyy better food.  Wish they would get better bands than the same ones that play every night at other bars on the near West Side.  I usually come on Saturdays when they open and there is one lady working the whole restaurant so the more people come in the more you have to wait for the smallest things.  She seems to forget what we asked for and is very short with us due to the fact that she wait on the whole place, bar and all.  Yeah, she keeps all the tips but the customers suffer...
