Horrible experience. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and got a chicken dish that looked yellow, more like a malai kofta than a tikka masala sauce. I ordered medium\/hot and there was so little spice in it that it tasted like nothing. I then had to go up to the bar to tell the waiter we didn't get our naan after waiting for 5+ minutes after the rest of the food came. I also told the waiter the chicken tasted very very mild and she took it back to add more spices and came back to say the chef would just remake it. Okay fine by me. While I was waiting for the remade chicken the naan came out and it was raw! Had to send that back as well and it came out raw around the edges a second time. She said they have a new naan chef, but you think they would make sure he isn't making raw naan before putting him in the kitchen to make customer's food. The remade chicken was slightly more spicy but still in no way a medium\/hot or even remotely looking like the RED chicken tikka masala sauce it was supposed to be. \n\nAfter that whole ordeal I got the bill and I was charged for everything. I had to use a yelp coupon to get the naan taken off the bill. I have never had so many problems with my meal and not even been comped for the chai tea. My wife is Indian and I have eaten at plenty of great Indian restaurants and this is one of the worst experiences I have had at any Indian restaurant anywhere. The staff was friendly sure, but the food was horrible. We just moved here from New Jersey, where great Indian restaurants are aplenty. We will not be coming back to the Taj Mahal!
