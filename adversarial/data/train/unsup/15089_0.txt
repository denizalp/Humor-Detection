Worst experience ever! What a nightmare \n\nWhile waiting at the gate in Las Vegas, a representative announced that there is a mechanical failure on the aircraft and crews were working on fixing the problem, \"but there is a chance that this plane isn't going anywhere.\" I then overheard Allegiant employees discussing how 5 other planes had mechanical failures that day. \n\nAfter being delayed for 2hrs, we were told the problem was fixed and we would be boarding the plane. We boarded the aircraft and then were told that a new problem had came up and they would be fixing it. To apologize for the inconvenience, the crew passed out water (how generous of them...water). After waiting on the plane for almost an hour, we were told this plane was still broken and we had to get off the plane and wait for another one(which was coming from Colorado). Eventually we got on a plane and I reached my destination. They get 2 stars because they got me from point A to point B. \n\nAllegiant is an extremely cheap airline. The ticket clerk is also the luggage handler, gate clerk, and ground control. It was almost funny to watch how cheap this company is, but then again so was the ticket. When it comes to this airline you truly get what you pay for. You pay next to nothing and you get next to nothing. The planes are horribly maintained. They fly MD-80's which has a total of 17 fatal events (where the aircraft flight had a direct or indirect role, excludes hijacks, etc) from 1981-2008. \n\nYou can really tell they keep overheard costs to a bare minimum. Even the employees joke about how cheap the company is. When the plane broke and when we had to deplane after being told the plane was fixed, flight attendants and gate clerks had the attitude of \"nothing new.\" If you don't care about service, safety, and convenience then this company is fine. Personally I would rather spend the extra hundred bucks or so and fly on a more reputable airline.
