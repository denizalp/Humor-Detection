STOP CALLING MY HOME.\nAdobe Carpet Cleaning got my phone number somehow, even though I'm on the do not call registry. They call, almost every day, at dinner time.\nI've told them to take me off their calling list immediately, and guess what? They call, again and again.\nI don't even HAVE any carpeting!!!!\n\nI've filed a complaint with the FTC to get the calls to stop.\n\nI cannot stand companies who use these horrid tactics to phish for business.\n\nStay away.
