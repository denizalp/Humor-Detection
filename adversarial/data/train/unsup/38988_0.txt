This is a great way to take a break off The Strip!\n\nThey have all sorts of games, not just pinball. Which, needless to say, is an impressive collection of classic machines and newer models. \n\nThe staff was friendly, the layout is walkable, and the prices are very reasonable!\n\nWould definitely go again
