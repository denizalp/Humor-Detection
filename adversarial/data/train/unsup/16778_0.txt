I'm still giving them 5 stars because it's still really good and quick service...but when we ordered here the other night: a smoked meat sadwich medium fat and poutine , of course, I gotta say both counts let me down unfortunately...but there's hope! \n\nThe poutine....booooo bbq sauce gravy :( but as far as bbq sauce gravy poutines go I gotta still give it props 'cuz it had lotsa sauce and cheese curds and the fries were fresh and yummy! So now I'll hafta try n order the poutine with the gravy they use for their hamburger steak ***realllllyyyy hoping they don't use bbq sauce gravy for hamburger steak*** then it may very well still be the perfect poutine!*stay tuned* lol\n\nThe smoked meat sandwich....E for effort but dannnngg tha's some funkified smoked meat. Love that it's deli sliced. Didn't love that medium fat was wayyy toooo fatty (i would be willing to try it lean to see if it helps), but also the meat is so incredibly salty for some reason...it's very juicy so again props, but wayyy too fatty and salty. Bread and portion and price are top notch though so overall no harm no foul. I bet swiss cheese (which they offer as an extra) would fix that salty right up ;) so again *stay tuned*\n\nDoesn't affect my opinion enough to change how good i think this place is...Will definitely be seeing what else they got!
