Progressive Field is a second home to all real Cleveland fans. The place is full of amazing Cle food, beer, and die-hard fans; however, you don't have to be a baseball fan to have a fun time at the field! Just grab some peanuts, pose for a pic with Slider, and cheer for the home team and you're in for a good time! Make sure to pay attention to the hot dog race during the game too because here in Cleveland, it ain't no joke! \nThe Corner is a great addition to the field! Make sure to head to a Cleveland local favorite spot before or after the game too in order to get the full experience! Also, if you have kids, the Kid's Corner seats a cheap and easy way to entertain yourself and the kiddos for the full 9 innings.
