I'll start from the beginning... When this place is busy (for some unknown reason) the parking is a nightmare due to the lack of space and the inexperienced drivers. The absolute WORST thing was me witnessing the valet girl stalling someone's car. I really couldn't help but laugh - why would you be valeting cars if you didn't know how to drive stick?!\n\nWhen you walk in everything is kind of new and trendy looking. I noticed a lot of younger people like to go here so if that's not your crowd then this isn't where you want to be after 7pm. I personally don't like \"trendy-young-and-cool\" sushi spots. I've only gone for dinner time so I can't speak for what it's like at lunch. \n\nThe few times I've been here the sushi wasn't all that great - and I feel I'm a pretty good judge when it comes to the sushi department. I try to give new places a chance so I've been here maybe 3 times. Sushi still wasn't all that, our service always left something to be desired, and the last straw....\n\nI COULD NOT BELIEVE after mediocre borderline poor service, our waitress had THE NERVE to hand me our bill and circle the suggested tip she wrote down. Seriously? I always tip my servers well and accordingly, and a whole lot more when the service is excellent. I rounded out my bill to the next dollar and will never come back here again.
