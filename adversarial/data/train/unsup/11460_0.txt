Tony's Pizza is located in the heart of the Historic Business District off Nevada Way. Today when I attended the 54th Annual Art in the Park Festival, I paused here for a quick and inexpensive bite to eat. \n\n  The prices at Tony's Pizza in comparison with the food concessions at Art in the Park was reasonable. They offer specials including two slices with a large Coke for $6; or a slice of pizza with fries, and a large Coke for $6.50. I chose the two slice special. \n\n   In contrast to the neighboring Milo's Cellar, Coffee Cup, and Art in the Park ; Tony's Pizza was nearly empty. There was zero effort finding a table in the small restaurant. I chose the table closest to the Coke machine. If I had chosen a few tables down, I'd be overlooking historic Nevada Street. Regardless, a few minutes later I was overlooking two slices of pizza. \n\n  The two slices of pizza were decent. I wouldn't go out of my way for this pizza, but if it is in my way in the heart of Historic Boulder City while my appetite is acting like a monkey pounding on my back, I might return here.
