Visited last weekend with my husband's family who are Persian and had a great dining experience! Kebabs are the best we have had in the GTA (and we have tried a lot of different places)! My husband and his brother both agreed the kebabs here are the closest they have had to being back in Iran. We ordered the Combo 3 which was koobideh, sultani and jujeh (chicken breast) with grilled tomatoes and two huge plates of rice. Meat was well cooked without being overdone, rice was tasty! Also ordered mast o mousir and khashk bademjan... Sooo good! First time there and will be back. Also recommended for my family to try (they are not Persian) and they went and also had a fantastic experience mid-week. Service was good as well!
