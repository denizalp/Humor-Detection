I love the multiple 5-star ratings all coincidentally written on the same day by accounts without pictures. What a sad attempt to increase their Yelp rating. Unfortunately, that's what they must do because they are the epitome of crooks and unprofessional management. \n\nLet me write a quick \"in conclusion\" for all the skimmers out there: Kiss your deposit goodbye. Don't even bother cleaning your rental because you won't see your deposit anyway. \n\nIn February 2014, I left my property cleaner than when I moved in and they tried everything they could to steal as much of my security deposit as possible. Brenda tried to charge me $50 for a broken screen, so I told her I want proof that there is a broken screen, and they just so happened to of lost that picture so I was refunded the $50. Pro tip: Anything they try to charge you for, demand a picture! I bet you you'll receive more of your deposit back. Oh and APPARENTLY the battery to one smoke alarm was dead so they decided to charge me for 3 batteries. Interesting seeing as the batteries were fine when I moved out. \n\nFun fact! The office 'staff' are her sons. Not professional in looks or demeanour. I received a notification that my rent would increase, which was fair seeing as my lease expired and was on a month to month, so I called to inquire per the notice, and her professional son said, \"um because we can\". When the joyous day came to turn in my intent to vacate notice, their office was to open at 1:00 pm, so I parked at 12:45 and they come strolling in at 1:22 pm. \n\nGood luck future renters, you've been warned. If you currently rent from them, I send my condolences to your wallet.
