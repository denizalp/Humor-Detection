The Hyatt Place Madison is a perfectly acceptable place to stay for one or two nights, which is what we did. If I was staying longer, I'd probably wish to stay somewhere else.\n\n+ free wi-fi. I think it's really obnoxious to charge guests extra for wi-fi (it's right up there with the mandatory \"resort\" fee some hotels charge). We're all going to use it, so just bury it in my room rate and don't nickel and dime me \n+ newer hotel, so it doesn't feel stale or smell weird\n+ friendly staff\n+ free continental breakfast\n+ convenient location; walking distance to downtown area\n+ two-person shower (for those of us wishing to conserve water; we didn't use it for anything else, I swear!), with a large shower head and great water pressure\n\n+\/- $10\/day to park\n+\/- comfortable bed, lousy pillows\n+\/- rate was average; not super cheap, but not expensive\n\n- poor signage for parking garage. The lot is shared with the clinic next door and you're not really sure where to go\n- garage had creaky elevators that don't always open completely (?)\n- there were a couple errant hairs in the shower that did not belong to us since it was our first time using it. Gross.\n-not much door clearance in the bathroom; hard to maneuver around in such a small space \n- A\/C blew ridiculously cold air in one spot and the air never circulated\n\nAs I mentioned, this hotel was just fine and certainly served its purpose: A bed to sleep in, a place to shower, and a rest stop in between running around eating and drinking. It's definitely not super luxurious, but it's certainly not a dump. It's average, but average is a-ok in my book. We get to Madison a few times a year and would most likely stay here again if it was a short visit.
