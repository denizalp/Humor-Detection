A few months back I brought my Retina MacBook Pro here because I had spilled coffee on it and the keyboard wasn't working. \n\nTheir website said they only worked on Apple products and had all certified technicians. Sounded legit.\n\nI was told I'd need a new keyboard and that the logic board would need an ultrasonic cleaning for an additional fee (using the same technology that dentists use to clean their tools!). \n\nOkay cool, whatever, just fix it.\n\nA couple of days later I picked up my laptop, keys working. Everything was great.\n\nAfter a few days I noticed that every time I picked up my laptop or moved it, I could hear a faint clicking inside. Like something had come untethered inside.\n\nThis time I took it to the Genius Bar.\n\nThe Apple specialist said that he had never seen a laptop so badly messed up: that the inside was full of dirt and dust, and that someone had pried the batteries out and then tried to tape them back in. The tape wasn't working and so the batteries were shifting around. That was the sound I was hearing.\n\nI was pretty angry, so I went back to WinMac.\n\nThe clerk was very apologetic, offering me a partial a cash refund for the repair. I took it and left a Yelp review without much in the way of details saying that their technicians aren't really Apple Certified, as their site implies, and that I didn't have a good time there and wouldn't be back. \n\nThe store reached out to me and offered to replace my MacBook, but then I never heard from them again. \n\nA few weeks ago, I was notified that my review had been requested for deletion because it didn't have enough information in it. So I figured I should type up the whole story. \n\nMy laptop still makes that noise every time I pick it up.\n\n1-star, avoid.
