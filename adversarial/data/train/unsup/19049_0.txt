I love chicken. I love waffles. But I never cared for the whole chicken and waffles thing as a dynamic dual. It's almost always been hey the chicken was delicious but the waffles were meh or vice versa or they were both complete crap. So of course as people hyped Bruxie up I really didn't feel like I was missing anything. But having finally given Bruxie a chance I'm sure glad they ain't just serving that regular chicken and waffles stuff.\n\nWent with the Original friend chicken and waffle sandwich. For me, anytime a business mentions the word original to anything on the menu I kind of have to order it. It was pretty good. The chicken was tasty. The waffles warm and freshly made. I think that's one of the things that separates Bruxie from a usual burger or sandwich spot. I don't really know of any burger spot making warm fresh made buns usually they're warmed up or just cold. That with chili honey, cider slaw, and pouring all that syrup makes it delicious.\n\nI'd for sure be back cause it's not just chicken and waffles. They have waffle sandwiches filled with pulled pork, pastrami, etc. Salads, bacon infused mac and cheese, waffle desserts, waffle fries. I kind of want to go back now.\n\nService was excellent, fast and friendly. The girl who helped me actually knew the menu and had some great recommendations. Made me feel welcomed and want to come back.
