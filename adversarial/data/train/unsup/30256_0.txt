I came in yesterday for the first time. It was busy so I waited about 20-25 mins to see the Dr.The front desk girls and the Dr were great, knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. The Dr. recommended I come in everyday for the first 7 days and once a week after that, so I enrolled in the monthly membership program. I came in again today (Sunday 9\/16\/18) at 3 PM for my second adjustment and it's closed. The clinic door and website info says it closes at 4 PM on Sundays, but here I am at 3 pm and It's closed. I was looking forward to my second adjustment and now I'm a little disappointed.\nI hope this is not a frequent issue at this location.
