This bar is so cute with its fire and library lounge! Real books on the shelves too. Such a wonderful atmosphere with excellent servers. Their menu is definitely pricey, but the mixologist is incredible. \n\nI ordered the narrator and my goodness if you like rye whiskey you've got to try this drink! \n\nThe atmosphere is just so lovely and fun to drink in the library. Stop by if you can for a different kind of bar experience.
