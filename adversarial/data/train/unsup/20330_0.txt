Kay comes to Michael's to gather craft supplies. When I go to any of these stores with her, I gravitate towards the monsters of myth in miniature made by this manufacturer of plastic, detailed fantasy...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.schleichtoystore.com\/CollectionItems.php?Collection=Knights&CollectionItems=Fantasy\n\nA visit to this Michael's on a Friday night was no exception. \n\nDragons, minotaurs, gorgons, gryphons, can be gawked at and procured along with knights, horses, and other people and animals. Unfortunately, they're a little expensive for what they are, but damn it if I didn't walk out with a bushel of them under my arm the last time I looked *cough* played *cough* with *cough* at them . \n\nMichael's also has a nifty poster section featuring all manner of pop culture imagery like this reproduction of a classic Brian Bolland Batman comic book cover from 20 years ago...\n\nhttp:\/\/milehighcomics.com\/cgi-bin\/backissue.cgi?action=fullsize&issue=49676586280%2050\n\nThis is how I keep from getting bored during trips to Michael's. Come ooh and ahh with me ya geeks.
