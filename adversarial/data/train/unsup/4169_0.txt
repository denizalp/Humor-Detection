Great new fast-casual that is open for breakfast or lunch!   Great addition to downtown for lunch!\n\nFresh Fire-Roasted Flatbread Pizza, panini sandwiches, soup and salad.  \nPizza with a purpose!   \n\nHave been to the other location and now to this location.  Delicious Flatbread Pizza, salads, breakfast panini and Wood-fired wings.  You can be creative and create your own pizza or sandwich.  Had the Capocollo flatbread sandwich with lettuce tomato cheese and fire roasted onions and the dry-rubbed wings.  Delicious!
