We were anxious to try this place since its next door to Rudys. Neither are outstanding but I prefer Rudys better. At Rudys the service is better and the food is seasoned great and has a good smoke flavor. At CSS the cafeteria style doesn't do it for me, I feel like I am 90 years old carrying a tray and looking at dried out meat that has been sitting out for hours. I got the brisket sandwich and it was terrible, it was SO dry. My husband makes amazing BBQ and we were actually amazed that a place could serve BBQ this terrible. I could barely choke it down. \n\nThe sides tasted like something my grandma would get at her retirement community, no flavor and completely bland. \n\nThe people behind the counter remind me of Jersey Shore idiots they can barely communicate what they are trying to tell you.  \n\nThe worst part is EVERY great BBQ place must have good sweet tea. Rudys sweet tea is amazing - Cant Stop's sweet tea tastes like it had been sitting in its container for 3 weeks. It was the worst tea I have ever had. The only thing good there is the cobbler. At least someone making the desserts knows what they are doing. Lets just say I wish I would have kept my $30 and not wasted my time. At the end of our meal, I was still starving and angry that we threw 90 percent of our food in the trash can.\n\nI made my husband walk over to Rudys - and get me a sweet tea and some prime rib to go. I felt like I should treat myself to some decent meat since I just wasted time and money on CSS. We will never be back and I will not recommend this place to anyone.
