Um no.  Just because you throw fabric napkins over your food doesn't mean you're wicked. I'm sorry, I wanted to be the person to jazz up my description like, \"oooh la la its so cozy and intimate\" but it just wasn't; it was way too small.\n\nI was late meeting up with my friends and they had all ordered drinks. I asked the waiter for the most popular beverage and he recommended the cucumber margarita.  Little did I know that I could have gotten 3 of those margaritas for $15 instead of 1 for $10!! And when I asked the waiter if I could change it, he said, No.  NO??! REALLY? He said it was because the bartender had already started making it.  It's the SAME thing and you know it! That's comin outta the tip fo sho! Also, it took forever to even get the drinks and I don't know why. BAD!\n\nThen my friends got two appetizers; the guacamole and the guacamole with feta.  They both had ZERO flavor. If you wanna get fancy, you could say, the flavor was silent like the \"N\" in damn or the \"X\" in faux pas!  There was no feta in that guac and u know it Pachuco! hmmph!\n\nThe only thing good about this place was the portion size and the clean washrooms.  However, due to the large portion size and high price, one would feel an obligation to complete their meal right? I heard some Chewbacca noises in the ladies washroom coming from the occupied stalls. A similar chant was heard 4 hours later coming from the washroom in my home. I was the only person home. 3 stars! MEH!
