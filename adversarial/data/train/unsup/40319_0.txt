There is a lot more than burgers here.  The menu is pretty big and offers a lot of variety.  I have eaten here three times and the food has been consistently good.  Everything is cooked fresh.  The dinner plates are $1.00 more than the combos and come with a really good salad as well as fries and onion rings.  Get a dinner plate!\n\nI had breakfast for the first time today and I will definitely be going back.\n\nThis is a small local business.  I think the owner does all the cooking\n  \nGive this place a try.  You will not be sorry!
