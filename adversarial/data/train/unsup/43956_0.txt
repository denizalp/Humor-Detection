Hands down the best dinner experience I've ever had. Came in with my family, a party of 18 and our amazing server Joseph along with other workers took such great care of us. Every dish we tried was excellent. My favorite being the Seabass skewers and the Wagyu beef, which we cooked on a 600 degree hot stone. The shishito peppers were also delicious and a great start to the meal. Thank you so much Joseph for the top notch service.
