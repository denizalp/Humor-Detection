Came here on the recommendation of a friend. We showed up roughly around 11am. The place was packed (it's a sunday, after a badger game, I get it). We put our name in with the hostess who stated it would be 20 minutes. 45 minutes later, we were seated. I get it, you can't make people leave...but over estimate the wait time. 20 mintes, I can hang out, I can look at a menu, I can make small talk with strangers. 45 minutes? I can leave and get a cup of coffee in someplace else and then come back for breakfast. \n\nThere was no apology, just a shout and a point to our table. Again, I get it, not a 5 star experience. Our server was prompt, coffee was good and he was generous with refilling our beverages. Menu selection looked good. We ordered and our food came out very quickly, which after waiting so long was nice. I had the Blue Plate Special omlete.  Decent. Nothing over the top, but very good; avacados were a little sparse, but hey, it's November and that shit is expensive.  We also ordered a short stack to share. I went to pour the maple syrup...and immediately my fingers stuck to the handle of the syrup carafe.  Gross. The potatoes that came with the meal seemed very (very) seasoned. I didn't try them. They just looked too salty and underdone. But no harm no foul, I will just know not to order them again.\n\nAll in all, I would come here again. Probably not on a weekend though. The bakery items looked delish, so that's a definite possibility.
