very bad manner! I don't recommend!\n\nThe service is very bad, I ask : I want to order, the guy has no response!\n\nI said again, he gave me  an awful face for my inquiry!\n\nI ask : can you speak Chinese? He gave me a nasty tone, no, I speak English and went back deep inside the restaurant and left me alone there.
