I read the Yelp reviews before coming in, so I had a reasonable idea of what to expect for my first visit to Plato's Closet. I brought in one canvas tote filled to the brim with clothes and called ahead to ask if I needed an appointment (no, you don't). Tote in hand, I stepped in Plato's Closet waiting to be smacked in the face with that usual musty thrift store smell but was relieved when that moment never came. Instead, I was greeted by a cheerful employee who told me she'd be right there to help me. \n\nAn older guy gave me a form to fill out and then the younger gal came over and explained the selling process. The wait time was less than 15 minutes, and I took that time to peruse the store. By the time the employee called my name, I had 6 things in my hand (but alas, I walked out empty handed). I was disappointed to see Plato's was only interested in buying 4 tops from me. Honestly, the things they bought were the items I least expected to be sold. They took a plain grey muscle tank, a TMNT baseball shirt, and a Coca-Cola branded tank (can't remember the 4th item). I was offered $8.40 for my items. Hey, that's more than I walked in with! \n\nThe brands and styles carried in the store are meant to cater to teens and young adults. I saw a lot of Forever 21 and Target brands with a few indie brands meshed in between. They had about 4-6 pairs of Doc Martens on hand ($45+), which I think was pretty cool. Some items were priced cheaply (trendy shorts for $3), while other price points were excessive ($8 for a lame shirt from Target). As with all thrift stores, you have to dig for the good stuff!\n\nWorth a Return Visit?\nI'll be back to Plato's to try my luck again at selling and buying!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #163
