Great fresh ingredients and service!  This is a stir fry place in which you select your own vegetables and sauces and they fry it for you with your choice of meats and with rice, noodles and choice of it being made into soup.  It's extremely delcicious and healthy food and reasonably priced.  Service is excellent and ambiance is noce for family or a date.
