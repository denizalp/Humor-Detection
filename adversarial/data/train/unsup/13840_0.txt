I'm not sure why this person has such a problem with Vegas Vacuum.  I came here to get my Dyson serviced and cleaned because I've had it for at least 8 or 9 years and have never had a problem with it until now.  They never tried to sell me anything, however, he completely ripped me a new one for having a bagless vacuum when I have my two cats in the house, as said the animal vacuum line from Dyson is awful for that.  But he never ever once told me to buy something he was selling there.  I was impressed with his knowledge (I assume it was Jim Pepper).\n\nHowever, when I picked my vacuum up (it literally looked like new, so pleased!), my husband was interested in looking at the only shampoo vacuum they had because we have been wanting to get one, then he did try to sell it to us, but we wanted the salesman pitch, as this shampooer was $100 to $200 less than others we had seen on the market and it looked much better.  We will probably be back within the month to buy it.
