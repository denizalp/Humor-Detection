After wasting my lunch break, I'm appalled to see the type of ratings they've managed to receive. It really does give me an indication of what money can buy because quality certainly wasn't on their priority list when opening a restaurant. I felt like pho-bomination they served me today was cooked in a toilet bowl after the violent passing of spring rolls and slim jim.\n\nMind you, I have eaten a fair share of Pho places throughout the WORLD, including in Vietnam. I'd be ashamed to serve this lukewarm soaked garbage with chunks of shoe leather to my own enemies. \n\nWill i go back? I would rather fallete a vagabond with a mild case of gonorrhea then put myself through another wasted meal at District One.
