I was speechless when we got to our rooms!! Very Speechless!!\n\nThank you to my hubby for taking care of the reservations. \n& Wow! What a special day to check in,  \non our 19th Anniversary. 2.9.2015 \n\nCeasars Palace is huge!! very huge!!\n My hubby had to show me how to get to our rooms a few times, \nbut I still can't get to it on my own. \nHe has to drop me off to the room, before he hits the casino.\n\nHubby got the deluxe room @ Octavius Tower. WOW!! \nIts very beautiful & huge!! Very Beautiful & Huge!! \nWe stayed here for 2 nights, ( wish we could stay longer here)\n\nThe bathroom comes with a Jacuzzi, his & her sink, & walk in shower. \n+ television + telephone. \n\nThe bed is so comfortable, I couldn't wake up the nexts  2 mornings!!\n\nWe didn't make it to the Forum Shops, so sad!!\n (Only 2 days here, not enough time!! )\nLOL-ness, we would come to the Forum Shops on our other Vegas Visits but when we stayed here, we didn't make it to the Forum Shops at all. \n\nJust FYI: We removed a bottle of beer to put our water bottle in, but forgot to put the bottle of beer back in the fridge. This was on our bill right after we checked out. Wow!! how did they pick that up so fast, I called Ceasars to get  a credit on the beer. \nAlso they charge a resort fee of 28.00 per day.\n\nThe parking lot is very far to our room, We had \"fun\" getting our luggage and shopping bags to the room & car.  \n\nTo Sum it up-\nWe really enjoyed our stay, I didn't want to leave!! I was so sad, when it was time to check out. :(\n\nI am blessed to have such a wonderful hubby & an opportunity to stay here for our 19th!!  :0)
