I loved 32 Shea in the early days, I loved it during its growing phase and I love the place today! The food is amazing! The Nutella mocha is my go-to drink... No place in the valley makes it better than the baristas at 32S. I can't even find words to describe how delicious the pastries are! Of course the place gets busy... REALLY BUSY. Why?! Because everything about the place is F'ing awesome!! The staff gets a little (sometimes a lot) frantic, sure... Because they're trying to serve you. Sit down and relax (all you 1st time visitors who leave bad reviews). If you don't have time to hang out and enjoy the ambience, maybe go another day when you do. Don't expect fast (Shit) food because this is not that place. The line out the door isn't because the place is mediocre... Au Contraire! I'll say it again, it's Amazing and worth the wait.\nSincerely,\nTried, true and returning customer\np.s. The owner is pretty frigin cool, too!
