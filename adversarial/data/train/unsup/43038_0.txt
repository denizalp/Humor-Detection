I am happy to recommend Garry Young and 911 Pest Defense.  We have been a customer of 911 Pest Defense for the past 7 years.  Extremely personable owner and staff.  Very reliable - come when they say they will be there.  Competitive rates and best of all - no issues with bugs!  I especially appreciated the head's up and recommendations when they spotted a few termite trails on our foundation.  All around great service.
