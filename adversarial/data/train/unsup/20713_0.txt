A good friend brought me here about a year ago to have breakfast while out on a ride This place is situated off of the road behind a furniture shop so keep an eye out as it is not visible from the street. The decor is very industrial, lots of steel and iron work. There is limited seating inside but a ton of space to sit outside and enjoy the live music and fresh air.\n\nNow I've been here a handful of times, with friends, my kids and date night and I can tell you that every single time it's been somewhat a disappointment. This place has all of the makings to be such a great restaraunt\/bar, but it desperately lacks consistency and overall management. \n\nExample 1: On almost every single visit the person taking orders has no clue what it is they serve or how to work the point of sale system. Takes so long to get a coffee or a food order placed. \n\nExample 2: We sat around today for a simple breakfast buritto... 30 minutes...in the meantime they brought the wrong coffee orders and had to make them over again. When we finally got our breakfast , I noticed something very different about the burrito. All of the vegetables were completely cold and raw... Never seen that before and inconsistent from past visits.\n\nExample 3:  In total there are about 4-5 people that work the breakfast hours. I've never really seen this place to full capacity and am puzzled as to why the employees dont come out from behind the counter to check in on customers , bus tables or upsell on food and drinks. I mean, the customer makes there own order, the customer seats themselves, the customer picks up their own order, the customer has to get up and get their own knives, forks etc.\n\nI really hate to be so hard on the place, but it could be so much better. I'm so laid back too and hate say anything negative about a business in my town , but I really hope things change for the better so I can change my rating.
