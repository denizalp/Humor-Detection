Earl's\/Fuel on 8th has a lot of flash and not much else. It's thoroughly ok. The inside is uber-contemporary like all Earl's locations, but pales in comparison to some of the stellar downtown restaurants that it apes. For one, you could get a much better meal at those places for the same price. Yeah huh. \n\nFuel is the lounge side of Earl's, and the music is blasting so conversation can be difficult. The drink \"specials\" are basically a joke. I have never wanted to spend a night here.\n\nOn the restaurant side, the food is ok. It's decent, it can even be downright tasty. But it is fairly unimaginative and tends to come with a fairly hefty price tag (mid-range). The staff is usually helpful and present, and occasionally even friendly. But in my experience, they don't really leave you to linger and chat. Which is unfortunate as this Earl's is one of the only places in the core that is open past 6. \n\nI just feel like I can do so much better.
