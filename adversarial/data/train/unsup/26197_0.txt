So disappointing when you are ignored for service, especially when my wife saw what she wanted at another Tiffany but couldnt decide to purchase until today. We happened to be in Caesars Tiffany's and i convinced her for convenience to purchase there. We walked whole store and not even a greeting much less asked if needed help.\nBack to Bellagio Tiffanys where we felt more welcome.
