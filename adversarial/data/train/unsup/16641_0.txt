Yu's promises a lot but delivers little. \n\nI got their delivery menu on my door the other day and was delighted to see they described themselves as serving \"Chinese Food & Sushi\". Delivery sushi? Have I died and gone to San Diego? Evidently not.\n\nThey have two choices for sushi: california rolls and vegetable rolls. I chose the california rolls, but what I got could not be described as a california roll or indeed sushi by anyone who has ever had either. The rice managed to have absolutely no taste even with a ton of soy sauce on it, and the roll instead of crab mix had a pencil-sized chunk of fake crab, a pencil-sized hunk of rock-hard carrot, a similar piece of cucumber with peel, and a teeny tiny sliver of avocado. Seriously, Yu can get at least 100 of these travestries from one 99 cent avocado.\n\nThe seafood delight consisted of fake crab (seriously, folks, we know you can't sell real crab at these prices but at least have the class to call it \"krab\". We're white, not stupid) along with lots of shrimp and about two cups of absolutely raw carrot and celery chunks. Is it too much to expect the food to be cooked?\n\nOh, and here's a clue: offer two liter bottles of soda. Your competition does.\n\nIf you're looking for sushi delivered in Phoenix keep looking. If you're looking for good Chinese, remember this: Not Yu.
