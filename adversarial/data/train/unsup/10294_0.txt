This place is awful! Went in first time. The bartenders YELL at you and act like you are on their watch. When the customer is in the restaurant they should be treated well, they keep you open. Food was bad, ordered couple apps like wings. The crowd is very rowdy and not behaved. Not a safe place to be in my opinion. Wouldn't be suprised if fights broke out daily here. Sleeze dive
