This place is a joke. \nThe only thing truthful about it is that it stays open late. There was a $10 cover + after specifically asking if they were still serving alcohol they replied, \"Yes! 'Til 4AM!\"\nLow + behold, like I had feared, by drinks they meant WATER. There isn't a drop of alcohol in the place. Of course the doorman played dumb to my questioning two seconds earlier too. \nDon't waste your time.
