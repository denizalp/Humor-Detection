YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(87\/365) \"Start Up Businesses\"\n\nLove the cool vibe and the atmosphere here at DCP. I especially love when people walk right past the Giant Praying Mantis and get the CRAP scared out of them!  LOL!!! \n\nCool concept and great way to help local businesses get their start, but like other reviews state, the prices here are cray-cray especially when you know there's other spots to grab a bite that are close to DCP,  and doesn't rip you off *cough* The Goodwich, Tacos El Buen Pastor, Rollin' Smoke BBQ,  Art of Flavors *cough, cough*\n\nAHEM!!! *clears throat* Anyway, it's a good place to hang out after dinner(and after 9pm for adults only) The live music stage is cool, and so is the huge slide! Haven't checked out any of the little boutiques yet, but maybe we'll do so on our next visit. ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uu  3.5
