Definitely won't come back. They always intentionally charge you more than price on the menu. Especially the case when you skip for a receipt. At first I didn't realize that cuz it is not a large amounts. Sometimes I pointed out when buying take out they said sorry and refund you. But if you didn't point out right away at the spot they will ignore and never admit what they are doing. Won't come back again when they treat customers like this.
