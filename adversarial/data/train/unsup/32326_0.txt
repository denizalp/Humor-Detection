Being local to Little Italy, I am always on the lookout for new restaurants on the College St. strip that are NOT Italian patios or Japanese AYCE. We often order Chinese food for delivery from the Annex or other locations. So when Northern Chinese Cuisine opened up shop, I was so excited to give it a try! We got pick-up which was ready in less than 30 minutes. When I picked up, the lady seemed really friendly. The decor doesn't look very exciting, but quite typical for a Chinese restaurant.\n\nWe ordered the fried noodles with shrimp (which are Shanghai style, being a Northern Chinese restaurant), eggplant with chili sauce, beef with broccoli, shredded pancake with pork, and fried rice with chicken. The fried noodles and rice were really good. The eggplant was oily and the beef was a little on the chewy\/bland side. The shredded pancake (which I hadn't tried before) was very interesting - kind of like noodles but more toothsome. The food was good overall. The bill totalled $46 including taxes. Really great value!\n\nNext time, I plan to try the dumplings and 'buns' (soup-filled dumplings) which are authentic Northern cuisine and seem to be their specialty.\n\nRecommend to everyone looking a good Chinese meal at a decent price point.
