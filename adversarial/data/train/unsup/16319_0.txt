I really wanted this place to be better then Soho SushiBurritos.... Since the location of JaBurritos is so much better for me. It is less then 10 minutes from my house.... So freaking cool!!! \n\nBut sadly the flavors and the staff were not up to par.  \n\nOverall my experience was average.  The staff were not very friendly but they weren't rude either... They were just eh....(2.5\/5). I got my food to go but decided to eat in.... The entire time I was dining in not one person came to ask me how it was... How I liked the food. Not one word. :\/ Even as i walked in...I didn't get a greeting like they did to everyone else that entered while i ate....I barely got a hi when I was planning my order. Overall... Not like SushiBurritos at all. :(. \n\nThe food was ok as well. The rice was not as flavorful as well. *Sigh* i got a create your own with sarimi crab.... Which is just the crab filling from the California roll. :) It was decent but it not seasoned enough... Just a hint more of soy sauce or salt I think would have made it alot better. They did have a bunch of ingredients which were awesome... And they even had fresh jalapenos which is a huge plus in my book. :) So overall it was ok...(3\/5)\n\nAmbiance was pretty cool. It was clean and very bright. They had a decent sauce area like you would find in any Mexican place. (4.5\/5)\n\nOverall, most likely I will be back as this place is so close to me... But if time permits I'd rather goto SushiBurritos.
