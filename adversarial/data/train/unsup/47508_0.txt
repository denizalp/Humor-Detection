I'm giving them two stars only because the things that have been completed look nice and I am happy with. \n\nI recently purchased a new home that when the previous owners moved they left with all the pool equipment and equipement for the built in bbq island. \n\nAfter some research and different contractors coming out to give us quotes and such we decided to go with Laguna. \n\nThe sales rep was at my house on time which was great for me since I am a very punctual person. The prices they quoted were very comparable to the other companies.\n\nThe nightmare starts now:\n\nOn my contract the approx start date was 9\/22\/11 and the apprx complete date was 9\/25\/11. It is 11\/15 and I am still waiting to have the work completed. They would tell me someone would be at my house on certain days and they never showed up. They would come on days I was not expecting them, which was bad for me since I have two lil dogs that weren't locked up.\n\nToday they are to come and finalize the burner on the grill becuase they input the incorrect one. Yes, they input an incorrect burner that used a diff type of gas than what I have. They wanted me to leave the final payment in the current burner but I refused as I would like to make sure that everything is working properly before I give them the final payment. If the work isn't completed correctly what do you think are my chances of seeing them again if they received that last payment.  So now they will come today when I am off work to complete the work and to get their final payment which seems is all they care about. \n\nThey are bad are returning phone calls and are very good at making excuses. This company will get the work done but not on time and with a lot of headaches.
