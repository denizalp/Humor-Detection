First, I'd like to lead with that our family collectively spends thousands of dollars on Nike gear yearly. Literally thousands. We also invest in Nike stock. We love Nike but do not love this store. The girls at the front desk are rude, especially the girl manager on shift August 14th. Customer service and satisfaction were not her priority. We just spent about $600 at the Nike store and two pairs of shorts were too small for my husband. In the past we have done a like for like merchandise exchange on sizes with no problem here. I lost my receipt. This Manager refused to do the exchange claiming the item I was exchanging was a lower value item even though they are exactly the same price. She was condescending and rigid. She said she was not going to risk her job to break company policy and do the exchange. I don't know if she knew that she doesn't work at a job at the Pentagon in National Security. News flash: it is a $55 dollar pair of shorts with tags. Exchange sizes, do the right thing! It is easy to tow the line and quote policy but customer service is much more than arbitrary rules. Nike has loyal customers like us because we love the product. My husband has now vowed to never come back to this store and that is sad because he used to like going there (and spending money). Job not well done Nike Manager!
