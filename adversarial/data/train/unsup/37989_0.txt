Was in town for a quick trip and was craving good asian food without having to go downtown.  They were very friendly and helpful and service was fast.  Food was incredibly yummy.  I liked being able to pick from several different sides and everyting was so tasty.  Wish I could eat here again soon!  I'll be back.
