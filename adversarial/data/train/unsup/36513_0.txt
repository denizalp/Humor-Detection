Played here this past Sunday.  5th round of the year here.  The course was in good condition, and the greens were fast as usual.  It's a long course... 7300+ from the tips.... and the distance and the greens is where most of the \"difficulty\" comes from.  The course runs through Seven Hills, with nice views of the city.  Although it is in a housing development, most of the houses are set back pretty far from the course.... so for the most part you don't really notice them all that much while you're playing.  \n\nI think it's a similar course to Lexington at Revere (located just a few miles away)....  although I think Lexington is actually more of a challenge....  although Rio Secco has a more highly regarded name.  The casino employee rate was $50 when we played, but I think it will drop even more during the middle of summer.  The staff here is all very helpful and friendly.  Although the pre-round practice facilities aren't all that great.  You're supposed to hit off the mats on the practice range.... which I hate!  makes every shot seem like a perfect one.  Overall a nice course.... in my top 5 or 6 for Vegas.
