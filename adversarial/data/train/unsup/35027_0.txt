Probably the best food places at the beaches. Whenever, I am in the area I eat here as the food is good. There is always a line up and the wait time varies between 15-30 mins. However, it is worth it. Some of the best Daiquiris and Martini I have ever had. They come in a huge glass and costs less then $10. Also, they have some of the best bread dip which is complimentary while you wait for your food. Although it is a mediterian place there sandwich and wraps are really good. \nOnly DRAW BACK are some of the WAITERS. There is one guy, we call him- \"Sweat man\" sadly he is always sweating despite the time of the year, and yes even when he is serving you food. We try our best to not be seated in his areas but it doesn't always help. And to add to his charm he is also rude. The term RUDE can be used for a lot of the waiters at this location. However, the owner and the management is nonchalant regarding their attitude towards the customers which is disappointing.
