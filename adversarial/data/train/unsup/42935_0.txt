My wife and I had a great experience. Food was good service was good, no complaints. I noticed a lot of inaccurate yelp commentaries about the price. Anyone who complains about the price does not get out very often. Its still less expensive that Carnegie deli nyc was 30 years ago. Been here 3 x and we avg $30 per visit.
