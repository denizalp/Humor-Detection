I don't know if I've reviewed Served before but it's an amazing food experience. The chef owner and his crew always comes up with awesome new food ideas, and the waiters are very passionate about food and flavors as well. It's a small comfortable little restaurant that has room for at least two big parties (8-10 people). Troy is such an excellent server and is clearly a lover of flavors. I've been coming here every so often for a while. I showed up for the thanksgiving special. Thanksgiving you have to reserve ahead of time and it's 30 per person for the turkey only option + all you can eat sides + dessert. Everything was delicious as always, Turkey was moist, candied yams hit a high sweet note with what tasted like vanilla extract, cranberry sauce had some amazing citrus notes, the veggies were awesome, the chunky mashed potatoes and gravy were excellent. There were some drawbacks, the cornbread+stuffing mix was a bit dry and under seasoned, and the guy who cut our pie slices at the end cut them super small and wonky. But overall everything was wonderful.
