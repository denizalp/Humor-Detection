Outrageously overpriced. I can only imagine that some of my fellow reviewers were tanked on wine when they wrote their glowing reviews, because the food is downright lousy. \n\nMy girlfriend and I had the soup of the day (chicken rice and curry, which was fine), and a decent salad. But then the tapas started. First, green beans, which were in a delicious sauce but were severely undercooked. Then, the flatbread, which is an awful way to waste $17. It was a chewy, flavorless affair that left us salivating for a $2 frozen pizza back at home. Then the Hangar Steak, which was also undercooked, lukewarm, and utterly bland.  It came paired with an unappetizing and -- brace yourself -- undercooked risotto! \n\nEverything needed pepper, yet none was forthcoming.  It seemed the wait staff was too busy obliging other tables' requests to uncork another bottle of wine. \n\nWith drinks and tip, we taught ourselves a $95 lesson: don't eat here again.
