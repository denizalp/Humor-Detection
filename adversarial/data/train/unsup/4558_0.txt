Great place for a nice kicking Mediterranean meal - to go for the most part as this place gets jam packed after a certain hour in the evening. Pita rolls and Shawarma dinner plates are their specialty. At least that's what I tried given the 2 were the featured items on their not so big a menu. And both of these totally delivered.\n\nLate in the night on Rue St Catherine, every restaurant is pretty jam packed. Especially if they serve alcohol or have a BYOB policy. We accidentally stumbled upon this place while trying to get a bite after one of the concerts at the Jazz festival. This place was packed too. But a quick peek and we knew at least we could do a take out.\n\nSo went for a kebab pita roll, a mixed meat pita roll and a mixed meat Shawarma plate. Yes, we were starving! Everything was fresh and being fixed right in front of us. They have an open kitchen where you can see the veggie bar and the meat skewered grill from where all the meat was being cut fresh and topped on to the dinner plate or the pita wrap.\n\nThey ask you for heat level preference and also what you opt your pita role or your dinner plate to be loaded with. \"Fully Dressed\" - gets you everything, with no extra charge. Fully dressed it was for us. And it was yummy! The special hot sauce will add that extra kick to your meal. Go for it. It is so worth it. It's not flaming hot, but it is good.\n\nThey open only in the evening around 5pm because we had walked past this place in the afternoon and it was closed. I believe they are open till late - around 3am. Definitely a good post drinking food to avoid a massive hangover. Meets all the requirements of a great Shawarma place. Fresh veggies. Meat being chopped in front of you. Hot sauce to boot. No hangover in the morning. What more can a man ask for after a wild night out in town? 5 stars!!
