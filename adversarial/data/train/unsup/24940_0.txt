Holy cow, these Pupusas were great!  I had two and two pork carnitas tacos.  Some of the best Mexican food I've had here in Las Vegas.  There was no one in the joint when we arrived, which was fine with me.  It was a Saturday early afternoon.  The menu is sizable but I knew what I wanted.  The food came out pretty fast and it was everything I thought it would be.  I can't wait to back to this place!
