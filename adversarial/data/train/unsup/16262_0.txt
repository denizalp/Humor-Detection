It's been a few years since I've been to this annual event. The good news is that the number of food booths and merchandise vendors has increased in number and quality. The bad news is that the event is perhaps becoming a victim of its own success, very nearly outgrowing its location. \n\nI love the fact that so many local restaurants have set up booths and that other food vendors earmark proceeds for charity. Very hot and crowded this day, however, with very long lines for much of the food. The food is not that cheap for the most part and it's unlikely that you'll find a true bargain among the imported merchandise, but did you really expect anything different at an event like this? The food is varied and enjoyable and there is merchandise you won't see everyday, at least not in downtown Phoenix. Need a Bonsai tree? Not everything offered is genuinely Japanese, but it bothers me not as long as there is fun to be had.\n\nThere is an arts and craft setup for the kids ($1 donation), but no large play area. Entertainment was solid during the time we were at the festival (three stages!!!). Lots of families in attendance. Lots of dogs. Lots of people dressed up as their favorite Anime characters. Very fun. Even though there is no admission charge for the festival, parking in downtown Phoenix can be a hassle or expensive. We chose to simply park a couple of blocks away for free (to the north and east) and enjoyed a leisurely walk with the dogs to the festival. \n\nWe attended the annual Phoenix Chinese Week festival just a couple of weekends ago at Hance Park. Matsuri has the more diverse food, vending and entertainment of the two Asian festivals, but we had a much more relaxing time at Chinese Week. Less crowded and more for young kids to do (bouncy houses). There is, however, more choice in entertainment for older kids and adults at Matsuri. Personal preference. Good food and friendly people at both events.  We intend to return to both.
