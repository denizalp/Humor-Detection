I have been a patient at this office for 17 years. \n\nThis is the only dentist in town for adults that I refer friends and family to. \n\nDr Cynthia is the best. She listens, takes her time, and is supportive. She doesn't oversell you on unnecessary treatments and she is always honest and forthright. She keeps up with the changes of my oral health through every stage of my aging and helps me prepare year to year to keep my teeth looking the best they can and being in the best health! \n\nThe office provides good referrals for care that requires speciality dentists. The Doctor herself is also concerned with the needs of the community and gives back to many local charities including Girl Scouts! I love supporting businesses who actually care about the Las Vegas community ! \n\nThe staff here is amazing. Kiki manages the front of the house. My bills are correct and timely and she always has kind things to say. Her personality is bubbly and kind. In the 17 years I have been a patient here every phone call and visit has been met by happy courteous staff who always put their best foot forward. \n\nMy hygienist is thorough, cleans my teeth well, and stays on top of my chart to make sure it is up to date. \n\nThe office is clean and tidy, attractively decorated, and location and parking are excellent. \n\nThe hours are extended and flexible Monday through Friday. \n\nThis is the best Adult Dental office in town!
