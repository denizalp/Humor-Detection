I'm really sorry to say that this was the worst SPG hotel I've ever stayed at.  Madison is known for having very lovely, friendly people but we did not feel comfortable or welcomed at this hotel at all.  Pretty much nothing about our hotel stay went right -- we could never book the shuttle, the food was terrible, it always took at least half an hour for a taxi to arrive to the hotel, the rooms were very bare bones and not well-cleaned, and the staff was super rude and unprofessional.  I cannot in good conscience recommend this hotel to anyone.
