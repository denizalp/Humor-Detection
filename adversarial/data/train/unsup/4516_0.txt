The Thai tea was terrible!! It was super watery and had absolutely no flavor . My mom got the milk tea and it was literally sour and after an hour it started separating . My aunts and uncles all got the taro slush, it wasn't as bad and the flavor was kinda nice, but not ONE drink had nice and chewy boba balls. All of the boba balls were hard on the inside and tasted like starch.
