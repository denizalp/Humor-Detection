The onslaught of ridiculous chicken sandwich pictures on social media finally brought me to try Blue Ribbon. Although a new location just opened on The Strip, I found the parking situation to be much easier to navigate in Summerlin. My intrigue began almost a month ago when Blue Ribbon promoted a sandwich called The Smorgasbird - a double decker chicken sandwich stuffed with fries, barbecue chicken, grilled pineapple and sauce at a nice price point of $15. \n\nThe challenge was to finish the bird within 5 minutes and to challenge other friends to do the same to be entered to win a free Hail Mary platter (that's 25 whole wings, 25 tenders, and a side). To sweeten the dean, $5 of that goes to the National MS Society, plus you get your choice of a free shirt or hat. It was win, win win, so I went for it. \n\nI skipped out on the actual binging challenge and split it with my sister. The chicken itself was good, but in the hodgepodge of different types of food all mixed together, individual flavors were difficult to discern. I did enjoy the skinny cut fries that they had. If you're feeling adventurous, try the chef's choice, beak to butt. While it wasn't for me, it's nice to see that no part of the bird is wasted and you can enjoy parts that some may see as delicacies such as the heart or gizzard. \n\nOverall, I found the chicken to be tender and juicy, but I'll have to try the original sandwich as well as the individual pieces. I love that they have different types of honey including spicy wasabi, which gives it an extra kick. I found the prices to be very reasonable, especially if you're coming for lunch and can grab lunchbox special for $8. The sweet honey tea is great, without being overly sweetened.
