Ok, I am not the kind to write reviews.  But, as my teenage girls would say, truth be told, I have to tell you how much I will never shop here again.  \n\nI bought three stacking rings from them a couple of years ago.  There is a clearly posted sign that says, we accept trades and will buy jewelry.  So, I present the rings I bought from them hoping to get some money for them and they tell me that they are too worn to be accepted.  Let me tell you I have not worn them very much at all.  It was definitely a hoax that they would buy my rings.  I was even going to roll the money into something else from their store.  No diamonds were missing.  they just needed to be cleaned.  It is appalling that they refused to give me any money.  Do not  give them your money.  Run away!!!
