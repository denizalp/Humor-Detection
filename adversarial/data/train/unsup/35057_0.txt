Tried the Traditional pho for the first time. It was a good experience for me. Never had tripe or tendon before and it did take some confidence to chow down, I did really enjoy it. The guy behind the counter was friendly and helpful. Loved their selection of beers and sake. I didn't know that Vietnamese dumplings were basically pot stickers, I was expecting more of a Japanese or Chinese dumpling, so that was my bad. Their house made sauces were fantastic!! The Tennessee Asian BBQ sauce brought my taste buds back to Nashville!! The only improvement was that their fresh herb bar wasn't so fresh... Everything was wilted and browned or super dried out (limes, cilantro, bean sprouts)... It was like 8:45\/9 but you can tell it had been there longer than a day... Overall it was good! And since it's super close to home we'll be back when we're in the mood for a decent pho!
