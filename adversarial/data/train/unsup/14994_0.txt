You know, I would've LOVED Tao if the crowd wasn't so populated with ASIANS! I felt like I was back in SF clubbing there.... \n\nThe ambiance is amazingly beautiful here and really does give me the urge to get my party on, but the crowd really kills it. The environment here is intimate with a great lounge\/party atmosphere. The lighting gives Tao such a great Asian-Fusion effect! \n\nThe guest list lines moves pretty quick and girls get free drinks till 1030 of course! The music played here is really good! Music is up to beat. The bathrooms are so odd though. It seems so exposed. Not sure if I like that. \n\nBasically my girls and I stayed here until 11iish then decided we were going to bounce and go to Marquee. This asianess wasn't quite our scene even though we are Asian... lol. I guess we just prefer different type of guys?
