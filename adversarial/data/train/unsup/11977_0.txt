Mikes is probably the best bar in Berea. The food is amazing, and there is a great selection of beers no one else has. HOWEVER, I had one of the worst experiences at a bar ever when I was at mikes last night. I was accused by a new bartender of breaking a glass and I never knew anything about it. I then asked to speak to a manager not the owner and he did nothing about the situation. I normally never complain either. I have been going to mikes frequently over the past 5 years and they will no longer get my business and I encourage everyone else to do the same.
