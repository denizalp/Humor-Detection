I have no clue what Paris is like but if this place was recreated to look like it, I must go right meow!\n\nGordon Ramsay's restaurant is in here. \n\nIt's not very bright in there. It's just enough light to be able to get around.\n\nThe restrooms were a bit dirty when I came here, and that's why I gave it 3 stars.\n\nI will be sure to come back and make an updated review :)
