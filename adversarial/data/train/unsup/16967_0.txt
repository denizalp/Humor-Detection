After being in Pittsburgh for 6 months I was still on the search for some solid Asian food. One day, I found myself having the ability to leave at a normal hour so did a quick yelp search for sushi and stumbled upon this joint. I had been craving sushi but not had the ability to have any good options in Pittsburgh so was eager to try this joint out. The joint is located on a strip in the Southside with multiple restaurants and bars surrounding it. The restaurant is large on the inside with a sushi bar upon your entrance. The folks greet you quickly at the door and seat you just as quickly with menus by your side. These folks have the standard menu selection of nigiris, rolls, and hot plates. \n\nThe restaurant itself would be great for date nights or large groups and everything in between. After perusing the menu, I ordered some hot sake (of course) and literally went down the list ordering a whole array of nigiris including a rainbow roll. I was a bit nervous as I have not had great experiences in Pittsburgh so far but figured I might as well go all out. I ordered yellow tail, tuna, salmon, white tuna, uni, ikura, and unagi. The rolls themselves were solid and I was glad they did not lay down on the sauce too much. The nigiris were actually pretty good and probably the best ive had in Pittsburgh. They were pretty fresh and they gave fairly large size cuts which was nice. For the amount I ordered, the price was also decent so I was happy with the outcome.\n\nThis is probably the best spot for sushi was able to find while in Pittsburgh and I was glad to have had the opportunity to grab this spot.
