My friends and I love coming here because they have comfortable couches where large groups can gather to enjoy drinks and hookah. We love singing karaoke and having a ball with the crowd!!! Most people are so supportive and jump in on the experience which makes it so much more fun. The  bartender Jackson, is awesome!!!
