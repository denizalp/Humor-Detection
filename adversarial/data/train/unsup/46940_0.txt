I ate at Guy's with a friend in January 2016, and we both enjoyed our experience.\n\nThis restaurant is located on the Las Vegas Strip at the LINQ hotel.  The decor and ambiance was fun, and the service very friendly and good.\n\nWe started in the bar with a $13 Mai Tai, which I thought was typical Strip prices for a drink.  The drink was good and you could tell they actually put alcohol in the glass.\n\nI ordered a turkey burger for $18, with avocado for another $3.  I thought the portion size was large, and the quality excellent.  All of the food we ordered was very good.\n\nI found this restaurant to be a fun place to have a meal and a drink.\n\nI am planning on eating here again during my next Vegas trip.
