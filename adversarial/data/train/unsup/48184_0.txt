I've never been \" bold\" or excited about Indian food. I assumed everything was curry, curry and more curry. \nMy friend invited me to this restaurant and I was eager to eat with an experienced devotee of Indian cuisine. \nFirst of all, our waiter could not have been more pleasant and helpful. He was patient and answered every question I had. \nSecondly, the restaurant is clean and lovely. Not loud. No distracting music. Service was great.\nLastly. The food!!! To. Die. For. I'm a confirmed fan. The nuances of mint, chile, cumin, etc. the Naan!!! Every bite was an explosion of flavor. \nGreat experience. I can't  wait to go back.
