Forget any other boba spot in town.  BrewTeaBoys got this. \n\nI'm usually picking up a caffeinated concoction before work, and while it's not always at BTB, i'm never really content with my drink because other places make it too sweet when i specifically asked for adjustment.  A hint of sweetness is ok, but anymore than that is irritating.  These guys knows exactly how to make my drinks, and on the first try too!  \n\nThe tea here are STRONG because they are built to order.  I am so pleased that i am never tasting just milk in my drink (or sugar.)  I haven't ventured off too far from the classic Oolong or black milk tea, but the ones i have tried were delicious: Taro, Hokkaido, and Caramel Milk Tea to name a few.  \n\nIf you're looking for something different with a little more body they have Sea Salt Cream.  Pairs nicely with their Cold Brew Coffee.  Outside of BTB i've only had Sea Salt Cream at 85Â°C, and i find theirs repulsive because it has way too much of a bite. BTB's version is softer.\n\nService is amazingly good.  Such a welcoming and friendly staff. Worth driving out of the way for. Would love to see more seating in there and maybe those idiot proof film sealing lids for their cups? I don't trust myself when i holding something so vital.
