Brianna and Christian made it FUN to get a heart scan.\n I arrived an hour early by mistake and was ushered right on. Clean and quick, they joked with me, didn't even feel the needle go in.\n I would come back here in a heartbeat. Get it? Heartbeat?\n Anyway, good parking but an awkward twist for the oldsters in to get chairs or walkers in. Couldn't these places add auto open doors, too?
