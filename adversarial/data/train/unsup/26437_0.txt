This place has great reviews, and now I know why!! I took out dinner from here and tried some different rolls and the tofu dinner set. I was blown away by the portion of the tofu dinner it was enough for two meals!!! The tools were quite large as well; I personally don't like how they add lettuce into the rolls but now I know to ask for no lettuce. I've heard it was pricey-- I honestly didn't find it too bad but compared to other places it is on the pricier side. I'll def return and try some other items !
