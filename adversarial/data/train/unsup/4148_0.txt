My fianc√© and I LOOOOVE this pizza joint! We live walking distance (if we really wanted to walk there....) and order more than we probably should. The antipasto salad is delicious and enough for 2 people. Their white pizza with spinach is my absolute favorite! Everyone is always super friendly and they're usually pretty accurate on the timing if you order to go. The large pizza + wings special really is a solid deal!
