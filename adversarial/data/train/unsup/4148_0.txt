This restaurant has a very cool vibe with the upstairs bar overlooking the dining area.  I really enjoyed all of the food I have tried. My favorite being the agnolotti.  The Zuchinni bread dessert is a must!! \n\nAs great as the food is I have not had the best experience with the cocktails. I have tried three different from the menu and have not liked a single one (Smoke, Rosemary and Cocao)
