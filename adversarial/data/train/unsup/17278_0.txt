Stayed for a mini vacation during labor day weekend, stayed in their suite which was roomy, fireplace, huge restroom, an more! Got a cabana near the water slides for $200 which I highly recommend, seating an shade is limited near the pools. Our waitress Lexi was very friendly and attentive. Recommend the peach daiquiri you won't be disappointed!
