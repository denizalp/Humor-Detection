Quick review as I only had one dish. Went early,  so only 3 tables booked. Warm greeting from owner. Bread was warm, crispy on outside,  soft and seasoned inside  (really good ). House salad super basic, homemade Italian dressing was very good.\nMarinara sauce was fantastic, great texture, not too sweet.  Meatballs very good too. Homemade pasta tasted very \"doughy\", almost undercooked.\nMy waitress was just ok. Took forever to bring\/cash check. Actually had to ask other waitress as mine had disappeared for a while. Based on the sauce, menu and other reviews I will go back and try again.
