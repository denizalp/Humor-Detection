The service was decent, but the food was so-so. There are SO many food options in Vegas that it's hard to pick. I didn't feel like this was the best I could've found, but I wanted to visit Flavortown. The brisket nachos were interesting to say the least. Not too sure that BBQ sauce and nachos clashed too well together, but it wasn't horrible. I would say it's a place to try if you're as obsessed with Guy Fieri as I am, but only for memeing purposes.
