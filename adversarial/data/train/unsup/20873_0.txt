There is a real danger in signing a contract with company that truly believe they don't have to fix a problem, 'Nothin can touch them' so, complaints bounce. And your concerns are just... Well, yours!  There is no upper management, and if there is any, they hide behind incompetent ladies that make you feel you are talking to a wall. The AJ in the corner is nice, the neighborhood is awesome, the exterior will draw you in, but the truth is you will regret this decision. Look at all the reviews..... The ones that rated positive are those who started living there a year, or less, and have'nt had to leave yet. That will soon change. Check back! They will soon  find the color rose wear off, and the little stars and unicorns fly away. If you have not taken your decision, let my situation just save you from it... Go the other way. There are other options. I live now in a bigger, better place in the area. What a waste that was. Overpriced, and not worth the aftermath. How can they get away with it is beyond me... But they do. Way too many times!! (Do your research) The sheriff needs to look into this!!
