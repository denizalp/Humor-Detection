What a friendly place! I came in on a Saturday evening, with mediocre expectations...it's a sports bar, a dime a dozen. But Diamonds, well that's a different story. First, I was greeted with a genuine smile from very friendly bartender, Antoinette. The spinach artichoke dip was ordered along with a tasty cider. Oh my! Let me tell you about the dip. It was THE BEST I've had in a long time. I travel weekly for work and my go to app is this on any menu...so you might refer to me as SpinachArtichoke dip connoisseur ;)  The homemade dip was full of diced artichokes and chopped spinach and just the right amount of cheese. Icing on the cake was garlic toast served with this appetizer. Lovely! The crowd was a mix of ages and 'types' which in my opinion gave the bar a low key vibe. Diamondbacks were on the big screens. But most people were there to enjoy the company. This is my new hangout :-)
