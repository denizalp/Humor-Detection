I have never in my life been left feeling more ripped off. I ordered a chicken quesodilla (7.99) and after adding chicken, got charged 12.40. I got handed a tiny plastic container that weighed 5oz tops, with nothing more inside than a folded tortilla with the equivalent of a slice of cheese and hints of a few borderline undetectable shredded chicken bits. I showed the manager and was offered a side of quac and chips, which was nice but I turned it  down. From the other reviews, it seems that this is standard practice. Avoid.
