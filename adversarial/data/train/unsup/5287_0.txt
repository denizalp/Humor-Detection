No wonder no one at the company will give you their last names.  Robin, the \"manager\" is a psycho, Craig needs to be medicated and the receptionist, who is a moron, actually said \"I dont know my boss' last name\". Horrible. This isnt even my debt, and they fully disclosed ALL information to me.\n\n I filed a complaint with the FTC, BBB and Attorney General.  Here are the websites if you'd like to file also:\n\nwww.bbb. org\n\nwww.ftccomplaintassistant.gov\/FTC_Wizard.aspx?Lang=en\n\nwww.azag.gov\nClick on the top of the page under Consmer and then Consmer Complaints. \n\nHere is the complaint I filed and my experience with the company:\nI was contacted in June by J&R Brothers about a 2010 medical bill of my ex-husbands.  I explained that we had been divorced since 2005 years and that it was not my obligation.  The agent stated that if I provided my ex-husband's mothers phone number that he would remove me from his account.  He also fully disclosed the nature of the call, the amount, date and due party for the medical bill after I disclosed that I was not married when the bill occurred.  This is a direct violation of FDCPA guidelines.  After providing the agent with my ex's mothers cell number, he stated I'd be removed from the account.  Two months later I was to close on a home I was purchasing for myself and my children and J&R Brothers had placed a collection account on my credit which threw off my debt to income ratios.  I immediately called J&R Brothers and was prompted to leave and after-hours message.  I waited 4 days with no return phone call and called again and was prompted to leave a second message.  I received a call the following day and explained the situation to the agent.  He placed me on hold, returned, and demanded that I fax over a copy of the divorce decree.  I explained that it would be on file in the same place that he found my name in the first place.  I tried to explain that all of my documentation is in boxes since we were in the process of moving.  He said \"do you want the fax number or not\" I stated no, because - and he hung up on me.  I called back and spoke to his manager, Robin.  She proceeded to shout at me, tell me I was rude for not listening and hung up on me.  I called back to explain to her that its not that I don't want to provide the document, I simply do not have access.  I also explained that it was against FDCPA guidelines for her to report this on my credit or to even discuss the account with me.  She raised her voice again and said she was not going to speak with me and that I can fax it over or deal with it. I asked her where she found my name and she stated that she didn't know and wasn't going to pull the file to find out.  I let her know again that I do not have access to the document and that legally IÃ¢â*¢Ëm under no obligation to produce it.  She hung up on me.  I called back again and she picked up the phone and shouted, \"IÃ¢â*¢Ëm not talking to you!\" and hung up again.  I called back and left a message.  I received no return phone call so I called back again.  She picked up the phone and shouted, \"You do not have permission to speak to me, I'll fix your credit!\" and hung up on me again.  I have all calls recorded if the documentation is needed.
