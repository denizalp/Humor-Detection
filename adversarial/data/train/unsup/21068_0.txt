Cute drum face talking to me in a language I can't understand = win. Hey, I am not an expert on the fancy machines they have at Gemini, but I could tell by the swift feet on the gals and gents here that they were. If their feet had been moving any faster, they would have been in flight. And, judging by those masters, this is the place to be if you're a dancing game fanatic or perhaps just a bit curious. \n\nThere are a few games on free play, including free foosball. I gave the drums a bang, but the most popular game according to the amazing owner is the Korean DJ Technika. I have a feeling if you have any questions, she is more than happy to help. \n\nThey also have tournaments. When we were there, they were getting ready for a fighting game tournament that night and guys were showing up with their own giant console\/controller things. I had never seen this equipment, which let me know this place is legit. Your own private gamer's paradise.
