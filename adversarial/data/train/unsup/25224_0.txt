ALWAYS, always a wait at the pharmacy. No effort to accommodate customers. Seldom do they open the 2nd of 3 stations that they have back there.  I don't even know why they set 3 up???  They only use 1.  \n\nGetting eye contact is next to impossible. So is a sincere apology for the lack of customer service in place.  Its not due to shortage of staffing either.  There are usually plenty of people back there and despite a lineup of people, they always seem to prioritize the driveup.  Its frustrating, because you know that whomever just pulled up isnt waiting yet if you are in the makeshift waiting area they take precedence.  \n\nI need to figure out where to go.  There is no shortage of pharmacies to choose from.
