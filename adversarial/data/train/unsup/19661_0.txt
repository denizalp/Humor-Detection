I was completely set on giving this place 4 stars until the final few minutes of my experience.  Why?  The only thing truly \"wild\" here is the pricing.\n\nI like the Rainforest Cafe, and have for over 10 years.  But then, I like theme restaurants (I miss thee, Star Trek) because it's goofy and fun to have some crazy atmosphere you normally wouldn't experience in a vast majority of regular dining experiences.  That, and I'm a sucker for their \"Mojo Bones\" (ribs), and their pun name filled alcoholic beverages.\n\nI liked the atmosphere (always love the fish and the rainstorms), the service was polite and friendly and very casual.  Good job all around for our waitress.  The food was good.  Their tomato basil soup is excellent, and I had a pleasant dining experience by their waterfall.  I even had some of my food to go, because it was a respectable (and large) selection of an appetizer, soup, a drink, and my main entree.  For two.\n\nAnd then the meal came to an end.\n\nThis is admittedly where I get \"cheap\".  Rainforest Cafe used to be reasonably priced, and while I noticed the prices were slowly climbing (but still reasonable), the prices were actually uncomfortable this time, so my lady and I tried to be careful in what we ordered.  By the time we got out plus tip, it was over $100+.  For two people.  In a chain restaurant designed primarily for families and children.  We didn't even get dessert.  Thank God, as I may have had to take out a loan.\n\nI honestly don't mind paying that amount of money for one of the exclusive restaurants on the Strip, but those are always intended as \"special occasion\" restaurants that are pre-planned for birthdays or some big event.  I wasn't expecting Rainforest Cafe to gouge me (especially in this economy), and it left a bad taste in my mouth in what was an otherwise good dining experience.\n\nI always enjoyed going to the Rainforest Cafe, and now I'm going to have to second guess doing it anymore.  I'd rather spend the $100+ on a quality steak or sushi from some featured chef in a fancy dining experience where I can dress up and impress the heck out of my lady for being so \"romantic\", than a restaurant you can find in most states around the country, and the standard dress is shorts and flip flops.\n\nWhen we walked in, I noticed the restaurant was surprisingly empty, and we had zero wait time to get a table.  I thought we had good luck in picking a quiet time.  I'm starting to think that's not the case for our quick seating anymore.  I'd hate to be a family of four.\n\nUnless the restaurant is trying to sabotage itself into a close-down in the near future, it seriously needs to reconsider its pricing structure.
