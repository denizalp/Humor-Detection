I called Penguin air for a noisy condenser fan.  The lady I talked with said I should sign up for their $218 yearly service contract.  I was told that gave me emergency same day service, Weekend and holiday service, and 20% off all charges.  I took out the service contract.\n\nThe tech came out on Saturday and determined that the bearings in my condenser fan motor were going out.  He then tried to convince me to buy a new system.  I told him to fix the problem.  The tech told me he would charge me $768 for a new condenser fan motor.  I didn't know if this was a reasonable charge or not.  I found out later that the tech works on commission and can charge what ever he feels the client will pay.  In my case, a senior citizen that was afraid of air conditioner failure in 115 degree head.  I told him to replace the fan motor.\n\nIt took the tech about 30 minutes to replace the motor.  The replacement motor was a Chinese Mars10468 1\/4 HP motor.  There was a bundle of electrical wire protruding from the fan grate.  The tech told me the motor he had turned the wrong way so he had to rewire it.  I was able to find a new Chinese MAR10468 on line for $68.  I paid $1400 an hour for the installation.  (1\/2 HR at $700.)\n\nI later called another reputable air condition company and was told that my job should have been $300-$400 at most.  They told me the jury rigged motor was unacceptable by industry standards.\n\nBEWARE OF PENGUIN AIR
