I'm an expert when it comes to Indian cuisine and sadly Marigold missed the mark   \nWhile the Tikka tofu  and Palak paneer was good, it was nothing special. The briyani, mushroom curry and eggplant tasted way too heavy with masala which frankly overpowered the entire meal. Very disappointed, definitely won't be going back. There are many other restaurants that satisfy my palette when I'm craving excellent Indian cuisine.
