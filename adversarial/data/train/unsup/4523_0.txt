I love a good pun, and I really wanted to love this place- but if the other reviews stating that the fish and chips here are \"just like England!\" are true, I'm a little bummed. Service was polite enough, and the menu is mostly fried items (including desserts).\n\nOpted for fish and chips on my visit- their specialty. The pieces of cod used were of good quality, and the fry was good. But the batter was bland and tasteless. Good crispness, and not too thick, but no seasoning. Chips were generic fries found frequently elsewhere- not sure what I was expecting but was underwhelmed. I will say that the tartar sauce was a homemade ranch dressing?-  smooth for dipping instead of chunky and light on flavor, but most definitely NOT tartar sauce. WTH?\nInterested in trying their fish tacos, hoping they add a chowder to the menu.\n\nFelt this place was a bit heavy on prices: meals from 1-5 pieces range from $8 to almost $30, with apps like onion rings (1\/3 pound?) and fried zucchini going for $7 and cajun prawns for just under $10. I didn't feel that the quality was yet up enough to justify the prices.
