More than Pizza!  Meat Sauce on Pasta (or in a Bowl) is VERY Good!  Might be the best in Charlotte!  Get Here EARLY the place gets Crowded and the Parking lot fills up fast!\n\nPizza here is Very Good, the Lunch Buffet is very Popular and as good as getting a Pie at Night!  This Pizza is WAY Better than Al's Pizza and is also Better than Jett's and Fuel!\n\nMeat Sauce on Pasta Mmmmmm!!!  This one is Mmmm YUMMM!  One of my Favorites... Just right on the Spices and Meaty!  Very Good Flavor!\n\nThis Italian Sandwich could be avoided if you can get out of the Neighborhood... Which means they BEAT a lot of places on Sandwiches:  They Beat Al's Pizza, Mcallister's, Which Wich, Jason's Deli, Fuel and probably everyone in the Neighborhood!  Compared to their Competition (just in the Neighborhood) they would get 4 stars or more on the Sandwich, Compared to the Best in Concord, Charlotte, Cornelius and Rock Hill, the Sandwich would rate 2-3 yelp stars, closer to 2 probably!\n\nVavid!!!  I do not consider this place a Lookalota, though many will, from the Parking lot to the Stairway to the entrance to the Dinning Room!  You could get a WHOLE Lot of Attention here though not everyone would notice, nor be happy about it... You can probably ignore it and be fine!!!  People watching People is entertaining sometimes for sure, it would be nicer if more subtle...
