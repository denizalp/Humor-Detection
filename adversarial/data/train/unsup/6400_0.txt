I really like this yogurt shop!  The employees are always super friendly and the place us always really clean!  \n\nMy go to flavor is cake batter and I top that with oreo cookie bits - so yum!  The toppings bar is extensive and you can have just about any topping you can think of.  The charge by weight just like all frozen yogurt shops do, the price is comparable. They have a couple tables outside so on a nice night, its fun to just chill outside. \n\nThis shop is in the basha grocery store strip mall.
