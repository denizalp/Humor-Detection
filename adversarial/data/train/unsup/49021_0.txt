Great build your own tacos!\n\nA good place to stop at lunch on Friday's, after work for happy hour (half priced margs!), and for late night eats after a concert or game. \n\nDinner times on weekends tend to have waits but you can order drinks at the bar while you wait. \n\nSome recommendation:\n-stoner queso - omg so tasty\n-stoner taco\n-Greek goddess taco\n-chorizo on anything\n-Coke cola marinated beef\n-new item - apple jicama slaw!! Tasty!\n-pickled peppers\n-blood orange margaritas\n\nAlso good gluten free options, low carb options, vegetarian options and paleo options. You can get corn tacos, flour tacos, bowls with and without rice and tofu\/black bean\/ portobello mushrooms for your protein if your a vegetarian or vegan.
