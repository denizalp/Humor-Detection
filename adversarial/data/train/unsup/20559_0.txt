In the world of Vegas, Caesars Palace is one you must tick off your list as having visited.  I've stayed here a few times and always enjoyed the experience.\n\nFor me, I visit the Forum Shops every time, the dining and shopping options are fun and a great time suck.  The Forum Shops is a huge indoor mall of stores and restaurants under a blue sky, which gradually evolves into dusk.  It's an experience to see at least once and take in the architecture, statues, and animatronic performance at the large fountain.\n\nCaesars represents everything that is Las Vegas.
