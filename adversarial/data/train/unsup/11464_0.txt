I seldom eat doughnuts as they are sweet and I don't do many sweets with any regularity. After my experience here I'll never be able to look a normal doughnut in the eyes again.  I found myself waiting for a customer to meet me in the parking lot and had heard several people say the doughnuts here were good, especially the bacon one.  I was totally unprepared for a custom fresh cooked doughnut.  I chose the Bacon Blast from the menu.  Then I got to watch them make my doughnut from scratch as it went in the fryer.  Then they dipped it in maple icing followed by a generous portion of thick cut bacon crumbles.  This was not a take back to the office doughnut, it was made to be eaten while still warm and soft and gooey.  And I did. :)  As an added bonus, at $1.25 it was reasonably priced.
