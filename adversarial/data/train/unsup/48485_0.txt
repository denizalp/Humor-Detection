Parking: Plenty of free parking. \n\nAmenities: guest laundry, pool, Keurig in room, complimentary drinks and delicious made to order breakfast! Ice machines on every floor but I had to walk to 3 different machines before I found one that worked! \n\nDecor: Exterior is very cute and reminds me a little of New Orleans. Cute outdoor sitting area. Interiorly, there is a waterfall at the entrance that is so calming and beautiful. Bathroom cabinets looked old and the wood was cracking. Rooms were spacious and had a full sized sink, pull out bed, microwave and mini fridge. Bathroom sink was also clogged. \n\nLocation: took us less than 15 mins to drive to the PIT airport and hotel also offers a shuttle.
