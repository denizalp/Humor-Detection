I ordered the Natural Burger Combo w\/ avocado & bacon (extra cost) which totaled to about $10+\n\nPros:\n* Burger is juicy & tastes fresh \n* Meal size is good & filling\n* Burger buns are soft\n* Manager checks up on you at the table to make sure you're okay\n* They sporadically clear the table for you\n\nCons:\n* Burger is a little messy to eat, and kept falling apart\n* Fries are ordinary & a bit bland\n* Fried zucchini was a bit bland\n* Prices are a little high for a burger place\n\nOverall, it was good & I'd go back here. I'm really keen to try their breakfast items!
