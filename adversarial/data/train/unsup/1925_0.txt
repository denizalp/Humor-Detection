We stopped here to cool off and grab a drink for lunch!  I know they clean with bleach but as soon as you opened the door, you were slapped silly with bleach smell.  The staff that took our order was nice.  We stay there talking for a little.  I don't know if it was the manager or who, but he seems very unprofessional.  Loud and a little obnoxious.  But the smoothies were good.
