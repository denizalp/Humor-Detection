It's hard to say you \"loved\" any oral surgery experience, but Dr. Bond and the staff at his office made the experience as enjoyable and easy as possible. I was in an immense amount of pain and they were able to get me scheduled for my surgery very quickly. The staff at the front desk are kind and efficient. I have been to the office for a consultation, my actual surgery, and a follow up visit. I never waited longer than 5 minutes, which is very impressive. \n\nAs far as the actual surgery went, I'm what you would call a \"nervous patient\", and Dr. Bond and his staff did everything in their power to make sure I was comfortable. The surgery was over in less than an hour, including prep time. His office has a separate exit and reserved parking for patient pick-up, which was greatly appreciated after the visit. My recovery went as well as to be expected, and while I was only out of work for only 2 days, Dr. Bond called to follow up both days after the surgery. Thank you Dr. Bond for taking such good care of your patients.
