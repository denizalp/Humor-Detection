I moved to this side of town a little over a year ago and thought I would never find a nail tech I love....well, I did.  Annie is the best and if I can't get in to see Annie, I see John.  They're all super friendly and do a great job every time.  I can call up and not even tell them who I am and they say \"Hello, Jeny\".  Not kidding.  Love this place.  Plus, it's not boring in there.... it's actually FUN!  No wonder it's always busy!!!
