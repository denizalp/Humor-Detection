Just an update, this Taco Bell is still a good location to go to if you are into fast \"Mexican\" food.  They have always made my orders correctly.\n\nI am typically here because of the Dbacks (AZ Diamondbacks) promo which is when they get five runs you can get three free tacos with the purchase of a large drink between 4p & 6p the next day.  $1.00 for supreme tacos; no limit to amount of promos purchased; drive thru & inside.\n\nThere is also a very friendly drive thru guy who speaks with a deep voice and gives your total in pennies.\n\nSolid location.
