Wow! Can't say that I liked this place at all.  The only positives were the attentiveness of the wait staff and the raw food display.  Oh and the octopus appetizer.  Speaking for myself, I had the $70 rib eye steak...for $35, I can go to CostCo and get THREE steaks of much better quality and thickness.  The $99 lobster my friend ordered was very tough and what happened to serving drawn butter?  My other friend ordered the shrimp and she said it was also chewy.  The total bill, with drinks, DID NOT justify the food.  Maybe we were there on an off night but neither did I get a Greek flavor from the place nor a positive dining experience for the cash we laid out.  Won't be going there again.
