I live and work in the area forever but  had not tried Adrian's pizza until a few months ago. I have been back at least once a week since! The food is awesome! I'll stop in for A quick lunch and take care of some work and use the WI-FI. They have really good daily specials. Salads are huge. The house made balsamic is awesome. And the pizza! OMG. First of all they put all kinds of crazy things on pizza like mashed potatoes and French fries. Each one I try is better than the last. Cyprus is my entire families favorite pie.If you haven't tried this place recently you need to stop in! The new owner is truly passionate about what he does. He is there every time I stop in. Almost forgot... He makes homemade soups. So fresh and delicious. If he had the tomato zucchini I highly recommend it. His wedding soup and chili are also really good!
