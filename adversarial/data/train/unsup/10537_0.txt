This place is not too bad. I have to say it is just like a lot of the other Danny's around the Valley. That is not a bad thing. Probaly good, because, you know what to expect.\nI jsut got a regular car wash. They do a good job.\n They are fairly fast no problems.\nThat is good and I like it. I tipped when leaving , they work hard here.\nIt is no easy thing to do in the heat all day.\nI work outside all day and I know it is hot out there.\nI would come back any day.\nIf you go really early during the week( before 9) there is a discount. Maybe next time I will try to get there early as well. Missed it this time.
