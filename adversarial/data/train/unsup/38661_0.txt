I really like buffet style food, so this review is difficult for me.  The buffet at The MGM Grand is pretty crappy.  I took part in breakfast and dinner at the buffet, and was very surprised to see some of the same foods at both!  The prime rib at dinner was mostly fat, the vegetables were tasteless, the shrimp were out too long, and became slimy.  If you want bacon and eggs for breakfast, then the buffet is adequate, but don't waste your money here for dinner.
