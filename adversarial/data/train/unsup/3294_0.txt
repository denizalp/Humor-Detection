SHABU SHABU!!! \n\nI LOVE shabu.... it would be my go to whenever I can't think of something to eat because it is like a home cooking meal... plus you can keep yourself entertained by cooking your own food if you are eating ALONE! \n\nJust like MOST shabu places that I have dined at... they have individual pots & burners for each person on a high counter top... although lately I have been seeing more places w\/ low counter tops which is nice just in case if you can't get onto the high top! This place is clean cut & simply decorated which I always like when there isn't too much clutter! They have one side bright & other side dark, & the counter tops are all white (makes me cautious of how I eat so I don't look like a SLOB ahahahaaa) \n\nOur server \"O\" (that's his name) was freaken AWESOME so calm & professional yet very friendly & approachable... he made me a little jealous as being a server myself made me admire the way he carried himself. He informed us of what they were about & all the steps of the process... we wanted but he whole experience even though we know everything about shabu after trying so many different places in Cali.\n\nSAMURAI YOJIE'S CUT $20.99 - Hubby got this w\/tonkatsu base which is $2.99 more but that DAMN soup base is freaken DERICIOUS!!!!! You just can't stop slurping up the soup. Samurai size is 7 oz. of meat.\n\nGEISHA PORK BELLY (side)$5.99 - I guess if you add a side it's cheaper as we are fatties we wanted more variety & got a side of thinly sliced pork belly that complimented the tonkatsu soup base so well! the geisha is 5 oz. of meat.\n\nSUMO YOJIE'S CUT $23.99 - I eat more than the bois & got the SUMO size which is 10 oz. of meat which is nice that they also state how many oz. everything is so you know how much to expect. This cut although I dunno what exactly it is... it's dericious... ahahaha \n\nSAMURAI PRIME RIB $24.99 - roomie got this & it was good as well... but IMHO I can't really taste the difference when it is shabu... but.. definitely wanna try the wagyu one day which I am SURE you could taste the difference.\n\nGTWC STRAWBERRY & BANANA $6.99 - This was a dessert fondue. umm... I really hated that I had to share... but I at least got to eat\/ drink\/ slurp down the rest of the Green Tea White Chocolate fondue sauce. =] w\/ the help of O I was able to stay classy as he brought me a little spoon to devour the sauce in class. \n\nICE COFFEE $3.99 - chilled & served w\/ cream & simple syrup on the side.\nCALPICO $3.99 - served w\/ a cherry which makes it fun \nCHERRY BLOSSOM TEA $3.99 - this was served in the newest technology for tea brewing which I have seen a lot at teavanna where you stick the bottom of the pot to the top of the cup.\n\nI WILL BE BACK TOO MANY TIMES IN THE FUTURE I KNOW IT...
