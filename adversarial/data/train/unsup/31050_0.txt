My husband was in a car accident on 4\/14\/2014, and we went through Enterprise located in downtown Pittsburgh to receive a rental. We opted to have an Enterprise employee pick us up from our home, and was abhorred by his rudeness. My husband and I thought we were being secretively filmed for some tv show that highlights how people react and respond when placed in a dismal and calamitous situation. I would think that Enterprise prides itself on customer service, and I'm not only appalled but disheartened that Enterprise would employee such a character. I will never spend my money utilizing your company's service...and I will be sure to inform my family members, friends, and colleagues to do the same!
