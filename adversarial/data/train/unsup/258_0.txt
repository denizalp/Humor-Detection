This place is new and the grand opening isn't until March. It is up and running and operating at full steam. The staff is all friendly and helpful. What's more is unlike most retailers nowadays where help is hard to find without issuing a SOS, help is everywhere here. It seemed like every checkout was open, so everything moved fast despite the full parking lot and store busy full of customers.   I was amazed that they weren't having more growing pains that are usually quite visible at a new store.\n\nSomeone told me that the deli and bakery here was awesome so I came to pickup some bread. Boy was I in for a treat. The bakery was fully stocked with all kinds of delicious sounding and looking artisan breads. All were available for sampling!!!! Yum! Carbaholics beware. Danger here! \n\nI love sour dough and miss proper sourness and their sourdough is awesome. \n\nThe deli is well stocked with meats and endless cheeses. \n\nI will be back and will review more, meanwhile pass the butter while I enjoy this bread I bought.
