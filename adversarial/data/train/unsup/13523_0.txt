I wish First Watch would proliferate all over this great land like Starbucks, Dennys, Waffle House and IHOP. Soooooo delicious.  Freshly made everything, some organic, some veggie, free range eggs,  First Watch is breakfast nirvana.    I sauntered here one morning just to see the deal.  I sat down.  My respectful and friendly waitperson looked at me and figured out the deal, yeah, \"He wants breakfast, coffee, a nicely made juice drink and off he'll go to work,\"  And that I did.\n\n\n\nThe Nicely Made Juice Drink:  I asked what her favorite drink was and she said a combo of  just-pressed kale, carrots and ginger drink.  She figured out I wanted that, so I got it. Deeeeeelish..... my veggies for the morning zapped with a ginger jolt.\n\nThe Breakfast:\n\nI asked her what the deal is with the smoked salmon Benedict and she said it's one of the popular dishes here.  She figured out I wanted something not so meaty but substantial.  I relished the freshness of this plate and when I cut into the egg and it sauced the rest of my plate, I reached nirvana.  Lovely breakfast, simple, fresh, high protein. Finito. \n\nThe Coffee:  Was better than standard served with half n half,   fake creamers for the hazelnut flavor lovers, and  simple syrup, take your pick.  She figured out that I wanted a togo cup.  Nice.\n\nHappy and content, off  to work he went,  with a bit of a gait,  she predicted.  \n\nI was happy all morning. Really. \n\nService:   Telepathic\n\n\nVisits:  2\n\nTip:  Super popular...... OK packed after 9am, lines and waits.   Open till about 3pm.  If you're staying at the Courtyard Marriott Phoenix North, First Watch is litrelly next door.
