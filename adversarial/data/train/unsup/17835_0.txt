What a gem in the desert!  We went there to try the World Famous Coffee Cup Cafe Nov 10th and quickly became a fan of the town after walking around the main drag and surrounding areas for about an hour.\n\nBeautifully maintained homes and streets.  Quaint small-town atmosphere, friendly people.  Being Mexican, one of the 1st things I noticed was that 99.8% of the people we saw, who were residents, were Caucasian.   I could retire there but if the town goes into the shitter I know whose door they'll be knocking on to blame for it....moi!  I'm sure the heat of summer is a drag though :*(\n\nAnyway, if you're in Vegas for more than a couple of days....get yourself out to Boulder City and enjoy the town.  It is near Hoover Dam too.  \n\nI'm glad I found another great 1\/2 day trip when I travel to Vegas in addition to Valley of Fire, Red Rock and Lake Mead.
