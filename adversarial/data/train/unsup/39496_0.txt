Holy cow! Beatles' LOVE Cirque show is hands down the best show I've seen! Visually breath-taking, stylistically surreal, beautifully choreographed and designed, powerful symbols and theme, etc. Haha couldn't help but sing along to the Beatles songs I did know lol. Love it and highly recommend it. 5 out of 5 stars easy!
