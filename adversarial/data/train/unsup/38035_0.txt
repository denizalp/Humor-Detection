New Korean spot in my neighbour.  Never tried their BBQ b4 but had ordered their spicy pork before.  Came here this afternoon to try their stew dish.  The restaurant seemed quite empty with Bloor BIA outside.  Tried their pork bone soup for a start.  To be honest, I felt they made their dish quite different from other places in Korean town, so people probably would hate it or love it.  I had the same feeling when I first had their spicy pork.  As the pork tasted quite dry unlike other places.  Side dish was kinda bland especially kimchi.  Main dish itself also didn't impress at all.  I didn't taste any spiciness at all from pork bone soup.  Won't say I hate it, but I don't like it either.  The environment looks chic and clean as restaurant is practically empty.  I thought complementary ice cream would be given if paid by cash but I guess no more.  Also lunch special was $7.95 as written outside but I guess that was only for weekdays, as I was charged full price.  Service is fine.\nOverall I don't think I will try their stew or grill items again but BBQ maybe if my fiends want to try it.
