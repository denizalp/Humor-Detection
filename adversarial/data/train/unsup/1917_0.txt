This is MY hike.  \n\nI like it because it's not packed with people, making it easy to pick your pace and not worry about having to navigate crowds.  Also, an added bonus is less people = less people littering and leaving their dog's shit everywhere.  Sadly, trash and dog crap abound at many of the Valley's trails, but it's fairly under check here.\n\nI take Holbert to the Dobbins Lookout, then go back down and rejoin Holbert to the end, and then take it all the way back down.  FYI: at Dobbins Lookout there are toilets (technically) but they are not plumbed and as such, the stench will keep you away.  I do wish something could be done about that...
