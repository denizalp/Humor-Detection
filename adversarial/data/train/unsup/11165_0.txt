It was boba. \n\nThe shop itself is bare, with a lot of varied chairs lining the walls and no real tables to speak of. It looks like a waiting room of sorts -- completely uninviting.\n\nI wanted the green honey milk tea, but was told that it wasn't really honey. Instead, it's some sort of caramel concoction.  Then why call it honey? The whole thing sounded weird, so I reverted to a simple jasmine milk tea with boba. \n\nThe drink wasn't anything special. It was less sweet than most places nowadays, which can either be a good or bad thing, depending on how you like your milk tea. The boba was soft but flavorless. I wish that it had a little sweetness to it. \n\nI mean, if you're super craving boba, then it's okay. But if you're looking for something to blow your mind, this isn't it.
