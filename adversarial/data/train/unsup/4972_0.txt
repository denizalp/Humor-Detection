Add me to the disappointed by Optical Experts list. And I'm also not happy that many of their reviews aren't showing up. People should be warned about this business. \n\nLike others, I purchased the $39 groupon deal which included an eye exam, frames, and lenses. Because I know my prescription is both heavy Rx and requires a progressive lens, I called to verify what would be included, and how much the extras would be. \n\nSo I walked in knowing my extras would total less than $200. \n\nI got a quick but thorough exam without dilation. I refused that service because my ophthalmologist does it for me. \n\nWhen it came time to choose frames, a technician seated me and insisted on bringing frames to me. She was a sweet older lady but it quickly became clear that her taste and mine were not in sync. I used words like hip, chic, funky and modern, but she brought boring, blah and grandma. \n\nBecause the deal I purchased required I purchase everything that day, I eventually settled on a frame (which I hate) and went for the necessary upgrades. However, the cost for the lenses and anti glare was more than twice what I had been quoted. I desperately needed new glasses, so I went forward after she explained that I misunderstood the deal. \n\nNo, I didn't. I had notes. \n\nWhen I picked up my glasses a couple weeks later, I was astounded at how heavy they felt. Yes, the lenses were about the same thickness as my older glasses, but the weight makes them truly unpleasant to wear. My vision with them is fine, but I hate how frumpy they make me look. \n\nI had to argue a bit to get a copy of my prescription. \n\nGiven my disappointment, I would never go back to Optical Experts. Quality eye care isn't cheap, and anyone purchasing a deal needs to realize they're not going to get a bargain here.
