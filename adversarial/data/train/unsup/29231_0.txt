Bagel Plus is the one of the most sanitary bakery I been in the area. \n\nAll the bagels are inside a glass cabinet, all neatly labelled. You can see exactly what they have for the day but if you want to buy any, the staff have to pack that for you.\n\nThe trade off is you cannot really cross examine what you are getting. Especially the sweet and pastries they are all kind of hidden behind some waxed paper.\n\nMost of the baked sweets are sold by weight... and they do have brownies and butter tarts too!\n\nMore than half of the store space is dedicated to a sit down cafe. You can get bagels in all style, eggs in different style and salad and other light meals.
