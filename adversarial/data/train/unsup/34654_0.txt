I feel like consistency is the biggest issue when it comes to a nail salon, so I'll reserve full judgement until I've been 2- 3 more times or I find something else in the area that really blows me away.\n\nBased on my first impression...perfectly adequate.  The work stations and equipment are clean, the prices are reasonable.  I had a very nice pedicure in a comfortable chair and a good gel manicure.  I felt like she had very good attention to detail with my gel manicure.  Of course we'll have to see how long it lasts.\n\nThe salon itself could use some attention.  Like I said - the work stations are clean, but the faux plants are dusty and there is stuff just stashed randomly in corners that clearly hasn't been touched in ages.  The childs pedicure chair near the nail station I was at had a thick coat of dust on the back.  \n\nI would go back at this point.  I like it better than other places I've tried in the area.
