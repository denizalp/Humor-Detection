By far the best library of the chandler libraries.  Ironwood is nice and cool, but it is not tailored to professionals with their own notebooks - there are very few plugs and they are few and far between - no quiet study rooms - very cramped - and the security just swims around you.  Sunset is very warm inside and small and zero tolerance for even low conversation.  This downtown library has a massive professional study area with hundreds of plug-ins everywhere very cool lots of open area very friendly hosts no security hovering everywhere a nice snack bar - comfortable sitting areas - many study areas just packed with value everywhere you look amazing - can't think of one downside none
