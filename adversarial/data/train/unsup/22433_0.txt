I've stayed at FireSky, The W, Hotel Valley Ho...name it! Hands down, the rooms, and overall resort quality, is the best by far at Talking Stick Resort! \n\nThe rooms have floor to ceiling windows, sheltered by plantation shutters, complemented by extremely high ceilings, transitional furnishings, and perfection with its lighting throughout. The bathroom is large and welcoming, and I love it's contemporary vibe! \n\nFun casino, great restaurants, gorgeous golf course, fabulous pools...amazing choice for your Scottsdale stay!
