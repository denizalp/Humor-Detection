Went there on Monday the 3rd. Food seemed to take longer for take out customers. Salsa\/vegetable bar was empty. When asked to refill, girl told me to use cups provided which shows me she wasn't listening. \n\nI could overlook all this if the food was good. Seasoning was nonexistent. The shrimp tasted like nothing. I'm super disappointed and will not be back.
