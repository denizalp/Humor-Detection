Come here and always get great service.  Henry and his team are very dedicated to there jobs and always treat us like family.  My wife was in a depressed mode from being pregnant and needed some cheering up.  Best way to do this is to bring them to a nail salon for mani and pedi's.  They have plenty of staff and many booths available for a busy weekend.  Also gave us water while we waited for the women to finish.  Highly recommend, you won't be disappointed.
