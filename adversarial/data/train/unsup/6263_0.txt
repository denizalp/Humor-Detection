My mom was craving this place since we first went there in November, and we were so excited to come back. The place is pretty busy. The mozzarella is a MUST if you go here!!! We got the kind with prosciutto, which I think is the best. We also got a stuffed meatball and the charity bread. Meatball was great, and we liked the idea behind the charity bread, but the bread was too oily. \nI got shrimp spaghetti for my entree, which was great--the shrimps were small and bite-sized. Service was friendly (maybe that's just the norm in Canada) and timely. Excited to come back here this fall!
