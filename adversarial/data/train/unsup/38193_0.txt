been here so many times now!  mostly for late beers.  their beer is amazing.  love how they have guest beers as well...always appreciate the great lakes here.  we had the flights and have had pints.  favourite beers so far are the love triangle ipa and the instigator.  barnyard and cockpuncher are pretty awesome too.  the place gets packed for dinners and nights on fridays\/saturdays...it tends to get quite loud.  we love the fried chicken - can't remember when the last time i had such an amazing piece of crispy-on-the-outside-juicy-on-the-inside chicken.  we were also blown away by the chicken wings - maple licorice!  the duck pizza was okay...may be it was an off pizza day..ours was a bit dry that night.  the dessert we got the trio - pot de creme, brownie, and toffee pudding...YUM YUM YUM!  definitely not a weekly place for dinner because i would probably do a repeat of the fried chicken, wings, and the trio dessert!   this is our go-to place for beers!  they also have a take-out area...you can get growlers here and other swag.
