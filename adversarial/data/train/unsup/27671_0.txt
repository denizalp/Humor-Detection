I have called 4 times this morning for an eye exam appointment. A message gives their hours open 9 to whatever yet the message says they are not open.  I called from 9:30  until 11:30.Leave a message and will get back to you tomorrow. Lol  Not me I am not waiting in all day for  return call.  Guess you don't need my business!
