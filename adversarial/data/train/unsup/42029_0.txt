I was nearly a Chipotle addict, but I can honestly say I haven't eaten there since Cafe Rio opened--it's just too good.\n\nThe salads are by far the best thing on the menu, and the barbacoa is so sweet and juicy that it makes all the healthy stuff seem super tasty. I decided to get adventurous once and order their tres leches cake and wasn't impressed, but the food off the line has never disappointed.\n\nBe careful going during peak lunch hours, this place fills up with students and staff from the university and the line can get pretty long.
