Sooo good! Highly recommend this place ! The staff were very nice and genuine. The atmosphere is very clean and very lively. The fish tacos were my favorite! Also, try the home made drinks , they are very refreshing. I only had the chance to try the Tamarindo, it was sweet and tasted like ice tea. And I didn't find the tacos on their own spicy, but you can add the hot sauce to them if you do like spicy! Overall very good and will be coming back!
