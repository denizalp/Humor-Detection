I've been going to Envy Nails for pedicures and manicures for over a year now.  They are always respectful, hygienic, and being in the salon is an enjoyable experience.  Their nail art skills are fantastic and the prices are very reasonable.  Plus they don't do a lot of acrylics so the salon smells great.  I've been there when it was busy with 5 people waiting (walk ins) and when I had the place to myself (5 inches of snow falling).  Both were comfortable experiences!  They do a really nice foot and leg massage and the massage chairs are wonderful.  I highly recommend Envy Nails and brought my whole wedding party here too.  \nThey now have a printed menu with prices and I've never had them use an off brand polish as some reviewers have.
