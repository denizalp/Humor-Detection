My fellow Mexican brothers and sisters are going to lynch me, decapitate me and hang my head on a corner of a grain storage building in Guanajuato (look it up), but I actually really like Taco Bell. I remember a long time ago, when Taco Bell \"threatened\" to open stores in Mexico all the Mexican-American were up in arms about it. But most of us Mexicans were like, \"hell yeah!\" best munchies ever!\n\nAnyway, this Taco Bell is very clean and the staff is uncharacteristically friendly. I really liked the way the cashier treated me when placing my order and offering items that complemented my order. At the end, he offered me his name and to let him know if I needed anything... Thiking back now, he might have been hitting on me. Less than 5 minutes later, another guy called my order number and not only did he wait there until I picked up my order, he thanked me for visiting and told me to come back to visit them soon. He did this to the other three customers behind me as well. That is the type of service you don't get in fast food anymore. That's why this Taco Bell gets 3 stars instead of the default 2 I give to fast food places just for opening their doors.\n\n No point in discussing the food, it's mass processed and it tastes the same no matter which taco bell you go to.
