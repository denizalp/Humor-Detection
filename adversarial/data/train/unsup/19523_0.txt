Pretty cool decoration with the wheel and the chair - HIDDEN GEM\n\nEver since http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/portola-coffee-lab-costa-mesa\n\nThe boyfriend and I wanted to see if there's more of these kind of coffee lab. Yay! Found one in Arizona! Glad we found one near where he lives, because I didn't want to drive any further than 20 mins plus to get some good coffee. \n\nCame here in the afternoon on a Saturday, and man were there a lot of people just studying. \n\nDrinks\n+Iced Toddy ($3.95) - The boyfriend got this and holy cow was it strong. A very concentrated coffee. It's like drinking a americano at Starbucks but without mixing it with water. But of course this place was a bit better because it's different \n\n+ Iced Chai with Soy milk ($4.85) - Yums! You can adjust the sweetness of it, but I forgot to do so so it was a bit too sweet for me.\n\nDecoration\n\nFeels like you're sitting in a warehouse. Bike wheels are attached with each other like a barrier\/wall between two sides. Haha.. I laughed when I saw the hair salon chair. Pretty cool. \n\nChilled place to hang out and to study. Definitely will come back!
