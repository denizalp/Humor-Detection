After a horrible double helix experience with another pierce shop, I decided that I would do an intense search for a new piercer to get my industrial and my rook done. A year later, I am SO happy I found Ironhorse. \n\nThe second my husband and I walked in, we were immediately greeted by Brandon -- smile and handshake. He was knowledgable of both piercings and had the details for me without hesitation. He even took the time to check out the layout of my ears - I've never had a piercer do that before. That was impressive. He even suggested a variety of jewelry that, to be honest, I had no idea about. (Again, I had a year of research behind me, so that too was impressive). Also, my husband is one to judge shops on how clean and tidy it is... So if my husband flat out says \"this is the cleanest shop I've seen. I'm impressed.\" -- that is saying something seriously!\n\nWhen it was time to be pierced, Brandon had the needles and jewelry out in plain sight. The whole time I was laying down, Brandon was calming and reassuring -- he was even throwing out more random knowledge about my piercings!  I will say these two piercings were the most painful so far, but with Brandon's reassurance, the piercings weren't horrible. \n\nAfter the piercing, he gave me a run down on how the aftercare. Again the advice he gave was phenomenal. And almost a week later, my piercings are healing just fine! Aside from having to sleep on my back because I was the dummy to get both ears pierced at one! \n\nMy overall experience here with Ironhorse was incredible. I highly suggest this shop to anyone - friends and strangers. I will definitely be returning for my next piercing! Thank you so, so much Brandon! You're amaze-balls!
