I can't give anything below this rating or I would have give zero rating.\nWe ordered couple of biryani's to go from here and one of the chicken biryani when opened was smelling rotten. I am sure it was a day or 2 days old.\nWhen we went back to the store and showed what we got..., we were shocked by the response from the owner.\nHe smelled it and then took a sample of it, got to the kitchen , heated it ...got back to us and asked us to smell it.\nHe thinks by heating the rotten meat it's going to get better....he finally returned our money after arguing a lot ... And then starts to talk as if  he made us a favor and kept shouting at us. Never going to order from here again.
