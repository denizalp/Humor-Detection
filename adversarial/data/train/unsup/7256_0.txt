I was really happy with this company and their work.  Ron was my tech, and the work was done very well.  The bill was very reasonable, just like Violet quoted me over the phone.  Friendly customer service too.\n\nI would use this locksmith service again.\n\nPS: I think Yelp's representation of this company is misleading.  Only one review is shown, and unfortunately it happens to be a bad review for the company.  However there are 24 very good to excellent reviews on the \"Filtered Pages\",\n\nI chose this company because I read the reviews on the Filtered Pages.  Plus the company has a top rating with the BBB.  So you can't please everyone, Yelp, so please better represent this company who employs our neighbors in this trying economy.  Also, instead of showing \"1 review\", put 25 reviews; otherwise, Yelp, you're not making any sense.\n\nSo as I submit this review, I wonder if Yelp will put my review on the Filtered Page.... hmmm.\n\n10\/19\/2011:  Yep, this review has gone to the Filtered Pages.  Yelp, was it something I said?  LOL.
