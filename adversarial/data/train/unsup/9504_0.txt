I was going to hit up the Rio World Carnival Buffet but decided to venture out a bit. Ok, so I spent way too much money in Vegas already so my purse strings started to tighten up a bit. You can't beat $6.99...well you can at $5.99, but I couldn't find a place for that price so here I went. Nanay Gloria's is a total hole-in-the-wall kind of joint. When you're eating you feel like you were at a relatives house. \n\nThe food was good. Extremely greasy, but good. I've always considered Filipino food to be the Mexican food of Asia. Greasy and always makes you want to take a nap afterward. There were many dishes I've never had before, but luckily I had a couple of my good friends who are Filipino help me out in describing to me what I was eating. \n\nWith each crispy-fatty bite I felt my taste buds heightened to a new level. The food was actually good! The lechon had crack sprinkled on top which is the reason I couldn't stop eating it. I tried not to fill up on too much rice so I could try everything else. There were 2 different types of curries. I'm sorry I don't know the proper names, but one was pork and the other beef. Both well seasoned and tasty.\n\nThe healthiest thing I consumed while during my Filipino cuisine were probably the 2 cans of Coke. $1 for each can I may add. So my buffet meal came out to under $10. Not bad right? Would I come here again? Sure I would, but first I'd have to have an angioplasty to clean out my arteries from the first time I came.\n\nNanay Gloria should really consider expanding this place just because it was a little too crowded at times with all the people coming in for take-out orders as well. I said so many \"excuse me's\" that the phrase lost all meaning!
