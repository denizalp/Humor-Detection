First things first the quad fires are amazing! Mac and cheese burger and pulled pork sandwich equally as good! Friendly staff and bartenders. Very busy restaurant but if you can grab a seat at the bar you're in and out in no time. The restaurant plays great music and is an overall casual chill place. Definitely will return next time I'm in Vegas!
