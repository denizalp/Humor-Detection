I CAN'T FEEL MY TONGUE.\n\nI didn't know that jerk chicken translated to spice with a little chicken on the side.  I admit that I have sensitive taste buds when it comes to spicy food, but this stuff was way off my spicy-food odometer.  I would say it was flavorful, but my tastebuds were so numb after the chicken, I couldn't tell.\n\nHowever, I did enjoy everything else!  The bread that comes with your meal is a \"festival\" on the menu, but it's darn good... and perhaps the thing to save you should the jerk chicken be too much.  I ordered the shrimps on the side of my jerk chicken, but I think I just got trigger happy.  One dish and and appetizer is already plenty, so if the waitress suggests a side of shrimp, I say pass.\n\nDefinitely get the plaintain avocado spring rolls.  Interesting texture and taste, plus the mango salsa on the side is quite refreshing.  Speaking of refreshing, I highly recommend the Sorrel to drink.  It's a hibiscus tea and rum blend, but you can't even taste the rum!  Mmm, perfect way to beat the Phoenix heat.\n\nCute little restaurant with brightly colored walls, which is a welcome change from the red, brown and tan buildings outside.  I came here while I was on a business trip, and it's walking distance from all the Downtown hotels!  I wish I had room for dessert, but I was stuffed.
