I was really excited to check out the latest lunch\/dinner place downtown.  The atmosphere is awesome and I love the outdoor seating- A+.  The food was A-ok (B-\/C+).  We came during lunch and I had the turkey sloppy joe with a roasted poblano pepper.  The pepper was a nice touch of kick to the sandwich but the sloppy joe meat itself was just okay.  My husband had the Bolegnese, which he said the sauce was really good.  My kids had the fish & chips plus the chicken strips.  Unfortunately the chicken strips were placed in the same beer batter as the fish and fried.  My normally adventurous - eat anything 6 year old took one bite and said \"yuck\".  I will give the restaurant another try and hope that 2nd try gives me food that is a \"wow.\"
