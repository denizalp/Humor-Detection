Stranded in Charlotte waiting for our group to arrive at the airport, we contacted a friend to get a recommendation for a good vegan restaurant in the Charlotte area.  They suggested Fern, and boy, we're glad they did.\n\nMy wife and I travel extensively, we're vegetarian, and we have sampled many vegan or vegetarian restaurants all over this country, and Fern is without a doubt one of the best.  Wonderful use of spices, and great presentation.  Go there . . . vegan or vegetarian for sure, but even if you're not, and you like wonderfully crafted food, you'll love Fern.
