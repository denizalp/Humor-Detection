I went here for lunch and had the Cali burrito. It was really good. The steak inside of it wasn't my fav so I'll try it with chicken next time. Ask for the carrier of sauces. They are really good. The house salad dressing was too sweet\/they put too much of it on the salad. I didn't like the fresh margarita with cucumber, a bit too sweet.
