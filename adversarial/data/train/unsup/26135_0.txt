Having just come from the Minnesota State Fair, I thought it would be nice to host a party of fellow Minnesotans.  I hired The Corndog Company food truck to provide corndogs and cheese sticks.  I thought that there would be no way these could compare to the State Fair's corndogs.  Was I WRONG!!  These were so much BETTER!!!!  Our 30+ guests agreed that the Corndog Company's corndogs were crisp and tasty.  Even the neighbors came by and later thanked us. The service was beyond terrific and the prices were (don't tell them) way to low.  5 stars plus several more.  My only regret is that they can't come back next week so I can have more.\nHire this food truck!!
