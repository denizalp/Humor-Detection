It's true, the best food are from places you would least expect. As with others, I was looking for something new in the area. This is a standard plaza off Eglinton here in Scarborough and you'd probably never find this unless looking for it. It's a small Jamaican grocery store that sources many products back from the islands. They have a counter at the front with some of the fried dishes on display. Menu is on the wall behind the counter. Pretty standard fare here.\n\nI ordered the large goat curry with rice and peas and 1\/2 lb of jerk chicken (1  whole chicken quarter. Am I glad I found this place, the goat was amazing, piping hot, thick and rich with flavour. Got was tender and the best bits are in the bones! Not much spice but I'm sure you can ask them to add if that's you thing. Rice and peas were on point and amazing smothered in the curry. The meal also comes with some fried plantain. The jerk chicken was also very good with tons of flavour but again not much spice to it.\n\nThis will be my new Jamaican joint in Scarborough and I will be back soon! Gotta try the salt fish fritters next time.
