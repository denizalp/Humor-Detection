I walked up to the place and weeds were growing around the door. Chewing gum stuck to the concrete all around the door. Kids were running all over the place screaming. I was shown to a table and underneath the table was dirt and dropped food like they hadn't mopped in a week. I turned around and walked out.\nAs I was walking in I asked someone walking out if it was good and they said yeah but I don't risk eating at a disgusting Chinese buffet.
