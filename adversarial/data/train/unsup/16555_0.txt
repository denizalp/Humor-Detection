Central location in downtown Phoenix. This location is in the strip mall next to Starbucks. Great daily lunch specials that are affordable. This location is great about serving you hot and fresh food. Out of all the Thai Basil's this one is not my favorite. The quality of service and taste of food is not good as the others. The last visit I had earlier this week was during lunch. The restaurant had plenty of tables open as we beat the rush lunch crowd but that did not slow down our server. She was not the friendliest wait staff. She seemed a little frazzled and had no smile. My order did not come our right however, I decided to try my best to enjoy it. My chicken was dry, the sauce was scarce and I do not believe I got the order I asked for. My friends order came out perfect. I asked for extra sauce and the server told me she would have to bring my plate back and they would remake me a new one. I did not want the trouble so I settled. We paid our tab with no thank you for coming in. I honestly think if they stepped the service they could win me over. I am in no rush to return here anytime soon.
