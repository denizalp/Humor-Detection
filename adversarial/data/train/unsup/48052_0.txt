I had no idea what the Keg was when I moved to Toronto. They don't have them in the U.S., but boy would they love the Keg there! I don't go often, and usually when I do, it's with colleagues and clients, but everytime I go, I enjoy it.\n\nThis Keg has it down. They are always rammed, but they get you through unscathed, and in fact, better than that: they get you through with lots of libations, flavourful thick steaks, and a lighter wallet. It's not cheap, but you get what you pay for. I really think they do a great job with a hectic crowd. Even for extra-large groups, they get it right here. I have never ever had a bad steak or a bad morsel of any food at this Keg.\n\nDo NOT go if you are looking for a quiet night. I mentioned earlier, this place gets rammed. And other reviewers have said it before: lots of suits. This is a place to go with some colleagues for drinks - it's a party in here. A party with lots of good cuts of beef. My kind of party!
