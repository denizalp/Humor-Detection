The worst delivery company in all the land. How can a delivery company screw up delivering packages so badly? I recently had a package marked \"delivered\" and the time stamp was when I was home, anxiously awaiting my package. Following up with customer service was no help (they seem to just copy\/paste generic messages and simply ask you to contact the seller for a refund). Perhaps the drivers are stealing the packages forcing the customers to report their goods missing? I live in a gated community and know for certain none of my neighbors would steal my package. I would never use this company by choice. It is a shame Amazon uses them.
