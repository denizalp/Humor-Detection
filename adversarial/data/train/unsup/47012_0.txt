Looovee the Venetian. While it's one of the more expensive places to stay on the strip, it is SO worth it. Especially if you have a big group of people. You can EASILY fit over 10 people in one of their Bella suites. And there's enough TV's to keep the boys happy watching their sports and girls with their chick flicks and reality TV while recuperating after a night out of partying.\n\nRecently discovered the food court closer to the parking garage (not the one by the casino). That place is ahmazing! Extremely helpful if you're on a budget, like most people in their early 20's who are in Vegas for a crazy weekend. Finding a table big enough for a large group of people is a bit hard, cause it can get pretty crowded. That's when you get everything to-go and bring it back up to your room :)
