New tattoo shop at first markham place, everyone! That's something you don't see a lot, right in the heart of markham.. \nThe store itself has a nice banner and it's a clean, brightly lit shop. Right when you walk in, you can tell it's sanitary. There's also a lot of space so it's not all squished together. \n\nMy friend got a piece done here, and it looks absolutely beautiful with perfect detail and symmetrical lines all around. The artist who opened this shop, Shark, originated from the pacific mall tattoo store, Phat Buddha. He's SO talented, with a natural talent for asian art, realism and colour pieces. We call him the 'friendly giant' because he's got a really gentle hand and your tattoo won't hurt at all when you're with him. He's also one of the most smiley tattoo artists I've ever met and if it's your first tattoo, he'll definitely make you feel better. He did my boyfriend's mom's first tat and he made it very comfortable for her and she didn't end up feeling much. It turned out beautiful!\n\nOverall, very good for a first shop! Hope to stop by to get a piece from him some day in the near future. Gaaaahh, can't wait.
