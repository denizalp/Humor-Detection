Some may take this review as a bit harsh but I just think this visit is our last and it is really due to a few reasons that will likely not be fixed. The place was busy, wait was long and we still put our name in. Two seats opened at the bar, we grabbed them. The bar top was filthy, I mean like syrup, and crumbs, dirty napkins and was never cleaned. I made it beyond clear it needed to be cleaned, my boyfriend ended up taking an ice cube out of his drink and sopping up the mess with that and a dirty napkin left behind... unacceptable. The bartender was swamped with bottomless mimosas ordered every two seconds. My bacon bloody was underwhelming and the bartender said \"bacon is so fresh and hot, right out of the kitchen\" it was indeed not. It was sitting out in the open on a cold plate and was cold and had been there since they opened the doors two hours plus earlier which is fine, had I not been lied too. We had to ask for napkins for our appetizer and dish, we had to ask for silverware for my boyfriend's main dish ( he got a biscuit breakfast sandwich, it was decent), my better 2\/3's finally just pulled out his card and handed it over so we could leave since no bill was ever presented as we sat there with empty drinks and no food. The open, loud, unorganized atmosphere and poor service (though friendly) did not even out the corn fritters and breakfast sandwich as something, even though good, Worth ever coming back for. Too many other options in life. Next....
