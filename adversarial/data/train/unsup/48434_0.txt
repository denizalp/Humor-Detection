We went to have breakfast as part of my birthday festivities for the day. The room is nice and the food was fabulous. I had the confit chicken hash and my wife had the huevos rancheros. Both dishes had nice flavor and beautiful presentation. Their signature juice which is a combination of orange, carrot and ginger was wonderful. As much as we enjoyed our food the highlight was our server Amanda. I would strongly urge asking for her if you go. She was the best part of very nice dining experience.
