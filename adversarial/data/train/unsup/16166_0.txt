Spicy Asiago chicken pasty. That is where it ends. Absolutely delicious! This place has a good beer selection and offers these things known as pasties (the a is not long... It is not pronounced like those stickers you put on your nips... Thanks for the clarification, bearded bartender). You can watch them make the pasties when you sit at the bar. The bread crust is flaky and is stuffed with the pasty of your choosing (get the Asiago chicken!!). It comes with a side of salsa and sour cream. They have plenty of vegetarian options too if you're into that. My boyfriend enjoys the Pilgrim usually. The interior is dark and it was kinda difficult to find the entrance LOL. Pretty hipster joint and the food is top notch. I don't think you can possibly be disappointed.
