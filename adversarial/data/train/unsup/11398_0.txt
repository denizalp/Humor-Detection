NOTE: the owner's comment below is dishonest and misleading. \nCarolina Fish & Food Market is who took my money (via PayPal), who promised me a refund, and who then refused to give it. This review is for the correct company!\n\nThis company is SO dishonest that they go out of their way to block bad reviews and to refuse to deal with anyone who complains, even in a polite and respectful way. \nWhen we were unhappy with a purchase from Carolina Fish & Food Market, they very kindly offered us a refund initially. Their employee asked us to write down our name, email, phone number, and order number - and said to be sure to write the order # down so we could get the proper refund. She even checked with her supervisor to make sure that's all the info they needed to process the refund. She said it would happen directly though Paypal since that is where I made the purchase.\nImagine my surprise when not only did I not receive my Paypal refund automatically, but the company CHANGED THEIR MIND and decided not to offer any refunds. I flied a claim with Paypal but the company LIED and said that my purchase was a \"shipment\" and Paypal says they provided \"tracking information that proves that I received my shipment.\" Of course I did not order anything to be shipped, so they flat-out lied to Paypal. I cannot believe this kind of fraudulent activity. To lie to their customers and to Paypal. I'm out $85. \nWhen I tried to write a review on this previously, they blocked my review through Yelp even though it's 100% the truth.\nPlease do not give a dishonest and untrustworthy company like this your business.
