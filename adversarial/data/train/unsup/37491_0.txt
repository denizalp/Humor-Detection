Just got my teeth whitened and couldn't be happier!!! My teeth are naturally really sensitive, I've tried professional whitening in the past but the pain was so excruciating I was very reluctant to whiten them again. When I heard about True Teeth Whitening I had to give it a shot and so happy I did. My teeth got significantly whiter and NO PAIN! It's affordable, the staff is very knowledgeable and professional, the place is comfortable and super clean. I definitely recommend this place and will be returning when it's time to whiten my teeth again. \nHappy Customer
