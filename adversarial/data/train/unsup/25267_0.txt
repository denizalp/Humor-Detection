Such a cool and interesting concept, especially amongst a sea of same-y bars. As soon as you step through the black curtain it's like you're transported somewhere tropical, where the bitter winter winds can't catch you. The attention to detail is something I really appreciated, from what the staff were wearing to the fog machine emitting clouds of smoke when someone ordered one of the bowls! I went with a few friends and we decided to get one of the bowls and much to our surprise it was really strong! This was great considering drinks are usually watered down with more parts ice. However, this one was not! Feeling ambitious after conquering the bowl I ordered the Hurricane. It was such a good drink! As an appetizer our party decided to try the PuPu Platter which lets you sample any 6 appetizers from the menu! This was such a good choice because we got to try a bit of everything. My favourites from the 6 were the chicken satay and teriyaki broccoli. For my main I ordered the burger which came with a pineapple slice inside. Initially I was unsure about how the flavour profiles would work with one another but after taking a bite it was like heaven!!! My burger was absolutely amazing and I'll definitely be adding that Hawaiian touch next time I make my own! Overall this place isn't just gimmicky with its decor and vibe, but it has the food chops to match. I'm thinking of having my birthday dinner here since you get the best of both worlds with food and drink!! Can't wait to come back again!
