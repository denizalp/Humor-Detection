Oh gosh...I haven't had Chinese food in a while so I ordered it. I got chow mein and chow fun.... holy crap, it was bad. The noodles were gross, they were gooey and sticky, the taste was so off, I ended up throwing all my food away, besides 2 spring rolls that were halfway edible.\n\nPeople that enjoyed this food are probably people that love TV Dinners, but if you have some self respect you'll stay away.
