\"I can't believe I drank that much...if I see another Captain 'n Coke I'm going to puke.\" \"I'm never drinking again.\"  Sound familiar?  Well, that's what we were telling ourselves when we were looking around for a place to grab brunch.  I remember coming across Mon Ami Gabi when I looked at Yelp reviews, so my coworker and I decided to check out the menu and look inside.  \n\nAs we walked into the main part of the restaurant, we were blown away by a HUGE bloody mary bar.  Both of us looked at each other with our mouths hanging open.  I'm not sure if it was because I was still drunk...but the bloody mary bar had a glowing aura around it.   It was a sign.  We were meant to drink more here.  I'm still convinced that bloody marys are a panacea for hangovers.  Trust me, try it out next time.\n\nAnyway, after we finished staring at the bloody mary bar for 5 minutes, we walked to the back of the restaurant and we fell in love.  There was a beautiful outdoor seating area and the rest of the restaurant had sunlight streaming in.  \n\nThe food was great.  My coworker and I ordered two soups.  I've attached pictures for your reference. ;)  I got a porcini mushroom soup and it was DELICIOUS.  One of the best soups I've ever had.  For lunch, my coworker ordered the salad with grilled salmon and I had the croque madame.  The grilled salmon salad was very tasty.  My croque madame was very good, but I found the bread to be a bit too buttery and crunchy to my liking.  Can you believe it?  I actually said something was TOO buttery.  Butter and bacon...can't live without it. \n\nI will definitely be back for the good food, impeccable service, beautiful atmosphere, and of course, bloody mary heaven.  ;)
