Thank heavens for Yelp, a formal place for snitching! \n\n**IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING SolarCity READ THE LEASE. I POSTED PICTURES OF IT**\n\n-SolarCity puts an UCC-1 Fixture Filling on your home and that might cost you the sale or the refinance. They claim it's not a lien but whatever they want to call the filing it's parsing words to a ridiculous degree. They claim that the UCC1 Fixture Filling is for your \"roof only\". What's on your location? Your home. What's your home holding? Your roof. What's your roof holding? Their system. So, if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck; ITS A DUCK!!! The UCC-1 is a lien on your home. They are mincing words and they are being intellectually dishonest.\n\n-THEY SECRETLY RUN YOUR CREDIT!!! SolarCity does not need your SSN or DOB. They are that sneaky!!!\n\n-That hefty $5000+ government credit... kiss that bad boy goodbye! You're leasing NOT buying and since SolarCity made the purchase, they get to enjoy ALL government credits because they purchased the solar panels for you, therefore you're entitled to NOTHING!!\n\n-$7.50 monthly fee if you do not enroll for automatic payment. \n\n-You must have an internet connection at all times... no exceptions. \n-They claim there's zero taxes. On the lease it states: ESTIMATED taxes. Basically they are saying: for now we won't charge you taxes but that's not a guarantee and it can change any second and you're ok with that. \n\n-$35 APS fee to keep the meter running. APS is planning to increase their prices by 400% to all solar customers. $35 x 4= $140. But is that increase guaranteed? Who knows but I'm not willing to take that risk. Just ask SRP customers how their price increase is going. \n\n-Every year SolarCity increases their prices by 2.8%\n\n-If you don't produce enough solar energy, APS will charge you if you use their energy. \n\n-After the 20 year lease, you can't buy the solar panels. \n\n-If you sell your home, the new owners have the choice to keep the solar panels and take over your lease BUT if the buyers do not want the solar panels, you have to take it with you and pay your new installation. Also, if your new home does not qualify... you're stuck paying a system that you won't be using and on top of that, you have to go back to APS. You'll be paying double to have electricity. You'll be paying APS and SolarCity. \n\n-SolarCity claims that we have up to 10 seconds before they install the equipment to back-out; that's donkey crap because the contract clearly reads that in the state of AZ we only have 3 business days after the date of the signed contract to cancel. \n\nDo your homework BEFORE they come to your house. \n-Ask APS to give you a TWO year electricity report. After Add the 24 months of the electric bill and divide it by 24. That total is how much your average APS monthly bill is. \n-Ask trusted friends or neighbors to show you their SolarCity bill, specially if they have been using it for over 18 months \n-Call your mortgage company and inform them of your plans\n-For new homes, call your roofing contractor and ask if your roof warranty gets voided if panels get installed. \n-Technology changes on a blink of an eye. Are you willing to be stuck with a solar panel that will start losing efficiency in five years? \n-Are you willing to pay for electricity that you're producing?\n-Bottom line... if you lease, you will not be paying for electricity (because you produce it) you'll be paying for solar panels that after 20 years won't be able to keep. \n\nHere is my story. \nWe signed our contract and WITHOUT reading it! Who does that?! Please don't judge us! All I remember the rep saying: \"initial here, here and here and then sign right here\" no explanations nor we asked and the meeting was a wrap. \n\nThe next day I called APS and ask to give me a neutral advice; which in fact APS did. \nI explained that we have a new home with high efficiency appliances, 3 people live in the home. We did the math with our 2 year history my monthly average APS bill is $128.36; with all fees and tax. \nSolarCity quoted me \n$85.57\nplus 7.50 fee\nplus APS fee 35.00\nTotal of $128.07 for the first year\nSolarCity would only be saving me .29 cents... that's a joke!!\nNo thank you... for 29 cents I think I'll keep my brand new roof intact. \n\nThe next morning I had time to read the 23 page lease. I was BLOWN AWAY and decided to cancel our lease. What took me 30 seconds to sign; took the following to void out our lease; 37 different phone calls, transferred me 17 times and waisted a total of 2 hours on the phone but after 2 days of hell and after sending a certified letter with a signed copy of the lease dissolution I was able to get out of the lease. \n\nOk, just because it didn't work out for us it doesn't mean it won't work for you. \n\nPlease, do what your mother says; do your homework and DO NOT SIGN ANY CONTRACTS WITHOUT READING IT!! Don't be this girl!!
