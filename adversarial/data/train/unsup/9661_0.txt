I have had 2 great stays here thus far.  While other hotels are peddling their patrons for even more cash (a la the new parking fees), TI is currently still offering \"free\" parking, although the fine print states that parking is included with the resort fees, which aren't any higher than other hotel resort fees so I consider it free parking.  In-room wifi is also included in the resort fee.  They also include a refrigerator in the room, free of charge (unlike a lot of other hotels, which charge $50\/night or more for an in-room fridge. It's a small fridge which holds maybe 2 medium sized carryout boxes, and a couple of \"normal\" sized bottles of water, so keep that in mind before bringing back a bunch of perishable items that may not fit.\n\nThe young lady who checked us in during my last visit was very nice and personable.  There was a large line, but she never made us feel rushed. She was amazing!\n\nThe standard rooms are decent and comfortable. I like the location of TI, even though it's a nice walk from the south end of the strip. It's close to Fashion Mall and if you're a fan of White Castles it's essentially across the street.  \n\nIf possible, come Sunday-Thursday for the best room rates.  If you must travel on a weekend, check their website before booking through a 3rd party.  I was able to find a nice weekend rate during a 4th of July weekend via the hotel's website.  And if you're staying for multiple nights, remember to tip the hardworking room service\/cleaning staff.  \n\nI don't gamble, so I have no advice to that regard. I've never eaten at any of the restaurants inside the hotel, but there are a few from which you can choose.  There are lots of boutiques and specialty shops, but if you're shopping for souvenirs, I suggest going to one of the souvenir shops on the strip where things are much cheaper. \n\n\nFor my Pokemon Go players, it's worth mentioning that there are quite a few Pokestops inside the hotel, and I found some new Pokemon here.
