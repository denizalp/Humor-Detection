The food here is delicious. SO much food. The poutine is delicious. The chilli is a large serving. The burger is delicious. Everything here is really good. They give free carrots and celery at your table, which is a nice healthy touch. Even though this is a burger bar (which I feel like I have to say because of the name, instead of \"burger joint\"), they seem to be focused on quality. I really like the burgers, poutine and chilli here, they're delicious. Definitely check it out!\n\nThe atmosphere is nice. Not sure what it's like in the evening but I went during the day. Service is friendly and good. A cup was a bit linty and though they were a bit hesitant at first, they replaced my drink, which was nice of them. I wouldn't suggest going for the espresso here, it's not very good (but espresso is a hard thing to get right I find). \n\nStick to the burger, chilli and poutine and skip out on coffee. Solid 4 stars.\n\nUPDATE: I went recently, and though the host was friendly the waitress wasn't as friendly as the server the first time I went (she looked sad actually). Though not warm, the service was fast. They couldn't do my burger medium rare and it was more close to medium well than medium, which is dried out! I will still keep this at 4 stars but I'd hope that next time my burger won't be so dried out. The drink that's half ice tea and half lemonade was pretty good too. They serve a nice little chocolate square at the end, which is a nice touch!
