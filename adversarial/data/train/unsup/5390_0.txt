So this is a nice place to hang out and chill.\n\nThe coffee is good and the atmosphere is worth paying for.\n\nHOWEVER.. And this is a HUGE however because it has happened twice now. The workers there are ARROGANT and RUDE. \n\nThey are not nice. I asked them why they don't serve their espresso to-go. A man with a beard looked at me and said \"Because we just don't.\" \n\nFor goodness sakes I'm a customer! At least be polite. He was NOT. \n\nBeware: THE MAN WITH THE BEARD BEHIND THE COUNTER.
