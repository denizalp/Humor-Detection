The name of this restaurant is actually \"The Dive N\".  I ate here for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised.  They only serve breakfast and lunch and they have daily specials for each.  The theme is that of a 50's style diner.\n\nWith some reservations I decided to try to the BBQ plate.  Once I ordered I thought for sure I had made a mistake because I know what good Q tastes like and I just ordered it from a 50's style diner.  That's usually a big no no!  As you can see from the pic of the plate it's a nice portion of food.  I was acutally impressed by the pulled BBQ!  It was very tasty and I was a fan of the vinegar based sauce that accompanied it.  The slaw was great, finely chopped just the way I like it.  Also the drinks they serve come with that really crushed ice which is a favorite of mine.  I don't know why more restaurants don't have that?!?!  The BBQ plate was $7.25 plus $1.25 for the drink.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and the restaurant area was very clean which is always a plus.  I will definitely be back here again to try some of their other menu items, but for first impressions I give them 4 stars!
