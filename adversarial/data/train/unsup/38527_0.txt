I went in at 12:15a to see a Dr. I wouldn't have gone if I wasn't in need of urgent care. At 4am...still no Dr. Respectively, the receptionist and nurses were absolute Angels. I 'think' they were frustrated with the pure laziness of the Dr. as well. The entire time I was there (literally) the Dr. treated and discharged 3 patients. With that said, I waited my time with the same 4 people in the waiting. There was 1 finger laceration emergency (he was in & out in 20 minutes). Very disappointed in the non-urgent care that this Dr. did not provide to anyone. BTW ... This place WAS NOT busy at all. True fail on behalf of this urgent care facility. Even though I am sick, I felt so bad for the 4...yes 4 patients whom in the waiting room who were more ill than myself and really needed medical care.
