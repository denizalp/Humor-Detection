This had to be one of the highlights of my bachelorette party. Our instructor, Pony, was AMAZING!! I can't say enough about how entertaining, witty, and charming she was throughout the entire class. There were 27 of us for a double bachelorette, and she managed to put us all at ease. We all had so much fun because of her. I don't think anyone left disappointed.\n\nShaun, the person in charge of ticketing for our group, also went above and beyond to accomodate our class. I only worked with her over the phone, but she was thorough and knowedgable. With 27 people, she managed to work out quite the deal for us which we all greatly appreciated.\n\nIf not for the PH staff at the place, this review would be 5 stars. To say it was disorganized was an understatement. I was told to arrive with my party at 2:30 for the 3:00 class which we did. When I got there, I was told there'd be a delay because the staff was still prepping which was fine; however, the class is supposed to be about 75 minutes. We actually started around 3:25-30 and ended our class at roughly 4:15 because another class was supposed to be coming in, so we were definitely shorted on time. \n\nOn top of that, with our large party of 27, we were apparently given the smaller classroom upstairs. We were told to move to the room downstairs only to have staff, again, move us all back upstairs. We then had to wait in the upstairs classroom for chairs because, surprise, there weren't enough in the smaller classroom. Our instructor requested for chairs, and after waiting several more minutes, had to go get them herself. The staff delivered the chairs about 10 minutes after that which meant if she didn't get the chairs we would've waited even longer. They also seemed blatantly uncaring about any of that. \n\nOverall, great experience and great fun because of our instructor. Staff at the facility was disappointing to deal with.
