I am very surprised to see Les 3 Brasseurs rated so poorly here. It seems that most of the negative reviews are related to the service. Fair enough. The place is huge and  it can get pretty busy around certain times. Despite that, I feel like it brings quite a unique and exciting concept to an area that's lacking in anything worth talking about. The beer is made in the restaurant with the brewing process exhibited behind glass. They only carry their own beer, which I find pretty good. The brown is quite hoppy and flavorful. I like the blond because it's still very aromatic but goes down easy. On the weekdays, before 3pm, if you have an excuse, half pints of the blond is quite cheap. The food is also good and moderately priced. What's more is that this place is large enough to accommodate large groups, which is why they're so busy on Friday afternoons.
