I swear,I love this office! There is no bigger chicken than me when it comes to going to ANYTHING medical. I have major panic attacks, and always cancel out. Well, I couldn't this time because because I needed a quick solution for an upcoming event that I had to attend.  The office,from the front desk to the assistants, to the dentist is amazing!!!! My daughter puts it best. God knew your fear, and placed angels on earth in that dentist's office.  I'm so grateful for the wonderful experiences that I had there.
