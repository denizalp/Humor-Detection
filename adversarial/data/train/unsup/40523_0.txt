I love this place.  I can't say I have ever spent less than $140 for a pair of shoes when I buy them here.  I am a die hard Zappos shopper and this place always makes me smile because I have a soft spot in my heart for Independently run businesses who have a great selection. Amy's Shoes is one of those places.  Love it.  Now go buy yourself a new pair of shoes and then head to Tartine a few doors down and have a glass of wine on the patio.  Diva day complete.
