Buritto Boyz beats any local fast-food Mexican spot in Toronto.  Expect to wait in a long line come 2-3am on a Friday or Saturday night after the club\/bar, but the food is well-worth the wait.  I've ordered both the chicken and sweet potato burritos.  Both are tasty and seasoned well without too much salt.  \n\nWhat I truly like about this place is that there are a variety of options, even gluten-free tortillas!  The price is always right; you can order a large chicken or sweet potato burrito with a combo (salsa and chips, a drink) for about $10.  To be honest, I would probably opt-out of the combo next time, as I felt the chips were a bit on the greasy side.\n\nGreat spot, great food, well worth the wait!
