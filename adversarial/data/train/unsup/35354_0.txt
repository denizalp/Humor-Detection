There are plenty of sushi joints in Madison, and plenty with delivery, too. This Japanese cuisine is definitely not my cup of tea (pun intended). The food was subpar. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and a veggie roll. They were skimpy, the rice wasn't really sticky, and it just didn't match Madison's sushi standards. \nI ordered this as delivery, and was told that my order came with a free appetizer since I had ordered $25 worth of food. It took over an hour for soup, sushi, and one appetizer to arrive. Then, after they had left, I realized they forgot the free appetizer (which was the reason I bought one extra roll in the first place). When I called back, I was told they'd return in less than 10 minutes with the appetizer. They never did. \nI guess I'd give this 1 star as delivery, since the food came so slowly and really didn't taste good, almost like it sat too long before getting delivered.  I gave it 2 stars, because my friends and I have sometimes received quality sushi when we have dined in. So perhaps if you do check this place out, definitely don't order delivery. Try a different spot in Madison for your late-night sushi cravings.
