Can I give this place a No STAR? I spent over 400$ today at this stupid park.\nWe tried to leave at 8 pm . It is now 11:17pm and I am still sitting here in the parking lot trying to leave. Gridlock ed everywhere. With 2 kids getting antsy in the back seat. No food or water. It is UNACCEPTABLE \n. I DEMAND A REFUND FOR THIS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE
