I don't understand Quest's complete disregard for customer experience. You're a diagnostic center. People come in for drug testing to blood draws to a lot of other scary medical things. Don't expect your patients to be experts. If a lab order isn't clear, why not pick up the phone and call for clarification? It seems they have a monopoly  on diagnostic testing in the Vegas Valley so avoiding them is next to impossible. The bathroom was disgusting. People collect samples in there. Keep it tidy. The thing that really grinds my gears is the totally lack of compassion. Having worked in the medical field and having my own experience with medical issues, a little compassion goes a long, long way.
