Clean basic interior.\n\nI ordered from the summerlicious menu.\n\nMy appetizer, Lamb Sausages: Grilled, on pearl barley with Stilton, grape tomato & wilted mustard greens. Taste, moisture levels were good, but portions was quite small.\n\nThe main, Speckled Trout: Amandine, broiled on long beans with almonds, steamed new potatoes, brown butter & lemon. My main was very tasty but my portions were so abysmally small.\n\nFor Dessert, Artisanal Cheese Selection: Three varieties of Local cheese with walnuts, amber honey & pear compote. The cheeses were alright & it was neat combining it with nuts & sweet petrified fruits. I liked the dessert  very much. \n\nOverall service here was attentive & quick, but the portion sizes are quite depressingly small.
