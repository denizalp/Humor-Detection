What an elegant idea turned awry with a lack-luster execution. There are some nicer appointments in this open and airy establishment coupled with a predominantly cold and hard interior. For a place that is selling itself as Japanese food fast, the hired help felt slower than that of a three toed sloth on a hot day in Africa. Overpriced drinks coupled with only so-so sushi (this is the Midwest), left me feeling like something was missing. Perhaps throwing a hibachi in the mix or a ninja that has no remorse for apathetic culinary offerings, would elevate this rice peddling pagoda's standards to something other than mediocrity.\n\n\n***Follow Up***\n I got this email from the owner - proof this institution is not trying to accept constructive criticism. \n\n\"Dude, you need a job.  Your gay verbiage makes me wanna throw up.. Sure is easy to judge other people when you don't have the sack to do something like this yourself.\"\n\nGay bash much? Hate much? Step up your game! By the way, I have a wonderful job and a \"sack\".
