Yet another really good burger option for the Chandler\/101 area!\n\nOver the last few months we've gotten a Smash Burger and now a Burger21 last week. If UR into red meat, how can you go wrong?\n\nI came here to grab something for a late night at the office and Burger21 hit the roof of my flavortown mouth. Sorry Fieri!  LOL\n\nI kept it simple. The cardiac arrest Blue Cheese and Bacon burger for only $7.95 and a Chocolate Malt ($4.95) to wash it down. Both were good. \n\nExpect to pay $12 or so, if you order a soft drink. Don't  those iced cold beers looked good? There's a real high probably I'll be back with some co-workers real soon.
