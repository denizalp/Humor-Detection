Just dropped by to check out coats. Found one I liked, several polos, and a few pairs of shoes I must have. Unfortunately the sales person was extremely rude so I'll take my business to South Coast Plaza where everyone greets me by name when I walk into the store. You ought to fire the gentleman who was working all by himself at the time this review was posted. The coat I'm buying was $4595 and the polos were $495 (I always buy one of each color). Thanked him twice on my way out and he refused to respond.
