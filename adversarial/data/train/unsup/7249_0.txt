Had my teeth cleaned here today and boooyyy was she thorough!\nFree whitening with each booked cleaning and the price was just right. I had quite some other stuff done too.....a good experience  overall.\n\nFelt like I lost 10pounds from my mouth when she was done :)\n\nGot a free toothbrush, a mini sensodyne toothpaste(repair and protect) and  dental floss as well
