I was drawn to try this cafe by the pretty aesthetics from the photos. It somewhat resembles the decor of Light Cafe and Latera with the abundance of greenery and industrial elements. It also had some interesting menu items such as the crystal dome platter. It is located in the Sky City Plaza amoungst the other growing food chains which are popping up here. \n\nUpon entering the cafe it definitely did not disappoint in the decor and ambiance. It really is a paradise for instagrammers and food photographers. The desserts however were sub-optimal and quite a let down. I ordered the steamed milk with red bean and the coconut milk with sago and grass jelly. The pictures in the menu were very deceiving as the desserts were microscopic! It was so small that I was finished eating in literally a few mouthfuls. Also the coconut sago was lukewarm and had a somewhat of a sore aftertaste. The steamed milk with red beans was not bad but not amazing either. Prices were also on the higher end and you could definitely get better quality elsewhere for the same price if not less. \n\nI would probably not be going back for a return visit however if you are into nice aesthetics and interesting looking desserts such as the crystal ball platter then this place is for you
