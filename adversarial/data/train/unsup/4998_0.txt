I decided to drunkenly stumble into this store since it is so close to home and I've never been before.  There aren't a heck of a lot of things to choose from, but they have some good deals on their games.  BLAKE WANTS TO PLAY WRESTLING GAMES WHEN DRUNK!  I was able to find one for a very reasonable $3.  \n\nSide note : While I was in line, I was talking to a rather interesting fellow who was complaining that his wife was going to be the death of him if she made him get rid of anymore of his 'toys' (tools)  I simply needed to remind him that wives live longer than their husbands because they're not married to women *boom boom ching*  \n\nThe short wait to buy the nifty game brought me to a very friendly group of staff.  Smiling and engaging, these folks were able to answer a question I had, quickly rung up my purchase and off I went with a smile on my face ready to nerd out for the night.  If not for the general lack of odds and ends available, this would be a regular stop for me.
