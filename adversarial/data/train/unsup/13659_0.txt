Apple butter and biscuits.\nRibs the size of my ass.\nGrits that look too hearty to be real.\nFried okra to die for (seriously, it's GOOD).\nFried green tomatoes.\nFried pickles.\nFried, fried, fried.\nThe chicken isn't too great. SKIP THE CHICKEN. And I prefer the mac and cheese from Voodoo BBQ with like...a pound of butter in it. If you're going to eat unhealthy - do it BIG.\nThe sweet tea is straight from Louisiana. It tastes like the stuff I'd get in the bayou outside of Central, Louisiana.\nChicken noodle soup that's not just chicken noodle soup, but the KING of chicken noodles.\nThe infamous fishnet leg lamp.\n\n- 1 star for no gator on the menu.\nBlasphemy!
