Just once, I would like to be charged at the end what is quoted in the beginning.  \n\nMy alternator went out and I called American Auto Lube and Repair as they have positive reviews on another review site.  They quoted me $221 for the alternator.  The same alternator sells retail at O'Reilly for $180 but I figured they have to make their money and I am sure they do not have the buying power of O'Reilly.  \n\nSurprise, Surprise, I get the bill at the end and they charged me $272 for the alternator.  When we complained, the one who made the quote was no where to be found.  \n\nBusinesses take note, being dishonest does not bring customers back.  I hope it is worth the overcharge to lose a customer for life.
