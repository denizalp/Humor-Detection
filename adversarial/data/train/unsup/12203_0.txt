Without hesitation, I say they have the best homemade ice cream in the tri-state area. The ice cream is rich in texture and full of flavor. Even after the change of ownership the recipes for the ice cream have remained the same. Brr-kee's has that small-town charm and big-town flavor. They are open seasonal and it's so worth the wait, it's something we look forward to every year. Try the brrr kee brownie, it's so good. They are located right near Oakmont Bakery and go perfect with a Oakmont Bakery cupcake.\n\n\nDaily ice cream flavors:\n \nVanilla\nChocolate\nCherry Vanilla\nCookie-N-Cream\nCookie Dough\nMint Chip \nChocolate Chip\nButter Pecan\nCoffee or Espresso\n\nMay ice cream flavors:\n \nChocolate Peanut Butter Explosion\nChocolate Butter Fudge\nMocha\n\nGelato Flavors:\n \nPistachio\nChocolate Almond or \nChocolate Pecan \n\nMay Gelato Flavors:\n \nAmaretto\nTiramisu\nBlood Orange\n\nSorbet May Flavors:\n \nPineapple\nMango\n\nFlavors change every month.
