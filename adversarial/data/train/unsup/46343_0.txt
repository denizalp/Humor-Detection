After having tried various Thai restaurants around Vegas we had finally arrived at Archi's.  Let me just say that we should have tried here first. \n\nAte the Panang Curry, fried tofu, and broccoli. Way more than enough for two and much much better service than lotus of siam. If you're in the mood for Thai then this is the place.
