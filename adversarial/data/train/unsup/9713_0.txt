worst pizza and wings. I read all your reviews and tried it anyway. there's no bloody flavor!! looks nice, but I was basically eating bread dipped in ranch, and I never do that to pizza. \nI don't know how they can make it without any taste. like your chewing air. must be science or something. \nyou know how to judge a pizza place? if they have a pizza oven or a conveyer belt thing. guess which one this place has. \nwings suck too, I think they bake them. get a fryer.  \ntry this place just to taste nothing while eating. it's wild and hard to explain. \nGordon Ramsey would throw salt in your faces and scream about seasoning. haha
