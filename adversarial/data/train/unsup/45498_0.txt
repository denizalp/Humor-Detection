I love Shea Women's Care and Dr Carter. Id recommend him without reservation.\n\nI started seeing Dr Carter when I was 10 weeks pregnant with my first child. What impresses me about him is his bedside manner---he does not \"doctor talk\" you, he treats you like a peer. He's also delightfully friendly and always has interesting, personal things to chit chat about.\n\nBest of all: he is incredibly knowledgeable, experienced, and takes time to answer questions and discuss concerns thoroughly with both my husband and I. \n\nI have to compliment Dr Carter for treating my husband and I like the unit we are, rather than focusing all attention solely on my experience with the pregnancy. Dr Carter was great about giving us tips that were beneficial to our relationship and marriage. Pregnancy and babies can cause stress in a marriage, and I am thankful to Dr Carter for his careful approach and ability to care for us as human beings with thoughts and feelings.\n\nAlso: I love Rachel, Dr Carter's ultrasound tech. She is a joy----sweet, empathetic, knowledgeable.
