Went there for dinner when visiting the village, and i had the Signature \"dinner kit\" kebabs, which was 1 lamb and 1 steak kebab, along with saffron rice. my friend had the Classic which was lamb, steak & sausage kebabs. The meat peices were interspersed with grilled veggies (carrot, squash, zucchini). very delicious. had a ginger Mojito, which was good, and a glass of house Chardonnay which tasted sour. The waitresses & waiters were very nice, friendly & professional. we sat at an outside table, it was perfect weather. our meal was a little pricy...but good.
