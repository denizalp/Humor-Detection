I just got breakfast and wanted to comment on their hash browns. They have a slightly herby flavor which i found delightful. Upon further inspection, i noticed little green flecks in them. They are either parsley\/dill or green donut sprinkles. They also gave my dog, who was riding shotgun, a free dog biscuit. She decided she wanted my egg sandwich instead. It was way less greasy than McDonald's. Not to my liking. But it's been twenty minutes since i ate it and i don't have to go download already. That's a plus.
