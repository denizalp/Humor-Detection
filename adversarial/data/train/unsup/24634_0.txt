remember when your mom would always tell you to keep your hands off the hot stove, but you never really learned your lesson until you actually put your hand on the stove and burned the hell out of it, than ran screaming and crying to your mom and she gave you that \"told-you-so\" lecture?\n\nwell, same goes for DUIs. it wasn't until i was put through the actual experience that i can fully say i learned my lesson. DUI screenings are required for DUI offenders and i chose the stonewall institute to get my screening done and attend the required DUI education classes.  courtney penniman, the founder of stonewall, didn't give me that embarassing \"told-you-so\" speech like my mom did so many times. she was open, kind, patient, informative, understanding, and really gave me the push in the right direction that i needed. i don't think i could have gotten anywhere NEAR the same experience at some court-appointed screening site. the prices are reasonable and in the end it was actually cheaper to go to her than to TASC, and more professional and friendly as well. \n\ncourtney also does psychiatric care for depression, anxiety,. trauama, serious mental health counseling, as well as general mental health counseling for individuals and couples.  on top of the drug and alcohol addiction therapy and DUI services provided to me. the first of its kind in arizona, Stonewall Institute offers specific programming designed to address the mental health and chemical dependency issues that are unique to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning (LGBTQ) population, so if you're family, you know you're in good hands with courtney.
