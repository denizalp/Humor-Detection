When asked where is the Trump Hotel, I could have never answered the question because it is south of the main Las Vegas Strip and kind of hidden by the Wynn and Encore.  There is not really any gambling at this hotel and is meant to just stay and relax, which we did.  The accommodations in their suites are nice, but not overwhelming with electronics or special lighting.  It is meant to spend family time for recreation and be shuttled to the various casinos or shopping centers within a few mile radius.  The best thing about the Trump is its proximity to the shopping mall, where your anchor stores pull in much of the shopping.  My favorite is the Nordstroms, which is literally across the street.  My only gripe is that it's valet parking only, which is complimentary, but you really have to tip these guys and gals, as they live off the tips.  As I understand, the Donald is coming in this evening for the GOP debate, being held at the Venetian.   I hope his stay is as restful as mine was!
