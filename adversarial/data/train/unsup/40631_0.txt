Strike two.\n\n5:15 on a Friday (learned later that East High had a home game nearby) and the place was mobbed. Wonder how many will return?\n\nSaw the fish fry, realized I did not want that much food. Opted for the sandwich and slaw.\n\nMenu suggested \"sushi grade\" cod but doubt you'd find that on the box it was delivered in. The sandwich was just okay, batter and bun kind of disappointing. The slaw was indecently exposed, very under-dressed.\n\nOh, $10 for a small pour of house chardonnay? Seriously?!\n\nBased on a thin (and pricey) menu, I doubt I will be going back.
