Nekter is located just outside the east entrance of Macy's in DTS. They have several different drinks that they offer on the menu. You can also pick the ingredients yourself for your drink. I usually go with the carrot, Apple, and ginger. Everything tastes fresh here and the place appears to be very clean. It is a bit pricey, but it is in DTS. Definitely stop by if your in the neighborhood. You will enjoy it.
