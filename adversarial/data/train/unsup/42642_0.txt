I still LOVE the concept, design and girls that work at Prose (Katie and Rachel, heart-eyes forever). \n\nHowever, the prices are just too steep.  Additionally, the one time I got gel polish here, my thumbs were chipped 24 hours later.  I have no doubt they would have fixed them if I went in, but it was right before Christmas and we were traveling.  I've heard others have similar issues with the brand of gel polish, so that's something to look into for the future. \n\nI hope Prose works out their kinks because it is a really cool business--I love many things about it, but bit of a rocky start for me.
