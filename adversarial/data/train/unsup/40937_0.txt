Always amazing,  always perfect coffee.  \nIf you are sick and tired of the bull plop you get from Starbucks,  and other shops of the like check this place out,  from conversation insighting artwork to coffee that is always perfect and never burnt.  If you feel like it they always have fresh baked goods from the bakery down the way,  recently acquired a contract for gourmet Popsicles,  and their coffee is Fair Trade and organic but they don't talk about it like it's an Advertising campaign like you know who does. \nThis place is amazing from the ground up. \nYou may have to wait a little longer for your drink of choice but you won't be disappointed.
