If I could give them zero stars I would. The service is absolutely horrid. I don't even think that word truly defines the service. A lady straight up came to our table asked us \"what do you want\".. We told them and she shoke her head and walked away. We had to ask for food multiple times and only once were we actually listened to. \nFair disclosure we actually frequent this place a lot for dim sum but this one visit was absolutely the worst. I am sure we would go somewhere else of there was any other place that served dim sum in the phoenix area but choices are very slim.
