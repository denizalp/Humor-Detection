I want to give this place five stars in a revised review some day! It's close, great concept, and related to the HUB so we were really excited to try it for brunch. Clearly, they are new and have some things to work out. We were hoping for amazing bloody Mary's, but they were a little thick and weak, so we ordered an extra shot... $30 for two bloodies was not out intention, but live and learn. I got the bacon burger, no bun, side salad. What I received was a bacon burger no bun, only lettuce. Asked for the tomato, onion, pickle... out came a caesar salad, I asked for garden... out came a garden salad with the wrong dressing. Yikes! When we got the bill, I was charged for the side salad and the dressing. Asked the server about it and he \"talked to the manager\" and got it taken off... oh, thanks! The burger menu says, your choice of side. \nWe'll wait a while and hopefully it will be better next time!
