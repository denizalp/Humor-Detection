My boss takes our team out to lunch once a month and this month I suggested Lebowski's. The menu seemed to have a good variety of food for everyone to enjoy. Also, I was a tad selfish and wanted to come here because the reviews of the wings are A++. \n\nThe parking lot is small, so if you drive a large vehicle I would suggest going somewhere else for parking during high peak times. The building is small but the inside was very clean for a pub like restaurant!\n\nFirst I ordered fried pickles. And oh my goodness were they tasty!! They came out super hot and I couldn't help but eat them up because they were so good! Definitely recommend them! A guy who isn't a big fan of pickles tried them and he liked them, with ranch though. \n\nI ordered the 6 buffalo wings and garlic fries. If you get regular fries your doing it wrong. Other people got the gold rush sauce.. I tried one.. and I really wish I would've gotten that sauce! It is described as tangy-sweet but it wasn't super tangy. Oh how tasty it was!! Can't go wrong with classic buffalo though. \n\nThe other guys got the Lebowski burger and said it was amazing. I didn't try it but they said they would be back to get it again. Finally, a guy got the chocolate cake. Wow! I had two bites and it was very satisfying!! \n\nI didn't catch our waiters name but he was bald and a really great waiter! Other waitress help with refilling our drinks. So ultimately all of the staff was nice, patient, and always ready to help! \n\nAll in all, I was thoroughly satisfied with my experience for lunch today! I can't wait to go back! Also all the other guys (8 of them) said the food was very delicious and even they would come back on their own!! And some of them live a good distance away! I recommend it for sure!!
