I really enjoy the layout of the course. It's challenging but not ridiculous. It is usually in fair shape as long as you don't go after a lot of rain, since most of the course runs through the stone creek which becomes a wash after a downpour. They have a good range setup and chipping and putting green. It's in a good central location near PV mall and the rates are usually pretty fair compared to other courses in the area. The greens are usually puttable. All in all I am sure I will go back at some point in my life to play with some friends that don't have a huge budget for a top notch course. It's one of them courses you want to enjoy with a 12 pack of brew and some hacker friends.
