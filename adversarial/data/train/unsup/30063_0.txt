My wife and I went to see bsb we had meet and greets. There wasn't enough seats for everyone in the VIP lounge once the concert started it was a blast the security guard that was near us in general admission was great he stopped ppl from pushing my wife and I to get our spots even claimed our spots when we had to use the rest room so we could come right back without loosing our front row spots. The concert was amazing, the restrooms are clean, and the staff was great!
