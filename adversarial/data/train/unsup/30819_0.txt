Walked by this place plenty of times, but never went in until recently. Oh my, where have you been all my life?\n\nCute decor with paintings of farm animals at the lower level, a row of forks along the wall upstairs -- quaint!\n\nEveryone looked like they were having a grand ol' time and just a quick sniff told me food must be pretty amazing. Ordered the fork scramble and it was beautiful. LOTS of fresh dill over smoked salmon, scrambled eggs and a rectangle of puff pastry. I ate all of this in careful rectangles, like a carpenter measuring each section -- took real self control not to devour this in hasty bites! Mmm...savoury, brunchy, nom nom noms.\n\nI'll be back...got my eye on some pancakes...mmm
