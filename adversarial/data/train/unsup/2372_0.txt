Was a patient there for years. I went 3 years without a visit making me a new patient. Ok just needed a physical,they cannot do the physical the first visit. They do them the second visit. So 2 co-pays, 2 bills to insurance company. Why couldn't we do everything on the first visit? I told the women since I'm a new patient I'll shop around. She did not seem to care...so hard to find a family doctor these days.
