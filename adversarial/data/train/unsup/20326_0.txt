I've had my eye on Vintage 95 for a while & was super excited to have a chance to stop in.\n\nThe environment at this wine bar was super relaxing & we really enjoyed the entire time we were there. We started off with some drinks as we had gone for happy hour and then decided to accompany them with an order of the garlic fries & the brie with jam and walnut toast. For the cost of the fries, we thought there was an ample amount, they were garlic-y but not too garlic-y, and the dijonaise that came with them was an absolutely perfect dipping sauce. I'd definitely get them again. We felt similarly about the brie & toast, it was a perfect sized amount to go with some drinks.\n\nWe had a little snafu with our meal order but the staff \/ management was so gracious, we really appreciated it. I had a chance to look at their lunch menu and saw quite a few tempting sections ... We'll definitely be back!
