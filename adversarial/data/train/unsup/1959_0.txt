It's Del Taco, so really, what can I say? The food is greasy, and heart killing. The prices can be ok, but you will get mostly lettuce with that 15c taco there. I suppose when you don't feel like making anything, and really don't care about your health, it's alright. But really people, it's not hard to make your own tacos, and with the internet you can find the recipe for their sauces and make it yourself now. You know, if that was your only valid excuse for coming here.
