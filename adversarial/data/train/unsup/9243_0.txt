My dog, Thor, and I love The Dog Bar!\n\nBefore you venture out this way though, you should know what you're getting into... Like other Yelpers reviewed, you must be a dog person.  The dogs will come up to you, sniff you, kiss you, and sometimes jump on you.  The first time we went out here, everyone seemed very on top of their dogs' behavior.  If one dog was causing too much trouble, the owner took them home.  Yesterday's experience was not so efficient.  There were a few dogs that blurred the lines between playing and fighting, and the owners did nothing except, \"Sparky, no.\"  I have problems with this, but the trouble making dogs didn't mess with Thor, so I just kept him occupied with other dogs.  \n\nThey don't do food here, but you can bring food into the bar.  Just prepare to have a lot of well behaved dogs showing off their tricks for a bite of your quesadilla. (Get your food from Cabo Fish Taco - nom nom nom).  I'll be back time and time again, but please - if your dog is not having fun, just take him home.  Don't make the other dogs (and owners) deal with him.
