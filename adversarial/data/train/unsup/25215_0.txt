One word: Amazing! The best Asian bakery I've been to by far (and I've been to a lot in LA). The cream cheese bread and taro donut (which you MUST get if you go here) were phenomenal. The matcha mousse was also heavenly and tasted like the treats I had in South Korea. \n\nMy only bummer was the mochi bread, as I tasted the red bean more than mochi. The bread wasn't bad per say, I just love mochi and would have liked more of that in there. Second, the matcha tea latte was pretty sweet. Next time I'd ask for less sugar.\n\nOverall, this place was a solid 5. Everything is freshly made and the owners are fabulous! :)
