Mediocre pizza, nothing special. I ordered a small plain pizza and it took 50 minutes to get to my house and I live 2 minutes away. I forgot to leave the driver a tip so I was going to head down to the shop to leave him a couple dollars. Before I put my shoes on he came back up to my door and asked for a tip. Classless.
