I have a mix feeling about this place. 1st service is good but my problem is the food. We ordered a Crab cake as Appetizers that was good so our expectation is high. However, for entree, we had LASAGNA and Iron beef something( I forgot the name). LASAGNA is very salty and I couldn't even finish it. When waiter came to check on us, we did tell him the entree was very salty. He asked us how to make it right...how could you make a entree right when it is too salty? ...maybe cancel my order or something but they didn't....\n\nHowever, when they took away our entrees, we over heard that people sitting next to us also complaint their foods are too salty.
