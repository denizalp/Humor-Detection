Truly a gem in Charlotte that it has a 24h diner that is better than half of the New Jersey diners i have been to! Food overall is good to very good. The biggest treat of this place is the cheesecake, made the way you remember it up north. You may come here to feel that you're back \"up north\" for the diner experience but if anything, the best cheesecake in the state of North Carolina is at Landmark. Period.
