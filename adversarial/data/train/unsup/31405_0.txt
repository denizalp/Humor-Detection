Came here for the Formula Drift event. It was insane!! Crazy drifters were losing control and slamming into walls. Talk about wreckage!! There were no fatalities though, so it was cool.\n\nVegas gets extremely hot in the summer; I wish there were some fans overhead or something to keep us cool while being in the audience. Lucky for us, the day of the event was cloudy so it wasn't that bad. :)
