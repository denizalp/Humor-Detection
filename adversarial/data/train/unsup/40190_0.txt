Iv always been a fan of this hospital! I had both of my kids. But when I'm at the ER with a screaming 11 month old because he can't deal with the pain anymore, and the nurse tells me my sons case is not important that as long as he was breathing he could wait pissed me off specially after being in the waiting room for over 3 hours with a child that doesn't stop crying!! Very disappointed!!
