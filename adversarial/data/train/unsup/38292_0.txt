Everything was great. My family and I were there last night and the service was excellent. The food was perfect. The baguette was soooo delicious. You must try it. We ordered 3. I had the beef tenderloin and they were delicious plus the potatoes were nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just perfect. My mom got the split pea soup and she said it was delicious. My husband got the burger and he said it had flavor and it was cooked perfectly. My brother got the crab cakes and that was delicious as well. Everything we had was yuuuummmy.  Also the lemon cake is soooo good. We would definitely return.
