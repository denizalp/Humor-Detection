Typical Asian grocery store but this one is unorganized with dirty floors at the entrance and checkout, rest of store is clean. Live fish available at the seafood section. Slight smell in the meat section but none in the seafood or Halal meat section. I would shop here if I was in the area and needed ingredients for an Asian dish.
