The spa is very clean but I personally prefer more \"pretty\" places. This is a very pragmatic place. It feels institutional to me. When I come here, it's to get a treatment and to hangout for a few minutes in the co-ed areas. Then I leave. I enjoy the clay ball rooms a little. I don't zen out on them like other people. To me it's more of a novelty. I wouldn't make a day out of a visit here. It's just not luxurious enough for me. A few hours is plenty.\n\nBut with that said, this is a very big facility with a lot of good things going. My recommendation is to pay for a spa service and use the facilities as an added bonus. I get scrubbed shiny with the Body Massage Scrub for $120. My skin is always super smooth with all the dead stuff sloughed off when the treatment is done.\n\nYes, yes. You get naked for the majority of the time you're here. I think this is more bothersome to the men I know who've been here. Something about bathing with other naked men. Oh... get over it! Naked is good. Naked should happen more often with no sexual intent.
