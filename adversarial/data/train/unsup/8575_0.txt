I called Aragvi at 4:30 asking if they had space for 4 people at 6:30 (Friday same night). The lady kindly called me back and said there was a table, but we would have to be out by 8:30...wow, popular place!\n\nAnd I can see why! This restaurant is sooo small! The room can only fit about 4-5 tables, and we got the one right by the entrance. No problem! I was already excited to try this cute and quaint restaurant. I have a Georgian friend so I was doubly excited to try some of her country's dishes!\n\nThere are two ladies who do everything from taking orders to bringing orders. The one who served us was so kind and \"mum-like.\" I came here with my boyfriend and his parents and we had no idea what to order. The hostess suggested we order an Appetizer Sharing plate which came with samples of: Beets (YUM!), Eggplant (Babaganouj) (YUM!), some Walnut paste thing (it was good but too much Walnut in my opinion), and some grilled peppers.\n\nWe also had some bread (they bake everything in house) and a cheese-like croissant which was really good (but heavy!). For mains, I had a stew with hearty veal and potatoes.\n\nFor booze, they have Georgian Wines so it's a good chance to try\n\nOverall, I would love to come back here. Everything is just so homey - I felt as if I was at my friend's house and her mom was cooking for me. Everything is made fresh and in-house and the food is really good. This cuisine is not something you get every day, so if you want to try something new, I would highly recommend this place.\n\nAs with all the other reviews, this restaurant is located in a small plaza, so parking can be tight at times. \n\nThey do not accept credit cards, so I would bring cash. Dinner for 4 people was very reasonable for all the good and full-food we got. Highly recommend (and don't forget to make reservations! It's an absolute must).
