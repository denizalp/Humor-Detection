This target is ALWAYS jamin busy, busy. I think it's the closest locale to the university. I have to admit the females clothes selection is head & shoulders above my local Target. I'll give them that. This review is wholly based on the CS. I returned a clothing article & exchanged for another no problem while the hubs bought some household necessities.  It happened to be the week they rolled out their new CC machines & boy howdy did it go badly. He was double charged after the cashier allegedly cancelled one of the transactions. So he went to the CS desk & got no where. Like literally no where & left unhappier than he arrived. It was such a bummer way to start a weekend.
