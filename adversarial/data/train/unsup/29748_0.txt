I am so in love with this place. \n\nAny time I am near Saint Laurent, I have to come here and get an ice cream. I LITERALLY HAVE TO in order to try all their delicious, creative and homemade flavours by the time I leave Montreal. This place is usually closed during the Winter (it closed early November to April and for good reasons when the temperature hits -40 degrees) but come Spring time, this shop draws lines.\n\nTheir most popular flavours by memory are the Chocolate 6X and the Coffee but with flavours ranging from Sesame, Chai Tea and Margarita, you can't just stop with one scoop. If you're lining up for Schwartz's smoked meats, I would say ditch that line and just go for ice cream instead. I even once considered having it for breakfast as I passed by this place at 11am on a sunny Friday.\n\nIt's the best! (IT DOESN'T TAKE CARD THOUGH!)
