I visited Doce Taqueria on Tues. prior to a Cinco de Mayo themed Yelp event at another nearby restaurant.  I'd been meaning to stop by, but it'd been awhile since I'd stopped for grub on the South Side.  This event, plus the fact that it was Taco Tuesday, gave me sufficient motivation to check it out.\n\nBecause I knew there would be snacks at the event, I decided to go with two tacos ($3 each)--one of the daily special (BBQ pork), and one of the pollo (chicken), both on corn tortillas.  Of the two, the chicken was the more subtly flavored, consisting of the namesake meat plus avocado, cilantro, crema, and cotija cheese.  The addition of a spritz of juice from an included piece of lime added a jolt of citrusy flavor, upping the ante.  The BBQ pork, on the other hand, was a veritable flavor explosion, consisting of cherry peppers, shredded cheese, and cilantro. Though I enjoyed them both, the special was my favorite of the two due to its bold flavors.\n\nLike many eateries in the South Side, the space is pretty small, with seating limited to the bar and a small ledge by the window, and no real tables.  From my visit, it appeared that the majority of orders were of the carry out variety, but a few other people also ate in, in addition to me.  Service was pretty efficient--my order was out in 5 min, which I appreciated given that I arrived a bit later than I'd planned to.\n\nThe decor was quite festive, evoking a kitschy SoCal vibe, which seemed particularly appropriate given the day and time of my visit.  The atmosphere reminded me of a similar taco shop on the North Side, but I enjoyed the food more and found the price point more reasonable.  While I'd rate the tacos at Las Palmas and Edgar's slightly higher, if you should find yourself nearby, I'd definitely say Doce is worth a visit! 4.5 stars.
