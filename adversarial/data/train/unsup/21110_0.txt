Okay,this update is for 2 specific incidents with 2 very different outcomes,but the weaker is cancelled by the stellar leaving my review at 5 stars.\nI wanted to get dogface one of those \"I'm a big scary dog\" spiked collars.They're like 60 clams.(a better spent 60 clams as opposed to the Smelly Dog 60 clam coat)Anyhoo.This is in Criptown Maul,so they lock the good shit up.Good shit being a 60 clam big scary dog spikey collar.\nDon't judge me...You know it's a fair statement.Even if you refuse to admit it.\nSo,I find someone to unlock the collar to make sure it fits.\nWell,it don't.AND it's brown...No no no...Must not be.This must be a black leather big scary dog spikey collar.My dog will be Dog Halford.My dog will be hellbent for leather.\nI ask key guy if they have any in his size in black that's not locked up in the display rack.Well Lazy Farts tells me they don't make that collar any bigger and it only comes in brown...Hmmm.I doubt that.\nI go to another Petsmart and get it.In black,In his size.Fucker lost a 60 clam sale.\nOh...and guess what...I happen to know someone in upper management in the Petsmart Corporation.Guess what he knows too now...\nYou never know who you're waiting on Mr.Lazy Farts Key Holder...\nNow for part Deux of this update.\nOn another occasion,I bring dogface to the groomie area,without an appointment or clue.(I take him to charity car washes to wash him.Cheaper than a groomie and money goes to some needy something or other.)All I need are his doenails did.They can do it!Check in groomie girl real pleasant,gave a shit,and was engaged and knowledgable.All the groomie girls were extra cool and human.You could get the idea they all went out for girls night out after work from time to time.Just the way they got along,a symbiosis if you will.\nSo,after looking at dog's nails,she comes back and suggests a slightly different service and the reason why.Reasonable,go for it.Dog was a bit nervous,but they handled him so well.His toenails all did and nice,dog more comfy now.\nI will go back for that again!\nOh,and he was wearing his big scary dog collar,the one they don't make in his size or black on that occasion...\nI didn't see Mr.Lazy Farts though.maybe he had made a bed of excelsior in the back and was sleeping on it.\nTee hee hee.
