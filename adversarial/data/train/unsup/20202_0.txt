Finally. I found home. \n\nFor two years I've searched Vegas for the same authentic Chinese cuisine I are in hong kong and on Guam. I've tried many, liked them, but this is the only one so far that is authentic and tastes EXACTLY like home. \n\nYelpers, I tried it based on your reviews and I'm so glad you are all right--this may look like a hole on the wall but it's far from it. The restaurant has nice seating and great staff. I love the fact that the cooks and staff speak Cantonese. It's a sign that the food is genuine. The prices are ridiculously cheap! Walnut shrimp was only 9.95!!! Everywhere else sells for 14 and up. \n\nThe food:\n-jellyfish appetizer: I love cold jellyfish and theirs is awesome. With kimchee seasoning and on top of pickled white radish and onions, it's a great way to start dinner. \n\n-fried shrimp: light and seasoned well. Served with great sweet and sour sauce. A must try. \n\n-walnut shrimp: crispy with a nice lemon mayo sauce and sweet, crunchy walnuts with sesame seeds. My favorite dish and they make it right!\n\n-marinated crispy chicken with seasoned salt: OMG. So good. Well seasoned, very crispy skin and lots on the plate. A must have when you come here. The chicken is marinated for a day, at least, because the marination was down to the bone. \n\n-salt and pepper pork chop: finally made right. Light and crispy, sliced with bone and topped with fried garlic minced up with peppers. It was heaven. \n\n-egg drop soup: thick, eggy and mushroomy. I loved it. \n\nOverall this is the only place I will be from now on when I crave Chinese cuisine. It's not out if this world orgasmic, but comforting and very, VERY good. I'm already craving more!
