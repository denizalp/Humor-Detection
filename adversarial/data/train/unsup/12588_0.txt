I really enjoy the Westin Casuarina, and this restaurant located inside is no different.\nThey are open  24\/7 and the staff is very friendly.\n\nWe ordered a few appetizers for the table. I only tried the calamri, and it was good. It wasn't as crunchy as I usually like, but it wasn't soggy either. \n\nI avoided the lettuce wraps because it looked a little weird, but my cousin seemed to really like it.\nI ordered the fish and chips and it was good, although the fries are skinny fries and I prefer fatter fries. \nThe waiter was very good, and I really liked the way he poured a beer. It was a very cool trick where he holds the beer glass against the tray sideways and pours the beer as he brings the tray right side up. I'm not sure if I'm explaining it well, but it was pretty cool.
