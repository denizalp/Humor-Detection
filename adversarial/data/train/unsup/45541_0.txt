I love kayaking at Wingra Boats! \n\nI've been kayaking out here several times now. I try to get out here at least once a summer, if not more. The pricing is fair, the service is good, and the lake is the perfect size. It's relatively small, but that's really nice for the novice boater. Never have to worry about getting washed out too far or anything. \n\nWingra Boats has several water vessels to choose from. Single kayaks, double kayaks, canoes, row boats, paddle boats, even stand-up paddle boards. Whatever you're looking for, they got it! Each type has an hourly fee. Your first hour is $XX and then they round to the half hour for time after. Every time I have been in, if I have been over just a little on time, they have rounded down. Very nice of them! \n\nI have taken my dog kayaking out here several times now as well. The first time I showed up with my dog I wasn't sure if they were even going to allow in a boat, but they sure did! They thought it was awesome. I always end up renting a double kayak. Doggo up front, me in the back. It works out super well - and he is not a small guy by any means. \n\nThere are shallow areas around the lake that are great for hopping out the boats and splashing around in. Or if you're like me and have an animal with you, it's nice for them as well instead of swimming in the deeper waters. \n\nThe lake also bumps up to the Arboretum, so you can hop out and explore over there too. Just make sure your boats don't float away!
