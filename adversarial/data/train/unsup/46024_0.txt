At the end of our Vegas trip, we wanted a decent breakfast spot away from the strip because all the good ones around the area were packed. This place was recommended, so we decided to check this modern breakfast spot out. I only wish that this place was closer to the strip. I guess that's why it was so easy to find a table to fit our group of 6 right away.\n\nFood:\n1) Coffee Cake was fantastic! The coffee cake here deserves 5 Stars. It was freshly baked, soft, moist, and perfectly sweet. I would actually make a pit stop here just for this if I'm driving to and from Vegas\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2?select=6Nzg1wAdBviOQNXVmfXlkg#oZXMxk_GLSoepyhkWveiJQ\n\n2) Country Benny - Biscuit split and topped with patty sausage, two poached eggs, and smothered in gravy. I liked the gravy because it was flavorful and had a good consistency (not too watery or too thick). The eggs were poached well and the seasoned potatoes were so good! \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2?select=6Nzg1wAdBviOQNXVmfXlkg#V-3L8nJ43gnSCuKv08V0wQ\n\n3) Sausage and Eggs were pretty standard thick links with eggs and seasoned potatoes. It was good, but nothing special. You could probably buy the same links at a market and make it yourself.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2?select=6Nzg1wAdBviOQNXVmfXlkg#fbjiuYm9Je2vHxb9QXLOaw\n\nService:\nThe servers were very nice and checked on us regularly to see how we were doing. You actually have to go up to the front to pay, which I found to be pretty inconvenient.
