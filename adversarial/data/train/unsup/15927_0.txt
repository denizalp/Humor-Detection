Oh my do these people deserve their 2.5 stars!\n\nI have been going to this place for as long as I can remember, every time that my tradeshow pops up at Mandalay Bay. And it gets worse, and worse and finally - disaster!\n\nFirst, I have to say that they have this incredibly amusing waitress who is any other Cantonese style Hong Kong restaurant, would be just as incomprehensible but alas...would only serve you great food, even if it was still moving when it arrived. Living in Hong Kong, I met plenty of ladies like this. And none would have ever remained in a job at such a terrible excuse of a Chinese restaurant. Even by Qwai Lo standards - this was a disaster.\n\nWe had a bunch of dishes. The fish was fishy in smell. The noodles - bland. The chicken tastes better in those free samples given out at shopping malls. \n\nIt was honestly one of the worst places I have eaten food at - period.\n\nThe hotel gave me a 100 dollar gift certificate after we complained about our 45$ meal. They own the Noodle Shop and if they ever bother to read their reviews, it is a real wonder why they don't switch up the chefs\/staff and management - fast!
