Sooooo excited to have finally tried this place. I'm a diehard NKOTB fan so, quite obviously, once I heard that Donnie, Paul and Mark were going to expand their chain all of the way up here to Toronto- the countdown commenced..... more than once because the opening date kept changing, but whatever.\nAnyways. The day came. I had checked out the menu online, so I knew roughly what to expect. The restaurant is clean and bright with lots of homages to the two celebrity brothers plastered all over the walls and televisions. It's fast food meets sports bar meets cafeteria meets sit-down restaurant. Nice, casual vibe with friendly staff- but the seating is lacklustre and spaced a little too closely together. The seats are lime green and feel cheap. They sell merchandise, but it's nothing special and slightly overpriced.\nNow- down to the food. \nFirstly- it came quickly. No more than 10 mins tops.\nMy boyfriend had a burger with sweet tater tots and I had the melt sandwich with French fries.\nBurger- flavour was good, bun was good, meat was slightly overlooked and dry. 7\/10.\nTater tots- slightly warmer than room temperature and wish they had a crispier texture. 7.5\/10\nThe Melt- 10\/10. One of the bed sandwiches\/burgers I've ever had in my life. \nFries- comparable to Burger King. Crispy and flavourful but over-salted. 7.5\/10\n\nI would 100% go back and try something new. I think it's adorable that they have their mother's pasta salad as a menu item. Jenny McCarthy also has a chicken sandwich on the menu. Too bad I hate Jenny McCarthy.\n\nAn automatic 18% gratuity is added to the bill, so just don't be surprised when you see that circled in pen by your waitress when it's presented to you.
