Yueh Tung (pronounced \"yueh tung\") is a Hakka Chinese restaurant at the corner of Dundas and Elizabeth, right above Pho Orchid. The entrance is on Elizabeth St, so you'll have to head a bit south of Dundas to find it. Once you've ascended the opulent carpeted stairs, you'll find the glory of Yueh Tung. I was worried at first by the row of seated patrons at the entrance, but it turns out they were waiting for takeout (a good sign). We headed for the maitre d' and Even though the restaurant was packed on a Friday night, we snagged a table pretty quickly.\n\nThree of us ordered the Hakka chow mein, BBQ pork fried rice, chili chicken and hot and sour soup. It's a good thing we ordered the \"small\" soup portion because it was enough to feed eight people. I can't imagine why our waiter even gave us the option. Would he have brought us the large if we asked for that? I could imagine him clunking it down with both arms. \"Here's your punch bowl of soup. Idiots.\"\n\nLet it be known: the portion sizes at YT are enormous. Minutes after ordering we were buried. The chow mein was cooked in a sweet soya sauce and was really nice. I've been spoiled by other hot and sour soups in the city, so I can only give theirs a 'meh.' The chili chicken was OK, but a bit overcooked and saddest of all: not spicy. The BBQ pork fried rice was BBQ pork fried rice, so I liked it.\n\nSo, while I was underwhelmed by the food, I'd have to say this place gets major points for value and service. Dinner for three clocked in around $30 including tip AND we had tonnes of leftovers. We also espied more than a few sizzling dishes pass our table, and wished we had gotten us some of that. I'll give them another try.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: Get this TUNG in your cheeks.\n\nMenu Readability: It's pretty long, but all your options are well-laid out.\n\nNeed to mention: They accept debit and credit.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I can't pronounce Yueh Tung.
