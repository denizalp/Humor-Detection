I just wanted to compare the top ranking buffet restaurants in the Vegas,  based on the USA Today's report. The decoration of the buffet restaurant in the Bellagio is not as impressive as the ones in the Caesar Place or the Wynn. The foods, however, were quite in par with the two. The cost here in cheaper too. For me, the foods in the top three ranked buffet restaurants are quite similar, so either one would do the trick. If you are not going for the decoration, then Bellagio would be the one for you.
