I needed to look for a place and I have been exhausted from looking on days on end. I had my first exchange with Paramount Properties with Leah, she was very knowledgeable and personable. She made me feel welcomed and assured me that they would find something for my fianc√© and I. She was patient and regularly keep me informed. Leah communicated and set expectations all with positive attitude. I'm so glad we got to meet her and made our process smooth. I've worked with other property management companies in the past and none of them compare to Paramount Properties. I highly recommend them and will use them again in the future. Ask for Leah super attentive.
