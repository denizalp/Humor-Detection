I see a whole new world today thanks to the folks at Central Phoenix Eye Care... \n\nYou see, I've been alternating between two pairs of prescription glasses and a pair of broken prescription sunglasses that had all seen better days for a while now... (I know, kind of embarrassing!)\n\nBut I had my somewhat annual visit yesterday and walked out of the office with what feels like three brand new pairs of glasses!  They were all cleaned up, tightened, fixed, etc... and in addition, I learned from Dr. Thompson that my vision seemed to improve a bit from my last visit!\n\nThe staff was friendly, they take my insurance, and I didn't have a wait at all!  They also have a decent variety of frames to choose from.  If you're in need of an eye doctor, you cannot go wrong with Central Phoenix Eye Care!
