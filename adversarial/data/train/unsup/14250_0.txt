Really pricey for what you get but convenient location keeps me going there. The lower experienced stylists are better value and they give decent cuts. Avoid Robbie. His ego is beyond his skillset, and while he has a good skillset, I can't put up with his \"you're so lucky to be in my presence, and I'll pawn you off on all my jrs, and be 40 minutes overtime working on you because I talk so much to the salon girls around me\" attitude.
