Had a really enjoyable time here.  service was great.  food was delicious. I had the dinner special.  it's the semi-serious burger built to my specifications with a side of their onion rings and of course a shake!  birthday cake and cookie dough!!!  The servers were very attentive.  There was two and both seemed very happy to help us.  We will be back!
