The show itself wasn't bad, but a lot of the songs I know were changed (performed differently), so there weren't a lot of opportunities to sing-along. We were given \"lighters\" - fake LED ones of course, but there was little indication when yo use them, so you can see people sporadically using them here and there, but not all at once, which was the main idea, I presume. The actors\/singers were so-so, with few exceptions.\n\nI think that the show was very demeaning to women, and made me feel uncomfortable for the women cast. The public was not engaged at all, but there was a good reason, as stated above. The music was good.
