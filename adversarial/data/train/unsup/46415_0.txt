ordered a swimming top online on Dec 26 2017....but was unhappy to see that they had the same exact item listed twice, same color, everything..for  $13 cheaper...I called customer service for a $13 refund.....was told no...because the item TECHNICALLY had a different item number..even though it was the identical product...so it was a different shipment from the company I was told...the manager offered me 15% discount on another item online, but I said no thank you, why would I bother when you get 10% off your first purchase anyway, and I hadn't yet signed up for the mailing list. Moral of story.....be very careful when shopping on there website...there is no way this sort of thing would fly in a retail store.
