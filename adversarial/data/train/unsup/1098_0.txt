If Top's Liquor were a friend of mine, he'd have a serious Identity Crisis with Attention Deficient Disorder. All the more reason to adore him, right? After all, he'd be the life of the party! \n\nWhen you walk into Tops, you see what can only be described as Sensory Overload. From boxes and boxes aligning the walls and stacked at the ends of the aisles to hanging paraphernalia, it's no wonder you get side-tracked so easily. What did I come here for?\n\nOh, right. Beer! \n\nHaving heard Top's sells Aquavit, a hard-to-come-by Swedish liquor, I had a feeling Top's would also carry some of my fave beer. Sure enough, although I'm sad to report they didn't have everything I was looking for. Where are you Hazelnut Brown? Where have you gone? \n\nApparently at Top's, you can pick and choose the beers you buy, for many of the 6-packs were half-full (or half-empty, if you're a pessimist). This intrigued and irked me, for I didn't want to BYO6P (Build Your Own 6 Pack) if I came with one thing in mind: 6 bottles of delicious Breckenridge, Rogue or other brewed delights. Then again, if I can hand-select my 6-pack, that's cool, too. (I just wasn't sure I could, and I was too shy to try.) \n\nSo I went with 3 bottles of beer: two Rogue I've never tried (American Amber and Moto Black) and one nut brown from Full Sail, an Oregon brewery.\n\nThe selection here is great! They even had a newly discovered Sundog Amber Wheat, as well as a new ale from Breckenridge I've never seen anywhere else. There's also plenty of Alaskan and many, many, many other breweries present - on the shelf or in the fridge. They even sell Peroni! (Haven't found that anywhere else.)\n\nI wondered toward the East wall, passing by Belgian Ales and others that intrigued me. I've never seen anything like it. Top's has the biggest selection of corked beer I've ever seen.  \n\nI tossed a glance at the Wine selection and decided to come another time when I was in the mood for vino. \n\nUpon checkout, I asked if they carried Rogue's Hazelnut Brown. The guy behind the counter went to look, grabbing a couple stacks of boxes and peering behind them at a whole 'nother stack of boxes. Guess they didn't have it, though he said they usually do. Hrm. \n\nFor 3 big bottles of beer, I paid a little over $15. Each beer was about $5, which is a great price! \n\nI will DEFINITELY be back!\n\n(Top's would've gotten a 5-star from me, IF they had had Rogue's Hazelnut Brown waiting for me. Shame on them...)\n\nJUNE '08 UPDATE:\nSo, Top's does carry the Hazelnut Brown. Yet, just as I have fallen in love with another Rogue beer - the black Moto Soba ale - I am having no luck finding it here, even though this is where I first bought it. Alas, I will resort to mixing-and-matching my 6-packs to explore other brews, like Full Sail and Lost Coast.
