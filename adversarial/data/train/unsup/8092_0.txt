A decent option for higher-end sushi without going to downtown Toronto? I had the omakase sushi and everything tasted fresh, as expected at this price point, but I felt the sushi was nothing special, quite large, and the amount of rice a little too much. If my judgement were to be based on the sushi alone, I would probably give it 2 stars.\n\nDessert, however, is where everything changed. I started with the houjicha ice cream, which was packed with flavour and left me wanting another scoop after the first bite. But then, I got a taste of the tohnyu (soy milk) ice cream from somebody else and decided I had to order one just for myself. If it wasn't for the hefty $8 per scoop price tag, I probably would have ordered at least 2 more scoops that night. Their ice cream is the only reason I would consider coming back. Each scoop made me want to give it an extra star so... 4 stars.
