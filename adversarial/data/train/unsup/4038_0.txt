Definitely want to come back to try the slices- they're oversized and look incredible. However, being that I'm trying to stay away from carbs currently, I went for the protein bowl. The lady taking my order suggested the Diablo bowl which has grilled chicken, cheese, onion and Jalapeños. Personally, I would not reorder again. Too much cheese and way too many jalapeños. And they're hidden, so it's challenging to avoid them. I eat unhealthy stuff fairly frequently, but this made my tummy hurt. My coworker had the meat lovers, and it looked killer good. Wings also looked yummy. They offer $3 wine with purchase of a slice and have $5 wine Wednesday, Sat and Sun specials.
