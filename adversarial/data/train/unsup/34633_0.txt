This is my favorite Brazillian steak house in town. I like Texas De Brazil, but this place is more homely. It's intimate, the staff treats you like family and the owner is a character! \n\nThe rodizio meats are excellent. The banana is sweet crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, The rodizio pineapple is stellar, The fried cornmeal is phenomenal, the service is amazeballs, and the price is decent. MUST TRY.
