I want to give a shout out to Diamondback Cleaners.  I needed my daughter's wedding dress cleaned and had a short timeline to get it done.  Not only did they do a great job, they were SO kind and passionate about their business.  I truly left there feeling like part of their family.  I highly recommend using them for your dry cleaning needs.  TWO thumbs up!
