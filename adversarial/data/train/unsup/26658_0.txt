These gals are nothing short of perfect business women. We met the gals at a wedding that our business was  catering. I was a little embarrassed to ask them to list our house over Instagram, but so glad I did.  Our house had previously been on the market for 6 LONG months and NOTHING. \nChristie and Jennifer both made the trek out to our house and met. They both were knowledgeable and professional. We signed and listed on a Friday and had a deal by Saturday. I know not all real estate deals work like this, but glad ours did.\nI will shout from the mountain tops how awesome this company is. If you ever need an agent please save yourself the homework and research and just call. You will NOT be sorry.
