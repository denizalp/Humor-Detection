This is the place to go if you want a great home cooked Italian meal! No high sodium processed Olive Garden crap. Everything was exceptional! We got the stuffed peppers for an appetizer, sapori ravioli and chicken Francese. The sauces were home made deliciousness and nothing was left on the plate. We ate everything! They are not stingy with their bread! We had three baskets. A true hidden gem of an Italian restaurant!
