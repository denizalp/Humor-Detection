This Place has been here forever. I mean as long as I can remember.\nIt is a family owned bussiness which to me the great!\nIt is close to where I drive by a lot and a nice big parking lot as well.\n\nI have shoes inserts this time that I took in to have repaired. They said they would have them ready the next day, and they did. Good as new.Plus a resonable price as well.\nI have bought all sorts of shoes here over the years to be repaired , and I have always been happy with the results.  They are open Monday thru Saturday. \nWhat more could you want?
