Major disappointment for a vegetarians.\n\nWhen I saw a specific \"veggie\" taco\/burrito on the menu, I knew I had to try the place out. Plus the prices were so great, that what could go wrong?\n\nI had one Veggie Street Taco and one Cheese Enchilada with verde sauce. My taco was suppose to be topped with onions, cliantro and salsa - didn't happen. The veggies consisted of onions, bell peppers and potatoes. Who puts regular potatoes in a taco?! My tortilla was dripping in oil, that I couldn't even eat it. The verde sauce on my enchilada was incredibly bland. Everything was meh to me.\n\nThen I saw a sign for Taco Tuesday, $1 tacos! Talk about great price. BUT the real icing on the cake of this experience was that veggie tacos do not qualify for this special. \n\nOverall, definitely won't return due to the lack of vegetarian options.
