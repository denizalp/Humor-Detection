Stayed here for the weekend while attending CES 2010 with a group of friends (six of us in total).  We got one of the suites with the two connecting rooms and it was such a nice experience!  The only thing I thought was a little troublesome was that we were a good 10 or so minutes away from the strip with no shuttles to take us there so we had to drive ourselves.\n\nI did like how the rooms were well-equipped for our needs especially the kitchen appliances and the washer\/dryer set (definitely helpful since I didn't feel like doing laundry when I got home a few days later).  Everything seemed to work out in terms of living arrangements and we all had a nice time.  We were mostly out and about while in Vegas so we didn't get to fully explore the resort.  However, the prices were nice as it didn't cost us an arm and a leg to stay there.\n\nI don't think we were coaxed to go into a timeshare presentation this time around which was good I suppose.  Though I heard that they give out vouchers for buffets which would have been great for us.  \n\nI'll definitely have to keep this place in mind when planning out trips to Vegas in the future... it's no fancy hotel like those on the Strip, but it has its own good features... worth checking out!
