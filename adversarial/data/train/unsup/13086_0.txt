After a pathetic attempt to play pool at the neighboring Gorilla Cafe, several of us meandered over to Badger Cafe for some grub.\n\nBC is attached to the RumRunner Bar.  The first thing i notice when walking into BC is that thick grease SMELL.  Man, they are seriously competing with Geri's Philly Cheesesteak for not only the strongest grease smell but the \" take me back to the 60's\/70's coffee shop motiff.  Personally, I dig it !!\n\nBut hey, it don't mean a thang if the food don't swing.  Again, for me, the food works but let's get real, the place is a hole in the wall grease pit so go in knowing and understanding that.\n\nI went with the build your own burger - added bacon, egg, swiss cheese and grilled onion.  Also went with the homemade potato chips.  The server suggested i go with her \" off the menu\" option of vinegar and garlic salt added to the chips, \" Sure!\"\n\nThe burger was perfectly cooked.  As what has become the norm lately, more salt needed on the burger ( is it me ??) great bacon and the egg hit the spot.  Minor ding - the swiss cheese slice was paltry and did little for the overall burger.  \n\nAs far as the chips - really pleased to see they are krinkle\/dip chip style - nice !  As to the garlic salt and vinegar - sorry, i wasn't feeling it - i'll stick to the garlic salt next time.\n\nThe group also ordered chicken wings ( didn't try ) and cheese curds - did try and loved them !   \n\nSaddened i couldn't get a Wisconsin Beer to go with the grub ( asked about Point Beer and Leinenkugel but i got a blank stare - settled for a blue moon ) \n\nI will return \n\npics attached
