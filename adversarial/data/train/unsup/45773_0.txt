I've been here a couple times, most recently I ordered the fettucine alfredo with chicken and I must say it was REALLY good.  If you like buttery creamy sauce with grilled chicken breast and noodles, this is great.  Service hasn't been the greatest either time I have come here though which is kind of annoying.  Also, this building is relatively small, although there is an outdoor patio.  It appears to be a brand new building too which is kind of nice.  Also, there is a TV in the main dining room so you can catch sports or news or whatever.
