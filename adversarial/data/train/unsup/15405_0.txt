Purhcased new tires and rims from them and from the day 1 of the purchase, there is vibratiton.\nHave gone back twice to re-balance but the vibration is still present.\nOwner says from the beginning that there is nothing wrong with the RIM from his experiences.\n\nI have replaced the tires through Michelin Warranty from the Michelin Dealer which this shop is not even under as Michelin Dealer.\nOther tire shop that has replaced my tires through Michelin Warranty tells me that the two rims had runout which makes perfect sense on why I was getting all this vibration. Now the owner and the DAI RIM distributor that works together will not replace two RIMs because I don't have a proper report that shows that the RIMs are defective. Since this tire shop does not have equipment to measure any defects in the RIM and Tires, I am forced to go to another tire shop and pay extra to get the report.\n\nI can understand that he has been in this business for long time but this shop just does not have the proper equipment like bigger tire shops that can detect the issues even before installing them.\n\nSure the shop provides competitive pricing but you get what you pay for.\n\nDo not buy from this shop unless you want to get yourself into more troubles.\n\nAlso this Atbin from DAI distributor, what a great sales manager who only cares about his numbers.\nKeep trying to make your money and meet your numbers you are the number one sale that makes 10 million dollar sales
