WTF - WHY THE FILTH\n\nThe same coupon mentioned by another reviewer brought me here, except I just came for a basic cut. \n\nThe salon feels like a 16 year old girl's bedroom during a slumber party: chatterbox females squawking with each other plus girlie magazines and three or four hairbrushes lying around. WITH HAIR ON THEM.\n\nThe cut took all of 15 minutes and was confusing. She cut hurriedly holding the scissors with two hands and went straight into styling my hair. The whole thing felt rushed, like the coupon was getting me a discount on quality, too.\n\nShe grabbed a hairdryer and my world went into slo-mo as I looked in the mirror and saw her reaching for a disgusting round brush on an ottoman that had been sitting there since I came in, majorly wrapped in a 1\/4 inch of other people's hair. In my mind I was thinking OMG NO. OMG NOOO. OMG EWWWWWW as she began blow drying and foofing my hair out with the grody brush. That is how people get psoriasis and lice. I probably have both now. Let's hug.\n\nIn the end the cut looked okay when I left the salon but my head was so itchy that I washed my hair as soon as I got home. Once I combed it out the right side was longer than the left and my bangs had a weird slope.\n\nI would contact the salon to get a touch-up and complain but it was just so dirty in there that I don't ever want to go back.\n\nI've been generous and given this place two stars because they do free bang trims. I guess if you like your haircut and don't mind the grimy setting then this is a nice plus.\n\nI feel bad calling this place out so hard but I am being honest. Like my boss says about business in the current economy, only the best should survive. Major improvement needed. This place feels ripe for fungus.\n\nGrade: F \n\nFILTH\nFOULNESS\nFAIL.\n\nBrooke had a really pretty long dress on though.
