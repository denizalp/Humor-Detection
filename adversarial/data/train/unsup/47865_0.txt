TLDR: Worth going. You need to do what Dr Waltz suggests, but it will 100% be worth the effort. Went from 10 years + of chronic pain, to (at week 4) being able to wake up and move around again without being worried about managing my pain. \n\n\n\n____________________________\nMy Reasons For Going:\n10 + years of severe Chronic lower back pain. Couldn't walk talk sleep eat or breathe without being in moderate to severe pain. My entire life was dictated by how bad the pain was that day.\n\nFound a Groupon with a great deal.\n\n____________________________\nPros:\n- The 1st chiropractor that has truly helped me.\n- Doesn't want me to be a long-term patient. (Most chiros want you to go come 1 or 2 x,s a week forever. Just whenever you need it)\n- Starts with Xrays and wants to do them again in 4-8 weeks again to prove what he is doing works. \n\nCons:\n- None to speak of that I can think of. Really a great overall experience. \n- Plan for your first few visits to take some extra time, because Dr. Waltz is getting to know how your body responds to the treatment, as well as he wants to make sure you're comfortable throughout the process.\n_____________________________________\n\nWhat to expect when you're getting started  \n\n1. The first visit (consultation) took an hour. (X-rays and exams). Hour-ish for two people. (My wife and I are both going together)\n\n2. The second visit we reviewed Xrays and got our first adjustment. Hour-ish as well. Dr. Waltz explain the Xrays in detail so we both felt 100% comfortable with the process. We were even given copies of the Xrays for our personal records.\n____________________________\n\nFirst Week: 5\/8\/17\n3 adjustments. \nTues Weds and Thursday. \n\nFor the first time,  I am seeing hope for my back pain and it has only been a week. \nMy back used to crack and pop every time I moved. My lower back was in piercing pain.\n\n5\/15\/2017\nWeek 2:\n3 adjustments again this week. \n\nFor the first time, my muscles around my trouble spots are actually relaxing.\nI am feeling a relief from pain already, which is a massive feat. \nMy pain has switched from joint pain to muscle pain. \n\nI am beyond excited to finally have a solution to my chronic severe back pain. I can't believe it was this easy. Honestly came down to going to the right chiropractor. This is my 5th doctor I've worked with, and it is the first time it has actually worked. \n\nMore Updates to come. Really hopeful now for the first time in over 10 years.\n\n5\/22\nWeek 3:\n2 Adjustments this week.\n\nStarted doing stretches and workouts at home this week. \nThis was the week of muscle soreness, which is a great change from joint\/spine pain. \nHad a few times this week where I woke up without any pain. \n\nPain is now manageable. No longer taking pain medicine all day. Keeping the ice-pack close to keep down joint\/muscle swelling as my body adjusts to the new alignment.\n\n5\/29\/17\nWeek 4:\n2 Adjustments this week.\n\nDoing more workouts and stretches this week. Muscles are still sore, but the workouts are easier now. Still some joint\/back pain but it's only been 4 weeks. \nAt this point, my body is just tense and tight, so doing more stretches and keeping up with the workout this week.\n\nStill not needing pain meds any longer. Ice pack still close by. I find that when I start to feel tight, I put on the ice-pack and it prevents the pain from getting worse.\n\n\n6\/5\/17\nWeek 5:\n2 Adjustments this week.\n\nWaking up without being in any pain this week 3 days now. Starting more aggressive stretching and workouts. The muscles are the biggest obstacle at this point. Minor joint pain still in my trouble spots. \n\nNo pain meds. Minimal ice pack. Still icing at night when I get into bed and right after adjustments to keep swelling down.
