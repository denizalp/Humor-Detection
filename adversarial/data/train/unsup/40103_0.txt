This is honestly the WORST car wash I've been to. I have been there a total of two times. The first time, my car looked somewhat decent but I've gotten way better car washes at other companies. I thought I would give them another chance and took my car in for a full inside and out cleaning. My car doesn't even look like it was cleaned at all!! There's still dust on my dashboard, there's bird poop still on my rear passenger door, and you can't even tell that my vehicle was cleaned both inside and out. This place is a corporate rip off and I wasted my money giving them another chance. They lost a good paying customer today, I will not be returning to Cobblestone or any of their locations. Extremely disappointed.
