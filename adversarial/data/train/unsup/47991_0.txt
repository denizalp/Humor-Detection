I've updated my review because I didn't realize I never tried their Malaysian choices, which is ironic. This is one of a few places in Mississauga that offer it, but taste is pretty spot on. Favourites include the Malaysian Laksa, Bah Kut Teh (herb infused meat) Noodles, Street Style Sandwich. They have lots of other interesting options like French Toast with Kaya spread, Malaysian Curry, etc. Overall lots of different options to try.\n\nI also had their Egg Crepes, which were tasty but a bit pricy for the portion. Signature Milk Tea also very tasty. The only thing I tried and would not reorder is the Potato Croquette given the price for size, and the Minced Meat\/Fish Ball Noodle Soup (given how flavorful the other noodles they have are).\n\nWhile I wouldn't consider this the cheapest breakfast\/brunch option, it certainly is still filling and affordable (less than $10 for most entrees) Also good variety and unique with the various Malaysian based dishes offered. Casual environment makes it nice and unassuming for a table of 2-4. It can get quite busy however.\n\nNow that I have revisited, this will be on one of my top breakfast\/lunch places to come back to or hangout with visiting guests or friends.
