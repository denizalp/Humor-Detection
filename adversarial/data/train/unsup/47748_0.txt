Absolutely love this gym. I can't stand a lot of the chains like LA or 24 because they're always so overcrowded and overpriced. Independence is a great place for people that want to lift and has an excellent range of dumbbells and hammer strength machines. \n\nI hadn't ever done any personal training but after watching the trainers here and overhearing the tricks and advise they were giving their clients I decided to give it a try. My trainer, Dom, has really shown me how to take things to the next level and I think a lot of the trainers at this gym would. That's the culture here, people are very friendly out everything they have into it while they're there.
