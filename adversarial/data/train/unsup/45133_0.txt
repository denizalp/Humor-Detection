Oh man! What a treat! \nOf course I ordered the softshell crab sandwich, and obviously upgraded the fries to crab-i-fy (not a real term)!\nIt's an entire softshell crab deep-fried into the sandwich all delicious on great bun and trimmings. The fries with the crab on poutine style is just out of this world! \nIt's not cheap lunch and be warned that you will not be productive at work all afternoon trying to digest I all (portion is huge) but oh so worthy indulgence
