I just got coupons to this place in the mail. I went with a friend and we were impressed with how large it is. The hostess was kind and showed us to our booth. The Sushi is spot on. I think this place will be my new go to place for Sushi and Asian food. If you have kids who do not like Asian food, they have pizza, French fries and chicken too. I would highly recommend to anybody. Don't let the negative reviews sway your opinion. It is the best out there.
