8\/11\/09\n\nFinally visited!  I've wanted to check out Cerreta's since I moved to the valley...  I expected it to be huge and bustling with people, but there were only about two to four customers there when I arrived (around 4:30pm).  Definitely more employees than there were customers.  The layout of the merchandise area also made me feel like I was in someone's unfinished basement, where a few tables were set up and piles of chocolates were just laid out haphazardly. The Godiva chocolate and company merchandise areas of Barnes & Noble's cafe at the Chandler Fashion Center blow this store out of the water in presentation and organization, if that says anything to you at all...  Heck, even the simple layout design of Cucina Olive Oils is much more inviting...\n\nSampled some of the truffles (the rectangular green mint ones are EXACTLY like Fannie May Mint Meltaways I had tried back in Chicago years ago).  Liked how I could pick and choose the amount and variety and then pay per pound!  Wished there were more chocolate varieties (truffles, bars, pretzels), though.  I'm surprised not to find any chocolate-covered grahams, or even smore's in their inventory.  The chocolate-covered pretzels were OK, although a bit too salty for me, but that's usually the deal with chocolate pretzels here in the US, isn't it?  For diabetics and dieters, there are sugar-free selections, but these are very limited, in amount and, most importantly, in variety (I counted maybe 5 or 6 flavors).  \n\nCurrently, there are two daily tours, at a going rate of $7 per person, which include a complimentary personal-sized create-your-own chocolate pizza (just like you can make your own chocolate pizzas at the annual Glendale Chocolate Affaire, hosted by Cerreta's, no less, at the park nearby).  As of visit's date, the tour runs for half an hour, and starts at 10a and 1p.
