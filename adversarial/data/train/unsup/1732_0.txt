WHAT TO TRY?!\n\nThe hot subs. I was debating between the Smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket sub and the firehouse hero. But honestly, all the specialty subs are worth a try!\n\nThe restaurant started in the States and now their franchise is slowly opening more in Canada. Now there are over six locations in Ontario alone, this restaurant's theme is firefighter themed due to the origins of the founders. \n\nThe subs come in 6 or 12 inches and they are made fresh to order! There are also lots of complimentary free toppings to add to your sub of choice so you really can load up the sub. \n\nI also tried the butternut squash soup. The soup comes with a bag of crackers. Nothing particularly stood out to me about the soup though. \n\nThe smokehouse beef brisket is smoked for 16 hours before it's served on the sub so you're guaranteed some smokiness in the sub. \n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nIf you order a drink, you fill it up yourself with their Coca Cola touchscreen machine so that means you can fill up as many different drinks you want, however many times you want. The 6 inch is a decent size for lunch and or dinner because they really stack it up with lots of meat and toppings however if you really hungry, go for the full 12 inch sub!
