Had reservations here for 830 pm. Just like with d bar, the service started out strong and got weaker as the night went on. Hostess was super friendly and the table was great.  First strike of the night was that when our server came to take drinks orders after a gazillion years, i asked for him to take the food order as well, and refused.  Only drink orders. (Only other restaurant I've had that happen at is zakkushi, not really the same calibre as Boulud).  But not only would he not take our food orders then, but not even after taking the drinks order and even not after bringing the drinks.  This to me is akin to asking for the bill and them dropping it off and not returning - I've told you verbally what I want and you won't do it for me. Ugh.\n\nFinally after forty minutes we were allowed to order food. Everything took so damn log. We weren't eating until 90 minutes in, and then when we went to pay, it took like 45 minutes. from when we asked for the bill, someone's ride had come from 25 minutes away where they live to get her (she text when we asked for the bill) and was just sitting waiting because it was taking us so long.\n\nAs for the food, I found it okay. The fries were yummy and I liked the three side condiments, but I did cut the roof of my mouth on a really friggin sharp fry.  Not a sentence I often write. The burger supposed had pork belly on it? But it was pretty flavourless and I had to add mayo to the burger to give it flavour. The bun was awful. Side of mushrooms was typical, but overpriced. \n\nI did like my $13 glass of red as well as the bathrooms were very nice.  Felt like the whole thing could have been elevated , the experience did not match the ambiance.
