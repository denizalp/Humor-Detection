Whether you are new to the sport of Muay Thai, or just want to learn, Sitan is the place to be. Thiago is one of the nicest and most patient people you will ever meet. He makes certain that if you are in his gym, you leave each class learning something new. He doesn't rush and make you feel lesser if you don't get it right out. He keeps working with you until you do. Everyone of the other coaches are the same way. They all genuinely care for you, regardless of whether you are planning to fight or doing this to get in shape. Try it out sometime.. I promise you won't be disappointed.
