I hate being not only the 1st review but also a bad one. I went to this location a couple days ago and the tech I had was extremely nice. I knew my face would be a little red from my brow was but I have 3 burns on my face. I called the location today and the young lady that answered the phone made me feel it was by fault that my face was burned. no apology or offer to have me go in and have a tech take a look at it just....oh well you should have said it was too hot...I KNOW THAT! It wasnt that hot I didnt think and I am not the tech! they should know if its too hot! As a result I will be taking my business somewhere else.
