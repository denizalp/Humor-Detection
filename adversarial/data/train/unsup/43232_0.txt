Pros:\n\nVery clean, nice staff (and pretty), the bathroom has a cool design, the few patrons that I talked to were friendly, the layout of the whole gym is pretty cool\n\n\n\nCons:\n\nThe leg area and leg equipment are lacking at the expense of rather useless upper body machines with too much redundancy (people mostly use the staples, those machines are always busy while alot of machines just collect dust). There is no place to deadlift. Only one squat rack and one power rack. This could be a big turn off for a lot of lifters. No pullover machine, I have never been to a gym that didn't have a pullover machine. I think if they replaced some rarely used equipment with more popular, and practical equipment and added a platform or two for deadlifting (or even just created an open space for it) this gym would be a more appealing. \n\n\nOverall, it was alright. I would choose to lose some of the flashiness and unpopular machines for a bigger emphasis on practical, popular equipment.
