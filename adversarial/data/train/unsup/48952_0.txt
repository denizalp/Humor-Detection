My brother and I are just visiting for two days on a road trip to CA and saw the reviews on yelp. It is a nice, pleasant breakfast atmosphere with kind servers and a cool wall mural. The food was great as well, and you definitely get your bang for your buck (a.k.a lots of food). The protein pancakes were excellent, just like the server suggested. Overall great place to wake up and eat in Scottsdale. Doesn't get a five star though because nothing really WOWED us, but it was good food.
