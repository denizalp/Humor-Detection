Maybe it is the small, non-threatening nature of being tucked into a shopping plaza between an Albertsons and Port of Subs - but I was not expecting much from Taste Tea. You wouldn't even know this place existed if you weren't specifically looking for a new boba place on Yelp. Speaking of new boba, the bubble tea scene here is exploding and of places that have only been open for the last six months Taste Tea is certainly in the top three! So how did this gem go from low-expectations to a new favorite? They just made me a bomb-AF tea. \n\nI asked for the oolong cloud tea and the owner asked me where I had it before and grilled me a little about if I knew what it was. I am assuming people have been ordering it by accident and not liking it? He even gave me a sample of their mango green tea. That was super good! I can imagine running in just for that in the summer - it was so refreshing and it didn't taste too artificial. I stuck with my guns though and got the cloud tea and I am so happy I did.  That sea salt cream was thick! I literally went to stir it, felt the resistance, and went \"ohhhhh\" out loud. \n\nI've been craving it everyday since I tried it. Will be back soon!
