One would think that it's easy to find quality Mexican food in Arizona, and while there are plenty of Mexican restaurants in the Valley, there aren't many that boast quality food, service and atmosphere.  Mejico Coina Mejicana is one of them that does all of the above...\n\nI've been twice so far and been super pleased both times.  I went on a date one time and on a double date the next time, so I tried a few dishes as we shared on both occasions.  Chris was our waiter the first time and Katie the next.  Both recommended the Shrimp Relleno.  It is awesome.  Don't miss it!\n\nThe cocktails are good, the cervezas are cold, and the chips and guac \/ salsa don't disappoint either.  Atmosphere is casual with just enough Mexican flair... there is seating at the bar, in the restaurant, and on the outdoor patio as well.\n\nSi esta buscando comida mejicana, este es el lugar.  Salud!
