My husband and I have lived at Altessa for 3 years and have enjoyed living here.  The complex is pretty quiet and seems to be comprised of mostly young professionals.  We have not had any problems with the management staff and they have always been flexible with our lease renewals.  The parking can be somewhat of an inconvenience if you have more than one car as there is only one assigned spot if you don't have 2 car garage.
