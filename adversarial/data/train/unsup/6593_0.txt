On my quest to find a good burger for lunch, I decided to eat at SmashBurger because I've always seen it whenever I'm near campus, but all my time I've lived in Vegas (going on my third year now), I really didn't see the need to come in here with In-N-Out being their neighbor. Anyway, I decided to give it a chance and finally ate here. \n\nUpon entering, I was actually a little surprised at how nice the interior looked. It didn't look like it was going to be much from the outside, but the layout of the place is nice and spacious. It has a modern, well-maintained look.\n\nI ordered the mushroom swiss burger with a side of their smash fries.\n\nThe mushroom swiss burger was pretty tasty. I decided to go all out and asked if they could incorporate a fried egg in my burger, which they gladly obliged to do! I wish the egg would be a little runny so the yolk would break and add even more flavor to the burger, but this fried egg sufficed (and I guess it's better not being messy lol). The burger buns were soft, the mushroom flavor was there, and the burger patty was juicy -- that's a perfect burger in my book!\n\nTheir smash fries were pretty good, too. They were thin shoestring fries that are tossed in olive oil, rosemary, and garlic. They were cooked to perfection and had a crunch to them (but they weren't burnt or brown-looking). I usually don't like soft fries because they get soggy easily, so this definitely was a good choice for me!\n\nI was delighted that this is near campus because it's super convenient for those in-between-class meals. It's a place to go to if you want a more customizable burger than the burgers at In-N-Out next door. In my opinion, it was worth the visit here and you can't go wrong with a good burger for a decent price!
