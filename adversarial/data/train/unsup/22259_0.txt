Absolutely worse pizza I have EVER had in my life !!!!! The tomatoe sauce has no seasoning, iwatched them dump a can of tomatoe sauce straight in the line to sauce pizzas. Real authentic Italian huh? NOT! They tried to give me old crust instead of a fresh dough because they said they were \"watching food costs\" if you ask me that's a poor excuse for a restaurant. The \"chicken cutlets\" are dryer than the Sahara desert.DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!  They have Mexicans cooking \"Italian FOOD\" disgrace to Italian Food !  Avanti Pizza Is The Way To Go For Authenic Italian Pizza in Hendersong
