Food was excellent. I would give it 5 stars for food alone. Highly recommended the duck panang and spicy duck fried rice. \n\nMinus 2 stars because we had a reservation and they could not seat us until 30 minutes past the reservation time. Though everyone was apologetic, my friend left a commitment early to be on time only to wait for quite some time. I understand that it is a small restaurant but I recommend not taking reservations and only allowing a walk up waitlist.
