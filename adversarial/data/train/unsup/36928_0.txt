3.stars - Good for a quick lunch \/ dinner or for picking up home made pasta & sauces.  \n\nThe name is odd... on all my visits, I never saw a single person order Pizza or ice cream! Everyone gets the pasta as far as I can tell. Located in the back of the market by Buster Sea Cove, line ups move quickly and there is plenty of seating throughout the market to enjoy your pasta.\n\nAll the pastas are homemade - cheese or meat ravioli, tri-coloured spaghetti and various other pasta shapes. Definitely better than typical downtown food court options. \n\nSauces are rather good as well for quick takeout - I personally love the simple tomato sauce. You can also select a meat sauce, white Alfredo sauce or a pesto option. Spicy versions also available. There is a \"cult\" following for their combo sauce - tomato, pesto and Alfredo mixed together - you can get it on your pasta or in a container to bring home.\n\nThey charge around $10 for a large bowl of pasta and sauce. Given the fresh ingredients, I think its well worth it. \n\nThey sell all their pastas and sauces separately so you can prepare later at home. Bags of their pasta can be up to $10-$12 but that appears to be the price to pay for fresh made pasta and sauces. \n\nCheck it out next time your in the market. Not exactly high end Italian dinning but above average...\n\nBK
