This place has ruined all other bubbletea places for me.  \n\nI used to pass by this place thinking it was just another cheap, mediocre bbt place based on its looks - its menu consists of a bunch of 8x11 sheets of laminated paper in a grid.  Moral of the story: Never judge a book by its cover.\n\nI ordered the small mango+lychee juice for $5.10 after tax.  This drink was liquid gold.  You could taste the real fruits they use and the tapioca had the perfect chewiness.  It was so good that I finished it before I even got home.\n\nIf you decide to go to Share Tea, Preso Tea, or any other bbt place in FMP, congratulations, you just played yourself.
