Good location. Can eat, have my little one play till she gets tired and even at times be entertained with special events they have.\n\nCustomer service could be better with checking on drink refills.\n\nHUGE HUGE HUUUUUGE bummer: no free wi-fi. \n(I'd rather drive all the way to the location near Fashion Square mall just for that reason alone).\n\nOtherwise....it's clean, good food and one of the few 'healthier eats'
