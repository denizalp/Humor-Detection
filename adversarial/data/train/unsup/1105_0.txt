Now I am confirmed that I love Pubs.. but I cannot stand Pub's food.\n\nOverdraught Irish Pub is a nice place to hang out and have a drink or 2 or 3 or 4 with your friends especially if they are doing a special on drinks. The Black and Tan ($7.20) is nice and smooth and poured the way it suppose to be. But I would not have know when the inside of this Pub was really dark (yes important for a pub as drunk folks want to be hidden and rip in the dark) , and my drink was dark too...\n\nGuinness Steak and Mushroom Pie ($14) is dark too and so damn salty!! I think the reason is the more salty your food is, the more beer you need to drink?? Good that I ate some Ramen before coming here.\n\nPlease tell your friend not to pick the table right by the door where the guitar playing singer going to sing. But if you just want to not hear what your friend's conservations those maybe the perfect seats.\n\nThey do have daily specials, check their website...\n\nBTW, why are the men working here not wearing kilts showing off their assets??
