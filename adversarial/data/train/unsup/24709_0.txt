It was a busy time went we went to try Ambiyan.  There was a Downtown Unionville festival happening on the weekend. We were seated on the patio. \n\nTo start we ordered a unique house specialty brie filled pakora - that was fantastic with the accompanying tamarind sauce, ooey gooey goodness. :)\n\nAlso had \nButter chicken - very fresh pieces of chicken breast but could use a hint more spice. \nRice - served is a nice vase container. \nNaan - excellent wouldn't change a thing\nAloo Gobi - excellent wouldn't change a thing\n\nI've eaten at my fair share of indian restaurants and I'd say\nAmbiyan is a pretty solid choice. The quality of ingredients, presentation, freshness and taste all rank high.
