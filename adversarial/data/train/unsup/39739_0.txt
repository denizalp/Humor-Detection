The Thumb is my happy place. Love the vibe, the food and especially the unique 'wares' for sale. From unique home decor items to special toys and true AZ gifts and collectibles, I love browsing while the food is being cooked. Great baked goods (all made on site - watch the bakery team create through the special interior window), yummy coffee drinks and cold beer on tap - all topped off with an amazing array of bbq sauces for the delicious smoked meats, sandwiches, salads, burgers etc etc. If you haven't been- GO- and join Guy Fiery in raving about The Thumb!
