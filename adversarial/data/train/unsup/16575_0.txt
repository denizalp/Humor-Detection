Ladies! If you're looking to be talked down to, and \"mansplained\" about your tire needs, look no further! This location has all the misogyny you'll ever need. In true car salesman fashion, some of the benefits you'll receive at this store are rudeness and high pressure sales tactics. And that's not all! There's even bait and switch tactics to experience if you're especially lucky. The first time it happened, I thought perhaps it was just a misguided employee. But unfortunately, this appears to be the direction that the company (and especially this store) is headed. Ladies, save you hard earned money for a company that treats women with respect.
