Love this place, the chef & the food. The chef has flawlessly migrated from a sit down Indian restaurant to a fast casual Thai place. The food is amazing.  Please help keep this small business in business by ordering at the front desk before sitting down, and not staying for an unreasonably long time. He needs to be able to turn tables in order to make money in this small space. \n\nThe GREEN CURRY with vegetables was so well seasoned, spicy and fully of regular and unusual veggies. Home run. \n\nCHICKEN WITH PEANUT SAUCE was my least favorite but my mom (who ordered it and likes peanut sauce) loved it. For me it had a touch too much of either fish or oyster sauce in the peanut sauce for me to appreciate it. \n\nEXPLODING CATFISH was pretty simple, with ultra thin little fillets of fish very heavily breaded and fried to create a crunchy base and then topped with a spicy mango salad. Usually I'm not a fan of sweet + savory. And I definitely don't like fruit in my entrees. But this worked very well together. It felt fresh and decadent at the same time. \n\nI ordered PAD THAI for my 3 yr old, since everything else we ordered was spicy, and it ended up being my favorite. Full of veggies - broccoli, zucchini, carrot, red pepper - with a perfectly balanced sauce to the noodles. It comes with a little heap of sugar, crushed peanuts and a few other things to personalize it if you want. I found it excellent as is. \n\nWe will definitely be back.
