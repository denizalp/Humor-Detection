Blech. ~$5 burger that I could hardly differentiate from one of those things wrapped in foil for 3 days at AM\/PM. Didn't even finish it.\n\nAlso, the employees laughing and goofing around while some seriously fucked up, tripping, bloody homeless guy traipsed through the place purposely smearing his blood and sweat all over the people and the equipment didn't exactly wet my appetite. If he tried to touch my daughter I would have killed him with our stroller and then started in on the staff.\n\nExtra star for the now bloody pile of peanuts and potato in the middle of the room. That's pretty fun.
