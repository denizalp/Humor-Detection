Check in was a breeze. I wasn't even out of the cab and the bellhop had my bag! I headed to the front desk and I was greeted with a smile and no wait. I was tired and a little nervous about arriving early but not only was a room available but I was upgraded. Alisha at the front desk was efficient, friendly and professional and I was happy about choosing this hotel before I even hit the elevators. The room by the way, PERFECT. Immaculate and comfortable, I will be booking my next trip here.
