I never in a million years thought I would ever dig a lounge-type specialty bar, enjoying a specialty frou-frou drink, in a tourist trap paradise all wrapped neatly up inside Vegas' most brand spanking new hotspot. Boy was I wrong! THIS PLACE IS SOOOO FREAKING COOL!!!\n\nEven I was laughing at myself attempting to explain the Chandelier to my brother. Neither of us had ever dared to venture inside the Cosmopolitan, but we had heard tales of this 'bar' located 'inside' this gigantic 'chandelier.' Yeah, try explaining that to a total outsider without sounding like some sort of mind alteration is involved.\n\nWe get there, we find it, we are blown away. It really is what everyone makes it out to be -- a bar inside a chandelier. Neither concept is lost or overpowering; you look up to face a larger-than-life beautiful chandelier. You get there and look out, and you are literally surrounded by lovely chandelier.\n\nBro opted for a neat scotch, while I ordered the Blue Grass Shuffle -- Maker's 46, egg whites, orange bitters and blueberry preserves -- and it is as gorgeous and delicious as you might imagine. OMG. No, really. One of the best flavored and balanced cocktails I have EVER enjoyed in my entire life.\n\nIt's really chill and smack in the middle of the mall (China Poblano is right nearby teasing you!), and I'm sure that later on in the evening the middle floors start popping off like with a clubby lounge kinda vibe. Either way, I loved my drink and my view! Definitely a new must-see in Vegas... How do you keep doing it, Vegas???
