This is one of our favorite restaurants in the Charlotte area.  The service is top notch.  We have been there so often they know us by face.  I encourage anyone who goes there to try the Brussels Sprout appetizers - in one word OUTSTANDING!  They are both crisp, fresh and sweet all at the same time. We also love the Rice Crispy Squares.  \nMy go to is always the Miso.  It is a warm broth with fresh corn, bean sprouts, Bok Choy, pork belly and an egg.  It is delicious - pork melts in your mouth and the veggies, noodles remain crisp and delicious!  \nMy husband gets the Buta Bowl it has a bit of a kick but never fails to impress!  \nTruly a great restaurant - worth the wait!  I love the traditional Japanese sitting - if not for that we would have never tried the Brussels Sprouts!  \nGreat service, excellent food and reasonable prices!  Love that it's right off the train -
