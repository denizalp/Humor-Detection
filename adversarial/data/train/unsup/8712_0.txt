I just started coming to this area because a friend recommended it to me. There are many establishments to choose from, and I'm very happy that we stumbled upon this place. We got there right when they opened, so we got a chance to talk with the bartender who was super friendly. First of all.....lets talk about the happy hour. 11am to 7pm? You can't beat that! We were there on a Thursday which is craft beer day. All bottle selections are 3 bucks. Oh yeah..... It was time to order food to soak up the alcohol I was about to consume! \n\nWe started off with the reuben dip. Make sure you order this next time you go here. Not so much for the dip itself, but for the boxty chips!  Wow. They were tasty. And they serve you a ton, so I got to take some home with me. They are even good cold. \n\nI am a sucker for lobster bisque. If it's on the menu, I order it. I'm glad I did.  The flavor is spot on. My only gripe is that I believe they put those fake crab sticks in it instead of real lobster. I didn't really mind because the flavor of the bisque is so good. \n\nFinally, we split the fish and chips. We only ate a couple of bites being so full from everything else, but this was very good as well. \n\nI have to apologize to the other restaurants in the area. It will be very difficult to try any of them when I'm in the area because this is my new \"go to\" place!
