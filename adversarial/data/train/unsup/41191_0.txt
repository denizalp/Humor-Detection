OK I normally never go to restaurants under 4 stars on Yelp, especially not $$$ ones, but I was starving and Center Cut was right in my hotel (the Flamingo). I had a 20% off coupon for staying at the hotel which helped a lot. The steaks are reasonably priced, especially compared to other steakhouses on the strip. I got the 14oz boneless ribeye ($42) and a serving of broccolini ($9).\n\nThe steak was perfect seasoned, great sear with a nice crust on the outside. The one downside is that the steak was a bit too thin for my liking. It was just over half an inch thick when I usually prefer my steaks at least an inch thick. As a result, the medium rare I asked for turned out closer to medium; still not too bad though, especially for the price. As an added bonus the steaks come with bone marrow on the side, which add even more richness to the meat if you want it (you do).\n\nWith the 20% off coupon it just came out to just $45 after tax, great value for almost a pound of prime ribeye steak! I give this place a solid 4 stars with the 20% off coupon and would probably give a 3.5 if I didn't have the coupon.
