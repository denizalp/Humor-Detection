Nice! \n\nthis was the first Carl's Jr. I discovered Green Burrito. Strange name, but they were pretty decent for fast food. Years later, I read Morgan Spurlock's book, he's known for doing Supersize me. In Don't Eat this Book, he writes about the connection of Green Burrito to Carl's as an attempt by Carl himself to revitalize the chain. And apparently Carl was fired from his own chain but since rehired? \n\nThere is some dark history with me and this location, but it had nothing to do with Carl's. I had a motorcycle accident out front one night. Actually, I had a protected left turn (left onto Maryland north), and someone approaching at excessive speed from the opposite direction BARRELLED thru their red light to make a swerving right turn- right on my path. So I veered left and slammed into that island in front of the Carl's. \n\nalso, in the area was the first (ghetto) apartment I had when I moved to Vegas, so I have been going to this location since moving here in 1999. The Ghetto apartment has since been refurbished somewhat as a Siegel Suite.\n\nCarl's is one of maybe 3 national chains I go to for one reason: The Big Carl. Right up against McDonald's mystery mad cow beef, the Big Carl is a larger burger for cheaper. Folks, there is NO reason to go to McDonald's since the McD brothers sold to Krok.  They put unsanitary barfed and peed on playgrounds and make happy little sweatshop imported toys so that your kids will nag you to go. \n\nSo go to Carl's!
