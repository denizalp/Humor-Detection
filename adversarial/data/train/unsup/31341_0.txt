Horrible service, mediocre food and overpriced.  Definitely won't be going back.  Called in an order to go and picked it up from the drive-thru.  Got home and opened up our packages to a huge disappointment.  I ordered the South of the Border omelette and couldn't believe that the fruit and sour cream were both thrown on top of the omelette.  The fruit should have been packaged separately (hot and cold don't belong together) and the sour cream should have been in a cup by itself.  The pepper jack cheese in the omelette was of the processed variety (think Velveeta.)  I would think that a place that tries to be higher end would use quality ingredients.  The second order was fried chicken and waffles but that's all we got.  No butter, no syrup.  So instead of eating our meals we had to make a trip to the grocery store to buy syrup since the restaurant was too far away.  When I called the restaurant to point this out I was told (after a very long and awkward pause) that the chicken and waffles would be taken off the bill.
