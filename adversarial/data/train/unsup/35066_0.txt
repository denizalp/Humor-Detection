Finally, the real deal!\n\nI met the owner and Chef, she's a sweetheart and a very good cook! The place was filled with Asians, which is a GOOD THING. If the people of it's own ethnicity are eating there, than you know it's a good staple of Korean Cuisine. \n\nThere's plenty of room to sit, and they start you off with KIM CHI, Cucumbers, and Boiled Peanuts for appetizers. Nice veggies to wet the palate. I had the Combo dish, which was outstanding!! Teriyaki Chicken, grilled Short Rib, and an Egg fried Steak over white rice served with the perfect Hawaiian Guava Passion fruit juice drink. \n\nI tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice. FIRE!! ABSOLUTE FIRE! Perfectly tender pork loin smothered in a spicy\/sweet sauce. I tell ya, the taste of that had me smiling. \n\nCustomer service is VERY GOOD! They are all very helpful and fast, so please be ready to order!\n\nI had made this rating a 4, and changed it to a 5. Because now that I'm writing this review, I want some more good food and good service.\n\nNice work guys!!
