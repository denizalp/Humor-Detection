Yesterday, I was able to get squeezed in for an appointment at 5 with Sanam. I don't trust anyone else with my hair now. Sanam listens to exactly what I want, is a blast to talk to, and makes sure I leave the salon looking opulent and as though I own EVERYTHING. And I never leave feeling over charged. I left the salon looking like I got a $200 haircut, when in fact; I paid a fraction of that.\n\nBut... then if I tell you all about him, then I'll never be able to get squeezed in last minute...\n\nGo see the others at Chatters in Chinook! They're all awesome and friendly, too.
