In honour of the Leafs sucking, I'm going to toss some love to our other sports team... \n\nNo, the Jays aren't doing well at all, but let's still tip some for the Sky Dome, a truly decent place to watch local athletics.\n\nThey serve poutine. They let you take tall cans to your seats. They've won back to back championships in my lifetime. They let you buy good tickets for under $50. \n\nIf you ever want to show off Toronto to a sportsf an, a Jays came with the dome open looking up at the CN Tower is the way to do it. We're a good looking town. \n\nPEPPER'S PISSED because she isn't a huge sports fan and has spent too much on beer here. Luckily, she still enjoys eating, drinking and yelling.\n\nLet's Go Blue Jays *clap clap clap*.
