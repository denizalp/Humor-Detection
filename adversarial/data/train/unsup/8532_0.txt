I was here on a sultry Saturday lady date and we were treated like queens.\n\nThe overall service was outstanding and bumped my 4 star rating up to a five. I'm not surprised by the other high ratings on Yelp.\n\nThere are lots of cocktail food classics; this isn't an overly ambitious or experimental menu. It's not horribly boring either. The concept is design your own snack board, share some plates and sip your drinks by the glowing stained glass bar. It works well. \n\nWe tried a bit of everything from the menu categories: olives, meats, cheese, sharing plates, drinks and sweets. \n\nWhat I appreciated most were the delightful details:\n\n+the lotus chips and persimmon jam with our aged gouda\n+the salty puttanesca dipping sauce with the fried artichokes\n+my fresh and classic Moscow Mule served in a copper cup and all (plus pretty straw)\n+textures, taste and presentation of the sensual scallops \n+exquisitely presented parmesan cheesecake on a decorated cheeseboard. Artful fruit garnishes that even included gooseberries\n\nTip: There are 1\/2 off Mondays (item changes every week) and 1\/2 off social plates from 5-7 every night.
