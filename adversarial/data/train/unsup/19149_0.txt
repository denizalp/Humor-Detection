This review is for the gas station and convenience store only.  I haven't had my car washed here yet.  I do like getting gas here though because the lanes are very wide and it has easy access to Frank Lloyd Wright, the 101, and that side street along the FWY (don't know the name).\n\nI'll give the car wash a try sometime for sure.\n\nReturn Factor - 83%
