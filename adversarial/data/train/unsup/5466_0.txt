My wife and I had lunch here August 19, 2013 (Monday) based on our proximity and due to some favorable Yelp! reviews which said that it was \"authentic\" and\/or good. We had the MaPo tofu and the Ho fun noodles with BBQ pork and I would vehemently disagree with those reviews which claimed the food was \"authentic\" and good. The menu is dominated with typical americanized chinese food items (which can be good - but good and authentic are very different things) but there are a few dishes which you don't typically see which lends the restaurant some apparent flavor of authenticity.  The Mapo Tofu was mostly flavorless and the strips of pork that you typically get with this dish, were, at this location, thick and coarse with a good amount of gristle. The sauce seemed diluted with only the green onion giving some \"asian\" flair. The Ho fun noodles with BBQ pork was a bit better in the sense that the noodles were not bad - but the BBQ pork was dry and cut along the grain instead of orthogonal to it which made it much tougher. The BBQ pork is also typically served in strips which are 1\/8\" to 1\/4\" thick with some fat on it - the BBQ pork on this dish was large, thin, dry sheets (cut the wrong way) of meat, which also did not taste very fresh. Now before the reader dismisses my review as from someone who doesn't know good chinese food, I am ethnically chinese (born and raised in Southern California eating chinese food for at least half my life), and have experienced both good and bad chinese food, with the best chinese food in Los Angeles, San Francisco and of course, Hong Kong. Based on my disappointing experience with these two dishes, I would not bother to visit this establishment again in the future unless there was a different chef.
