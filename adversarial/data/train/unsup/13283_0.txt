This is a brand new location on cherry road in Rock Hill, S.C. In the same spot where Firebonz used to be. They tore down Firebonz to build this new Popeye's restaurant. Just for your info, this location just open on Monday and you will have quite a wait as it has been PACKED and wrapped around the building with cars and employees outside assisting in car flow. Yesterday I waited about an hour in line to place my order. I will have to say that yes it was worth the wait!  The chicken and popcorn shrimp is absolutely delicious. And the mashed potatoes and gravy puts Churches, KFC, and Bojangle's to complete shame. Also kudos to the manager they selected to run this new location. I had plenty of time to observe him working in such high demand. He's a very detail oriented, thoughtful, respectful manager. Yet thorough and on top of everything! VERY CUSTOMER FRIENDLY. I'm sure after a while the restaurant will settle down somewhat. But if you want to give this new Popeye's a try, prepare to wait patiently. It WILL be worth the wait! LOL
