Hmm..I was a little disappointed that I didn't love Stack'd, especially since I love burgers and this place is so close to my house.\n\nWe went on a Friday night (Pens game on), and it was loud as expected. There isn't as much seating as I thought, but there was no problem getting a seat, though we had to wait for people to clear tables. You get a sheet where you can mark the qualifications of your burger- bun, size, condiments, cheese, random toppings, etc and hand it to the waitress. \n\nThe burger itself was OK- nothing stood out for me. The price point was fine as well. It was hard to get service, and when at first we didn't remember who our waitress was, we made the mistake of asking another, to which she replied, \"What?\" when we asked for help, and then \"You have to ask her,\" pointing to our presumed waitress, who was sitting down at a table with people she knew. All in all, a normal burger with bad service. With all the other competition out there, I can't see myself going back.
