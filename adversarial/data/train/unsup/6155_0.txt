Best Buy,you really suck.\nTried to buy a camera the other day.\nMid day,mid week,store pretty empty.\n3 employees hanging around the camera department as I started to look at options.\nNo one asked if they could help,in fact they first stopped their conversation in an attempt to become invisible.\nNo problem,I'll poke around till I either find what I want ,or until I have comparison questions to narrow down choices.\nI think I have it,I'm ready to select.\nWhere'd everyone go?\nI'm so lonely.\nI start to wander a bit and see if they're doing laundry in the appliance section.\nnope.\nMaybe around by the video cameras.\nNope nope.\nUnder a display cabinet?\nNah,that would be silly...\nThey were just gone.\nPoofed.\nVanished.\nVaporized.\nI decided it had to be the nefarious work of aliens.\nYes,I said \"nefarious\".\nI became frightened in my alone-ness Fearing next would be an invasion of the Apple People of the Crack Basha's.\nWho would protect me?\nThe aliens abducted all the staff of Best Buy,so it would just be me.\nI couldn't possibly stop them all.\nThey would come,snarling their toofless grimaces at me.\nI would be defenseless.\nFearing my life and existance as I know it,I saw only 3 choices.\n1)Face them all.Aliens and Apple People of the Crack Basha's.Fight till the end or vaporization.\n2)Take what I wanted as there was no one left to stop me.\n3)Make a hasty retreat and go elsewhere to purchase a camera.\nGentle readers,as you read this harrowing tale,you can safely assume I chose plan #3.\nNew camera in my possession,safe at home taking pictures of the pets grateful to have gotten out alive.\nSince all the help at Best Buy has been vaporized,you may want to go elsewhere if you'd like to purchase anything that isn't self serve.\nRemember to get a subscription to some crap magazine on your way out.\nThank you,come again.
