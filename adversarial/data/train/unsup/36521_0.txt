Try Caribbean food with a Spanish twist?  Kaya has some really good food bursting with flavor!  We started our foodie experience ordering the Jerked Pork and Plantain nachos and their Yucat√°n hot bean dip.  Both of these appetizers are recommended but the Plantain nachos were great!  I ordered their Tropical Paella that had a large quantity of mussels, shrimp, chicken and chorizo.  The dish was very good, but I have had paella in a number of places including Spain and was not the best, but I expect you maybe hard pressed to find better in.Pittsburg. My wife enjoyed her Chili Rellenos they were tasty and well presented.  Note - They have a good bread pudding if you have room for dessert.  \n\nFood 4 - Excellent starters definitely go with Jerk Chicken Nachos. The Tropical Paella is Very good as well.\nService 4 Helpful and Friendly\nAtmosphere 4 Very nice Caribbean vibe that adds to your experience.  Nice place for a fun night out.\nPrice 4 Good value for the money \nOA 4
