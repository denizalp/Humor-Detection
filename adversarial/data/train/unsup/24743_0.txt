Oh, my tummy. What I did to it today was just cruel. But sometimes it's necessary to punish one organ when you reward another. And the part of my body getting the reward would be my taste buds. Yay for taste buds!\n\nAmazing BBQ to be had here at the festival. Starting with one of the finalists (I didn't find out if they were a winner), Rocky Top Smokies. I have never in my life had more tender melt-in-the-mouth ribs in my entire life. I will have to keep an eye out for these guys because they're simply amazing.\n\nThe rest of the festival is an opportunity to sample more roasted meat and side dishes as these folks compete for prizes and bragging rights. And then are the non-BBQ tents. Prize wheels from Time Warner Cable and Fifth Third Bank (thanks for the hat!). Greyhound also had a prize wheel (thanks for the cool shopping bag and T-shirt) and one of their new buses for touring (really slick - wifi and power at every seat that is more comfortable than flying for sure).\n\nParking is only $5 and it's a pretty good deal. We were fortunate to have great weather today - I can't imagine that it would be nearly as much fun in the rain. Get there early, get your 'cue and beer, and get going. It got crowded later in the day and it wasn't as much fun with all those people around.\n\nAs Yelp Elite, we got a bit more insider information, including a \"media pass\" and a guided tour and explanation of the competition process for the Memphis Barbecue Network. (Side note - I need to plan \"Memphis in May\"). And that meant meeting the Rocky Top folks and getting to sample their wares as well as ribs from a half-dozen other competitors. So much food.\n\nDon't skip the beer sampling - hopefully they know how to pour better than I do! Purple Haze from Abita Brewery and Carolina Brewery's Sky Blue were good, but Starr Hill's Dark Starr Stout was a surprisingly delicious pour.
