Great patio.  I really enjoyed the vibe here and service was great.  \n\nI had the wings grilled which tasted great but not very spicy even though I got the spicest option.  \n\nLots of parking at the side and back.  The plaza it's in is a bit confusing but it's actually nice and feels like a small town.  \n\nNo tvs outside but they have loungers and tables.  Lots of tvs inside with a big projection
