Full House BBQ sigsig is defiantly different here compared to any other Filipino resturants I've tried in Vegas. The reason why it's differnet is because they have white mayo sauce on top... which gives it a creamy flavorful taste. I enjoyed their sigsig very much, it was packed with flavor and creamy goodness.\n\nI also tried java rice for the first time. I did not enjoy it as much a garlic fried rice. I didnt get a chance to try their garlic fried rice.\n\nService was amazing. They constantly refill your water.
