This is still an ok place..Courtney was awesome on this visit but she did keep my Canes Club Card so I guess I am no longer a card carrying member...LOL\n\nI don't go here often, I just had a craving.  Prior to this visit, the food tasted like it was cooked in old oil.  \n\nThis is one reason I do not visit this place often:\n\n. Where can I find Raising Cane's® nutritional values?\n\nA. At this time, Raising Cane's® is in the process of performing nutritional value testing on the food we serve. Thus, we are unable to provide you with the nutritional content information you've requested.\n\nThis is from their website..if a place that has been in business for as long as they have and their website still says they have no idea about the nutritional value of their food, it is a place to use caution with when deciding where to go eat.  I know some people do not care what is in their food, a place SHOULD still be able to tell you the nutritional value of their food.  If they do not know then the question is where are you getting your supplies from???\n\nJust saying...
