If tacky could bleed, it would bleed pink.\n\nI can't even remember who convinced me to try this place, there's a huge Chinese porcelain statue of a girl wearing a Japanese apron holding a bowl of soup, that's not very Japanese?\n\nAll of the chairs were in pink vinyl, which has nothing to do with Japan.  It's not like they call it The Land of the Rising Flamingos.  There are traditional style sumos painted onto the walls, and a dish display that reminds me of those vendor games where you throw a ball to knock the plates down.  \nThe servers looked Japanese, but of course when I say 'looked' Japanese I'm only referring to their height.  I couldn't understand what I was looking at when I opened the menu, I'm not a ramen kind of guy.  There was a photo of a dish where it was very obviously octopus covered in melted cheese, but I asked the waitress what it was just to make sure.  \n\"Excuse me, what is this?\"  Pointing to the photo of the cheese octopus.\n\"Uhh....I..I don't know.\"  The waitress replied.\nI looked at her, she looked back at me, then she looked at my friend, then she looked back at me, and I looked at my friend who looked at me, then I looked back at the waitress who was still looking at me.  We all fake smiled at the same time.\n\"I'll have that\"  I said.\nI also ordered a bowl of ramen.\n\nI didn't like the food, I'm sure it wasn't very authentic.  The cheese octopus was horrible.  Did I mention that the furniture was all in hot pink?  \nJapanese food is difficult enough to figure out on it's own, but when the wait staff don't even know what it is, I think maybe the chef should take it easy and humble his menu.  \n\nI should of said to the waitress when she brought me the bill.  \"What is this?\"   Who knows, maybe I would have gotten lucky.
