Hands down the best buffet I've been to in a very long time.  I can't believe it doesn't have 5 stars. I only went for lunch which was just under $40. Dinner was just under $60. Breakfast was $30. \nYou enter via velvet rope lines and pay for the buffet before you are seated. \nI liked the decor here too. Had more of a restaurant feel than a buffet feel. \nThe food was delicious and plentiful. Fresh seafood, a few breakfast options, soup, meats including brisket, sausages, sushi, pasta, salad bar, dim sum, etc. Every section of food was themed. Chinese, Japanese, Italian, etc. I could have filled up in just one of those sections. I tried to sample a little bit of everything but there were just too many options to pick from. All of the food I tried was delicious. \nLastly the dessert section. Huge. Crepes, macrons, ice cream, cakes, etc. \nBest buffet I've been to in a very long time if not ever.
