I've been to a few Pho restaurants and this one is my favorite so far lol..\n\nMy classmates and I went for lunch; We ordered crab and cheese wonton and a Veg roll for our appetizer, both were really good especially the Thai sauce yummy... Our mains were: chicken pad thai,  shrimp pad thai and chicken beef pork and rice. Food was flavourful and brought to out table warm.. The server was very helpful; she recommend to try the vietnamese iced coffee and it was good. Strong not too sweet, something I would try again. \nPrices are reasonable for the portion. Overall a good experience and would eat here again..
