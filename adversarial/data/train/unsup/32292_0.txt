Big boys moving was wonderful! We needed a last minute move of items from 2 different locations. The guys were there in a timely manner, went through everything with me first, informed me of the cc fee and any issues they noticed right away. Once they got moving, everything was quick and effective. One of the guys (Richard) micro-managed, which made everything go so smoothly with no loss or damage done. Thanks guys. You are my Big Boys for everything I need moved now. :-)
