Was excited to try this place and left disappointed. The icing seems to taste a bit grainy... Maybe it's the lack of dairy due to it being vegan. Anyways, the cashier was friendly and let my sister and I try any flavor we wanted. I had amaretto and blueberries while she had blueberry pie or something like that. They were both okay. \n\nI had bought a coffee along with my dessert and really disliked it after my first sip. I hesitated to ask for a refund for it, but it was just so distasteful. I kindly asked another man.. I think supervisor maybe? For a refund. He seemed annoyed that I would ask for such a thing, and actually LIED to me saying that he processed the refund. My sister is a little less shy than I am and asked why her e-receipt had not changed. He said \"oh let me check\" and all of a sudden she got a notification for a refund. What a JERK.\n\nI will never be back, nor will I recommend this place to ANYONE.
