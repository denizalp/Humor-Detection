If you are extremely afraid of heights like me Please do not buy the 200's section. It was way too steep It felt like I was falling the whole time. I was looking for a seatbelt to secure myself in my seat hahahaha!. I just told myself that the design of the arena was approved and met all safety codes so no way I will be falling. \n\n*The visibility was still super great even way up in the 200's section just as long as you can tolerate heights*
