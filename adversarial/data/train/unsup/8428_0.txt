My birthday is coming up in a few days so I decided to treat myself a little bit and get a brazilian wax.  I'd been putting it off because it's not exactly a procedure that is comfortable or relaxing and it's always awkward going to a new person to get it done.  I finally buckled down and made the appointment though because I'd been wanting it for a while.  It took me a little while to find a place to park so I was about 10 minutes late to my appointment and I was worried they would tell me I had to reschedule but surprisingly they still got me in right away.\n\nAnita was the aesthetician who helped me and she was super down to earth and friendly and made me feel comfortable right away.  She was very informative about everything she was doing so there was never that moment of, \"Whoa!  What's going on?!\"  I liked that she was talkative too so there wasn't an awkward silence throughtout.  One of the most amazing things about the experience though was that it wasn't as painful as the ones I used to get!  She doesn't use hard wax at all so it was a lot less uncomfortable.  Not to mention she was very fast so I was in and out pretty quickly (definately a good thing with a procedure like this, let me tell you).\n\nAnd because I had such a great experience with this procedure, I'm looking forward to going back and getting other services done too.  To me that says a lot about a business and from what I've seen they'll live up to my expectations!
