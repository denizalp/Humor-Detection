I stopped in on my way home from work feeling too lazy to cook. I'd been drawn in by having previously seen arancini on the menu when walking by. When I went in I realized the rice ball was the size of my head and would be impossible to eat while walking. The little ones are less messy, I don't get the giant thing. I settled for a slice of pizza. There appeared to be three options. I went with pepperoni. It was nothing to write home about. The crust was thick and doughy. the cheese and pepperoni were minimal. The sauce was bland. I checked out the menu to see if there were good specials to try out at a later date. The place is priced as if it's gourmet pizza but the product just doesn't seem to live up. Standard toppings. No wood burning oven. There are two tables, both were occupied by one person waiting for take out. One wall is marked as a \"wall of fame\" and has a ton of trashy looking marker scribbles. This neighbourhood has an over abundance of pizza restaurants. I don't know if this one will find a niche.
