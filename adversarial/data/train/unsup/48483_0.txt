Decided to have lunch here instead of going to my fave usual sushi place. Everything from the service to the food was top notch!\n\nMe and my sister both got the Dixie sushi lunch with a side of salmon sashimi. The sashimi was fresh and were a nice thick cut (mmmm!). The dynamite and california rolls were fresh and did not fall apart. The service throughout lunch was great! The servers were always attentive and were very nice. You usually don't get this kind of service at asian places.\n\nI think Tako Sushi is going to be my new fave usual place.
