Instead of bikes anywhere, generally only at a grid station.\nWant to ride it now, instead of $1\/ride (like others) you have to subscribe to a plan.\nYou get the app and you have to make an account, instead of working off the phone's ID and\/or your payment ID when the simplest use would be: \n1. install app.\n2. Point at bike you want, pay with device-payment (apple pay, andoid pay).\n3. unlock bike and ride.\n\nInstead, have to make an account and in this case, log back in to account.\nBalance is due on the account from last time I rode, fine, sorry, my bad, (unlikely) to attempt to just pay in app.  App cannot take payments, you must go to website.   Somehow paying money from 2 mos ago is different than paying for a ride right now, which the app can process.\nPayment on web, on phone, is very hard. This is where you really want to make it easy to take peoples' money!... website is a full page busy spreadsheet thing crammed into a phone browser, for fun I tried to see if I could do it.  15 minutes later, I was able through careful zoom and scroll to pay back bill, says paid in full.\nAPP DOESNT REFRESH.  Kill, restart... nope.  Still says \"You cannot rent bike your account is frozen.\"\nDelete app, reinstall app, relogin... OH, now I can.\nSelect \"plan\", (fine, $10\/week, and I have to remember to cancel in a week... cuz I just want to ride a bike today and maybe tomorrow).\nReady for payment... which is already in the website.. need to re-enter the credit card here, doesn't work with the device payment... \n\nSo at this point I gave up.\nNice bikes though, nicer than Ofo or Lime or the orange one.  But, cant actually get them to ride :)... so, fire the CTO, and whomever worked out the registration and payment flow, change the model to allow 1-ride use (as well as plans, fine), and enable app to do everything including payment from device payment system (apple pay, android pay, etc).  \n\nMatter of fact, I dont trust these guys with my CC number, think I'll go remove it now in their website.
