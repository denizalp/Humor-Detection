I usually come here to buy there pastries or get drinks.. the only negative thing I can say about this location is that I bought some macaroons for my sister here a few months ago and it was a little hard.. so I don't know if the macaroons just sit out for awhile or what.. but all the other desserts I got here were pretty good..
