Late night staff (sometimes day time as well) clearly don't care about proper customer service. They are always on their phones, talking to each other, and not professional at all. \n\nAlso what is the point of paying for the \"black card service\" when they let ANYONE use the massage chairs and tanning machines. They don't check for the passes nor clean the machines after uses (tanning beds)\n\nIt's a great spot, and well lit space, but common, the staff should be more professional. \n\nThe general manager should be aware of this, and the franchise owner should be as well. \n\nCheers.
