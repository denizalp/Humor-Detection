For the price, creativity, customization, and the concept, this place deserves five stars. It is nearly impossible to find a place where one can have a gourmet-ish meal for $8.The best part is that everything, including their sour cream, is made on location. \n\nTacos remain my favorite. My favorite combination is baked tacos with corn tortillas, chicken\/mushrooms, cheddar cheese, slaw, sour cream, and pickled onions. I love the fact that I can customize dishes and still not be rushed. The staff is exceptionally patient and helpful. They don't mind explaining everything step-by-step to anyone who looks even slightly lost. \n\nI really hope that their business thrives and that they open more locations.
