I visit this place every time I'm in Vegas! A lot of people frown at the idea of paying $10 just to look at a whole bunch of cars that they can't afford but, C'mon, most of us go to our local yearly car shows. Same difference. Make sure to go down to the bottom level of the dealership. There are a lot more cars down there. And you can get your picture taken in a Ferrari.\n\nAt least if you take your ticket into the Ferrari Store they will take $10 off a purchase of $100 or more so it's basically free if your going to buy something in the store.\n\nI saw some great deals when I was there. Hooded jackets that retail for $200 on sale for $60. Key chains that retail for $150 for $25. Cologne gift sets with 3.4 oz bottles of cologne and model Ferrari's for $65 . \n\nExotic cars are like beautiful women, I could look at them all day without getting bored. If you love cars as much as I do I highly recommend it!
