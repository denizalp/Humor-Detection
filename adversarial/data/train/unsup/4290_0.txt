I've been to Farrelli's a handful of times now. I've come to conclude that the concept is fanciful, but the execution is mediocre. \n\n5 Pros: \n-the art deco doors, gorgeous! \n-Hollywood glam posters on the wall \n-you push a button on your coaster, it lights up, then over pops the waiter with your refill \n-you can have a drink at the lounge while you wait for your film \n-there's an email listserv and you can get hooked up with deals \n\n5 Cons: \n-the food isn't great, (IT'S AWFUL) tastes mass produced and bland \n-too expensive \n-slow service in the theater, rude service upfront \n-you get graced with \"smoooooth jazz\" before the film starts, yeah no really. \n-if you're not on a date here, you'll feel like you should be
