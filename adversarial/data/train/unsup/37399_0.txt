I was referred here by a friend who said that Maurices had great quality\/beautiful clothing comparable to Lane Bryant & Torrid but for a lot less. I came to this specific location and literally everyone there was very kind and helpful. Their plus size section was quite small and they didnt have any workout clothing there. I managed to find a couple items I liked but the prices are similar to their competitors. Basically to spend less\/get more join their free rewards program (card) and go during their bogo\/special sales. I hope the other locations are bigger in town - as I was told. Overall good experience. I just wish this particular store had better\/bigger selection and was priced a little lower. Thank you for the good experience.
