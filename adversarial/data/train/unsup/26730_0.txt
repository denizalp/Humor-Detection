Delicious food, nice coffee and friendly staff. It's the perfect independent coffee place that has everything you would need. I would love to bring my book and chill out for a few hours except that the indoor space isn't the most cozy. If they had a few more comfortable tables and chairs then it would make the world of a difference. Otherwise, picking up to go? Excellent.
