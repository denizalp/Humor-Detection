Anthony M is spot on when he says variety if what makes Goyemon stand out among the AYCE sushi restaurants in the valley. In addition to the usual menu of sushi and maki choices, there are nightly blackboard specials, specials on your place mat, and off menu specials you can ask for if the staff knows you well enough. I think their variety is especially evident in the non-shushi items: cold tofu, grilled pork belly, kama, udon, and even Monta ramen (after 2300).\n\nFish quality is decent. It is definitely not Urawasawa or Nobu, but it is definitely not horrible as some would have you believe. Not sure why some Yelpers are so bitter towards this restaurant, maybe since they normally wish they can dine at Nobu, they feel they are extra special and deserve special treatment. When that doesn't happen they try to trash the restaurant and those who like it. If that is the case, they should be ashamed, if their egos permitted it.\n\nService can be slow especially during dinner time, but the servers do put forth a lot of effort to get everyone's orders in. I think the best bet is to come here later in the evening, since it is slower and that is when ramen is available. Looking forwad to returning, especially for one of Nelson Q's UYE's!
