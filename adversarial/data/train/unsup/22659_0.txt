My boyfriend and I came here for a quick dinner on a Saturday night. I guess I should have done a bit more research before stopping by because I had no idea it was a speak easy type setting. When you walk in you need to ring a doorbell to gain access and then are ushered through a somewhat secret entrance way.\n\nThe place has a super old time mobster feel to it. The lighting was super dark and there was some Sinatra type live music, def a cool and different vibe.\n\nFood wise we absolutely loved the pasta and meatball. It has a very tasty, homemade flavor and the portion size was enough for us to share. The stuffed mushrooms were pretty tasty too. They had a bit of a spicy sausage kick to them. \n\nI would certainly come back here again, but recommend making reservations before since we were only able to sit at the bar.
