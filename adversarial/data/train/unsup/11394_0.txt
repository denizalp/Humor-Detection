Something for Everyone\n\nA friend and I went to The Phoenix Ale Brewery Central Kitchen yesterday for the first time.  We both ordered  the beer sampler (5 beers of your choice). \n\nThe brews were very good. I really enjoyed the Camelback IPA and the Orange Peel IPA both were freat.  We spent an hour or so visiting while sampling a flight of beer. You can see the brewery from the tasting room. We didn't take the tour, but could see that several people did.\n\nA neat place to go.  The prices are reasonable, and the  service was very good.  Well worth the trip.
