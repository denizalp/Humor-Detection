First of all Gabriela was great! She did the very best she possibly could have, greeted every customer as they walked in and handled the sea of people as quickly and professionally as she could. She acknowledged wait times repeatedly and when I realized fax was self serve and left the line she came to check on me because she noticed I was missing. Both my stars are for her.\nNow the guy in the blue shirt. Never got his name. The store was extremely busy and I could hear him on the phone, trying to hide around the corner. I caught a glimpse of him a couple times but he was careful not to make eye contact.  He stayed in the back until Gabriela had gotten everyone set up on machines. Then he stepped out, asked the room (making no specific eye contact) if anyone had questions, then headed out the door before anyone could answer.\nSo far I had waited in line almost 10 min. Waited several min for the very slow fax machine, and then I had to wait in line again so I could pay.\nAs I walked out of the store, the guy in the blue shirt was smoking and playing on his phone. My 1 year old (very fussy at this point) caught a puff of smoke in the face and coughed.  He never looked up from his phone.\nI feel bad for the girl working with him. I have done a lot of retail. What he did was not ok to his customers or coworker. \nGabriela got a lot of grief from a lot of customers and handled it by politely smiling and apologizing.  She acknowledged my fussing child directly. Could have been a 5 star customer service experience if she had been given some much needed help by her coworker.
