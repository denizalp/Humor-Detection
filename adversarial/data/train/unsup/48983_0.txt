The food is great everything on the menu is pretty good and I love their macaroni salad. However, their customer service is just severely subpar and lacking. What is the point of allowing customers to phone ahead if no one answers the phone? I don't understand. I've been ordering the same thing for months now, and I called ahead and all the sudden they say they don't have macaroni salad with that plate. It's a little frustrating because the menu has not changed and the attendant on the phone told me if I could just pull up the menu and look at it. No, I cannot pull up the menu and look at it because I'm driving that's why I'm calling you. You are supposed to be the expert on your menu. Really considering not going anymore. That is a real shame because I love the food.
