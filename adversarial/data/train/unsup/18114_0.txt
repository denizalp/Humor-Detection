I unfortunately, used this place twice before I discover a place that knows how to treat a lady. The work is as good as others, but they have two big jerks that work there. That treat women like dumb broads. \nWomen beware!\n\nI complained that there was grease on my beige interior, bad mistake!\nTheses thugs let me know I was expecting too much out of their sloppy greasy mechanics.\n\nI had to wait in their stinky office, while they got my car 20 minutes later I get in my dirty, dusty, greasy smelling car and they have smeared oil on the seat.  I complained, they took back, brought it out, this time it smells like paint thinner.    I gave up.   The thugs got their money and bitched at me worse than any woman I've encountered.  You win Roger! I crown you with the worlds largest dirty oil pit!
