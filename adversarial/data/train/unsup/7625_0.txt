The food was amazing; it was definitely the best barbeque I've had, at least when it comes to places outside of the U.S. I would give Le Boucan 4.5 stars as -- previously mentioned -- the food was superb, as was the service. My only complaint was that our table didn't have any of the condiments, napkins, etc. that all others, even unoccupied ones, had; once we asked for the items, however, they were quickly brought over. I'd definitely return to this establishment if I find myself in Montreal again!
