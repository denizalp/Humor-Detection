As with others, I would give zero or negative stars if possible. I have mobility problems and some days find it very difficult to walk. It is one of the reasons I belong to amazon prime. For years, fedex and ups deliver right to my front door--perfect!! Ontrac has left one package on the driveway. I ran over it without even seeing it. Now they leave the package on top of my TRASH CANS!! Which r a long way from the front door. Fortunately one neighbor has seen a couple of the packages and brought them to me. On another day, our trash collector saw a package on the can...got out of his truck and walked it to my door before taking away the trash (yes, I live in a very small town where people actually do this sort thing!) this poor service must stop!!  This is based on real experience. If yelp does not believe that, I would be happy to privately send recent Amazon order numbers! I know ontrac doesn't listen and won't respond, but I feel better just putting the truth out there.
