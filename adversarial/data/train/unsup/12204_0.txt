You can do some crazy things with burgers here, add lobster or foie gras (sp?) or even truffles. But if you keep it simple with their angus burger it will still be goooood.\n\nThis place is located in Mandalay Place which is the shopping walkway in  between Luxor and Mandalay Bay. The prices are definitely steep, you start at $8.95 for a regular burger but then your add ons like cheese, mushrooms, etc, cost that extra cash. Fries and sides are extra too, by the time you're done you paid a pretty penny for burgers and fries. I recommend the sweet potato fries.\n\nService did not check on us once after the food arrived, maybe he knew we were trying to be cheap cause we split a burger and he didn't bother??? HAH probably.\n\nedit***\n \nWent to Gordon Biersch and ordered a burger, I swear it was just as good, and probably cheaper.
