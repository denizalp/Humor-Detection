I don't think I've ever given a 5 for a food court restaurant..\nI can see why it's popular, plus it's funny there are 2 asian restaurants side by side; one clearly outdoing the other...\nThe service was really friendly, I went at off peak (probably best when you see the lines online, I imagine it moves fairly quickly..).\nGood lunch for under 10 bucks, rare.
