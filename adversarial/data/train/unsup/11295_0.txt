Someone must have talked to the staff about their poor service in the past few weeks, at least at the bar. I was asked 3 or 4 times while waiting for my drink, if I needed a drink.  I also got my complete change back.  But really adding tax in a bar- who does that?  I must say the female bartender I ordered from knew her Beer, she asked my girlfriend what she liked, then brought her a few samples, one of which was dead on.  I was actually kinda impressed.  My only complaint about the bar was they said they had 550 bottles in the cooler, but no one knew what bottles they had.\n\nIt all went downhill from there, I went into the back room, which was empty.  I found out it was empty because it was rented out to a private party.  On a Friday.  At least the waitress was nice about it, but no sign or anything letting me know ahead of time.\n\nAs luck would have it I find a table with 3 other people right after I was kicked out of the vault room.  However, at the table the Stone 16th Anniversary IPA I drank must have doubled as an invisibility portion-  The waitress waiting on the bros on either side of me either could not see us, or seemed to think our empty glasses meant we were too old to have another beer, apparently she does not know thirty somethings have real jobs and can leave tips.\n\nI'd go back... if I rented out the back room, otherwise Mellow Mushroom has a comparable beer selection at least on tap.
