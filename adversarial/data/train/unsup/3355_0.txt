Just average. Marinara and all Red Sauces taste the same,  store bought. They have two gluten free pastas on the menu.  But not available when I ordered them.  Wine selections are just below average,  inexpensive bottles you can find at the market.  \n\nHostess was appalled that we didn't have reservations.  It was a Monday.
