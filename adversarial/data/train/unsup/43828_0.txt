*** Two of the BEST MOUTHGASMS EVER!***\nJust ate here for the first time so the hubby and I opted for a variety of things so we could taste as much as possible. There aren't enough adjectives to describe how AMAZING this place is! \n\nThey are beyond 5 stars and A+ for us! I may be back this weekend even though they are not close to anything for us. We just happened to need the extended hours post office up the street and decided to try it out. \n\nOh, and btw I am a connoisseur of Mediterranean food, lol. The point being that I definitely know the difference between EXCELLENT and mediocre. \n\nWe had a chicken shawarma plate with babaganoush and a steak plate with hummus. Both plates came piled as full as absolutely possible with food which included rice and salad.  I included two pics one showing the two plates about 5 minutes into eating (Duh, sorry) and one of the hubby's plate after he finished. I thought he might lick it clean before all was said and done. I, on the other hand, had enough left over to FILL a full sized to-go box. Seriously folks, BIG portions!\n\nThe service was quick and both of the people working were kind and helpful. I asked a lot of questions considering it was our first time there and the young lady who helped us was patient and descriptive with a great smile as an additional treat. She did not rush us or so much as hint to being annoyed by the many questions.\n\nI couldn't help myself and had to order some baklava when I went up for the to-go box. Haven't tried it yet because we are too full. They have several varieties so of course I got an assortment. \n\nWe were DELIGHTED to see that they have a loyalty program, especially since this just became my favorite restaurant and new hangout. \n\nDELICIOUS...WONDERFUL....SURPRISING... SCRUMPTIOUS... FANTASTIC... AWESOME... \n\nYou get the point, right? Go! You won't be disappointed!
