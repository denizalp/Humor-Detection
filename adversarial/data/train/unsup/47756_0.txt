I've been here a few times already & I keep coming back bc of the incredible staff & when I mean incredible staff I mean Leaire, (would have given this a 5 star for her) she always makes me feel welcomed & loves to ask about my day & how my week was & gets my order perfect instead of asking her for more things. This last time I came, I was with a girl Alexandria. WORST employee you guys have there, she was so rude & looked like she hated being there with the plainest attitude. Was giving her coworker rude looks & I had her fix my sandwich about 2-3 times bc she just being stingy with the amount. \"Have if your way\" ha more like have her HER way. Defiantly will be calling ahead to see if Leaire is working because I guess it's kinda hard for some people to make a sandwich.
