IM ADDICTED! I wouldn't consider myself as a big bubble tea fan but I am simply addicted to One Zo. They make their own tapioca balls (you can watch them in action at the front of the store). These tapioca come in many different flavours (cactus pear, black sesame, caramel, etc) and my favourite so far would definitely be the black sesame (you can taste the sesame!!)\n\nIm not 100% sure but looking at the barista, it seems that they use milk instead of milk powder (but I could be wrong). Im super excited to try more of their bubbles and teas.
