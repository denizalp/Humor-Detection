I like this place, but hate the location..\n\nOK...got that off my chest. Whew!\n\nI am a sucker for a mediim.rare burger with an egg on top. And Michael Symon delivers every time. I get the burger perfectly cooked, and they don't try to counsel me to overcook it. In other words, they understand how it should be done. \n\nThe beer selection has a nice variety, and they do growlers.\n\nThe atmosphere is fun, and very casual. The paper towels on the table are a necessity.  Service is typically good, at least I've had no issues. \n\nLove the pickled items bar. \n\nOh! And those rosemary fries! Perfect. No really...PERFECT. They are skinny fries that are perfectly cooked, and so magical. I can take or leave fries...let's face it...they are everywhere. I'm incapable of going here without having some of these tasty treats.
