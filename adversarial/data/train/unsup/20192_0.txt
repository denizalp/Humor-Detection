The first few times eating at Fern seemed to be hit or miss for us. However, recently we have been going to brunch every other Sunday and have yet to be disappointed. I was never a big chicken and waffle fan, but their vegan version chicken-fried tofu and waffles is one of my favorite meals in Charlotte. I think it is the maple-hot sauce glaze that is the secret. It is delicious. Every time we go, I contemplate getting something new, but thankfully I keep going back to the waffles and reminding myself how good they are. I did have the huevos rancheros with tofu before and was a fan the first time I had it, was less thrilled the second time, but now it doesn't matter...it's all tofu and waffles these days. \n\nThe wife always gets the biscuits and gravy which does have some excellent tasting gravy. \n\nDefinitely recommend checking them out.
