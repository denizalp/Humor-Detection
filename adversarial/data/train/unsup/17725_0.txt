OMG!  That is all one can say about barCHOCOLATE.  That OMG applies not just to how the confections taste but to just how darn beautiful they are.  Each piece is like a lovely little jewel but these are jewels you can take a bite of and have your toes curling in your shoes as you taste them!\n\nMade with fresh, all natural and local ingredients, these chocolates are a perfect two bites of bliss.  And this comes from a guy who is definitely not the sweet tooth kind.  Highly recommend a trip to the market to check these guys out!
