I did not have a great experience in this airport.  I think I came in through Terminal E, and it just reeked of mildew!  I hope that wing is next in line to get renovated.  \n\nOnce I moved towards the center, it was a lot cleaner looking, but I wasn't crazy about the food selection.  Cinnabon, BBQ, pizza with 4 slices of tomato on it and that's it?  It's tough to be a vegetarian in NC, I guess.  And the lines for the food were ghastly!  Anywhere remotely healthy or yummy looking had an insane line.  I guess I could have had a 5,000 calorie cinnamon bun for lunch.\n\nAnd yes, I gave an extra star for free wifi.
