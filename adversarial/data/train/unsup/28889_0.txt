I just saw a sign for Foo Sing on Brookpark Road in the Target shopping center.  Not sure if they are reopened yet, but I plan on heading over there tonight to see for myself!  When they were forced out of the original location for the new Burlington Coat Factory they had an email sign up list to be notified for when they find aa new location.  I'm not sure if they sent it and it went to my junk mail or not, But I'm so glad to see them reopening again.  I have missed their great food!
