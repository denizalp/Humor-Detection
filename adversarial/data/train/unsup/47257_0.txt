I was on my way home from work, hungry and a little curious about this place, and I am so glad I walked in. Over the past year I tried a quite few things on their menu and loved all of it. My favourite would be the beef tacos. The braised beef has so much flavour, and toppings are fresh. I've never seen anyone grill tacos before, but it's something special to the dish. The burritos and quesadillas are great too!\n\nThe staff here are always smiling and super nice; I don't think I've ever been disappointed at their service. And the prices are very reasonable, and the portions are nice and generous. They renovated the restaurant recently, which is really nice and I hope they will attract more people. If you like Mexican food, I highly recommend it.
