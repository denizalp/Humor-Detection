This was first time trying the float spa, and oxygen bar.  The experience was absolutely amazing, love the ambiance of the Himalayan salt lamps everywhere, the  soothing music and the employees were accommodating and a pleasure to be around.....I would definitely love to do this again, definitely a great place to rid of the stress, pain and aches, so much more.....I would definitely recommend it.
