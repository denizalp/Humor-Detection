Went here once with some friends for half price wine and appetizers. All the apps we had were pretty good. The second time I went is what made me leave this review. My husband and I came for our anniversary. We had the calamari appetizer which was delicious, not too much breading or chewy like some calamari I've had. I had the scallops for dinner and my husband had the shrimp and grits. We were both thoroughly satisfied with the meals and the service. Definitely will be back! Delicious good quality food.
