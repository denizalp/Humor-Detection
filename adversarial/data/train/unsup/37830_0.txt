This used to be my favorite nail place, and I was going there for more than a year regularly. I was getting gel polish on both my fingernails and toenails consistently, and ended up with nail fungus on all of them. Some of that was due to me never going without the polish, but then they kept doing them and never let me know I should leave it off and treat it. After letting all of that grow out for months, I was finally ready to go back and just get a manicure. I ended up with infection around 2 different nails from where they trimmed my cuticles. Needless to say I won't be back!!
