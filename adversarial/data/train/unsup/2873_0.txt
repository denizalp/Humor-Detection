Domus is noisier than a dorm!  Seemingly, the only solution the well-intended staff can offer is to suggest that one call Security.  Calling Security works to cure after-hour pool parities but how does one call Security on your neighbors who are just living their lives?  I notice that \"Mark T. of Domus Apartments\" has offered an architectural explanation for the lack of sound deadening features at Domus -- which only serves to offer no hope for improvement and to validate what we residents are living with.  Anyway, back to neighbors just living their lives...  my upstairs neighbor arrives home about 7:00 pm every evening, takes off his shoes and drops them on the floor (clunk! clunk!) and when he walks, my ceiling lights shake.  He then gets on the phone or has friends over and talks incessantly and loudly.  He also loves to play his favorite song of the moment over and over on nights that he's preparing to go out.  How does one call Security for that?  The couple downstairs is fond of watching action movies on surround sound every night then having sex.  How does one call Security for that?  My neighbor on one side wakes up with a cough every morning.  When he clears his throat it always startles me because it sounds like he's in bed next to me.  Again, how does one call Security for that?  Then there's the couple across the hall.  They have domestics at 4:00 am.  She locks him out in the hallway.  He pounds on the door and calls her name.  I guess one could call Security for that but I don't want to embarrass them.  Of course, the ability to hear each of my neighbor's every move makes me wonder which of my moves they are overhearing.  My lease is up soon and I can't wait to move to a place where I can have a sense of privacy and sleep well again!
