If you've been through Excalibur, you've probably seen the super lame posters for this show. \"Norway to Lose!\", \"Russia to the Show!\", etc. So, since the tickets were cheap, we figured we'd check it out, under the impression we'd probably just be laughing at how corny it was the whole time and have a funny story to tell afterward. Totally wrong.\n\nThe show is great for:\n- Drinking as many beers as you can and yelling at dudes riding around on horses.\n- Becoming immediately and inexplicably nationalistic about the \"country\" they sit you in. We were in \"France\" and instantly wanted nothing more than French victory in battle. Screw Spain!\n- Vegetarians. Just tell the waiter when they first come by, and they'll bring out pasta for you instead of a whole chicken.\n- Giving the finger to typical \"take yourself seriously\" Vegas and just having a good time.\n- People who don't care about historical accuracy in the slightest. The \"Czar of Russia\" pledging allegiance to \"King Arthur's son, Chris\"? Ouch! Good thing they have a full bar. \n\nIn retrospect, I guess it actually WAS corny, and we DID have a funny story to tell afterward... But it was totally enjoyable and 100% worth the price.
