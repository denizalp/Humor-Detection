No draft beer is a drag.\n\nI like the $6 burger Tuesday lunch special.  The house salad is good too.\n\nThe waitresses are nice to look at but it is hit or miss with service.  I go about once a week but they never seem to remember me; interesting for a neighborhood grill.\n\nI have been a few times on Sunday during football season.  A great steak and side for $13...cannot beat that!
