There is no doubt that it's good BBQ. Lovely Brisket, good pulled pork and nice sides. The ribs are average. The type you'd find at a bar that doesn't specialize in them. The piece of sausage they let me try was good, but not good enough to come here for.\nThe real question is, is it worth standing in line for? NO! and differently not in the summer.\nNot to say I wouldn't eat the food. I'd just rather go someplace else (there are many), where the food is just as good if not better, with faster service. Waiting inside and better prices. Their price for a rack of ribs is so much, I felt I was paying for someones Porsche or their kids education.\nI would wait one more time to try the beef ribs. Good ones are so hard to find and I  think they have the skills to do them right. I hope.
