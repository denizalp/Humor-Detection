Friends in from out-of-town last Friday.  We wanted to have a few drinks and talk.  I couldn't think of a better place in the East End to sit back and relax than Kelly's.  I hadn't been there in a couple of years, but remembered it fondly.  \n\nNever made it in.  \n\nWe arrived at 4.30p (hoping to beat the rush of Friday afternoon commuters) but found the place locked.   \n\nNo sign on the doors with the hours of operation.   \n\nThe lights were on and a staff member was standing behind the bar, sorting something.   \n\nWe knocked on the door.  Nobody came. \n\nWe knocked on the window.  The woman behind the bar didn't even look up.  \n\nI didn't have my phone and my buddy's phone doesn't have Web access, so we called 411 for the bar's number.  \n\nCalled the bar TWICE.  Nobody answered the phone.  \n\nWTF?  \n\nAre you THAT successful that you can't (a) post your hours and (b) you can show even a modicum of good customer service?\n\nOr was it because we weren't hipster dofusses (dofi?) you didn't want us in your establishment.\n\nWe went down the street to another bar and enjoyed ourselves for several hours and spend a couple of hundred bucks on food and drink.
