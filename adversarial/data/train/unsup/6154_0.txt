So when my sweet boyfriend sent me a text that said meet me at Dozo for sushi, I was a little nervous.  I'm very hesitant to try a new sushi place, mostly cause I'm just a big-baby-scaredy-cat.   But I put on my big girl pants and met the man at Dozo.  \n\nFrom the minute I walked in the door, I was charmed.  No screaming loud music?  No 19 year olds serving a food they likely know nothing about?  No scenesters to be found?  Dozo, I'm in love.  \n\nWe started with edamame, which was steamed perfectly, very flavorful and lightly salted.  Then we moved on to the Crunchy California roll and a two-piece order of sake (salmon).  Both were delicious, but the sake in particular melted in my mouth.  Next came the caterpillar roll which was tasty, but a little loosely rolled for my taste.  Then a delicious unagi.  Then the bf wanted to order more, I didn't know if I could possibly eat anymore but he agreed to ask the friendly chef for a recommendation.  (Side-note: I love doing this, you get the most unexpected, delicious surprises when you turn a chef loose at his craft.)  What we got in return was the most perfect end to our meal: a spicy tuna roll, with tuna and avocado layered across the top, with a citrus sauce, unagi sauce and all those yummy crunchy bits sprinkled around it.  All of that plus two large Kirins and a flask of sake for about 60 bucks including tax and tip.  \n\nThis place is clean, family run and very friendly.  Service was prompt and the chef was more than willing to educate us about what he was making or what was on the menu.  It was quiet in the restaurant with maybe only three or four other people in the place, but it was a Monday night.  Plus I like it that way....so shhhhh!  Even better....it is in the neighborhood.  We'll be back....often.
