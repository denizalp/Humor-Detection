Huge fan of the food, not so much the prices and the service.  I've had such good service for quite awhile, I'd almost forgotten what it's like to get an apathetic server.  Get it together, woman!  At least act like you care.\n\nThe mighty meaty pizza was really good, full of delicious meaty toppings, and I love the crust!  Yeasty and wheaty and really delicious.  But $21.59 for a medium?  Really?  I think I blasphemed for the first time here.\n\nThen the oven-roasted wings were very tasty as well.  Hot and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  $10.49 for 10?  Over a buck a piece?  Second bad set of words uttered here.\n\nThey have a fantastic beer selection.  The server asked me if I wanted a glass with the bottle of beer I ordered and I declined.  My husband had ordered a beer in a can (we didn't know that at the time), and she didn't offer him a glass.  Weird.  Just a preference thing, but beer in a can tastes much better from a glass.  No tinny overtones.  We each had 2 beers and all were $6.50 each except for the Belgian beer in a can that was $5.50.  All in it was $61.82 after tax, before tip.  Blaspheming continued here.\n\nOur server was really almost nonexistent and not engaged with us as far as talking about the food and beers and even said she doesn't bother to learn the beer list because it changes so much.  \n\nNext time we'll try happy hour so we can afford to eat and drink here, and we'll sit at the bar to maybe get good service.  The place is huge and I like the eclectic d√©cor all over the place.  The outdoor patio and bar seating looked very inviting too.  Maybe we'll have a better experience the next time around.\n\n**Update.  After hearing from the owner just a short time after I posted my review, I'm going to add a star.  I am completely impressed with a business owner that can approach a less-than stellar review with good questions and feedback.  That makes a huge difference.
