Terrific wait staff, appetizers, drinks, CHEESE CAKE, and entrees.  Always a fun occasion to go to - and people watch.  Just wish it dished up fewer calories!  \nAlways excellent - even though it is a chain, and not family owned.  We try to patronize locally owned places to dine - but this \"chain\" is a delightful exception!!
