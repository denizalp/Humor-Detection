THE place to go for pho and more in the Green Valley\/Eastern & 215 area. The shrimp & pork spring rolls are some of the best I've tasted. \n\nService is above average for an Asian restaurant. Sometimes they may not check up on your table, but it's no problem being able to flag someone down. Free hot jasmine tea, which is a nice addition to the meal.
