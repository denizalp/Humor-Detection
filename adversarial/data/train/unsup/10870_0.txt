Wow!  Keep in mind that this is two stars AFTER the fact that we got in for free, without waiting, sat in a super nice booth enclosed in glass, elevated above the dance floor with free top shelf drinks.  Also keep in mind that this review is written for who I think is the average Yelper.  By that I am assuming that you do not visit Las Vegas on a normal basis, and are looking for the best spots to make the most of your trip (like me).  \n\nThe Good:  \n- Go go dancers that smile, are great dancers, and in great shape.  They even climb up the pole with plastic umbrellas.\n- Great DJ, good music\n-Being the newest club in town means...it's new.  Everything is new and shiny.  I like shiny things.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Bathrooms lines were stupid long.\n-Super small club.\n-Even in the VIP lounge there wasn't much room to dance.  Looking around there were people dancing on ledges everywhere.  You could not move in the dance floor.\n-The VIP hostesses are beautiful.  But beauty doesn't give you the right to glare at me when I politely decline a drink they shove at me.  Also, unless you are a man, they won't even make eye contact with you.\n\nThe Ugly: \n-The bouncers are super rude unless you know somebody.  Even then, some still have a snooty attitude.  \n\nThe Disgusting:\n-Not the fault of the club, but a great reflection of their clientele.  \nI'm behind my girlfriend (who is white) and walking towards the VIP lounge from the bathroom and heard this ugly, nasally, voice screech out as loud as she could \"What the F*ck is up with all these stupid Asians?!\"  My friend is passing her as she screams this and I am now face to face with her.  She stares at me and looks terrified.  If I wasn't invited into the VIP booth as a guest, I truly would have made a scene, but I just laughed at her.  \n\nThe Verdict:  I would not pay to come in here.  In fact, if somebody else paid, I still would not come back.  I thought America was past racism, but I was wrong.
