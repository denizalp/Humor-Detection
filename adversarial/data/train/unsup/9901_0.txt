My daughter has been taking lessons here for over a year and we'll be moving to a new school in June after the recital.\n\nThe staff is just okay and the classes are just okay but the prices are pretty high.\n\nWe feel like they're not as interested in teaching, caring for the kids or improving the kids as they are about making sure they're paid.\n\nYou can find better and I suggest you do.
