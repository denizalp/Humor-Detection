I've been here many times for team lunches or casual work events. Collectively we have ordered nearly everything on the menu. For the most part sashimi seems fresh and the portion sizes are good, but the rolls have WAY too much sauce. Everything feels like it has been drizzled triple time. I usually recommend half the sauce because it is completely doused in it. Service is decent though, they bring your food promptly and nicely lay everything out, but getting the bill can take a while (ironic). Not my first choice for restaurants.
