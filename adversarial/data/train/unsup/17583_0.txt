First, a place owned and operated by an American can not be authentic and it's not! It is what most refer to as Tex-Mex.\n\nI am getting more and more disappointed with the stacked Yelp deck and not being able to count on the slew of reviews that are more often than not bought through services.  Considering the amount of reviews this restaurant has and considering the reality that it is no where near to the best \"authentic\" Mexican food and also not deserving of a $ rating, it's reasonable to assume that the majority of reviews here are bought and paid for.  \n\nI'm an Engineer married to a Latino. I live here in LV, CA and Texas.  My wife wanted to leave the minute she saw the menu and realized it wasn't authentic Mexican food. However, I hate leaving so we went ahead and ordered.  I got five street tacos on special for 7.45 plus tax and my wife had the Breakfast Chorizo Burrito for about $5.50 plus tax. So our total bill with tax was about $14.50.\n\nThe street tacos had about 1 tablespoon of meat...yes that's correct, one bite of food for about $1.50 and that's a supposed \"special\" price. My wife's burrito was larger but again not much meat and all eggs. Considering that you can get a Carne Asada burrito packed with meat and no eggs at almost any Mexican joint for the same price, again the price of $5.50 was way too high for a breakfast burrito. It should have cost no more than $3.99 because again it was mostly eggs.\n\nIt would have taken a third meal to fill two people up  because their portions are so small. In fact, after eating here we had to go to another restaurant to eat again. So if you factor in another meal around $7.00 now you are at $21 for two people...hardly what I would call $. It never ceases to amaze me how reviewers rate base on the price of an item instead of what you get for the price. Hence, if they charge only $1.50 for a taco and all other restaurants are charging $3.00 but the $1.50 taco only gives you one bite compared to the $3 taco that gives you 8 bites, the $3 taco is a better deal. \n\nThe taste of the food was OK for Tex-Mex but nowhere near the taste of \"authentic\" Mexican food and when you get down to it nowhere near the best Tex-Mex.\n\nI rate the value at $$ and the food at three stars as any legitimate, unbiased, review probably would. Also, the atmosphere had loud American music and was not at all conducive to an authentic Mexican establishment. And, I'm being extremely kind with a three star rating as we WILL NOT be returning which in all actuality makes it a two-star establishment.
