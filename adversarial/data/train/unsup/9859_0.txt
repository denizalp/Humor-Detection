Yonaka is good.\n\nCome here for their Happy Hours.  There's a separate Happy Hour menu.  They run from 5 pm - 6:30 pm and 11 pm - 2 am.  I've only been to their 11 pm Happy Hours which doesn't get to busy.  Sit at the bar if it's available or at one of their tables though they both work out good.  \n\nA must have is their Crispy Brussel Sprouts http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=3_WTe2cZ1rDORg9bsAWJgg#3_WTe2cZ1rDORg9bsAWJgg there are better pics but this was mine. So good and so refreshing.  They're brussel sprouts with lemon chili, mint, and puffed rice all charred up together. Didn't really care for the puffed rice but so good.\n\nAnother must have is their Tea Brined Ribs http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=De2lRI4xE353jlYac9aC6Q#De2lRI4xE353jlYac9aC6Q again there's probably better pics.  They're pork ribs in a citrus citrus-honey-tea glaze and sesame.  Sweet and tasty, not your typical BBQish pork rib.\n\nAnother must have is their Karaage  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=De2lRI4xE353jlYac9aC6Q#4SDCYEHrg0maFggCW_1T5g  I didn't take a good pic so I stole one.  They're this fried on the outside and juicy on the inside fried chicken pieces with jalapeno, mint, basil, and onion.  The best way I can describe it all is like fried frog legs but not really.  You bite into them and after you past their fried outsides it feels like it burst opens with it's moist insides. I don't really know how to explain it just try it. Spicy, yet refreshing. \n\nWho am I kidding almost everything is a must have. Here's a few more items I've had with a pic.\nThere's Gyu Sliders http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=8bju5AS8EBNp7o4aO6k9Lw#8bju5AS8EBNp7o4aO6k9Lw \nA Seasonal Sorbet Selection http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/yonaka-modern-japanese-las-vegas?select=yAxLlRGdxR-3axaQ2Jc7zw#yAxLlRGdxR-3axaQ2Jc7zw \n\nEat everything slowly and in small bites that's how I'd eat it all. Nice interior and excellent service and very friendly staff. They have special daily items. And there's sake.\n\nIf you need a quick phone charge while you eat there's a power outlet next to the tables near the hostess counter.  It's right there so why not use it just don't go setting up shop there.
