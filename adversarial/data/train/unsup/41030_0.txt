I really really liked this place. The fish was fresh, the service was great and the manager came and checked in on us. The food was delicious and super cheap. The only reason they are getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that there was a construction going on in the back and they had a ton of noise going on. You couldn't hear the conversation over the noise, there was a guy painting the restroom so it made it kind of impossible to use the toilet since the door was open he has in there painting and there was no latch.
