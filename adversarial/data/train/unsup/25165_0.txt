I've been driving past this place for the past 4 weeks and I decided to finally check it out earlier today.  Their selection is huge, with more North Face, Patagonia, and Marmot gear in every color imaginable than I think I've seen in most other sporting goods stores.  While many of their items are out of the price range of a penny-pinching college student, they have a pretty nice clearance section in the back that, with a little bit of digging, turns up some great bargains.  I ended up getting a $35 pair of Columbia running shorts for half price so I can't complain! Additionally, the surplus section of the store is pretty cool and most of the army gear that they have is in pretty great shape.  In regards to the staff, they were very attentive and helpful; there to answer questions without hovering.  I'd definitely recommend to anyone looking for gear for their next camping trip, general fitness needs, or to gear up for the most likely impending polar vortex to come yet again this winter!
