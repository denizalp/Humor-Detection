Wow that was a bad massage. I felt like I was a cat or a dog getting petted. At one point, they were \"massaging\" my back and I felt like someone was rubbing my back while my head was in the toilet. And the foot massage was better at any mani\/pedi place I've been to. \n\nThere are so many massage places in the area. Give any other place a try.
