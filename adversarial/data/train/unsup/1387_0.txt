These nice purveyors of American food and contributors to culture not only make a dynamite pastrami sandwich and great drinks---\n\nThey stand up to the bastards at THE TOW TRUCK COMPANY who regularly victimize tourists and locals with their barely legal tow Trap operation!\n\nThat alone is worth the full five stars.  Thanks guys and gals!
