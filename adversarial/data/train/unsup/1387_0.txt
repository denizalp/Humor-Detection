First time eating food from Pita Jungle.  I've heard so much about this place, I couldn't wait.  I was at a client meeting in Downtown Phoenix and since the meeting went over the lunch hour, they asked if we wanted to grab something to eat and someone mentioned Pita Jungle....awesome.\n\nI ordered the Falafel Pita.  It was pretty good.  The Falafel was cooked just right with a hard outer shell and moist and tasty center.  The Pita and Veggies were good too.\n\nOverall, it was a very satisfying meal and we were able to power through our meeting.  I want to come back and try different menu items.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%
