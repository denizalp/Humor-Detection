I visited the Shameful Tiki room way back in August 2016, but somehow my review went into the \"draft folder\" instead of posting, so here it is.\nA Birthday celebration with a friend last night at The Shameful Tiki was a total blast!\nThe place is surprisingly tiny, but the decor is perfect, the drinks were delicious, and the celebratory volcano bowls and mystery bowls are a total trip, complete with music sound effects and smoke machine effects! \nHonestly, everything was absolutely perfect, just as I had hoped, and helped turn this little birthday celebration up a notch, just as I hoped!\nThe surprise of the night was the food, portions were small but quality was really excellent. She had the vegan tacos and I had the burger and both were excellent quality, and absolutely delicious.\nI don't give up very many 5-star reviews, because I think there's always room for improvement, but I think the shameful Tiki really hit it out of the park!\nIf you have a birthday or a special celebration planned, or just want to have a few cocktails and some fun with friends, I highly recommend the shameful Tiki.\nI had so much fun, I even took home one of their custom Tiki mugs for my home bar collection. I'll be back!
