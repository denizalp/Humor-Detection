Had lunch delivered to our home. The food arrived just barely warm and we both got 'intestinal discomfort' followed by a lot of time on the toilet later that day. Made the connection after the third time we got lunch from this place over the course of several months with the same result. For this reason, we have nicknamed them \"Number 2 Kitchen\"  and no longer go here.
