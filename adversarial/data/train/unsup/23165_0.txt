Deli Snowdon is part of Montreal's culinary history.  It is a traditional, Jewish deli that opened way back in 1946 and is still around today.  You'll find all the staples of the Jewish deli on the menu like matzo ball soup, karnatzel and smoked meat. \n\nIt's in a bit of an awkward location lying along Decarie with not much around it.  There is some street parking available but that is about it.  Inside the place is a little dated and could use a bit of a facelift.  It is pretty big though so getting a seat is a breeze.\n\nOn this particular visit I thought I would go with something traditional like brisket. This came served to me on rye bread and it was drenched in gravy.  The meat was juicy and tender and I really enjoyed it.  I also had a side of onion rings which were only so so.  There was a little too much batter and the portion was pretty small.  \n\nAlso they have cherry Coke and I mean Coca Cola, not some imitation brand!  This is one of my favourite soft drinks yet it is hard to come by here in Canada.  I always have no trouble finding it in the US but here you really have to go looking for it.   Needless to say this made me happy!\n\nThe prices are reasonable and I paid about $16-17 for my whole meal which is what I would have paid anywhere else.  It's an interesting option if you find yourself in the area but I'm not sure it is worth a detour.
