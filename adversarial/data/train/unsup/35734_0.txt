I went to this restaurant because I was HANGRY and it was across from my gate. This was the beginning of my birthday weekend and it was after 12pm so a mimosa was in order. It was fine; that's hard to mess up. The chicken flatbread I ordered was mediocre at best. It was served with a packet of Parmesan cheese. That's right, a packet. I suppose the need to have to get people in and out efficiently is a priority. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because, Melissa, my server was very kind and attentive. Otherwise, this review can be summarized by saying \"go to another concourse, the walk will be worth it.\"
