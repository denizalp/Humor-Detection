We are so glad we stopped in after empanadas at Viva Las Arepas. \nWe were on a food adventure and we hit a home run!\nThe gelato was delicious and the owner was so great! We test tasted many flavors and each ended up with a couple of amazing flavors and a couple more to go! \nThe flavors are authentic and wonderful combinations. There were all time favorites  like chocolate, peanut butter, raspberry. And the there was rosemary!  All delicious!  It's a must try!!!!
