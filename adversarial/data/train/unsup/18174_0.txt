Stopped in just before closing for some ice cream on my friend's cheat day.  We'd walked all the way to Serendipity which was (unbelievably) out of ice cream on a Sunday.  So we passed BLVD on our dejected and ice cream-less trek back to the hotel and decided to give it a shot. \n\nThe line wasn't too long but it was less than 10 minutes before they closed - they had tons of ice cream and cookies and stock left of items you'd want from the menu - which was good - since it was close to closing time!  \n\nAfter we stood for about 10 minutes we were up to order and saw a special for a St. Patrick's Day themed milkshake which my husband and his bff both decided to get.  \n\nI was a bit worried about them doing a bad job since they were probably annoyed by the line and amount of people who wanted ice cream just before closing time (they had locked the doors by this point and weren't letting any new people in only us out once everyone got their stuff) but the gal was jovial and friendly - she took her time to make the shakes and even topped them cheerfully with whipped cream and some oreo cookie crumbles.  \n\nMy husband decided to buy some unmarked Fiji water while paying and it was $25 for the two shakes and water.  I was like - \"How much were the shakes?!\"  They were $8 a pop which is steep but not terrible - but that water was $8!  OMFG.  Ridiculous.  \n\nThat's annoying - it was a large FIJI but it's still water - which is like $2 at the gas station - that markup is something atrocious.  My husband never looks before he pays and it wasn't marked anywhere in their drink case - he paid it but I'd have asked them to take that shit off. \n\nThe ice cream was good - but I'm takin' a star off just for the overpriced water.
