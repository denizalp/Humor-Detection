Gals at front desk check in were friendly. We stayed 2 days and mentioned problems with hot tub during first night. They called back and said issue was fixed, No It wasn't. Called again on second night with same hot tub complaint, they said it was fixed, no it wasn't. We expected Marriot type service but didn't receive that. We made a special trip from Ohio and were disappointed with how things worked out here. We will look to stay elsewhere next time visiting Arizona.
