I am NOT a fan AT ALL, I enjoy a good massage  and am very fair when it come to cost but this place is a rip off. I've been to Hand and Stone before for the introductory price of $49.99. It wasn't a good experience as the massage was very touch and go nothing worth remembering. That massage happened June of 2014 & I didn't write a review because I said ONE DAY I'll try them again and maybe things will get better. \nWell I tried them again this past Monday Aug.14 (National BianKa with a 'K'\/ my Birthday ) and when I tell you it was the worst idea  ever I MEAN IT. \nFirst off I was put in the first room off the lobby, so the noise level wasn't relaxing with techs welcoming clients and taking clients back to the waiting area to pay and saying their partings which isn't comforting for someone trying to get a massage and relax. \nLet's get to the COLD, when I say COLD I'm talking the room and more importantly the tech Aga hands which were ICE BRICK COLD. I immediately informed her by jumping out my skin when she touched my back and she said \"My hands are cold this time of year\" . Mind you it's SUMMER & it was over 90 degrees on Monday the day of my massage. \nShe left the lights super lit, I had to ask if she could dim them like a normal massage .\n\nThe cost just took the cake, I had a SpaFinder gift card from a friend for $50 and a $10 off coupon which in my eyes would be way more than enough for this horrific massage. Instead after applying all the discounts I still owed $29.95 and I couldn't for the life of me understand WHY I would still owe after all that. No one could show me anywhere in the menu where the cost for a prenatal massage was I was just told that it cost the same as a regular massage for non members which is $89.95 which is preposterous for a bootleg massage. I'll NEVER return here unless it's FREE considering I wasted my gift card and my coupon and my $30 cash. Super THUMBS DOWN  not one but two THUMBS DOWN
