I've always said I avoid \"fusion\" restaurants. I am a vegetarian and it should be easy to find something anywhere... but with fusion dishes it's nearly impossible to customize or substitute entrees and that creates problems for my diet and (mushroom) allergy.\n\nLast night while arriving 45 min. prior to watching \"perks of being a wallflower\" (watch it!) I noticed this place next door. I have been wanting to try \"tapas\" (this was not that style of small plates)... \n\nMy friend and I stopped in and ordered two individual glasses of sake wine \n(try the top red option if you dine here! I had the white peach- meh.) I simply ordered dessert which was the banana fritter + ice cream. It was good but nothing spectacular. Ordinary deep fried 'nana, fruit as a garnish, and a scoop of ice cream. Not even really worth the $6. Why didn't I eat any 'real food'? I only noticed one tofu dish listed throughout the whole menu. Not very impressed. And NOT veggie friendly. \nI've been to other sushi places and usually I can at best find a ramen noodle option. Not the case here.\n\nAlso, the female server was nice 'n all, she mentioned. . .\"Oh if you ever stop here AFTER your movie you can bring your ticket stub and get a discount\" \nUh....... cool? Not helping us tonight. We also split the bill. 2 cards. she charged mine twice! How do you mess that up? We weren't even in a rush. \n\nAs the yelp rating ^ states, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"
