You get what you pay for in forms of service. Best time to come would be morning or early afternoon. After 5 it becomes packed and I had an appointment but everyone else that came after said they did as well and it was a mess since they didn't take names for that afternoon appointments. \nColor selection is sort of limited.  They did a good job on my fill except that right after getting my nails painted and done it looked like I had them for at least 5 days.
