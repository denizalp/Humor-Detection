So very grateful to Dr Brian and his staff.  If it wasn't for him 6 months ago referring me to \"New Eyes\" I certainly wouldn't have my eye sight corrected. So a big Thank you to him and all the ladies who work there.\n\nThe office is very modern and very well kept. The staff is super nice and knowledgeable.\n\nDr Brian is awesome. He is very professional and thorough. I can tell he really cares about his patients.\nI received a good bill of eye health and was finally able to get a new prescription for glasses. \n\nI can see again! Thank you.\nHighly recommend!!
