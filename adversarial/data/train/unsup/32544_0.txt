Now that I've eaten at La Tavola I can't believe all the good reviews it got. The calamari was very chewy although the flavor was good. the sauce did not stick to the pasta and the grease used for the veal was not fresh.  The only thing memorable was the rack of lamb. We all agreed it was very good. Service was adequate. Ambiance was terrible.
