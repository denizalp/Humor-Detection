This is the best bike shop around!  They are knowledgable and honest.\nI just took my bike in for a tune up before the Velosano.  It had been sitting in garage all winter (I know....bad).  They took it in the back and came out and told me they truly did not believe it needed a tune up. They oiled it and checked everything for free.  \n\nAny other shop would have taken my money....and done a \"tune up\" regardless of the need.\n\nThese guys\/gals are the best in town!  I will drive to Solon and pass many other bike shops just to give them my business!\n\nSo great to finally see a retail establishment with class!
