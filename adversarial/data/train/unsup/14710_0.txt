10\/01\/14 I've had more pleasant experiences. This place is a dive.  It tries so hard to be hipster, but fails.  Just because you have a wire bicycle on the wall with Christmas lights hanging from it and a few PBR signs, doesn't mean you are cool and hip and don't need to, oh, I don't know, maybe provide a good product\/service?\nThe front bar was the best room, but tiny.  The hall leading to the pool table room is lined with wooden seating booths...which had dirty upholstered seats.  It reeked of urine, or a urine-like smell.  The walls were dirty, had holes and half the artwork looked like it was ripped from the wall.  There was no menu presented, except for a draft menu, and I didn't see any waitstaff.   The back room had more seating, and a pool table.  Patio was the nicest feature.\nThe bartender was exceptionally rude and really put a damper on things.  She is short, brown hair.  Several people around me also noticed she was just not happy to be there-she gave a lot of attitude and eye-rolling. I asked her to mix me a specific drink (listing the ingredients) and she made a face and said \"yeah, ooookay.\"  Wow.  Our party only ordered one drink each because she was so nasty acting.  Even opening a bottle or pouring a Jackie O's was taxing for her.  I tipped her anyway, hoping her mood would improve, but she snatched it up and didn't even say thanks (and I hadn't even picked up my drink-a concoction she made up because they have a piss-poor bar and were out of rum.  For once I thanked the bar gods for the copious amount of ice in my glass, which watered down what I can only describe as liquid hate mixed with battery acid and lemon juice.)\nI very rarely give one stars.  Our group did make a note to never return to this dump!  The one star it does get is only because I saw another Yelper there, with her cute doggie.
