Took some friends out to dinner in Vegas and figured that RM Seafood would be a great place to stop by for dinner.  Assumed that with the RM name the quality would be high and the food excellent.  I was somewhat conflicted about what rating to give for the restaurant.\n\nDrink started off while we waited for our table to be ready, about 45 minutes for a walk in group of 6, not bad in my opinion.  Had a Hedricks gin and tonic at the bar.  Well made and balanced, not weak but not overpoweringly alcoholic.  Quick bar service.\n\nThe bread came to the table with 2 types.  The cornbread was fairly standard and average.  However, the biscuits were dense yet moist.  The tight crumb was refreshing with a moist buttery center.  I was a fan instantly.\n\nI chose the house signature bib salad.  The lettuce was fresh and crisp with a high quality bib lettuce.  The green goddess dressing was excellent, this was by far the best green goddess dressing I have ever had anywhere.\n\nThe main dish was halibut with pea and a basil broth.  The fresh halibut was disappointing.  Flesh was firm but dry, there was little preserved moisture toward the edge of the filet.  The halibut appeared to be a quality piece, but the preparation and cooking could have been better.  The basil broth was thin, watery, and bland.\n\nThe high point of the dish was the peas and the pea shoots.  They were tender and sweet with a bright taste.  However, they did not make up for the rest of the dish.\n\nStaff was quick, courteous, and very helpful.  However, the few high points of the night did not make up for the problematic main dish.  If the halibut was better I would have gone up to 4 stars, but unfortunately I can not in good conscience do so.
