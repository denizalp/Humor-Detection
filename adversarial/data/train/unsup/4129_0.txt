I bought a living social only after specifically asking if they have certified prenatal massage therapist. I have constant back aches and my feet are killing me. So I thought this would be a good time to use my living social. The place is far from my home but what the hay, I am about to get an hour long massage for $33 so no complaints. I walked in and the girl at the desk was nice. I used the rest room which was meh - not so clean like I would expect at the spa but whatever. My therapist was waiting for me outside the bathroom. The rooms are really really dark and hot!  My therapist turned on a small fan on the table, didnt give me any direction on what she wanted....no clothes, clothes, face this way etc. She was kind of like whatever you want. Ok thats fine. What really icked me out was the 2 pillows on the table did not smell or look clean. I said a quick prayer and put my head down lol. Hopefully Im not home with bed bugs. The therapist herself didnt seem like she knew what she was doing. I didnt get any relief because there was no pressure at all even though I asked her to add pressure. And the oddest thing is that they do not use any lotion or oil on your skin which makes the rub  really uncomfortable. \nI have had a fabulous prenatal massage at  Massage envy on rea road and the experience was different and the full price for a massage is cheaper than this places full prices. Massage envy is $79 and this place charges $85. For what - Dirty pillows, Hot rooms (seriously turn on the ac when its 85 degrees outside) and under trained therapists. Save your money and go elsewhere.
