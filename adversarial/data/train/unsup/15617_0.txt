Short review for a short visit *cracks knuckles anyway*:\n\nAfter hearing a little buzz about a Korean soft serve chain opening up in Toronto, I looked into it and saw that they had a very popular honeycomb ice cream so I thought \"oh it must be Softree!!!\", but no, it was Milkcow which I've never heard of. Either way, I ventured on through Hellfire aka Toronto weather and showed up to their grand opening expecting a queue, but the store was mostly empty. I feel like walking into empty establishments is becoming a thing with me. Anyway, I ordered the Green Light (mint syrup + almond) because mint ice cream and I share a special relationship and my friend got the Black Pearl (hazelnut syrup + sea salt + cocoball topping). \n\nWe got our ice creams, sat down, took pics and dug in. Eh. It was good. Minty soft serve. The syrup tasted kind of like creme de menthe if you've ever had that. My friend's was also just good. Maybe our minds would've been blown had we ordered the honeycomb ice cream, but the record-high heat was screwing with our cognitive abilities and we went for things we usually get. \n\nOverall pretty good. If I hear enough praise I'll probably return, but until then I'll be at home with my AC and two best friends: Ben & Jerry.
