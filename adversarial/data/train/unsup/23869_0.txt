I've been waiting  for this promotion in the mail from the Golden Nugget Casino,  I called to make my reservations for May 1st through the 3rd. But do to the fight they won't Honor this promotion, I have been a steady customer for the past 5 years and this is how they treat loyal  customer's! All I have to say is Fu!# You GOLDEN NUGGET!!!,  will never stay at your hotel ever again. So friends and family if you stay there don't give them a dime of your gambling money. Play at the Fremont or other surrounding casinos!\n\"I forgot NOT for kids\"\n\"late night prostitution\"\n\"Crap dealers are cool at times\"\n\"Fremont is a freak show\"\n\"Vic & Anthony is a great steak house\"\n\"Great pizza at the grotto\"
