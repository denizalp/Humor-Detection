This is my favorite restaurant on the strip! Their southern food is phenomenal and the ambience is great! I stop in here every time I come to Las Vegas! I've tried their marrow bones over toast, their shrimp and grits, the chicken n watermelon n waffles, and the chicken n biscuits. All phenomenal!! My fianc√© also loves their cocktails. He says the bacon infused old fashioned is the best cocktail he has ever had.
