Complete and utter ripoff. \n\n9 of us bowled for two hours in two lanes and were charged $186 for 2.5 hours which was an extra 30 + tax. One lane didn't work and we had to have  the guy reset us SEVEN TIMES in 10 minutes before they moved our entire group to the other side of the alley. The other lane stopped at the end of 2 hours when screen said game was over. We were supposedly given an extra 20 minutes to compensate for the broken lane but ended up having to pay for it and the 30 minutes that the other lane did not actually use when the screen said their time was finished. Manager basically ignored us when we asked him to explain this. \n\nIf you want a bowling alley with modern equipment that works and not to be ripped off go elsewhere.
