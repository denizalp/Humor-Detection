DO NOT GET COX PHONE SERVICE. \n\nWe were sweet talked into changing our Century Link phone service to Cox Phone service.   The clueless tech fiddles with our phone for ninety minutes installing a huge phone modem in addition to our basic cable modem, screws up our fax machine, and has our phone number switched off.  When I had enough of his shenanigans and asked him to leave, he and his supervisor I demanded he call refused to have our basic phone service resumed. We are now without any phone service at all, and our business fax does not work.  \n\nDO NOT GET COX PHONE SERVICE.
