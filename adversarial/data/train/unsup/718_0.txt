We have returned to Intermezzo a few times and the Serbian dishes are very good.  The beef burek is very good.  Think of it is a flaky calzone with perfectly seasoned ground beef.  I have also tried the stuffed cabbage (sarma) which was very good.  Additionally, the sandwiches are very good since they make their own bread.   I highly recommend this place and it is reasonably priced too.
