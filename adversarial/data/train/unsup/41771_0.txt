Overpriced even for the airport with mediocre food (at best). I ordered one of the rice bowls with mixed veggies, Guac, and an egg. The egg was half raw still, the quac wasn't fresh (it's the kind you get from a pouch and it tasted off), and the rice was like an Uncle Ben's kit. I've made better at home (and I'm a terrible cook, so that says something). Wait staff was friendly and fast, which is why it got over 1*
