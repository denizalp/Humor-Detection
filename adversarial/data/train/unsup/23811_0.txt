I love this candy store! It's located in the Bally's walkway at the bottom of the escalator, just before the food court. They have a great selection of candy, chocolates, and novelty treats. My favorites are the creamsicle flavored gummi bears and the gummi marshmallow turtles. The staff are all super nice and helpful too! I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!
