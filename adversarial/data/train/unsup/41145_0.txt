My girlfriend and I just ordered some wings from here, got home and found out that the wings had no flavor on them, with the exception of one wing that had the lemon pepper dry rub she asked for. For future patrons make sure when you order to go, check the wings before you leave the place. I definitely won't be ordering here again. Also, there's a employee in there with tattoos on his right arm that I'm sure was making our order, seemed very rushed.
