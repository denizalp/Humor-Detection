The room is tastefully decorated and service throughout our meal was excellent.  \nWe decided to pass on appetizers\/salads in favor of an order of delicious saut√©ed spinach.  We each chose grilled halibut for an entree that came with au gratin potatoes.  Everything was excellent though our halibut was overdone and dry.  We did not return the fish because we were under tight time constraints since we would be seeing a show immediately following.
