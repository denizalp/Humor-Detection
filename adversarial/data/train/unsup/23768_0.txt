Painted black and gold (even the ATM machine outside) and nestled in the heart of the Strip District, this store is comparable to Party Max and Party City stores...except that in addition to basic themed party supplies they sell everything Steelers.  In fact, Mike Feinberg Co. was the \"Terrible Towel Headquarters\" from the 1970s to 2000.  Loads of Pens and Pirates merchandise for sale as well.\n\nPolamalu wig?  Check!\nPenguins Mr. Potato Head?  Check!\nSteelers scrubs?  Check!\n\nMike Feinberg Co. puts even the kooky selection of Steelers merchandise that one can find on eBay to shame!  Like the website states, this place is your \"one stop shop\" for Black & Gold merchandise.
