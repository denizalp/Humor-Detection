I really don't have that much to say about this drive-thru operation as I wasn't aware of how big a chain it was outside of the San Francisco Bay Area. I was driving back to my hotel in north central Phoenix and noticed this was the only place still open for coffee. I ordered a $4 Americano little realizing how big the mobile cup would be (photo: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2N1is99). It took about fifteen minutes all told. When I finally tasted it back at the hotel, it was at the right temperature for me to sip though the taste was just slightly burnt. No matter as it gave me caffeine I was looking for, so I could respond to all the emails I ignored all day.\n\nCOFFEE - 3 stars...tasted the way I expected for a drive-thru business\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...well, uh, I was in my rental car\nSERVICE - 3 stars...friendly enough\nTOTAL - 3 stars...as transactional as you could possibly want
