Are you a cat because you're purrrrrrfect!\n\nMy heart is full of fluffy kittens!\n\nWhat's a better way to spend your day off than playing with a bunch of cats and kittens?  Trick question, the answer is, \"nothing!\"  For $10\/hr, you can surround yourself with gentle purrs and a choir of \"meows\" from cats looking for their Forever Home.  LaGattara is partnered up with Lost Our Home Pet Rescue and they have a clowder of cats and kindle of kittens waiting for a kind Yelper, such as yourself, to adopt them.  Take off your shoes, run around in socks [they supply a clean pair for you if you're not wearing any], and go have some fun!  It's therapeutic, even.\n\nThe cafe portion of the place isn't up and running yet but don't let that stop you from stopping by to boop some feline noses and play with their little toebeans.  There are a lot of events such as yoga, paint night, and even movie night being hosted here so check out their website.  This place is truly amazing and I hope that those looking for fur babies decides to stop in to adopt... don't shop!
