I was shocked and appalled when I had the unfortunate experience of sitting next to a nurse who works at your facility. She described it as a place for \"crazy people\". I wanted to take her picture and post it but it's not the right thing to do. Anyone who exhibits that kind of lack of empathy has no business working there. It's disgusting and unforgivable.  I can't wait to move away from her. She sickens me. \nShame on you and your facility.
