\"Roses are red, violets are rare. Coffee, coffee, coffee rockin' everywhere\"\n\nAvery's is another great spot to get your Java Jolt on in the Valley. I popped in after a meeting and met Linda behind the counter who was friendly and accommodating. After using my check-in offer, which takes $.50 off any large espresso drink, she informed me that they roast all their beans in house and get their beans from a local distributor. Local, local, local rockin' everywhere! \n\nInside Avery's it looks very much like a coffee shop that your gam-gam might want to hang out. Stained glass, flowers, and older clientele scattered around the space. Not traditionally a place that I would like to set up shop and work for a while. If you're younger this is a get it and go spot, but for older cats it's a great place to catch up on old times and talk about the new fangled Flat TVs they have today. \n\nThe espresso here was very good and had a clean taste. No SBUX burnt standard here. Good spot for coffee and a very friendly staff. Hmmm, so roasty!
