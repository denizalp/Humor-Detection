Hi Doomie's! Welcome to Toronto!\n\nI say that because Doomie's is a vegan restaurant from our neighbour south of the border. Los Angeles specifically. They are know for their #whatveganseat movement. That they don't just eat salads and raw foods.\n\nTheir menu lists items similar to what you would find at your everyday pub. Burgers, sandwiches, and a whole bunch of fried stuff - except everything is vegan!\n\nI love avocados and was immediately drawn to fried avocados as it was the first item on the menu. My friend and I also ordered \"fried chicken\" and waffle and mac & cheese. Everything was delicious! Other items on the menu I'm tempted to try: pesto chicken mac & cheese, \"pulled pork\" burger and their assortment of desserts including doombits.\n\nThey have quite the cocktail menu as well!\n\nOne slight issue I had was with their ventilation. I'm not sure whether it was because it was their grand opening and they weren't able to get the issue sorted or not, but my friend and I sat right by the door, and at times when they used a hot sauce, it was so concentrated that it caused a lot of my friend and I to cough a lot, even the hostess had to open the door to air it out.\n\nI'll be back!
