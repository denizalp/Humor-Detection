Daystar how I love thee!  You've been there for me in one way or another since I was just a teenager.  I learned about the Grateful Dead because of you. (Thank you if I've never done so before).  The first waft of Nag Champa to bless my nostrils was because of you, too.\n\nFrom my hemp necklace phase, to the many times you had supplied me with candles and incense...you just always had the \"thing\" I was looking for, but didn't have anywhere else to get it.  And, at the end of the day isn't that exactly what a headshop is supposed to be?  Yes, and yes!\n\nIn all seriousness, Daystar, has to be the best headshop on the Westside of CLE, if not ALL of CLE.  They have a great array of tobacco pipes (glass, wood, metal, bone) and a good supply of water pipes; including any spare\/replacement parts that you need.\n\nWhatever you need to recreate \"Shakedown Street\" in the comforts and confines of your own home, Daystar has it.  Glass\/chalice cleaning solutions? Check.  Papers?  Check.  Candles?  Check.
