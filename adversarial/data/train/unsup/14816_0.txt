Aiiiiiiiiu, if one must go eggstatic over a sandwich, Eggslut is the place to gooooo.\n\nLocated right on the 2nd floor of the Cosmo, this place is pretty easy to see due to the long long line of hungry people.\n\nMade a quick stop here with my mom and we left feeling satisfied. For food, we ordered the Fairfax sandwich (which was a glorified scrambled egg sandwich with onions\/chives\/siracha sauce), fresh OJ and the dark chocolate cookie. \n\nOJ = fresh and .....orange :)\n\nCookie = KICK ASS COOKIEEEEEEE. You should try this if it's in stock since they do run out from time to time. Plus, your cookie gets heated up, so the melty chocolate is worth it.\n\nFairfax Sandwich = yummmmy. Eggs were so fluffy and light as a feather. In terms of taste, it was pretty good, especially the bread. Perfect for sharing if you're not too hungry. \n\nPricing = priceyyy. It's Vegas....so $20 bucks for a meal wasn't too bad. \n\nOverall, this was a solid stop for breakfast\/snack. If you don't see any seats at the nearby counter, don't fret! Just wander around and sit in the comfy lounge seats :D
