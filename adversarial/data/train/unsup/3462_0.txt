This Avis is such a scam!\n\nWe booked our reservation online with a coupon.  When we initially checked in, the clerk asked us to please present any coupons. We explained we clicked through a coupon online. He said he had to see it so I pulled it up on my phone. He then declared that they weren't accepting any coupons that month and wouldn't honor it.\n\nWhat kind of shadiness is this?? I rent a car about once a year on vacay and have never had drama. Will definitely be avoiding Avis for ALL future bookings.
