Last night I attended this Macaroni grill and I was disgusted by their customer service. I was harassed by my server who is named Tony. Now, I understand we were in a Henderson which is almost like the Beverly Hills of Las Vegas and the people there were dressed business casual but that gave him no right to treat me like SHIT! I may have tattoos and I might not have been suited and booted like these older folks but I had just enough money as them in my wallet and I am a big tipper. He gave me a dirty look when I declined the wine and ordered beer instead. He repeatedly came back and tried to remove my plate from the table while I was still eating and had a mouth full. It is such a shame that I was treated that way and that one employee made the whole restaurant look like a shit hole I will never go back there again nor will I recommend it and I will definitely tell ALL of my friends and family members in Las Vegas, Summerlin, and Henderson not to ever step foot in this place!
