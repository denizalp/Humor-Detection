I love this location. I actually was regularly going to the locale on Scottsdale Rd but not only is this location 5 min from my house, but it's just overall cleaner, the staff is super nice and very helpful. \n\nI work out at the crack of dawn and I've gotta give the a.m. staff credit they are perky just as much then as they are when I come back and work out in the afternoon. \n\nThe place is fairly clean at all times, and I've never really had to 'weight' on any machines. *See what I did there? lol Yea I'm a gym nerd. :) \n\nI would say it would be nice to see some more classes offered here but other than that I really can't complain. They have some newer equipment here that I can't get from the larger location(s). \n\nI'm moving in a week so I'm hoping my next 24 location is just as good if not better.
