Went here this Sunday morning around 9am.  I was stunned at how crowded this place was on a rainy, Sunday morning at 9am, but I guess this place has a loyal following in the area.  \n\nAs you can see from my pics, I ordered the breakfast burrito.  It came with red beans and rice, salsa, and sour cream.  Because I was feeling a little hungry, I also got a side of hashbrowns and side of bacon.  To be honest, I didn't find any of the items I ordered to be anything special.  I'd say the bacon was good - crispy but not burnt.  Otherwise, I'd say the hashbrowns and breakfast burrito were just OK at best.  My issue with the breakfast burrito is that it was somewhat small, lacked seasoning, and the salsa def wasn't made in house.  Go to Toast for a better breakfast burrito.  The hashbrowns as I said, were just ok as well.  Its not that they were bad, I've just had waaay better at many other establishments.  \n\nThe best part of my dining experience was the unbelievable and friendly service I received from the gentleman running the bar this morning.  He was quick and efficient, and got me in and out quickly given how crowded it was.\n\nAlthough the food was just ok, I saw many other entrees being served that looked very appetizing - perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing.  I'd def like to go back and try a few other menu offerings such as the create-your-own omelet, steak and eggs or chicken and waffle.
