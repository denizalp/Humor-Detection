Updated version from my prior review. The staff were very pleasant at this location. The work was not good unfortunately the gel mani lasted one day only. By day three I had not one nail intact. My cuticles were trimmed so closer that it was just painful for a week. I wouldn't go back to this site related to poor quality of the very simple work I had done and no have my cuticles nipped so close that they hurt with a nipper that did not come from a peel packed freaked me out.
