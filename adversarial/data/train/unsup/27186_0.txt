We have been to this restaurant a number of times in the past. I loved their samosas (when they had them) and their mutter paneer roti. However, we ordered once about two months ago and we had to throw it out it was so bad. We tried it again last month, thinking it was just a bad day. Again, it wasn't the same as it used to be. But giving them the benefit of the doubt, we tried once more last weekend. We placed our order at 7:00pm- again they had no samosas, but that was expected- at. 7:45 when our food was still not ready, we told them we wouldn't be returning. It's a shame, we used to love their roti but definitely not worth the wait and sick of them not having items in their menu.
