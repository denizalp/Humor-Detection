Talk nerdy to me, Warby Parker. \n\nBefore their retail store opened here in TO last year, I ordered spectacles from Warby Parker online. I'm a fan girl of any company that does good, has pretty products and keeps prices in check. Every pair I've gotten has been exactly $150, and as long as their business model doesn't change, every pair of glasses I buy forever will be $150. \n\nThe store itself is super cute and filled with nice, knowledgable staff. They have cookies for pups and maps of great places to read in TO. Cute, cute, cute!
