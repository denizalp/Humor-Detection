edit:  I'm temporarily upping this to 3 stars until we try Flemings again just because LeRoy Godfrey is such a classy gentleman who took the time to contact me personally about our experience.  We will be back soon!\n\nMother's Day Brunch was VERY disappointing.\n\nService:  My wife and I and 3 yr old were seated promptly.   After sometime, water was served (two glasses).   The server offered to bring a kid's cup with a lid for our daughter.  We waited and waited and finally they served complimentary biscuits but still no 3rd water for our little girl.   So I asked the person who brought out the biscuits if we could have another water brought out as well as additional napkins and he said, \"Yes, right away.\"   Once again, the waiting continued and that 2nd server never came back with napkins or water.  (One of our white tablecloth napkins had old black stains on them.  Don't reuse these if you can't get rid of a stain.  Please just throw them away)\n\nFinally, we asked a 3rd server for an extra water and some napkins which we finally got (except they did not have any kid's cup apparently so just another glass of water.)\n\n\nFood:  The complimentary biscuits came out BURNT on the bottom.  My wife also said they didn't have a good taste at all.  I used the pretty good apricot jam to mask the burnt taste and managed to eat a few of them.  \n\nOur appetizers were probably the highlights of our meal (downhill from there).  We had the modern caesar salad which was fine and the lobster bisque.  The bisque soup base was more watery than we're used to but the added lobster meat inside saved the dish for me.  \n\nSide dishes of whole carrots and potatoes were served.  The potatoes were fine.  The carrots were a mix of undercooked and overcooked.  Some were still crunchy when bit while others were soft as mush when you placed it in your mouth.  No consistency.  \n\nFor our brunch entrees, the wife ordered the baked Brioche French Toast and I had the Prime Rib.\n\nFrench Toast- NOTHING like the picture on their advertisements\/website\/gift card.  (Photo comparison below)\n \"layered in vanilla and orange custard, with a brown sugar, butter and walnut streusel, served with maple-blueberry syrup, Chantilly cream and grilled sausage\"\nWhat really came out was some french toast, a dab of whipped cream, TWO pieces of blue berries.  What is this?? It also tasted only as good as it looked.\n\nMy prime rib was cooked the way I liked it (medium rare) but no where near the best tasting.  I had to salt it well for flavor.  The three sauces that accompanied the meat were bland.  There was no strong kick to the horseradish, the au jus was okay, the pepper cream sauce was good.\n\nFinally dessert.  The turtle pie must have been frozen or old.  Either way, cutting it with a fork was nearly impossible.  It was hard like a rock.   The blueberry cheesecake was below-average for a dessert as well.  My wife and kid usually can finish all the sweets at the end of a meal, so you know there's a problem when we left with more than half of the dessert untouched.
