This isn't the biggest dog park so if you have a Husky or other breed that needs to really stretch their legs it might not be ideal, but it is pretty good. Things I like about it\n\n-lots of close parking \n-people are generally friendly and dogs are well behaved... although as always there are exceptions\n-its relatively clean. Although there is a hill at the top that then dips down again- that area is no mans land. Dogs disappear  from view when they go there and people use it as an excuse to not clean up after them creating a poop minefield reminiscent of the Korean DMZ \n-Lights- its not super lit up at night but definitely enough to be manageable if you can't get your dog out during daylight hours or want to spare them the heat. \n\n\nMy one complaint- people for the love of god don't run the fountian for 20 mns when no dogs are drinking. This makes a huge puddle around the fountain that the dogs then lie in before running around in the dirt making them extra filthy
