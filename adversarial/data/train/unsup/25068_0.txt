What a cool experience! I surprised my boyfriend with this for his birthday and it did not disappoint. The staff was incredibly friendly and our server made us feel very comfortable in a reality that was anything but within a seeing persons normal. Being in the room your other senses increase. As our server would bring the food or beer the first thing I noted was the smell. Usually secondary when food is brought to the table. We both chose to be surprised by our meals and in doing so found we really enjoyed foods neither of us normally would have picked off a restaurant menu. Great experience. Room for improvement would just be the waiting room it's big and has lots of seating but looks very dated. Overall great experience and I've recommended it to many friends and family.
