I can not review the food as we were never served.  I can't even tell you if the water was decent, because no one ever came to the table.  We sat there for 15 minutes, while wait staff walked around us, never looking at us.  Unfortunately, we hadn't eaten all day and decided to finally try Bachi spurred on by seeing it Triple D of the Food Network.  It was only 4:30 in the afternoon and the tables weren't even full.  We saw others sitting around in the various stages of not being served, some had empty glasses of water and some had drinks, but they all still had their menus and had the same look my table did...what the heck?\n\nThe menu looked good, but to us, service is so important.  There are just too many choices in Las Vegas to be ignored like we were.
