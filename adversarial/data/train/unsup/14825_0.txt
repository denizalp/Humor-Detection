Really disappointed with this company. Known the owner for quite a few years and was completely appalled by the lack of  \"Customer Service\" i received by them. First incident came when I requested an oil change. The \"owner\" first quoted me a ridiculous price then when I agreed to the terms, he changed the date and time of the appointment constantly. Not a big deal right? only a oil change right? well it didnt seem that way. Especially for something as simple as a oil change. Needless to say, i went with a different mechanic to get such a simple task done.\n\nThen more issues arise where i seek help from Vosier again. Again, I get the exact same \"customer service\" experience. After overpricing, excuses and just bad business..i again decided to take my vehicle elsewhere. \n\nLets just say I never dialed (nor will I ever) Vosier number again...nor do i plan to. \n\n\nLets get something very clear, im not mad..just disappointed. I had high hopes for Vosier when it first came out. I was a fan. But after constant excuses, overpricing and just straight out \"you arent driving a BMW\/Mercedes therefore Im not giving you the type of service you want\" attitude, i gave up. \n\nThe guys at Vosier need to focus on all the little guys in the business. Not everyone is driving a Porsche or BMW or Mercedes. We get you want to be the next \"high level\" automotive shop but you MUST treat every single person like they're driving a luxury vehicle then. Dont treat them like crap. \n\nIn a nutshell, if your friends with the owner..you'll get pretty good service. If you are acquaintances with the owner...you'll get moderate service. If you dont know the owner at all...watch out! Unless your driving an expensive vehicle then im sure dollar signs light up and you'll get the best of the best.  \n\nDo your research and ask around. Just because the logo looks nice..doesnt mean the service is top notch.\n\n\nUPDATED: 11\/07\/2012\n\nSorry to disappoint you Dave but i am NO WAY affiliated to Faye C above. Im just an old friend\/customer that got fed up with your BS therefore Im saying what I have to. Maybe if your brother Mike ran the shop, things would be different. Now that guy knows how to handle business! \n\nps - I have 0 intention of calling you so you can \"try to help you out in the near future\". I do wish you all the best though. Take into consideration those that have REAL reviews. Not the ones that you begged your friends to write for you.
