I recently celebrated my 25th birthday in Montreal and chose this place for the festivities. Why you may ask? First off, the decor and  vibe of this place is somewhere between divey and classy, which I love!  Secondly, Saturday night is\" MOD club\"! If you love 60s soul music and British pop this is the spot for you! The music was great, the beer is modestly priced and we had one of the many big booths to ourselves. It was a good night!
