I needed to dig a hole in my backyard. A small one, only eight feet square and about three inches deep. So there I was with a shovel and a hoe and a wheelbarrow, hacking away at the grass. After two hours, I'd managed to clear a two foot by two foot square section. My hands hurt, my back hurt, and I knew that I'd have a decent sunburn by nightfall. What the heck was I thinking?\n\nSo I headed out to the Internet to see if I might find a power tool that would do the hard work for me. And I landed on a rototiller and shortly afterwards on Sunbelt.\n\nI arrived early, they wrote up the invoice and sent me out front to have the shop guy load the thing into my car. When I returned a few hours later (good hole dug, less sore muscles), they gave me a credit back for the unused time, inspected the tiller and I was back on my way.\n\nA positive experience and if I ever need to use a power tool again, Sunbelt will be at the top of my list.\n\nTips:\n- You can book in advance, but I don't know if that's really required.\n- Be sure your vehicle can hold the doodad you're renting. My car has a large cargo area, but I had to pop the read glass to get the handle to fit. Since it has a gasoline tank, I didn't want to have it tipped sideways.
