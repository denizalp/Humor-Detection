We went here for dinner (It was Christmas night). Love that they have bike racks right outside the restaurant - we rode our bikes there on the greenbelt and it was super convenient. We were seated right away even though the hostess seemed unsure she could seat us since we didn't have reservations. \nThe service was friendly and efficient, but lacked basic things like silverware (we had to ask for it) and napkins (we also had to ask for them but they were never brought)\nThe food was good and I honestly was skeptical of the different cuisines served (sushi, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai) but my sushi was pretty good and my date's Kung Pao Chicken got a thumbs up. The pad thai and curry looked really good too and I couldn't decide between Thai and sushi -- sushi ended up winning.\n\nWill be back for happy hour. Hoping that the subpar service was because it was a busy night. Next time I'll be trying the Thai!
