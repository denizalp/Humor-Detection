Jewel's was our Go To GF place for breakfast. The service has always been mediocre, but the food made up for it. Not today. To start with, menus are kept at the register, so you stand there with people behind you quickly trying to make a decision while the unenthiusiastic cashier seems annoyed. I always get chicken and waffles, but my husband felt rushed.  We took our number to our table along with our coffee. They've done away with the raw sugar, so we used the white, but it did not improve upon the highly acidic coffee. We squeezed unto a wobbly table, trying not to spill coffee and juice and my food came about 10 minutes later. The food runner said my husband's pancakes would be right out. After 10 minutes I walked up to check on the missing pancakes. The runner looked annoyed and told me they'd be right out. Five minutes later he dropped off the pancakes. No explanation.  As I mentioned, the food usually makes up for the service. My waffles were gummy in the middle, as we're my husband's pancakes.  The chicken lacked the usual seasoning.  Sadly, I don't think we'll be back. At over $30 for breakfast for two, plus tip, it's no longer worth the drive.
