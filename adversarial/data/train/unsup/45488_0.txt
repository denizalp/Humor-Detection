Sushi burritos are definitely one of those things where you look at yourself and ask \"hey maybe I should try this?\" And the choice of getting is worth it. It's a good snack to split with someone you love. Service was speedy, creating your own burrito was creatively fun overall I shall give this place 8.5 rolls out of 10 rolls #RollCanada150
