KING CRAB LEGS AT FRYS 12\/17\/17\n\nThis review is for king crab legs purchased in the butcher seafood case. Looked fine. Didn't smell bad.\n\nAfter steaming, the crab meat smelled strongly of ammonia. Looked it up and it appears that this indicates deterioration of the crab, or a bad holding tank when caught or stored.\n\nNever had an experience with bad crab like this. Definitely not eating it. Over $100 purchased.\n\nWill be returning for full refund, with receipt and sticker label per the customer service rep.\n\nDisappointed.
