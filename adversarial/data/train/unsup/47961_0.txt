The food is always delicious. Love that you can come in shorts and a t-shirt or dressed to the nines. It is Vegas after all. The service here has always been great. We had three people last night. We were at the high to table in the bar. NOTE: the chair height is to high for the table. Way too high. Therefore if you are over 5'3 it feels like your meal is in your lap. Very uncomfortable to eat at these tables. I hope one day they fix this.  For three people 2 cocktails each, 1 app, 2 salads and 3 entrees. Just over $300. The food portions are small as they should be. This isn't a chain. If you are looking for \"quality\" this is the place. If you want \"quantity\" then go elsewhere.
