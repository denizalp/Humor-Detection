Yummy flavours, lots of veggies and just enough spice! \n\nWe ordered the Crispy Beef, Chicken & Eggplant, and the Thai Glass Noodles. With a $20 order, you receive free spring rolls and delivery is free. It took about 40 minutes to arrive. Total cost came to just under $40.\n\nLooking forward to dining in, as the restaurant looks really nice inside!
