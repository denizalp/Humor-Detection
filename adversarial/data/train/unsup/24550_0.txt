I think that Jose Andres must have been smoking weed when he thought of this restaurant concept.  He probably got the munchies and thought, damn I need to get me some greasy ass Chinese food or Mexican food.  It would be great if there was a place that served both. Bingo!\n\nThen he sobered up the following day and created the menu as well as the prices.  It takes the clarity of corporate gluttony to take well-loved comfort food that is cheap and then charge more than 4 times the norm for it.  And it takes an idiot like me who will walk in and pay for it.  So I'm gonna call you out right here, Jose.  You have had me shell out tons of my hard earned money at your other establishments for fantastic cuisine that clearly distinguished you from your peers as well as served as an homage to your roots training under Adria Ferran of El Bulli. But you won't fool me again in ordering your f***g pathetic excuse of $25 fried rice. I felt like I was eating at Disneyland or at the airport.  Yes, I know that high quality ingredients adds cost.  But the food should taste better than the fried rice dish my sister made for me when she learned to cook at 9 years old..not an exact replica.\n\nBut the tacos here are pretty good, despite the sticker shock.  Chilaquiles are also good, but probably not as good as you mom made them, unless your mom was Chinese.  But that is what everything more or less tastes like here.  Mexican food like it was done by a Chinese chef, and Chinese food like it was done by a Mexican chef. Somewhat creative, good quality ingredients, but lacking the comfort that we expect these foods to provide.\n\nBut I would definitely not classify this place as fusion cuisine. It is more like what you get when you come across a Lousiana Fried Chicken - Hong Kong Express joint.  \n\nJust whatever you do, don't get the fried rice.  Curiosity killed the cat on this one.
