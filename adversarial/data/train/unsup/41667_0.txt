I have been visiting this donut shop since I was a little girl. Don't let the neighborhood stop you from going in and trying something.They have the best donuts in town. Forget Krispy Kreme and Dunkin they became to commercialized, this is a small family owned homemade donut shop and you can't find donuts like theses anywhere.
