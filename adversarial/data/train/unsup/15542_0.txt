Gen Korean BBQ is a beautiful restaurant with great food.  So many delicious choices - Steak, Chicken, Pork Belly, Shrimp, Calamari and more.  My personal favorites were #4 Signature Pork Steak and #21 Cajun Shrimp.  Yuhao and Brian were incredible servers and food was Amazing! What an fabulous dinner deal $19.99 AYCE.  Brian, Assistant Manager Trainee, came over to check in on us at the end of our meal.  We will be back!
