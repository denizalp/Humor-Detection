Was in the plaza and needed a coffee and figured I'd try something other than Starbucks. Looked super clean and organized. Chloe was the barista that helped me and she was very nice. \n\nThey use powders instead of syrups, I didn't like that you could see it in the drink. I ordered a vanilla iced latte, tasty! \n\nI will be back
