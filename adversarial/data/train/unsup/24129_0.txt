Our group had a great experience with Maverick. We had some problems with the maximal weight of people who can board a helicopter and we had to change the group at last minute, but it was understandable. All for safety reasons. After that everything went smoothly from picking us up at the agreed spot, travelling to the airport, safety instruction to the actual tour.  \n\nBefore booking I researched the company and saw the comparative reports of all-time helicopter accidents. And there wasn't any serious crash noted for Maverick. I'm a bit of a safety freak so it was important for me to know we were going with the verified company. And I was not disappointed - I felt safe the whole time. The pilot was steady and did all the maneuvers very smoothly. He was not a born storyteller but he described all the attractions we were flying over and answered all our questions. On the way to the Grand Canyon I was sitting on the front sit and the view was perfect. Really breathtaking! I couldn't get enough photos. Later we switched seats but the view was still very good. However, I know that we had an advantage of having a plane to ourselves. I don't think there is any general system for switching places and if you are traveling with strangers they may not be so nice as to let other people take their (better) sits on the way back. \n\nDuring flight we've seen many beautiful things - Hidden Valley, the Valley of Fire, Lake Mead, Fortification Hill, Hoover Dam and of course Grand Canyon. The sunset was starting just as we were flying over Downtown Las Vegas and then the Strip. We also landed in the Canyon for a forty minutes and had a nice snack there. Just enough time to walk over, take a few photos. The whole adventure took 4,5 h (2,5 h of that was the actual tour). We thought it was money well spent.
