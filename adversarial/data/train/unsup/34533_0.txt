When my usual AYCE joints nearby had no available space, I came to SushiD, where there were several tables open.  The sushi was AWFUL, the rice was too sweet and chewy, and the rolls had very thick rice layers.  I couldn't finish them.  The teriyaki beef was very fatty.  Service was good.  Food was terrible.
