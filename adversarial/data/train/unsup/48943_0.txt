Used a coupon and got a large specialty pizza, large 1 topping.  We added a large salad to it.  It was $30.  That's a pretty good deal.  I picked up the order and it was on time.\n\nThe large specialty was a supreme.  The toppings all tasted fresh and were very good.  The dough had a yeasty taste to it.  It was tender and almost undercooked.  The large 1 topping was split as an extra cheese and black olive for the kids.  They both ate 2 pieces each.  In my book that is a win.  Chef salad reminded me more of an antipasta because of the slices of lunch meats on it.  It was also fresh tasting.  Not from a bag.  Their dressing was a Ken's dressing packet.\n\nOverall it was tasty pie.  Not the best I've ever had.  But served its purpose and was a great value.
