IMPORTANT CONTEXT\n\nI had 3 animals: 2 dogs and a cat. \n\nMy big boy doggie Clopi and my cat Rocky died. \nMy little dog, Princess Baily, is 12.\n\nTHE STORY\n\nNow that I've only got Princess Baily, who is experiencing many health issues, I thought I'd treat her to a trip to Petco, where she could buy whatever she wanted. I thought she would like a new basket and a waterfall fountain. She thought she'd rather be anywhere else than a local Petco. Whatever, I'm bigger than she is.\n\nSince it's her first visit (and probably last), I let her explore.\n\nFirst, the treats. She was not even slightly interested in any of them. Princess Baily is used to gourmet, which these were not.\n\nI showed her some clothes. None compared to the wardrobe she already has at home. \n\nI showed her some baskets and blankets. She liked the pink and gray fluffy one. So I bought it.\n\nNext, we just kind of wandered around.  \n\nWe saw a bunch of dog and cat supplies, and some small creatures; reptiles and such. Princess Baily was nonplussed.\n\nThere was a lady with a smaller dog. I thought it would be cute if the dogs met each other. \n\nThere was a good selection of waterfall fountains. \nI picked the coolest one and bought it.\n\nAlthough they have a decent selection of pet food, Princess Baily only eats Beef Evo, which I have to special order online for $200 per bag, since they've discontinued it. So, there's nothing for her to eat here.\n\nPrincess Baily was bored. I was bored. \n\nSERVICE EXPERIENCE\n\nThree different staff members asked if I needed anything. I didn't, but they were nice to ask.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt's a clean store with a decent selection of basic pet care items.\n\n4\/5 RECOMMEND\n\nOF NOTE\n\n* Plenty of Free Parking\n* Hours\nMon-Sat 9AM-9PM\nSun 10AM-7PM
