Yeah...good vibe from the employees. Never felt stared at or less than. Being a old white dude, sometimes you get that shopping in a culturally based store.\nThis is real, butcher shop, bakery, salsa, tortillas, seafood and prepared foods. All made in house. Nice.\nPicked up the grub for some tacos that worked out great. \nLast words...legit.
