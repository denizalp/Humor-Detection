Nice to have something different in this area, but not so sure I'd go out of my way to shop here on a regular basis. For me, it was a one time \"What the heck is all this weird stuff\" kind of adventure. Yup, it's fun to check out and take a gander at all the not so usual merchandise, but again, I would not be making regular stops here. They did have a strange selection of beers too!
