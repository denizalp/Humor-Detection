First things first! The food was decent... Nothing too spectacular. It's just like every other CPK I've been to. The only difference being is the hiked up prices because of the restaurant being located on the Strip. That was expected, however the service we received was not!\n\nI met up with a few friends who were visiting from out of town to get some dinner. My friends arrived before me and they were able to get a booth almost immediately. Great! I arrived a few minutes later and there were already waters at our table. They told me that our server wasn't the one who brought the waters to the table and were just told by the hostess that she would be with us in a few minutes. In fact, another server named Alberto was kind enough to keep refilling our waters throughout our meal. A for Alberto or A for awesome? \"A few minutes\" turned into almost 20 and our server finally came back to our table. She didn't even introduce herself or seem very friendly. To top it off, I felt rushed when she was taking our order. She was just overall not very personable. Our order came to the table in a decent amount of time, but we also had to ask for our complimentary bread that I'm assuming was supposed to be served upon arrival to the table. Hmmm... Maybe not? After our order arrived, we had only seen our server once throughout our meal. The last time we saw her was when she dropped the check off at the table! \n\nAnyways, our experience here was mediocre and I feel like it could've been so much better had our server been a bit more mindful of the vibe she was putting off. With that being said, I probably won't be returning to this location again.
