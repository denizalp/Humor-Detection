I've been to this location once, and that one time was enough to not have me as a returning customer. \n\nI went with a friend around 2-4 pm, I believe on a Saturday. It was incredibly dead. There must have been three tables, not including us. My friend ordered some chicken crepe or something and I ordered a slice of cheesecake. \n\nMy friends food arrived, and I waited, and waited. Still no cake. The waiter (who I learned is the owner) did not even acknowledge the fact that I was still missing my order and was by the front door. About twenty minutes after my friends food arrived, he came over and I told him I hadn't recieved my cake. A quick apology was given, and my cake was delivered. \n\nI'd overlook a wait that long for food had the place been busy, but there was really no reason for a customer to be waiting THAT long. \n\nWish I could have reviewed this better. If you're looking for slow service, then I'd definitely recommend this place to you.
