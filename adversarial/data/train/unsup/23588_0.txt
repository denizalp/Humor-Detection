This is one of the best Hero sandwich shops in the country! I believe it's a chain only in the Cleveland area! I blame this place for my weight! The Romanburger is an institution and the Hot Buttered Cheesesteak is heaven on a bun! We often have them make a deconstructed version that we can cook at home in Chicago or Atlanta!\n\nWe have also spent many a night attempting to recreate these masterpieces at home! We've come close but never perfect!
