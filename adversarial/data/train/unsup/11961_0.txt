In 2012 the family was driving from Zion N.P. Home to the Bay Area and was in Vegas around the lunch time.  We pulled out the trusty Yelp app and started looking for places to grab a bite and get back to the drive.  Tacos El Gordo pops up and we say, \"sure let's give it a try.\"   Tacos for $2?!  Adobada that changed my life and expectations of what a pork taco should taste like.  Initially we were a little shy when getting our food and did not want to over buy, only to go back up to the counter 2 more times for 2nds and 3rds.  \n\nThe best part the experience was my children, 10 and younger loved the lengua taco.  At first we just purchased the taco, asked them to try it, and only after they ate the whole thing did we discuss what it was.  My 10 year old goes back up to the counter by himself to order another 3 or 4 for the table.  \n\nSince that glorious dining experience, I must have told 100+ people to visit Tacos El Gordo in either Vegas or Chula Vista\/San Diego.  \n\nWhat did I learn today?  Dining here at 1am is a real experience.
