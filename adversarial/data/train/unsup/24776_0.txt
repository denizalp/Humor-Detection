Kate's Korner Ice Cream Parlor is located in the South Point Hotel and Casino.  The coolest thing is that they are open late - until midnight! So, that's definitely a plus!  (Apparently they may close even later on weekends!)\n\nWe've been enjoying our free ice cream there for the past three months during our little staycations, courtesy of South Point!  \n\nThey serve up  Dreyer's ice cream and at $2.50 a scoop, it can seem quite pricey.  But then you see how much they scoop into your cup and it definitely looks like a two scooper!  So you get your money's worth here!\n\nService has been fine each time we went.  They treated us all the same, even with a coupon.  Overall, Kate's Korner satisfied our ice cream cravings!
