I was super excited to finally try Salvatore's Tomato Pies as I've heard great things about the pizza there. I ordered the market salad, and herb and cheese bread as appetizers. The salad was good, but the herb and cheese bread was very disappointing. The bread didn't seem to complement the cheese and the garlic dipping sauce had a really bitter aftertaste to it. I did, however, LOVE the pizza I got, which was the Fat Uncle Tony. Can't wait to try more of their pizzas!
