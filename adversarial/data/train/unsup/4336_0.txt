Preparing for becoming a mom is overwhelming... \n\nThank goodness for advice from friends and the customer service at Buy Buy Baby or I'd be even more clueless than I already am when it comes to shopping \/ registering for the baby.\n\nI've still got a lot to do, but I'm taking it one step at a time.  I've bought a few basics and started my registry at Buy Buy Baby.  I've been in to this location several times and visited their website a ton, and I've been pretty impressed overall with the service, quality, and selection they offer.\n\nI hear that BBB accepts coupons from competitors as well as from their parent company, Bed Bath and Beyond.  If you have advice on where to find these coupons, please let me know!  I have a feeling I'm going to be a regular customer here for awhile and I'm up for all of the savings that I can find!
