Never go to a big box store for your aquarium needs again! I wasted so much time and money and was getting semi-accurate information at best.\n\nAquarium Arts has been around for a really long time, and they know what they're doing! They are super knowledgeable, and also very ethical. Like they won't sell you fish that just came in because they want to make sure they're healthy. That's amazing!\n\nTheir prices are reasonable. Their fish are healthy and well cared for. I will only shop here from now on!
