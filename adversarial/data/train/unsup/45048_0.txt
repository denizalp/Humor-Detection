i've never been so impressed with a diner. i absolutely loved this place. this was my mother and i's first time trying metro diner and we are so glad we did. we just moved from Seattle, Washington and don't have a metro diner up there. the chicken and waffles were amazing! these waffles had STRAWBERRY BUTTER. who da hell thinks of strawberry butter???? you can imagine how incredible it was. you def will catch my mom and i back here soon. the biscuits and gravy were bomb too and with some louisiana hot sauce.... oooo wee. amazing service, amazing food, amazing music 11\/10.
