Welp, Brenden theaters at the Palms put in \"Luxury\" seating but it was done very badly; you'll hear everyone around you just like the old theater seats and when you lay back you're own feet cover the screen..doesnt feel like you're in a lux theater at all. It's ridiculous. I had the pleasure of sitting next to a loud group of 4 people and my wife complained to the employees. They said someone would come and let tell them to chill. Didn't happen. Complained again after 40 mins of non-stop annoyance and still no usher or security. We asked for our money back and the manager said she'd refund us and if we wanted to stay, that we could move down a couple seats. We decided that was cool.  20 mins later someone comes to tell us we have to leave because we're not in our seats lol.  The obnoxious people were still there, not being asked to quite down or clean their huge mess. Finally spoke to a security guard who said he wished he was called but wasn't.   Just whatever. Horrible experience.  Wouldn't go back for free. Eeb after years of going there this was the worst experience by far.
