The selection of wings is awesome, and super tasty.  Need I say more?\n\nWell, they down-rate the heat rating of the wings.  I had some 4-flame wings which barely registered anything to me.  3-flame were downright candy.  And they say they have the best ribs north of Texas.  Are they kidding me?  Baton Rouge down on the 7 blows it away, and Baton Rouge isn't even the best either.\n\nHas sorta a \"hooters\" vibe with the servers if you know what I mean.  But cool having a TV at the booth.  Say good bye to social interaction.
