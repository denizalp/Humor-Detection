Wha.... You can review buildings on Yelp? \n\nUmmmm Yes you can!!!! And with that have a listen to how unique the Port Credit Lighthouse is, located in the lake shore neighbourhood of Port Credit in Mississauga. \n\nWhile it serves as the office for the Port Credit BIA, the lighthouse also doubles as a major focal point as you drive East-West along Lakeshore Road. No matter the time of day the light above rotates and acts as a beacon to passersby letting them know that they're close to great local businesses!\n\nWhile the lighthouse is merely a replica of the once functional Port Credit Lighthouse that was operational between 1882-1918, before being destroyed by a fire in 1936.\n\nPort Credit (which gets it's name for being at the mouth of the Credit River as it enters into Lake Ontario), was without it's Lighhouse for almost 60 years when the Lions Club of Mississauga, partnered with the City of Mississauga to erect the red and white replica which still stands to this day. \n\nLikely one of Mississaugas most historic landmarks and something to behold when driving by
