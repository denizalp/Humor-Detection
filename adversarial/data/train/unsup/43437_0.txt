let us not forget that montreal gets RIDICULOUSLY humid and warm in the summer. which makes perfect sense for havres-aux-glaces to spoon out its incredibly delicious gelato flavors. \n\ndense but smooth, the gelato packs so much flavor in each bite. we opted for their green tea and one of their top picks of alcoholic gelato (all beer related). a wonderful treat while walking through jean talon!
