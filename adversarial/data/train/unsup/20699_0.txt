Call me old-fashioned but I'm a girl who loves flowers and it's not necessarily about getting them (I say this because I know they ain't showing up on my doorstep any time soon), it's giving them that I truly love to do.  \n\nBut if there's one thing I don't like about the presentation of flowers is the sappiness that is inextricably tied to the event.  For me Yang's is a perfect solution.  It is a flower shop specializing in flowers that aren't sappy.  At least that's how I would characterize it.  Yang's forte isn't the delicate rose, whose pedals threaten to wilt each time you give the flower a sniff.  Rather, this unique flower store has a wonderful assortment of tropical flowers -- birds of paradise, ginger, spider mums etc -- that are large, tough looking, and fully saturated with colour and beauty.\n\nI like a flower I can huck in my car and pull it out when I get home unscathed - Yang's offers me that and what is more, it doesn't cost that much.  If you want a rose, sure you can get one there but you're losing out on a lot of fun and for me that's what flowers are for.
