A wonderful place for breakfast or lunch. The decor was nicely done with colorful umbrellas etc. Our waitress Maria was dressed in PJ'S which was cute, she was pleasant ,accommodating & explained everything on the menu. Our food ( Breakfast) was excellent and enough of it. We can't wait to go back!!
