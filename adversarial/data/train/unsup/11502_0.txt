I came in for dessert and was able to knock a bookmark off. Good thing because if I had waited much longer it wouldn't have happened given this place is closing soon. Yep, closing. Walking in I noticed there were a lot of customers inside and I didn't care for the ordering process. There isn't a specific line. You just walk up to any part of the very busy counter and hope someone will notice you. Very confusing and annoying. Things got better from there thankfully. There are many flavors to choose from and they have different special flavors. \n\nBambino - $2.50\n1 Scoop - $3.50  \n2 Scoops - $5\nMisto - $12 (5 scoop tasting plate)\n\nI went with 2 scoops from the specialty menu. Mighty GM Pie was the first scoop and it was peanut butter gelato with chocolate fudge, banana jam and Oreo cookies. Glazed and Confused, my second choice scoop was strawberry and cream gelato with glazed donuts. I went with these two scoops hoping it might taste similar to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and some might argue that all that was needed was a couple slices of Winder bread because it did in fact taste similar having those flavors together. I'm not sure what the upside cone was about and those with me mostly agreed it wasn't necessary because the gelato was packed in the cup and not the cone, so basically decoration I guess. I got rid of the cone and went for the gelato and it was tasty and refreshing. I felt the price was reasonable and the big round couches were comfy and roomy enough. The girl who took my order was very friendly and gave me samples of what I selected just to make sure I'd like it. That's a nice touch I really appreciated. They have coffee also and with Gelato Messina located in Downtown Summerlin, this makes for a great spot to grab some gelato to enjoy while you are walking around the area. Too bad that will not be here for much longer. If you have been wanting to try this place hurry on over before they close.
