Older building but pretty nice - front desk staff for the most part were very pleasant and went out of their way to assist with a shuttle and directions - food and beverage staff seemed a little stressed out but the food was good and fairly quick - early flight prevented me from trying the breakfast - rooms could use some furniture and decor updates but were clean and everything seemed to work ok... When in Pittsburgh again I'd stay here.
