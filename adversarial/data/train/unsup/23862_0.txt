Red Lobster is always really crowded because peeps love the cheddar biscuits.  Who are we kidding here?  We all know it's the damn cheddar biscuits that keep em' coming.  Even the wait staff knows it.  Our waiter had his shtick down to a science and his main sell was the what???  \n\nCheddar biscuits.  \n\nIn fact towards the end of our meal he greeted a couple that had just sat down behind us, and ran through his entire spiel word for word as he had done for us.  \n\nThe humiliating part was that the woman has the EXACT same reaction that I did when he said, \"and might I say, the cheddar biscuits are the best part of the meal!\"  \n\n\"Hahaha!  Yes!!\"  *nods and smiles like a complete jackass*
