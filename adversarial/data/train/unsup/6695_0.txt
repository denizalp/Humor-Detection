YELP REVIEW CHALLENGE --- 80\/100\n\nI literally walked blocks just to get to this place and boy was it worth it! \nI was in chocolate heaven. This place is definitely not just all hype. Their chocolates were so good I didn't want to share with my kids. Laugh now, but wait til you try it. I can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can splurge. This is definitely a must visit. Yes, it might be a little pricey for some people but you'll understand.
