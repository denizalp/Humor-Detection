The nachos at margaritaville are one of the most enjoyable things about vegas.  As a late night snack they are one of the best things you can get.  And the margarita choices and other drink concoctions are outstanding.  Always love coming here, and the live rock music is a nice touch.  Overall reasonably priced food and drinks, and real chill setting to just have a good laid back time.
