THIEVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Owner could care less too.\n\nMy mother in law sent my kids and husband a bunch of items through this store.  She had THEM pack it up and send it to us.  \n\nWhen the box arrived to me at my work (still sealed) my son's card was missing out of the box.  I called my mother-in-law to make sure she had actually shipped it with the rest of the items and hadn't decided to mail it.  She said she gave it to the man that works there to pack with the rest of the items.  She said she was going to go there right now and talk to them.\n\nShe talked to a man at the front counter and told him what was missing out of the box and that there was some cash in it (over $100).  He said no problem and even acted like it had happened before.  He had her fill out a claim form and told her when the owner came it, he was sure he would reimburse her.  Well, the owner never called her back, but they had given her the owner's cell phone number so she called him.  Eventually, she got to speak with the owner and he could have cared less.  Didn't offer to replace anything.  She even had paid extra for the insurance.\n\nI would def think twice before choosing to ship through these people.
