This one is a solid 3. Don't get me wrong, we enjoyed our protein pancakes and scramble just as much as the next Joe...but we haven't been back to US Egg since we went a few months ago, and you're talking to two of the biggest breakfast fans out there. If your looking for a safe, tried and true breakfast place that won't let you down, but won't blow your socks off either, then give Us Egg a shot. They've definitely got some good choices of food on the menu, but somehow this place just didn't hold our attention like some other breakfast spots have. I mean, even there name is so generic and blah..US Egg... how original is that? I think this is definitely a few steps above Denny's, but being a step or two above Denny's is not a very hard thing to accomplish. They should maybe start striving to be a few steps above Denny's and then maybe it will be worth making a second trip back.
