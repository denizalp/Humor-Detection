This place had some serious 5-star food and 1-star service.\n\nI needed some breakfast in a bad way, as one often does in Vegas and reluctantly agreed to wait a half hour for a seat because I am an advertiser's dream and Adam Richman likes the place so I am all over it. \n\nI lived in Vegas for nearly a whole year (which is something like 6 years in Vegas time) and usually know better that to eat in a popular restaurant on the strip when avoidable but we were close and hungry.\n\nWe get seated and it takes about 10  minutes to get some coffee and another 10 after that to get water that was ordered at the same time. \n\nWe order up some chicken and waffles with a side of biscuits and gravy. Hope fills my heart renewing my faith in a Man v Food destination (my lady wouldn't let me eat the 6 lb burrito at The Sahara but for the record I would've killed it).\n\n30 MINUTE LATER...I see our food come out of the kitchen...and...head straight to a different table...We try to flag down the guy bringing it out as the table tells him yes they ordered chicken and waffles but not biscuits and gravy but before we can get his attention he drops the chicken and goes back to the kitchen with the biscuits. \n\nAdd 20 minutes to that and they manage to sort out what has happened (try getting a server's attention in that time) and we get an apology and finally a coffee refill. Keep in mind tht the table who got our food had another order for the lady and she had to watch her man eat for the 20 minutes before her food came out.\n\nI will give them this...the food was orgasmic. ORGASMIC. the chicken was amazing and the waffles had friggin' bacon cooked right into it. Right into it! The biscuits and gravy were omgnom or whatever the kids are saying these days.\n\nI would go here again but probably stick to my instinct and make my way to the one off the strip.
