Do you have anything less than one star? I remember better food in my high school cafeteria. The prime rib was like shoe leather. The Mac n cheese was tasteless. The sirloin was inedible. Mashed potatoes cold. The only thing that I didn't leave half a plate of was the salad and most of the toppings for that were wilted. Ranch dressing covers a lot of sins. Terrible!
