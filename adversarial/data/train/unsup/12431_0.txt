Let me preface this review by saying I am far from disgruntled, I didn't have a miserable experience, but the 4.5+ stars this place gets is SUPER misleading. It couldn't hit 3 stars if its existence depended on it. \n\nIt's a clean place. Very sports bar-ish. Nothing out of the ordinary. TV's at every table and a million more on the walls. Expected. \n\nService was quick and the waitress was a doll! Service was absolutely flawless. \n\nIt was the food. It was so awful as to be a afterthought here. It's like, hey, if we put enough TV's in here we won't have to serve anything edible; just beer and football! No. \n\nOrdered the queso without the meat and some chips. The cheese was so coagulated that it was almost chewy lumpy. My mouth completely rebelled. It was also freaking spicy, which they don't mention. Thankfully I ate first because my date hates spicy. I caught it in time so he didn't have to suffer the fate of eating this non-food THING. The chips were...uh, stale? I mean, tasted like cardboard, I mean, didn't have any taste, were not crunchy, but not stale. They were alien. \n\nEntrees coming up. I got the fish and chips. Uhm. Hmmmm. Fries were tasteless (recurring theme here), fish was sqaure. Deeply deep fried. Super crispy. The fish oddly didn't fit into it's hard outer shell. I have no idea how they did that. I was fascinated. The serving was also super stingy. Just don't do this. Or, eat at your own risk. \n\nMy date had the Philly cheesesteak, which I'm going to go ahead and say was terrible. I don't eat meat, but I can't imagine his resembled food any more than anything else. I dare you to try it for yourself, though.\n\nThis place is shockingly bad. It doesn't have an authentic feel, it's not that great. I have no idea where all those stars came from. Maybe they bought them from the star store. Maybe they should work on earning them. Bad. Avoid.
