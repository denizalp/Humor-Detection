The hardest thing about moving besides moving is find new favorites to eat.\n\nThis has become new new go-to Pho, I usually call in on the way home from work and pick it up just because I like to eat at home after a long day and somedays you don't wan to cook or go out.  I call in and give them my numbers they make sure I know where it is and give me a time.  They are always right on time the soup is hot and ready everything is in the boxes and I head on home.  When we get to-go  we don't eat right away so I put the broth on low and let it warm buy the time I am ready to eat we ladle it out and add ingredients and it is as good as eating in!\n\nEating in the restaurant is always clean the owners are almost always there working and you are greated nicely and led to a table.  They know us so it is pretty easy for us.  They have a tv to watch while you wait.  \n\nThe soup is one of the better Pho places in town.  A lot of people complain about the oil in the soup but in all actuality the oil is part of the soup and means it has been made properly, if it is not there you will be lacking the essential flavor of the soup.  It is also a clear light brown broth.\n\nThis is not a fancy place and the price reflects that but the soup is good, hot and fast V\/S other places down the road with a 20 minute wait and a bit over priced.  If you want good home cooked Pho come here if you are meeting friends for drinks fun and Pho you may not like it here.  \n\nI will be back at least twice a month sometimes once a week!
