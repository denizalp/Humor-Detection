This restaurant was dead empty on a wednesday night. And while the decor screamed 'mistake!' I trusted my fellow yelpers and stepped in for dinner with my significant otter.\nSo glad that I did.\nFirst off, take the servers reccomendations. They have good taste, are beautiful solicitous, and are graceful, unobtrusive and a higher grade of tablecloth than the decor suggests.\nAs a result.of our servers reccomendation we had the house special naan for an appretizers.\n5\/5 will order again. Every time. Best $4 appetizer Ive had. The toppings were fresh, the balance of dairy and bread perfect.\nDinner was also wonderful. We tested the chicken tikka masala as well as another chicken dish which I will not embarass myself by trying to spell.\nIn short. Wonderful.\nThe chicken tikka was not heavy. The spice and tomato came through beautifully. The other dish was a perfect pairing with its dark, cardamom and cinammon gravy.\nJust do it.\nIgnore the mash of mall vs genuine decor.\nEat the food.
