At a destination for tourists, there's sure to be a ton of hype to go around. Bacchanal's success is warranted much more by hype than actual quality... it definitely has its pros and cons. Be READY to wait. You could have a partial group go first to put down a party size and be placeholders in line. \n\nLet me start by saying everything about the restaurant is beautiful! Interior decor is modern, and dishes are plated creatively. The taste is where I'm disappointed here. Almost everything tastes like a dish of salt w a hint of food. Have a lil pep talk w yourself and try your best not to let your eyes be bigger than your stomach here, so you can try everything! There were very few dishes that I would go back for. \n\nThe dessert island is truly the most impressive I've ever seen at any buffet. Be sure to save room! Still, very few that I would enjoy more than a single bite of. \n\nThen again, this is all just my opinion. If you've never been here, I'd say give it a try. Personally would rather spend the money elsewhere.
