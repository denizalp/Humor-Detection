I went in to renew my license plate. I checked in and waited a few minutes. I was called back and met with a middle aged, caucasian female.  She was rude from the get go. She quickly looked at my papers and stated \"We can't help you. You need to smog your car.\" I tried to ask her a question but she cut me off and told me she can't do anything until I smog my car. Every time I tried to ask her a question, she shut me down. If I wanted to be treated that rudely, I would have gone to the DMV across the street. I've never been treated this way with AAA. Her whole demeanor and attitude were poor. Every time I've gone into an AAA office, I've always received friendly and courteous service. But not this time.
