Wow this place definitely exceeded my expectations. We came on rec from two locals (who just happened to be Indian). I expected to be served \"Americanized\" (aka less pungent spices and less hot-ness) but boy was I wrong.\nWe started with the samosa chaat (4 huge pieces with just the right amount of chutney. Their chickpeas were to die for). This dish was best with their house hot sauce. \nWe also got the tandoori chicken platter (I could have done without the rice since you get a wheat naan with it). Their wheat naan is topped with cilantro. It's definitely on the crisper side than I would like but I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be like a crostini for the tikka masala side. I like that the tikka is less creamy and more tomato based. This dish is the best with their lava hot sauce. \nWe also got the lamb meatball wrap. The meatballs were super juicy and flavorful (though my bf who is Indian thought the above two were more authentic). I liked how this naan was pillowy soft. This tasted the best with raita as well as the lava sauce. \nWe add a lot of red onion (soaked in lemon)  and jalape√±o on both dishes. \nWe ended with the chai (it is pre sweetened). I prefer mine with more cardamom but still good. \nThe service is great- there is even wet wipes around the restaurant. \nI can't wait to try the rest of the menu.
