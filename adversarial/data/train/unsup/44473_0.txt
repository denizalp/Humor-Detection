Today I was a first timer. The food was great, the fries were good. I ordered the pork burger with an egg. Only thing I'd say is the ginger was just a tiny bit overpowering. I also got shock top as my beer of choice which was cold so I asked for a cup and ice. Other than that it was good and I would come back again
