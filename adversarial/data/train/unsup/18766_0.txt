Since the recession hit, you don't find too many pagan-type shops any more.  When you do, they tend to be a lot like this.  This is a one-stop shop for all of your New Age, Pagan, Wiccan, and Asatru needs.  I mention the Asatru because there is a large Norse section to this store (including about 5287 different sets of runes--I'm exaggerating).\n\nIf you need books, incense, oils, candles, non gem-quality sapphires, small Egyptian statues, etc. etc. etc., this place will likely have it for sale, and they'll throw a smile in for free.
