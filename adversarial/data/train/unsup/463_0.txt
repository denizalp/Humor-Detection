Don't base your DD experience on this location. I'm from Dunkin country and grew up on the fat pills. For some reason the quality of this particular store is always subpar. They don't offer many choices and what they do have isn't always fresh. But they are trying.  There a couple of others in town that are a bit better.  I keep my fingers crossed that they make it to California one day.  But then again, it's not the healthiest of choices.  But it does work when you have a sweet morning craving.
