Staff - Kris & Maya are very welcoming & have great customer service. I took my brother who needed his eyebrows cleaned ASAP. He had been hesitating about getting them done because last place he had gone months ago left them very feminine looking. Maya here at Diyas did perfect. She listened to what my brother was looking for! Keep the thickness just clean out the eyebrows. He liked how they were left! Thank you Maya.
