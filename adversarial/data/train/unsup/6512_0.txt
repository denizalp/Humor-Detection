Finally! It took forever for it to be finished up and open for business! I've been waiting for it to open because I love their California locations! \n\nIf you've never had all you can eat Korean BBQ before, you'll definitely want to have Gen be the first place you try. If you go for lunch, it's $16 with a large selection of choices, and if you go for dinner, it's $25 with some added dinner items that are delicious. Bugolgi, Hawaiian Pork Belly, and Beef belly are my favorites. The first two are already marinated so you don't need to dip them into any of their sauces. But for the last one you can dip it into any of the three provided options - which are all good. And if you don't know what to order, they have little markers on the menu pointing out which ones are the top choices - but you can't go wrong. \n\nDownsides of Gen: (honestly there's really none)\n-You can only order 4 items at a time, but it's fine because you can't cook everything at once. \n-They can only split the bill at a max of 3 different ways \n-2 hours is the max you can stay (but you'll be plenty full by then)\n\nConclusion:\nEAT HERE. The first REAL AYCE Korean bbq in Arizona. Nothing compares to it. And do yourself a favor, come with an appetite. I promise you'll get your money's worth.
