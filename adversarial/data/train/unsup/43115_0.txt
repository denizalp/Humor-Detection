Just bought a house and needed the carpet cleaned before moving in. We paid for tile cleaning and carpets in the entire house about 1700 square feet. Paid about 600 dollars for the service. They did a good job with the carpet. Tile turned out ok, but in the downstairs bathroom they totally broke off the door stopper. Pieces of wood from the bathroom door came off along with the door stopper. Then they pulled out the faucet sprayer and broke that. I wouldn't call them ever again after this experience.
