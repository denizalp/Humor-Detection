Pop Lash & Nails is the perfect place get pampered. Do what I did and get the gel mani-pedi deal on Groupon and head over with some friends. \nThey have a ton of colors including OPI to choose from. The chairs for pedicures are massage chairs and there is a large screen TV on the wall in front. \nThe shop is very clean and the staff are all very friendly. \nI've had better gels done in the past, but they aren't bad. They didn't push my cuticles very far back and didn't get very close to the cuticle line when they started painting. Thus my nails needed a fill by the end of the first week.... which I'm glad I didn't do because they started falling off at week 2 :( \nFor the groupon price it was worth it. Would I pay full price to get them done again? ... no
