My first time seeing a show here and also my last, \nEverytime I was in the ladies room a male staff member would come in and start screaming at all the women to \"hurry the F*@k up\" no reason to treat people that way ever!! Seriously awful vibes!! \nWay to packed, tickets were obviously oversold. \nGot manhandled several times by security literally shoving me out of their way (I'm five foot two and these men were way taller than me) \nOnly one exit that we were shoved through like cattle after the show was over, \nDefinitely look for a better venue if you want to see a show and actually enjoy yourself!  \nThe only highlights of the night were the amazing headliners, and that bottle water was 3$ (Kirkland water which is 25 cents each at costco)
