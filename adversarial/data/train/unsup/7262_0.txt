Stepping inside Shomal North on a Sunny afternoon feels like bring me to another world... World which is dark..cool... and full of men (waiters)\n\nI have to agreed with John F., the interior decorate does remind me of an Italian Village I been too.. now think about it.. I know exactly where it is!! The interior of Frankie Tomatoes!! The little storefronts, the fake painting of the cliffside on the far wall, the little X'mas lights decorating the trees....\n\nI don't have a lot of experience with Persian food, ok make that once!... I can only compare to Pomegranate Restaurant (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/pomegranate-restaurant-toronto-2) which I just love!! \n\nRaw onion, parsley and radish were brought to the table even before ordering. We were told that we suppose to eat them with our food. But what food are we going to eat?? BTW, their wine list are 3 pages long... more than their food choices!!\n\nI found the stews are really not as delicious and taste not as good Pomegranate. The chicken here was so over stewed that it does not taste like chicken anymore. The lamb is ok... I have better... But I like how they match the different rice with the chicken and lamb.\n\nI found the services here is cold, and the waitstaffs are quite disinterested. Maybe it is how an authentic experience suppose to be :P.\n\nI am not in a rush to come back here for another meal.......\n\n2.5 stars
