Let me just say, this location does not deserve any hint of a star, but I had to choose at least one. I was less than impressed by the management at this location. My boyfriend had brought me in to use a guest pass of his. A manager that had passed me in (Don Jones) was very insensitive. I believe he was trying to be funny, but was far from it. The conversation started when he was trying to convince me to join the team by getting a membership. I had told him I live in Tucson for school and he had a smart remark about it being the \"special needs school.\" I was honestly startled because I had just started my job today at a camp for special needs children. I then realized he was trying to mock the fact that I attend the University of Arizona. Typically, I brush off the ASU\/UofA rivalry jokes because it is meant to be fun and games; however, Don left me appalled. My boyfriend saw the look on my face as I was trying to process the repulsive statement Don had made. After, my boyfriend tried to lighten the mood by saying \"Oh, well she is actually studying special education! What a coincidence that you would say that!\" Don proceeds to say \"well it must be easy for them to teach that at the special needs school.\" Whether it was meant to be funny, it was highly insensitive. I have been around the specific population of children with different abilities since I was a baby. My older brother, in fact, has a physical need. In addition to the camp, and my major in general, I also have an internship position at the Disability Resource Center (DRC) on UofA's campus. Specifically, I make sure all classrooms, restrooms, and campus events are as inclusive as can be with the resources provided to assist a specific population of people.\n\nLifetime will not be gaining any commission from me due to their insensitive employees.
