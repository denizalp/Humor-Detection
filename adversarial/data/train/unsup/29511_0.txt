So, I went to Yelp to find out where I could purchase bulk herbs, and this shop comes up.  Now that my house is riddled with cold, cough and aches cooties... I decided that I need to make a 'MEAN TEA' to bust immune system in my home. So I trek it to the store and my first impression was 'HMMM it smells good in here'.  The smell of the spices is so yummy!  \n\nThe shop is small BUT they are very organized.  I went to get elderberries and to my dismay... they did not have any.  HOWEVER.... They helped me pick organic herbs from what I needed.  They are very knowledgeable in the herbs that they have and they have a quick reference humongous book on other stuff.  \n\nI'm still SAD that they didn't have the elderberries HOWEVER... they called another shop for me to make sure that they had it, and wrote the address for me.  I got what I needed and they have a fan out of me.  I didn't give them the last star because... they didn't have that herb.  I did wind up purchasing 'other stuff'that was uber fresh!  They have made a fan out of me.
