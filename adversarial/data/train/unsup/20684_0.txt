I can never resist!!\n\nThis store carries so many fun and exciting things to see and try!\n\nWhenever walking the strip this is one of those must walk through places. I am always checking out the new Perfume they have. It is nice they have the sample bottles to just about everything they have which is really nice. I am always finding something new I want.\n\nThis must be one of their busiest locations but I have to say the customer service is great. If you need help looking for anything just ask someone close by who works there and they are always happy to help you out.\nEven though they are busy the checkout is pretty fast without waiting too long.\n\nOne of my favorite places to visit!\nIf your close by stop by and check out all the goodies!!
