What the pho.\n\nAfter a Saturday night that went on for far too long, my friend desperately needed some pho to flush out his veins. We didn't want to drive, so we decided to go to the only pho restaurant on the strip. I warned my friend that this place was rated 2.5 stars on Yelp, but he insisted that we try this place. I had low expectations after reading some of the reviews below, yet... I was still not prepared.\n\nThe egg rolls were soggy and tasteless. The fish sauce was bland. I ordered a Thai iced tea, and it tasted like it had been half diluted with toilet water. The pho was actually the worst part. We both ordered Pho Tai, which has thin slices of rare beef. Not only was the broth tasteless, the slices of rare beef were all still stuck together in one chunk--as if they bought a chunk of pre-sliced frozen beef, and were too lazy to separate them in the soup. Worse, the broth was lukewarm when it arrived at my table. I immediately submerged the raw beef underneath the noodles in a desperate attempt at a decent meal, yet the middle slices remained rare and stuck together. The cost of our meal (one order of egg rolls, two drinks, two pho bowls): $50.\n\nI don't recall ever being quite so infuriated by a meal before in my entire life. To the people below who could dare give this place anything more than 1 star, OMGWTFBBQ. Shame on you. This may be Vegas, but there are no winners in this place.
