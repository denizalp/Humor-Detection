Extremely poor service. My boyfriend and I went in the restaurant wearing T-shirts and black pants.  We were greeted by the hostess and informed immediately that there was a dress code.  However, we could go to the bar area where they have a full menu plus a special menu for those not allowed in the main area. The hostess said no hats allowed. My boyfriend took off his cap. Unfortunately it seems like we are still not looking good enough to get an average service.\n \nI don't know how they make the judgement call because they don't post the dress code at the door. Also we just saw a few people standing just outside of the restaurant in shorts having a smoke break but seemingly they look \"high end\" enough; while we were wearing long black pants (at least we weren't wearing shorts and flip-flops).\n\nWe were told to sit down in what appeared to be the back of the bar where the furniture was stacked up and wait for the waitress.  The hostess did not take us to the table nor give us menus to look at.  We waited for almost 10 minutes before we decided to leave.  On our way out the waitress finally had our menus for us, but by this time frustration and hunger took over and we decided on trying another restaurant.  We felt very uncomfortable and unwanted there.  We told her we actually decided to leave but she did not ask us if there's anything wrong with the place or the service.\n\nI might be wrong but I think that if we were to pay for at least $60-70 for dinner, we expect service to be at least semi-descent. Who would want to pay that price to be treated as a second class\/abandoned customers?\n\nFinally we are glad that we end up switching to a burger place for dinner. We get respect, dignity and better service at a burger joint. I will never attempt to dress up to come back to this place.
