Went in today at to get our marriage license about an hour before they closed. It's a small courthouse so was very easy to find and get in. The security guys were very nice and funny when we first came in and even said congratulations when we walked out. \n\nThe marriage license\/passport area is a little room straight in the back to the left. You sign in, fill out a short form, and wait till they call your name. The room was pretty full when we got there but the line still went really quick. Once we were called the process was simple and painless and we got our pretty shiny marriage license. We were out within 20-30min.
