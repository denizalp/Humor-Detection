I felt badly, because we were the last patrons of the evening (I believe the kitchen closes at 10:30p), but the staff at RM Seafood went above and beyond to make sure we had an excellent dining experience regardless.\n\nAside from a bit of a lag in taking our order (to be fair, we said that we needed a few extra minutes- just not quite THAT many extra minutes), service was spot on. The complimentary cornbread was sweet and moist, and our cocktails crafted with care.\n\nMy entree, the scallop dish, was amazing! You could definitely taste the freshness and the scallops were perfectly cooked. The accompanying sauce and vegetables matched perfectly.\n\nMy dining companion had two types of sushi, and also reported that they were very good. As it was the end of the night, perhaps there were some items left over, because they sent out a complimentary order of mashed potatoes, which were also pretty amazing! \n\nAnother table could not finish their bottle of wine, so we were gifted the remainder of it, as well as a complimentary dessert. While the key lime pie was good, I didn't love the meringue or crust that much.\n\nI would definitely return to RM Seafood for a fine dining seafood experience, and perhaps coming in at the end of the night is the way to go!
