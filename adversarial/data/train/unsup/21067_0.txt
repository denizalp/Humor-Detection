4 stars for draft selection 0 stars for attention to detail and service. They gave us breaded buffalo instead of grilled BBQ wings that we ordered. The guy next to me sent his wing order back twice cuz the first time they gave him the wrong sauce and the second time they forgot to put any sauce on them. Also the crowd is a dumb mix of tourists and try-hard locals. Great view of a pond?
