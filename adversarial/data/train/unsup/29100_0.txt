I have been here several times since my last review, and while I still like the concept and the food, the service has gone downhill.\n\nThe plusses include a drop in prices, meaning that you can definitely have your fill of sushi (a variety in fact) for under $10. Each plate is now between $1 - $2, with most plates falling in around $1.50 (red, green, and white). The last two dinners I've had here were by myself and also with a friend. The total before tip was around $6.50 and $15, respectively.\n\nIf what you want is not on the conveyor belt, you can still order from a sushi list for the same price. Definitely try the Amaebi (sweet shrimp) where they take two prawns and chop them in half. The bottom half is eaten raw and the top half with the head is deep fried in batter. Yum!  The soft-shell crab roll can be anywhere between good and awesome depending on which sushi chef puts it together. One day when we ordered this, the presentation was great (legs dangling out of one slice like spiders) and big, another day the rolls were small as if just another mini shrimp tempura roll (and no legs! the best part! ugh!).\n\nUnfortunately, because of the drop in prices (and probably also due to this crappy economy) weekday lunch hours are SLAMMED. The last time I was here for lunch, there were only 2 waitresses attending to the whole restaurant. In the 50 minutes we were there, it took about 10 minutes to receive our waters and wasabi after sitting down and 30 minutes to pay for our food after eating. Nevermind that my water wasn't refilled at all.\n\nI will still come here to eat because of the value and because it's actually decent sushi. However, having lunch here now is definitely out of the question unless I take a lunch around 2-3pm...or have some killer time to burn.
