we decided to try doc's place for dinner with a 25.00 certificate from restaurant.com. doc's is located on the northeast corner on central and camelback. we both ordered the bo diddley blackened salmon served with rice pilaf. i appreciated that my entree was not overly salty. i was pleasantly surprised the menu was much better than expected. \n\nthe food was decent and well presented. we arrived too early to enjoy the jazz band so until then i will hold off on giving four stars. i want to get the full experience when i return.
