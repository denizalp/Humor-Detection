I LOVE Frankies Pizza! It is such a cute pizzeria and has a very close family feel. When you go in, they immediately greet you and the menu is clean and simple but has a great selection! I love their pizza because the bottom never gets soggy. Sometimes when I go to a pizza place, the grease and cheese makes the pizza slimy on the bottom and everything slides off when I eat it. Here the pizza stays just as fresh when you eat it as it did when it came out of the oven! They also have the best Italian sandwich! I don't know what it is, but it is delish!\n\nThey make sure you are always taken care of and enjoy your meal. They are an authentic pizzeria and you can taste the love for cooking in everything you eat!\n\nOH! AND THEIR CANOLIS! How could I forget!? They make them from scratch and MMM MMM MMM! I eat here about 1-2 times a month. What can I say, it's really good!
