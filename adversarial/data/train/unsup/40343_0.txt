First time going here today with my 2 year old daughter and a 12 year old girl who I babysit... I've always heard this place was so good but just have never been... Finally today while I was babysitting I brought it up how we should go try it out and she had mentioned that all of her friends love it so we went. You can choose up to 3 flavors for a cup so we each picked out our flavors and the guy started making it . The guy working was so friendly and personable! While waiting at the window I looked over to see him wiping the sides of each cup to make sure he handed them to us looking perfect and boy were they perfect! I have to say I've never had a more tasting icy in my life! I know who would of thought an icy could have such an impact lol! The ice was so smooth and soft it wasn't like any other icy I've ever had! Very delicious and satisfying and will be coming back again this weekend with my husband. If you haven't tried it out yet you're missing out!
