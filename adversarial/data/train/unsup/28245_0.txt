I've been coming here since they opened and have not had any problems!  Jackie has been doing my hair for 15 years now and I've always been happy!  The salon is made up of a few hairstylists that were friends and they hold their own schedules so it's best to make an appointment but there is always at least one person there for walk ins.  One of the things I really like is they don't try to sell you products like the chain salons.  They also have without a doubt the best prices around!
