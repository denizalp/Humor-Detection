We didn't realize this was aimed at take-out orders when we first went and waited quite a long time... TOTALLY worth it! The food is ridiculously good! We ordered jerk chicken on sweet potato and jambalaya on regular potato for dinner and strawberry sweet potato and marshmallow sweet potato for desserts, as well as some wings. Not a mediocre food in the lot. And the staff are so friendly! This is the perfect example of the mom and pop local shops we love to explore and support. They even went through the extra trouble of accommodating several food allergies, finding us dishes we could have or ways we could alter existing dishes to be safe. We will definitely be back next weekend to try more dishes, although we will put our order in ahead of time!
