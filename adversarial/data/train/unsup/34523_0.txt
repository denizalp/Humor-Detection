Sugar Factory has a few locations now, but the best is this one in the Miracle Mile inside Planet Hollywood. This location has the best selection of their signature lollipops. \n\nThe staff here are super helpful, they put together nice little boxes of all the different lollipop flavors I was purchasing for gifts, in addition to preparing the correct flavors with the individual reusable blinged out lollipop sticks I was also purchasing.\n\nThis is a great place to pick up novelty items to bring back as souvenirs\/gifts for people. But it isn't cheap. Think of it as a higher end candy boutique.\n\nPretty good variety of candy - they also sell gelato, chocolate goods, and a few baked goods. Great place to stop by if you need gifts or have a giant sweet tooth like me!
