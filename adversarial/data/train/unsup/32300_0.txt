I have passed by this fast food counters many times but usually after the lunch rush. When I saw that they had fresh mango slices as a choice side salad, I made a bee line to make my order. This fast food counter boasts a large selection of meat, vegetable, and sea food dishes.  You can pick one meat item with noodles or rice with one or two veggie\/salad selections.  I opted for the one meat with noodle and a veggie and a salad combo...the damage was $8.13 tax included.\n\nWhat makes this fast food place so unique is the vast selection. You have the choice of fried rice, pad thai noodles, california thai noodles (egg noodles), and glass noodles.  I opted for the California thai noodles stir fried with green onions and bean sprouts.  From the meats, you have a large variety of chicken and beef...from curry chicken to bourbon chicken, to sweet and sour chicken\/beef. I opted for the green curry chicken with veggies.  For the vegetable options, you can pick from a brocoli medley, a zucchini\/mushroom\/celery\/carrot mix, green beans. There is also tofu, and fried tofu puffs with eggplant.  For seafood, you have spicy shrimp or white fish in batter.  I opted for the zucchini\/mushroom medley.  As for the salads, you can choose romaine lettuce or mango strips. I opted for the mango - is there any other choice?!\n\nThe noodles, veggies, and chicken curry were good...not mindblowing but decent, but the best part of the meal was the side mango slices which would most likely cost $3 if you were to get them from the marketplace buffet where they charge by the weight.  It was a refreshing side option which you do not find anywhere else in the downtown food courts. Just for that alone, it is worth ordering from this joint.
