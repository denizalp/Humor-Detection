My girlfriend and I stopped in here for a quick bite and a drink. After sitting at the bar for 10 minutes the bar tender handed us menus and said nothing and walked away. A few minutes later she asked us for drinks. My girlfriend and I ordered beers and she asked for our IDs. My girlfriend handed over hers and the bartender asked for a second form of ID and she handed over a college ID.  My girlfriend said, \" I'm 28 years old and my birthday is .....\" to which the bartender responded: \"if you're 28 years old what are you doing in college still?\" If she actually understood how college and graduate programs work then maybe she wouldn't be a bartender at a bad bar. They can keep their overpriced BBQ and domestic bottles, we will go to the smiling moose instead.
