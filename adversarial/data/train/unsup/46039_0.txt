The food was beyond amazing, I strongly suggest the bibimbap, the corn pancake, and the glass noodles, those were my absolute favourites!  I went here for my birthday on Friday, and it really made my birthday meal special!  A few complaints I have though are the slow service and the awkward chopsticks.  I understand that the restaurant is really busy, but we found ourselves waiting a looot for simply things like water.  As well, the chopsticks were cool, but they were so skinny, they were hard to hold and manage, unlike the usual bamboo ones.  Besides those two criticisms, this restaurant was awesome!  Absolutely delicious and very different :) , I would happily go back to Little Piggy again!  Hopefully soon.
