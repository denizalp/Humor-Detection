I've been here for brunch, lunch, dinner, and late night drinks.  This place is what you call \"cool and sleek\" for downtown slash midtown Phoenix.  I'm not totally loving the loacation south of Indian School, but you wouldn't know otherwise while in the restaurant.  This place is totally modern looking as well as being quite hip inside and has a menu to back it.  Extensive martini list that are only $5 after 10pm can't be a negative in anyone's book.  Also, check out the relaxing patio and watch the \"light railers\" go by.  This establishment is a must to partake in at least once, if not many times!
