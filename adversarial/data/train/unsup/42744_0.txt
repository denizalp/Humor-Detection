This place always seems to have the hardware I need for my projects, and at prices that beat ordering online. While it is true that customer service is not their forte, I can say that I've never been treated rudely or poorly by the staff.\n\nIf you have a pretty good idea of what you are looking for this is the place for you. If you need some advice or are looking for help completing a project, you should probably try a \"helpful hardware place.\" This is more of a \"hardcore hardware place,\" and that's fine with me. As long as McFadden-Dale keeps carrying the products I need, and they are on the shelf when I need them, I'll keep coming back.
