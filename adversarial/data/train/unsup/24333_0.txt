We went for a quick lunch to this restaurant. It seemed relatively new, the place is clean, organized and there were few people. We were seated immediately. \n\nWe ordered Mongolian chicken and Pad Thai chicken. Both came with soup, spring roll and rice as a side. But we paid $1 extra for fried rice. The soup they served veggie tofu was pretty good. The Mongolian chicken had a unique smoky taste. It was alright and not that great. I was not satisfied with the fried rice they served. It seemed like a regular rice with some crumbs of egg in it. The spring roll size was decent. The pad Thai was alright and was not exceptional. \n\nI could easily say this place is trying to be a version of Panda express with a nice sit out. Overall the food is alright and not so unique to be a repetitive customer. The price is average and there is definitely room for growth when it comes to taste.
