Go see Dr. Tounian! He is easily the best dentist I've ever seen. \n\nOffice staff is great, they will work with you on payments, even if you don't have insurance. They usually get me in and out, they are incredibly fast, polite, and gentle. I've never had to wait more than a day or two for my next appointment at Floss. (You can trust me on gentle, I've had 4 cavities and a two root canals here, and I'm terrified of the dentist)
