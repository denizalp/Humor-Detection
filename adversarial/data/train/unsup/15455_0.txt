We lived in Las Vegas for around 15 years and Wo Fat was one of our favorite restaurants. It was sad when I looked through all the reviews to see it had hit a low spot for a while but, luckily, it is back. When we went to LV last time, we went back for our fav meal. \n\nWe have tried many things but favorites are the curry puffs, fried rice, and the soups-hubs loves the pork noodle and my fav is the chicken noodle. It is everything that is good with a flavorful broth, thin tasty noodles and veggies,like bok choy, that always make me feel healthier.   In fact, when one of us felt like a cold was coming on, I would go get take out of the soups. \n\nWe have travelled many places but have never found soup as good as we had at Wo Fat. I'm not sure what it is but it is the best that we've ever had. Now, that we don't live in Las Vegas, we have to hope we can get there whenever we are in town. \n\nI do recommend your giving it a try. I hope you love it like we do.
