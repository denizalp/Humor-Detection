Way overpriced, I mean 4$ for an iced tea? Unbelieavable. I mean seriously. Pasta with peppers too spicy it was unenjoyable was like eating straight tamales for crying out loud. Throat got obliterated. Salad was a big piece of lettuce? Come on Italians get with the program. Bread and mints was about the only good thing. And not to mention no to go cups for the ridiculously priced drinks. Unbelievable. Nice people though.
