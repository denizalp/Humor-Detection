The Lava Lounge used to be cool, now it sucks hard.\n\nWent last Friday at about 11pm.  I knew we were in for trouble when I asked for one of their tap beers and he said that we couldn't get anything on tap because his lines were being cleaned.  No apologies, just in a snarky asshole tone.  Maybe you should have planned ahead.\n\nSo we get the special of the night, pre-mixed long islands.  We sit down and want to listen to some music and are ready to feed the juke box, but no options on the screen.  I ask the bartender about it.  \"We turn it off on the weekends\", he says in a condescending, not giving a shit, way.\n\nSo we deal with Ke$ha and the litany of pap crap that ensues until we finish our drinks.  This place used to be a haven from the frat boy\/sorority girl infestation downtown.  Actually, the bar's concept and Tiki-theme is credited to Rob Zombie's bassist.  Sorry to say that Zombie's bassist would be appalled now, vomit, and then leave and never come back.
