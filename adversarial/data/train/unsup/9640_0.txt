During our last visit to Vegas, we wanted to watch \"We're The Millers\".  Decided to go to a theater that we have never visited before and decided on this one.  It is a nice movie theater located inside the Palms Hotel & Casino.  Its located by the west entrance close to the food court.  Grab a bite before or after going to the theater.  As most theaters are, the food prices inside the theater were expensive.  Save money and eat at the food court which has plenty of affordable options.\n\nThe theater is pretty big, and decorated nicely.  There are even stars on the ground similar to what is seen on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  There is an IMAX inside.  The movie we watched that evening was located in one of their smaller venues.  It was stadium seating, clean, comfortable, and the sound was good.  \n\nA couple of things I did not like.  The seats did not recline and rock as much as I would have liked.  Every once in awhile, there would be lights coming from people's cell phones.  Many teenagers and adults were texting during the movie.\n\nOverall, our trip to Brenden Theatres was fine.  We would probably go again, if we were in the area and wanted to watch a movie.  Ticket prices are reasonable.
