Worst place to get your contacts using your insurance. Customer service is so poor here. I had gone there early for my appointment based on my past experience nevertheless still got terribly delayed. Lack of staff the person at the reception finally decided to get the contacts for me. There was not trial of contacts, the doctor said try them out and if they dont fit well call us since it was crowded and no staff members at all. My new pair of contacts (4 boxes in total) did not fit right i called them and never got an answer till date. I would never recommend this place. Waste of time, money and energy.
