This place is a joke and doesn't even deserve a star. The ambience is that of a creepy pedo palace, the bartenders are mean, the DJ's play lame mainstream music that no one dances to, they charge $10 for water and the floor... holy hell the floor... is sticky. Can you imagine running a blacklight over it? Disgusting. Also, yes, as a woman I got my 3 free drink tickets, but was told that I could only order vodka from the well with some type of juice. When I tried to order a jack and coke, I was told \"that's not basic enough\". This place is where dreams go to die. It should be called \"Plight Nightclub\".
