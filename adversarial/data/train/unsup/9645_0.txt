Have you ever heard about the mechanic shop who buys Yelp reviews off of a shady website or how about the shop that tell their friends, \"hey shoot me a quick review and I'll give you a discount on your repair.\" If you haven't heard of those mechanic places, I know you've heard of the mechanics that charge an arm and a leg because they see you riding in a Mercedes, so they tell their buddy's, \"watch this, I'm going to sucker this guy out of $8000.\" \n\nWe've all heard about those companies, but I refuse to get suckered just because of what I drive. I would like the same treatment if I drove up in another car, but I didn't receive that, and I'm sure they'll respond and say this never happened, but that's a chance that you should be prepared to take, I would suggest you take a taxi cab up there, because if they see you in an uber they might add and additional fee of $2500. \n\nI told the owner, \"to not touch the car,\" because I didn't want any other fee's, because he had originally told me that he would do a free diagnostic as long as I didn't have a \"laundry list\" of things wrong with my Range Rover. I actually told him everything that was wrong with it and even which side was damaged, and he asked me, so you don't want to pay for it, after that comment and the poor customer service, I just paid the $100.00 fee. \n\nLong story short, I picked up my Range Rover and got the heck out of there as fast as I could. I took my truck to another shop on West Charleston, and look at that free diagnostic and it was a lot cheaper than $8000. They also write reviews of themselves and switch the pictures and names, what a cool trick. \n\nBEWARE OF FAKE REVIEWS AND FRIENDS OF THESE MECHANIC SHOPS, THEY DO EXIST. THEY DIDN'T WANT ME AS A CUSTOMER AND I WON'T EVER BE BACK. I'LL LET ALL OF MY FOLLOWERS KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE.
