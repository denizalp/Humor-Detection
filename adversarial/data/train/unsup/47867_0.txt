So much fruit with the breakfast meals!! I have to admit having an allergy to kiwi I was nervous because every pic of food I saw on their website had kiwis in it. Our server was great and made sure that everyone at our table had fresh fruit salad (no kiwi) so we could try each others food without worrying about me!\n\nPrices were pretty good. It was 36CAD for two breakfasts, OJ, and a Mochacino.\n\nWe will definitely be coming back tomorrow :)
