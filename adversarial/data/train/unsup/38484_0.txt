This hidden gem is located in Parkdale just west of Dufferin on Queen. It's our fave lunch spot with their homemade lemonade and chicken\/Brie wrap. We also frequent the Cosmo for brunch on a Saturday morning for their breakfast bagels or egg platter. (My parents brought breakfast bagels to the hospital when my son was born. Such a nice treat).
