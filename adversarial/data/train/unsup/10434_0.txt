After reading so many good reviews for Shang, I stopped here on the way home for dinner.  I took a seat at the bar so I could watch the action at the cooking area on the other side of the bar.\n\nI was told I could sit anywhere and the server brought me hot tea not too long after I ordered it.  It was super--a mixture of white and green tea with a very distinctive flavor.\n\nI ordered the Shang beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodles.  While waiting, I did enjoy the show watching the cooks put noodles in their strainers for heating and then adding the noodles to different soup dishes.  I also got the chance to see them start the process.  A large pan of bones with meat was brought out and later, after a wok was heated to a high degree, the bones were but in and braised with the high heat.  The cook had two large spoons to stir the meat.  Very interesting to watch the start of making the broth.\n\nMy bowl of soup was brought and it was very good.  The beef flavor was nice and strong.  There were very tender beef cubes in the soup, and it also contained three baby bok choy.\n\nServie was very good with the server bringing me more hot water for my tea.\n\nI'm really a fan of Shang and I want to go back and try the beef pancakes.  It would have been too much for one person!
