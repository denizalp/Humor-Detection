Now its 3:39pm right now as i am righting this and my appointment was at 2:35pm. I just got out not even 5 minutes ago. So we called into the back and the nurse comes and only askes maybe 2 questions and leaves. Then we wait for the doctor to come right ,?like usual. By this time its maybe 3:40pm. Need i mind you i have 2 kids thats are being seen and 2 waiting with my oldest sister whos 26 in the car. We waited and waited and i went out multiple times to ask what was going on. Id understand if they were busy or something but trust me they we not at FUCKING ALL!!! IT'S BEEN 1 HOUR AND ABOUT 35 MINUTES AND THE DOCTOR NEVER COMES IN!!!!!!! These kids are 12 6 7 4 and just got out of school. There hungry and cranky!  And i have other things to do. Dont get me wrong im sensable and will be understanding of course but when you arent busy and im already in a room. I expected to be seen before somone who made there appointment at 3:15. The doctor really hax no excuse and said she sees her patients according to the shedule so why am i being seen at 3:40 when my appointment was at 2:35??? Im sorry but i got other things to do and feed my kids. Then the doctor was only in there for less than 5 minutes. So your telling me i waiting more than an hour for a 5 minute meeting w someone who dont gaf? I would rather have cecelia the nurse be my doctor than the actual fucking doctor!!! If i could give this place a zero i would!!!! No questions asked
