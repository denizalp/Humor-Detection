Holy crap the food is large. I came here with three work buddies and ordered an Antipasto salad. The guy next to me, let's call him Brian ordered a calzone for 10 bucks. Well, my salad was gigantic and had all sorts of great meats and cheeses. I actually couldn't even finish the salad. Brian on the other hand had what I would say is a 12 ince cheese pizza rolled into a calzone that looked like a large football. It was enormous. The dough was very tasty and they totally didn't skimp on the cheese. Wow. It was great.
