I stopped into Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken after a few drinks at Downtown Summerlin. Let's just start with that it is extremely modern inside. However, I then saw the prices. The food is WAY overpriced, even for the area. I paid $12 for a sandwich. It came with sides, but that did not come with a drink. The portions are average. You're not paying for more. \n\nOverall, the food was okay. It wasn't at the McDonalds level. But, it was not something that I would keep coming back for. Service saved this review.
