This place serves delicious hand-pulled lanzhou style noodles. You do not come here for service or ambiance. You will be disappointed if you are expecting great service. \n\nYou come here for the reasonably priced noodles. The menu is simple. The portions are generous.\n\nThe soup noodle was delicious. We got the thick noodles and it was cooked well - aldente. \n\nWe also got the dry noodle mixed with vegetables and pork. I would highly recommend it.
