Atmosphere:\n\n- The host welcomed me in from the tornado conditions outside and let me drip off on the wood floor, which was kinda nice. \n- We were seated upstairs, with a cozy feel and a nice view down Bloor West Village. \n\nService:\n\n- It took forever to get anyone's attention, but finally flagged a guy down.\n- I recognized the \"unfit for service\" server-- the one who looks like an evil leprechaun, right? I embarked on a social experiment to kill him with kindness, and it worked!\n- Sadly, our original server didn't know the specials (and read them only when prompted) and didn't tell me about the gluten free chocolate torte (which I saw on the chalkboard as we exited). I really wish he would have told me because I had already stated I was celiac, so that was not cool!!!! \n\nFood:\n\n- When every other Italian restaurant has \"10,000 Leagues under the Sea\" sized grilled calamari, how does Queen's Pasta end up serving the runts of squid?\n- But my g-free butternut squash soup was delicious-- both sweet and savory, and piping hot. Just the thing to warm the soul that entered from the storm.\n\nOverall, I think it had the best atmosphere of the BWV restaurants I passed on foot, and our table of 4 left satisfied with bellies full of pasta.
