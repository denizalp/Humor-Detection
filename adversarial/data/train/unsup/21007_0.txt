Normally I stay far away from clubs, but my cousin's maid of honor picked this place for her bachelorette party (former sorority girl- go figure), and my curiosity was piqued. I figured I would get some entertainment as an outside observer.\n\nWrong! We arrived around 10pm on a Thursday, and there wasn't a single customer inside! This is the Old Town hotspot I have been hearing so much about? There wasn't even any music playing.\n\nThe doormen and hostess were all very nice and were understanding when we hightailed it out of there.
