QUANTITY NOT QUALITY mostly NOT EDIBLE\n\nThe good-\nmy ice tea and the pickle chips.\n\nThe bad-\nrye bread as thick as my thumb (rye bread should be thin)\nlow fat  low quality corned beef that appeared to be previously frozen because of dark color but had added grease fat added to each side of each slice of meat that seemed to be mostly burger grease (because of the remnants of burger I found in my sandwich) and other assorted grease. The dressing was thinned down to a milky substance. The cheese used was processed not real cheese . The sour kraut had a few of someones grilled burger onions in it. \n\nThe salad was water logged and not drained and I had an inch or more of water in the bowl.\n\nThe waitresses all were sleeveless and that doesn't seem sanitary because of all that reaching everywhere how do you know if some deodorant or antiperspirant didn't flake off into your food? \n\n My waiter seemed very rushed the whole time.\n\nFelt sick to my stomach after here.\n\nand on the way out I saw ketchup bottles on the patio tables outside that may have been opened and were possibly spoiling in the high heat outside.\n\nI know most people only enjoy the fatty breakfast here since they are used to that  and that is cool . They are really large and most people I saw were LOVING that!
