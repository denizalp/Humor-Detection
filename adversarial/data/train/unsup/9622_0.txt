Now this is how to run a Clothes Mentor! This location was clean, the employees were very friendly and helpful. The clothes racks were easy to shop, they were not over crowded with clothes. They had a good selection, and they had many items on sale. I was very pleased with my purchases. I highly recommend this location.
