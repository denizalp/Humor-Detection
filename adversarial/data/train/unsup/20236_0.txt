I had to go there to visit my aunt.  Parking is expensive just like any other hospital.  It is a good thing she did not stay there too long.  I have to say went to the restaurant and got two pizza pizza slices. For some reason they were out of this world.  Don't know if it was the oven they are using but it was the best pizza pizza slice I have ever had in Toronto. It was also very reasonably priced. As for the rest of the food I can not say. \n\nOverall : the staff at the hospital were polite and friendly.  The pizza was the best I have ever tasted.
