This was my first time trying the Thai Style Noodle House on Jones and Warm Springs. You can find Thai Style Noodle House on the southwest corner and right behind the Lucky's Lounge. \n\nWe saw the good reviews on Yelp! and decided to give it a shot.\n\nWow! What a gem!\n\nThings I like-\n\n- Ordered the Tom Yum soup with vermicelli noodles ($6.95), the chicken pad see ew($6.95), and the BBQ chicken fried rice (also $6.95) Portions were very healthy for the price point and everything tasted so yummy!\n- the chicken pad see ew almost had a subtle sweetness to its flavoring that made the dish very tasty! Not overpowering, but still noticeable ...it was just right! :)\n- the chicken fried rice was very tasty and the rice was soft and fluffy!\n- the tom yum was served in a HUGE bowl and this was the first time I've had it served to me in town with the vermicelli noodles. So tasty and full of flavor!\n- service was friendly and competent. \n- the actual restaurant itself is very spacious and is tastefully decorated. Lots of purple and pink!\n\nThings I did not like-\n\n- the soft drinks, once again, served in a can ($1.50 each). Argh! \n\nAside from the whole soda in a can thing, I love this place and will definitely be back on numerous occasions! Great food, in healthy portions, at a reasonable price! This place is somewhere you definitely want to make a point to check out if you appreciate some good Thai food!\n\n4.5 stars!
