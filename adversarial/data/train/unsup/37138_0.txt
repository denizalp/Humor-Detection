Standard breakfast and brunch only establishment. \n\nSo far have only tried a GVP omelet, club sandwich and the huevos rancheros. Nothing special taste-wise, but the service was fairly fast, as is the common expectation in these types of eateries.\n\nExpect a 10-20 minute wait on weekends. Never been there during the workweek.
