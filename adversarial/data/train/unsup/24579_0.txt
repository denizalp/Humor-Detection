So I really love trader joes. This trader joes isn't huge... But It carries most of their specialty products. Beware of the parking lot... it's just a busy section of the shopping center and it's pretty limited. Use the spaces near the k-mart so you don't get your car hit with another car door or shopping cart. \n\nI love how trader joes went from being known as a specialty store... And then slowly became more a of health conscious\/specialty store. They claim that anything with the trader joes label is non gmo. However, they don't label the packages that way... So I'm skeptical. They offer a wide variety of vegan snacks and products and their is list available on line... However... They are always getting new products and it isn't up to date. I suggest just referencing the list while you check out the store. Their organic produce is fairly priced and they offer a wide range of different hummus and dips, meats and cheeses... And breads... Quite a few specialty breads. They also have a ton of gourmet cookies and chocolates! If your in the neighborhood of a trader joes, even if you don't need anything... Check them out. :)
