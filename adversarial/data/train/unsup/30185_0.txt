Our travel counselor, Mary Falter was absolutely awesome! She assisted my husband and I with our very first cruise and made us want to leave the very next day!\n\nThe office was close to home and extremely beneficial for all of our needs!\n\nThe fact that she followed up with the very next day was very great! It confirmed that we are with an exceptional company that cares.
