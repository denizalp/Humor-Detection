My friend and I rented a car from here for a trip to California for four days. we made the appointment at 7:30 in the morning so we could get on the road. When we arrived we were greeted by the friendly staff. Our car wasn't ready quite yet, so we waited. As we waited the two guys that worked there were really nice and were making conversation with us. The guy that seems like the manager, felt bad that we waited a little bit for a car so he gave us a free upgrade! Everyone was just so nice and accommodating. The car was excellent! It worked out perfect. If I ever rent a car again it will definitely be from this enterprise!!!
