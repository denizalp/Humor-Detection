I am so put up with Best Buy. I have ordered 6 different TV within the last 2 months because of the TV was either cracked, didn't work with arc 1 input on our receiver,  or the orders continued to be pushed back.  I lost count on how many times I tried calling BB and got disconnected or the phone never was answered.  Mark helped us out a few times,  and he did a good job getting our situation fixed but the hassle of going to BB continually, especially during the holidays was not on my agenda.  We finally received the 70\" Vizio 4k TV and it's awesome.  Great TV. But next time,  I will go elsewhere!
