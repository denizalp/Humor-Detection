Not recommended....at all! \n\nFirst off, making an appointment is a joke! I made an appointment and still had to wait over an hour to be seen. The office looks like your traditional health clinic in a poor neighborhood where you feel like you're going to catch something just from being in there. \n\nAnyway, I finally get seen and the medical assistant basically took a look at me and wrote me a prescription for a cream...now this is when it gets interesting....I was charged $114 for basically nothing. \n\nWhen I went to CVS to fill the prescription, the medical assistant forgot to write the medication on the prescription form...she just wrote the instructions. The pharmacist attempted to call the location and a bunch of the phone numbers on the prescription either didn't work or were to the wrong location. Come to find out, the prescription was about $120 and I couldn't afford it. So basically all this location did was charge me $114 for an incorrectly written prescription that I couldn't afford. No wonder they're on the verge of getting de-funded. Truly horrible place to get medical care. I thought it was going to be cheap and affordable. Nope! Next time I'll go to a real doctor. \n\nAvoid this place like the plague!!! And let's work to defund these crooks!
