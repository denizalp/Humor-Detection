\"I hate sushi.\"  That was me earlier in the night, when looking at the menu.  I was in Vegas for a week and it was our last night.  My friend really loves sushi and I wasn't that hungry, so... fine.  Nobu.  Truth is... I'd never actually had sushi.  I had some lobster roll once and couldn't get past the seaweed wrapper.  Almost turned blue and, well... it wasn't pretty.  Anyway... they seated us in the lounge area in a huge booth.  No one behind us.  Clear view of the entire place.  Felt like we had the best table.  I scanned the menu to try to find something I would actually eat.  Wagyu.  That works. Chicken, too.  Shrimp Tempura.  I can do that.  The server (super hot; in fact... all the servers are ridiculously gorgeous)  was convinced that I'd like sushi if I just tried it.  I explained my issue with the seaweed.  She smiled (knowing what an idiot I am, of course) and said rolls are one way to eat it, but that I needed to trust her.  She said her brother hated it, as well... but once he tried it... he loved it.  She suggested the \"Omakase\" - a tasting from across the menu.  You give them a price point (ours was $125 per person).  They ask if you have allergies, what you like\/dislike... and you get a series of signature items delivered over the next hour. Ordered a lychee sake and... as I looked around, I realized that it was our last night and this was a nice place. Ok.\n\n\"Amazing\" is an understatement.  One of the best meals I've had.  Ever.  The first dish was the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno.  Wow.  It was incredible.  Next up was a red snapper sashimi with lime.  Another sashimi... this one salmon with sesame, ginger, and green onion.  Then came the beef tenderloin (my least favorite dish of the night), followed up by black cod miso (wonderful flavor), creamy\/spicy shrimp tempura, and then the sushi... albacore (holy mother of god this was good) and bluefin.  The final dish was a dessert... chocolate cake and green tea ice cream (with berries).  Topped it off with an espresso and called it a night.  With tip, the bill came out to about $450 for two.  A lot of money, but... it was a terrific experience and now I know I like sushi.\n\nHighlights...\n\nYellowtail sashimi with jalapeno\nAlbacore sushi \nLychee sake (had a few; they were about $20 each)\nServers (what? eye candy is nice, too)\n\nI'd like to try the wagyu tacos.
