For those waking up hungry as heck in the morning and craving eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes and etc. Village Inn is the right answer. The menu isn't meant just to feed ya, it's to fill you up just right. About half the menu for breakfast comes with a side of pancakes and everyone gets their own coffee pot so no need to worry about refills. This place will satisfy any morning cravings, this will be my number one spot for breakfast.
