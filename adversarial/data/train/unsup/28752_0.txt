Visited here a year ago and the menu included steaks. I'm so happy they cut it back and just made it what it is, a decent beer bar. I had a cheeseburger which is the house burger (they don't seem to give you options unless it is something in the menu)  The burger was delicious. She is ordered a chicken cheesesteak and asked if the owner was from Pennsylvania cause it was that good. We came to find out the rolls are from NJ. Our server was nice and polite and quick to offer beverage ideas. I know they are trying to play to the craft beer crowd and cutting back the menu which is good
