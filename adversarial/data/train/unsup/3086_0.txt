South Park Mall my favorite mall in the Cleveland area, and in my opinion it is nearly perfect. Sure, they don't have the high-end department and designer stores of Beachwood Mall, but they have EVERYTHING else: a movie theater, a bouncy trampoline contraption, a pet store, a huge food court, a ceramic painting workshop, blacklight mini golf...in addition to a variety of mid-higher end chain stores (clothes, shoes, jewelry, electronics, kitchenwares, toys, trinkets, etc.), not to mention all the other stores that they have in it's large surrounding complex. It's really like a little village!\n\nThis is a great mall for strolling, window-shopping, or hanging out because it's massive and full of people.\n\nWhen I stopped in today, I was impressed with the entertainment they brought in for this holiday season. There was a train for small children, a balloon artist, santa claus, and a dance troop. It makes an outing to the mall a lot more fun!
