Learn from our mistakes.\n\n#1 - Locals get a 50% discount.\n\n#2 - Living social has deals all the time. Don't pay full price for a ticket. \n\n#3 - The happy hour thing is crap.

Like I said, learn from our mistake. \n\n#4 - Make sure all of your friends have the same type of ticket so you can't get suckered into spending an extra $15 for the happy hour ride when you already bought drinks.\n\n#5 - For $35, you can go to Foundation Room at Mandalay, have two amazing cocktails, and a better view.\n\n#6 - Watch for backsplash when someone else in your pod gets motion sickness and vomits everywhere.
