I have never in my entire life had to wait for over 30min for bacon & eggs with French toast. The restaurant was only half full at the time and other tables which were seated after me got their food well before I did. \n\nMy server said coffee was on the house due to the wait, yet the home fries which comes as a side did not even cover a quarter of the plate, you could count the individual fries that's how few there were. \n\nAfter receiving my food my server was no where to be found and another server who saw my frustration had to handle my bill. \n\nI don't know if this was an off day with my server but it's still unacceptable. I will not be coming back.
