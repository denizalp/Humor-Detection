I had a great experience with Charity Towing.  My car tire blew at 5 am while my hubs was driving (I was home asleep) so he calls AAA and they send out Charity towing.  My hubs had to head to the airport to catch a flight so I met the tow truck at the Waffle House on University.  (Plus the car was stopped on I 10 and people drive crazy!). Anyway the tow truck driver was really really nice and friendly.  I wish I remembered his name but he moved here from South Dakota when he was 16 and we talked about the weather and scary flying experiences in little planes the morning of Feb 21. \n\nI digress - so AAA had told me to take the car to The Auto Shop and assured me that they sell tires.  The tow truck driver said \"they don't\" and called to confirm that they in fact didn't. So he towed my car to Discount Tire and even took the short cut because it was more than 5 miles and I have to pay for towing over 5 miles.  I really appreciated that!  \n\nSo my hats off to Charity Towing!
