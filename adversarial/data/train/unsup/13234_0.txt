Ordered Hatch Burger mid rare with sweet tots. After about 20 mins it comes out minus the aioli, and overcooked to the point it needs the extra lube, and tots are ice cold..I tell the server the Burger is overcooked, and missing the sauce. Here's the important part, all I wanted at that point was the sauce. Not the management attention, not the rolling eyes of the judging server, not compensation, free food, sympathy, or a hug, just the aioli that was promised on the description. They took it very personally, like their elderly grandpa was back their flipping those grisly hockey pucks..long story short I got the sauce, the burger was comped. The tots remained frozen to the plate. I left, never to return.
