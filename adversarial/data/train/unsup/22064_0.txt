Always hit the spot. The portions are huge for the price. I love their poke and their fried poke salad. I think we've ordered every combo you can think of along with all the sides. Furakaki Chicken, beef stew, Hoisen ribs and kalbi are our favorite. Don't forget to leave room for desserts,  Chantilly, guava, haupai cake and coco puffs. \n\nThey also offer daily specials and readily available spam musubi!
