My 100th Review!!!\n\nMy 16 year old daughter and I went here a few weeks ago for some ribs. They were good...but nothing that would be featured on \"Pit Masters\". \n\nWe shared a Caesar salad to start. My daughter had the Mac & Cheese and I had the potatoes. They were both good but nothing to right home to Momma about. \n\n3 solid starz for A-OK!
