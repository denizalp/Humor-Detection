Basic woodworking class with outstanding instructor.  Jamie is funny and easygoing making the 3 hour sessions go by almost too fast.  High quality power and hand tools are used.  In the 6 weekly sessions we made 3 different items.  I did not believe it would be possible to learn and create these so fast, but we did.  Class size of 10 people was ideal, allowing a great amount of hands on tool time.
