SO average. I think the dim sum scene in Vegas must clearly be lacking because they would not get these kinds of reviews in Rowland Heights or LA area fo suree.\n\nWe came here on Christmas for a late lunch and decided to try this place out. Ordered the egg tarts, siu mai, BBQ pork bun, beef chow fun, sweet tofu, gai lan with oyster sauce, chicken fingers, chinese donuts, and another tofu dish. \n\nOverall bill came out to $60 for five of us. Service was average but that was to be expected for a Chinese restaurant.\n\nI know my dim sum pretty well and also had the legit stuff in Hong Kong and I'd say the flavors and taste were totally off for all the dishes we had and everything was just average. \n\nGuess I'll just have to get my dim sum fix when I go back home after.
