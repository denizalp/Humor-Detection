Thanks to David B. and a serendipitous coupon from lunchclub.com, I finally went to Los Reyes de la Torta. The description of the Huarache con hongos is what really did it... and it was perfectly described! \n\nIt's like an extra thick soft corn tortilla topped with beans (navy or cannellini, not pinto) a LOT of queso fresco and... hongos (mushrooms). Don't like mushrooms? Pick a different topping... much like (as Dave B. describes) pizza!\n\nThe waitress asked if I wanted red or green salsa and I asked for sides of each so I could try them both, but I only got the red... which was fine, because it added good flavor. \n\nThe portion was huge! And, the price was fair (around $7 including a can of diet coke)
