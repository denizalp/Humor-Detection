Great subs, loyal customer, but they're pricing themselves out of the market. Just ordered a large sub which my 4 month old menu says is 10.99, pricey as is. When I picked it up it was 11.99, and I'm thinking I had an old menu. When I picked up a current menu it also said 10.99, so I said wait a minute, why am I charged 11.99? The guy behind the counter explains that the printer screwed up the prices. So why would you not explain to that customers when they order? And why would you not at least hand correct the menus?\n\nThey seem to continue to do a brisk business but I have to predict their downfall if this is how they do business.
