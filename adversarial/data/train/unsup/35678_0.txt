Kate Spade, Michael Kors, and Under Armour are my favs here. There are plenty of of others but these are my go to stores. Nike is disappointing because they do not really have any markdowns, on anything! Express is ok...Banana Republic doesn't have much (at least not when I've been there). But if you need to do some shopping go check it out, there are some good deals there!
