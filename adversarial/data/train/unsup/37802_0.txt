We were out with friends (adults) in Uptown on Saturday night.  After dinner, we decided we wanted to hear live music, so we walked over to Happy Dog.  When we walked in, the kid at the door just stared at us.  We asked if there was a cover and he said yes.  Then he said \"it is a younger crowd here tonight, sorry\" and did not let us in!  Were denied access for being adults!  I think Happy Dog needs to remind its employees that it is the adults who spend money and leave tips and therefore pay their paychecks.
