I actually like McDonald's and I think they have the drive thru service down to a science. The several times I have been to this location, my order is taken right away and my order has been correct. The speakers work clearly so you don't have to shout or repeat your order. The menu is brightly lit and easy to read. Service is polite and quick.\n\n I like that they have different coffee options now. There are lattes, cappuccinos, and caramel macchiatos. Though they are not amazing, they are not bad either. It's hot, it's caffeine, it's 24 hours (in the drive thru), and its consistent. Besides, you can't beat the price point for what you're getting. Good location too as it is on the way to the 215.
