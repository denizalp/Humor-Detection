\"F--k O'Sheas!\" - Jeffrey L. (I'll explain this quote later)\n\nHooo man this place is something else. I first stumbled upon this place on a one-day adventure to Vegas with my Pilipino Cultural Night buddies. Since then, whenever I'm in town I'd pass by this place often, but never really go inside.\n\nOn the plus side, the tables are cheaper, whether it be blackjack or roulette, or whatever you prefer. As mentioned before, the Jager bombs are only a couple bucks. And as much as I try to avoid fast food, its nice that there's a late night Subway and Burger King tucked in the back. It was a last resort for my friends and I after all the buffets were closed. \n\nSo here's where it gets ugly. Let's not kid ourselves, O'Sheas is freakin' dirty. It smells like alcohol, vomit, and shame rolled into one, and thats not a good odor to breathe in consistenly. Well, you can say its what Vegas is all about, and its one of the older casinos, but whatever. \n\nI was impressed that this is the only casino that does beer pong. To feed my curiousity I looked at the beer pong area and holy moles it was a mess. There's drunken people yelling at each other while multiple ping pong balls fly through the air or bounce on the ground. What made this is worse is that the floor is dirtier than sin. Considering the rate the balls fall to fhe floor (I just chuckled as I typed that), imagine all the germs you get once you end up downing one of the cups. They should change it to hepatitis pong or something. I'll stick to playing at parties where the area is likely much cleaner. \n\nOh, one of the machines ate my friend's 20 bucks, and had a hard time trying to get it back. He also got a paper crown from Burger King, and someone drunk lady knocked it off his head outside of the casino. That's how we arrive to the quote at the top. \n\nIf anything, just come for the tables or the quick bite to eat. Ugh. F O'Sheas indeed. Cheerio... err bollocks. Whatever.
