This is the perfect hotel to stay with your \"girls\" for a weekend of debauchery. When Jessica and I walked in we immediately thought it looked like the hotels in the Arabian Gulf with its tall ceilings, gorgeous fountains and palm trees.  This is new Las Vegas, baby.\n\nThe suites are very nice and modern and sexy.  The red velvet chaise lounges are perfect for a that glam pre-party photo shoot, and the suite is perfect for post-party lounging. The beds are super soft and I'm already thinking about taking my mid-day nap tomorrow on piles of down pillows. After party in our room?  You know it!
