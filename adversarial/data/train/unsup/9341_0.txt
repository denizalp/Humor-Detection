Now that I've recovered from my food coma, I can happily report on my pleasant experience at Beckett's Table. \n\nAs our large group walked in, we were warmly greeted by the staff and seated at an accommodating table in the back. I noticed how homey the atmosphere was with the low lightening, the open kitchen and the wooden and brick architecture. Although the restaurant is situated in a random strip mall in Arcadia, you would never know once you get situated inside. \n\nWe started with cocktails and I went for the Palmaire. Tasty!! It had pomegranate infused vodka\/juice of some sorts and the soda added a perfect blend to it. \n\nSo now moving on to the food. \n\nOrder everything on the menu, or as much as you can handle for the size of your group because everything I tasted was delicious. The enchiladas have a zing to them, the mac and cheese is cheesy goodness, the Brussels sprouts are perfectly cooked with just the right amount of seasoning and the vegetable dish has the right amount and style of veggies to make you want more. \n\nNow that I was nearly stuffed from the appetizers alone, I moved to the entree. Although I was full and could have (should have) gone with a lighter option, I heard such amazing things about the short ribs that I had to give it a go. Yes, it was worth every bite and more. The shorts ribs were so tender, the meat fell into my fork and the potatoes and green beans were the perfect compliment. \n\nTo end the meal marathon, the group tasted all the desserts on the menu. Yes all of them. Each one was good in its own way, but my favorite was the chocolate souffle cake. What can I say, I'm a chocoholic. \n\nIn summary, this is a great dining option for dinner with your sweetie or with a huge group. You'll leave full from a great meal within a comforting atmosphere.\n\nLet me also might add...they are only open for dinner and get there early because there will be a wait.
