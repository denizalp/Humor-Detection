I've been to several Coach Outlets, from Vacaville to Petaluma to Gilroy to Las Vegas and who knows where else, but Las Vegas is definitely my favorite.  Not only do they have a bigger selection, but the girls that work here are definitely more friendlier than at the other locations.  They don't act all snobby and look at you like you can't afford anything inside the store.  They're attentive and eager to help.  I've spent many thousands of dollars on Coach and this would be one of my favorite place to spend it if it were closer to home.
