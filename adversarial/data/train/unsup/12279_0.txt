Dole Pineapple.\n\nThat's what caught my eye as I passed by this otherwise overlooked shop.\n\nI'm not a fan of self-serve yogurt joints, but after bicycling on a hot summer day, anything fruity and refreshing sounded good to me. After that first visit, I was hooked! \n\nLocated next to Naga Thai by Horizon & 95, this frozen yogurt shop has your typical common flavors you commonly see, Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry, and Red Velvet. In the span of all my visits in the last few weeks, I've tried every flavor. My favorites? Dole Pineapple (of course!), New York Cheesecake, Peanut Butter, & Cake Batter. I've sampled lots of flavors from Yogurtland, U-Swirl, Yofresco, & Golden Spoon, & I NEVER cared for their versions. Yet, Island Frozen's New York Cheesecake & Cake Batter is creamy, tasty, & yes, nonfat. Their Peanut Butter is awesome, I'm already thinking of what kind of chocolate I'll mix with it next!\n\nFor those who are curious, or people from the Hawaiian Islands, this isn't Dole Whip. I don't believe there's any dairy in there, since it's labeled Lactose-Free. It's more of a sorbet texture & a sweet pineapple taste. \n\nAs you go grab your cup, you'll see a clear case with cups already filled with waffle bowls. No charge for the waffle, but remember it's included in your yogurt weigh-in. I have found them to be stale at times. \n\nFree WiFi. \n\nThere's one TV that is usually playing a kid's movie. Mulan was the feature presentation last time. There's a few old-fashion video arcade games located in the back for the older kids. There's a small little kid's table w\/ those cutesy chairs. As a mother of a toddler, it's very kid-friendly. I like that.\n\nClean restrooms.\n\nToppings bar is always kept clean, fresh, and I love the variety. Fruit, cookies, chocolates, syrups, mochi, popping pearls, brownie bites...\n\nThey have what they call snow balls, but when I asked, they pretty much said it's a shaved ice cone. I haven't tried it, so I can't judge how good it is. \n\nThey give a stamp card. 50 points will earn you $5 off. I'm surprised I'm not there yet.\n\nSo there it is. If you're in the neighborhood, at least stop by to try their Dole Pineapple flavor. It's yummy!
