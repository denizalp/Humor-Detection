I was hoping to really like this place as many spots in the area are delish (Le Thai, Park on Fremont) but, I was bummed at how lackluster the food was for the price you pay. \n\nWe usually get sangria when it's on any menu. La Comida's sangria was aight. I felt like it was more ice than sangria tho.\nSecond we got elote. C'mon...how can you ever get that dish really wrong!?! It's corn, mayo, and cheese -- delicious!\nSadly, I forget what my boyfriend and I got but, I know he got the fish and I got half a chicken wrapped in paper...(sorry for the bad description).... His fish was whatevs; and my chicken was good in that it was smoky but, it's not something that I would try again.\nOur dessert of saut√©ed bananas and vanilla ice cream was the star of the show. Something about that ice cream...I think the real vanilla beans!\nwaaaay =)\n\nOverall, we paid almost $70 for this lunch and it was MEH. \nGoing to Tacos El Gordo and\/or Mundo should've gotten our money that day.
