After hearing from some friends that this was THE yoga studio in town for 'real' yoga, I ended up checking it out just this weekend. I didn't check Yelp before heading out to meet up with a friend for the 11am Sunday class. I got there in plenty of time and found the studio just east of Pavilion, the lovely furniture store. Though, if I hadn't walked past it a million times, I might have missed the sign and painted Shiva door. \nI just wanted to try it out and since P90X revs up this week, I didn't buy in to the 'upsell' for the 1 week pass. I did end up paying $20 for the one class, though- Ouch! \nThe class room is huge! Enough to fit in 40 or 50 students, though mine wasn't full. The room, though not Hot Yoga, was hot enough and I was dripping like rain during the final 45 minutes of this 105 (!) minute class. \nI've been lifting weights and exercising a lot, but I could hardly lift my arms for days! This is a tough workout. \nBut, they have the same problems as other studios- not big enough bathroom\/change room space, but it's exponentially worse here because there are 50 women trying to pee in one toilet and shower in just one stall! \nLuckily for me, I'm tethered to a 15 minute walking radius from my place, so I walked home to shower it off. Phew- what a workout!
