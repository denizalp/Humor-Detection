I used to be a huge Aloha Kitchen fan back in the day. It was my go-to spot over 10 years ago.  Back in the day, I considered Aloha Kitchen one of the best for Hawaiian food in Las Vegas.  Big portions! Great prices! Yummy Hawaiian food! That was then, this is now. A lot has changed over the years. I either had really low standards when it came to portion size back in the day or Aloha Kitchen started to skimp. I remember the Loco Moco being so big. That's not the case now. The side of Portuguese Sausage is only 3 small slices too. I recently went here craving a high calorie tasty meal. My Loco Moco and Portuguese Sausage still tasted good. But I left hungry and wondering \"where's the meat?\"
