Came here tonight for the first time. Was ushered in with a friendly greeting by a very nice gentleman at the front door. We were here for restaurant week and they were offering both their queens fest menu and regular menu which was nice to have options! My husband and I chose the restaurant week menu. Lobster bisque was wonderful  (made from scratch) as well as the pork osso bucco and filet mignon. Our waitress was wonderful and attentive. Our food was very good but it was the service and personal attention and southern hospitality (something those of us from the north can really appreciate!) that will definitely put this on our list of places to return to! \n\nOne recommendation would be to dim the lights a little. It was very bright in there.
