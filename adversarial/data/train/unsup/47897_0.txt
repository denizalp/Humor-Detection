I'm not a seafood person but I found a lot of choices at Snug Harbour Seafood Bar and Grill. They don't focus 100% on seafood, which is convenient at least for me. The interior is absolutely breathtaking and very modern. It's in a very beautiful location, right by the water, which is very nice to visit after your meal. Very clean restaurant and although it's not too expensive, people dress very nicely.
