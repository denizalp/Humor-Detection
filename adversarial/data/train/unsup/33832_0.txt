I am writing this review after waking up to find the store closed at 8:45. I mean cleaned up ready to blow out at 9:05 closed. When an operation cannot do something as simple as honor their business hours that is a message of just plain NOT CARING.  \n\nFor the sake of transparency, as in all my reviews, I will say that I have enjoyed their good numerous times.  I WAS a fan.  But seeing this crew watch me photograph them as the cleaner up after closing early, no one even made an attempt to offer an explanation.  \n\nSince I witnessed this evident lack of caring it makes me suspect on other aspects of the operation and processes.  Needless to say Blue Ribbon can consider this customer gone.\n\nWalked right across the street to another establishment and spent my money with them.
