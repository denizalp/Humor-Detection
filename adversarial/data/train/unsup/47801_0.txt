Like Megan, I don't want to feed my dog the usual cheap crap you can get from the grocery store, so I shop here instead.  They carry high-quality food, treats and toys.  Great for anyone who loves to spoil their furry \"kids\".\n\nThis place always cheers me up too.  I know animals in cages can make some folks sad but I can't resist oogling over their piles of baby hamsters and fuzzy, yellow ducklings.  Even the reptiles are cool.\n\nIt's like a one-stop shop for kibble, toys and cuteness!
