I guess I just don't get it. \n\nI had to bring food to an obligatory breakfast potluck at work. Oh how I hate obligatory breakfast potlucks at work!  I was going to go to Sprouts and pick something up on my way in, but I did not realize they didn't open till 8AM.\n\nI saw the new Krispy Kreme Doughnuts was open across the street, and I found a solution. There was a bit of a line, but nothing too bad. I got a mixed dozen. \n\nI ate one of their donuts, and it pretty much grossed me out. It was way too sweet in a gross way. I tried a different kind on another day from a box in the front office at work. Same thing, I threw it away after one bite. I do not get what is so great about these doughnuts.\n\nThere are a lot better ways for me to exceed my caloric limits. Krispy Kreme, I'll pass.
