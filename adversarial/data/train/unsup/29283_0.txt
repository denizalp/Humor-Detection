I cannot recommend this place enough!! The staff always made sure we were taken care of and had enough water. One lady was so so kind and did my hair, my mother's hair, and a simple nail on my mom for free! My mom and I hadn't asked for any of it either. She was probably bored, but I don't care it was such a sweet gesture. The guy doing my chrome nails was so great- he listened to everything I asked and carried it out to the best of his abilities. And the owner I believe was the best oh my goodness. She checked in and even tried helping out with my nails (chrome is very difficult to work with). They talked to us about all kinds of things and I enjoyed being there!! They were very patient and on top of having great prices. The manager noticed my nails weren't done perfectly (the chrome application wasn't entirely smooth because of how hard it was to rub in) and told the guy to take off 10%! I love this place and I'm absolutely coming back in the future!!
