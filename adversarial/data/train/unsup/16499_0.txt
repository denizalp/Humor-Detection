I first tried this place for my best friend's 21st birthday party and I have been hooked ever since. What truly sold it for me was the overall ambiance. I have been to the original location as well as the Tempe one and the Tempe location takes the cake for me as far as the outdoor patio. Something about the bistro lighting overhead makes for such a great setting and compliments the meal perfectly. \n\nEvery meal I have gotten I have enjoyed from this place as well! I normally get a combo item which includes tacos, enchiladas, flautas, etc. which fills me up. The meal also comes with refried beans and rice as well. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is the price. Being that I am in college I find the pricing to be a tad high for the meals and drinks they provide, and judging by other reviews I am not the only one that feels this way. I am all for paying the price if I feel that the quality and quantity reflects it. \n\nThe service has always been amazing at this location as well which I certainly appreciate! I will definitely be back to this place and feel it is a great place to spend special occasions at!
