I found out about Wet Republic through Thrillist and thought it would be a fun day activity during our bachelorette party weekend in Vegas.  We thought it would be a classy way of hanging at an adults only pool.\n\nCould we be anymore WRONG!  Upon entering, it felt like we were transported to the Jersey shore or the Inland Empire.  Never have I seen such a large concentration of fake tans, skunk hair and silicon.  Not to mention the amount of Roid Rage exploding from every orange man with spiky hair and ridiculously worded tattoos on their stomachs.\n\nLuckily, we planned ahead and reserved a daybed, so we had our own space to lounge and could easily avoid being bothered by the aforementioned people.  The servers were courteous and our hostess was very sweet.  However, at the end of the day, she for some reason had a complete melt-down and started bawling, and we had to close our tab with her.\n\nWe still managed to have a good time.  We spent most of the day just gawking at the ridiculousness that surrounded us.  A lot of the people seemed completely wasted and high on something else other than life.  The experience horrified me so much that I canceled my plans of going to Rehab the next day.  I'm not saying that Rehab would be the same type of crowd, but I really wasn't in the mood anymore to find out, even with the possibility of hanging out in a free cabana.\n\nIf you're looking for a more relaxing day at the pool, don't waste your time or money at Wet Republic.  I could have had the same experience and met the same kind of people there if I just drove the 45 minutes inland and threw a pool party of my own.
