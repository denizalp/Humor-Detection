Vin Master is a neighborhood wine shop gem. Chris and his wife know their wine and always help us find what we are looking for--even better, they help us find what we aren't looking for. We've had parties for friends in the space, brought some snacks and had a casual evening cocktail hour, or just popped in to shop for a bottle or two. It's pleasant, relaxing, and delightful. Love this place!
