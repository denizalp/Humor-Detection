Let's start off with I LOVE THIS PLACE. Living a mile from here is the best news in a while. This place is new and absolutely gorgeous. It's like the future of cinemas and cinema experiences.\n\nYou walk in to a front desk with a very polite hostess. We went 3\/18 at 8:00pm to see Beauty and The Beast. So whoever was working the front desk was awesome. She was beyond sweet and very informative. She signed me up for the VIP reward program very fast and explained it to us. Got us through a speedy experience and pointed us to the elevators.\n\nWe took it up to the top floor and a bouncer maybe manager smiled and talked to us. He pointed out where the movie was and also pointed out the beautiful lobby bar and dining area. Super great spot to grab food or drinks if you get there early. If you are on time FEAR NOT you can order food and cocktails from your seat!!!!!! SAY WHATTTT!!!!\n\nYes a server comes to your leather reclinable seats and takes your order after you push for the assistance button. Once you hit the button a server will come over. The food menu looked great but we ate before so we were looking for more drinks and dessert. Next time I'll plan to make a movie and dinner of it. We ordered beers and milkshakes. That was perfect. My partner also got a popcorn. \n\nI was upset because they brought me a chocolate cake slice, despite being amazing I thought the server bought it for me to be sweet, but apparently not. We were charged for it but didn't even order it?! We paid and realized when we were home. I'm letting it go but next time only bring what people order. This was a small hiccup in a great experience. Maybe a manager will reach out and try to fix it. Still would come back, a lot actually. Place is clean and ran well. Can't wait to see the progression.
