This chevron is disgusting. I was on my way to work and this was the closest Chevron, so I didn't have a choice. It was super crowded and it was hard to drive around other cars to get to an empty pump. When I finally did get to a pump and opened my door, there was that sand stuff all over the ground to soak up spilled gas. I was wearing a long dress that day so I had to lift up my dress so it wouldn't touch the ground. The location of this gas station is in a horrible part of town, so there were a few homeless people just hanging around. The pump itself was old and grimy, so I had to use a paper towel to grab the nozzle. Only good thing I can say is that gas was about 10 cents cheaper than on my side of town. But for my safety, I'd rather just drive further and pay the extra $.
