I got a $10 off $20 coupon and need to find a sports bar for Sunday football in my new neighborhood. Had the hot bone in wings and the pick your own pasta and cheese. The wing flavor was first rate. Only 8 wings for $9, but unfortunately this has become the norm for wings in Phx (what happened to $6 for a dozen wings in this town). With the pasta you get to choose shells or rotini, then 2 kinds of cheese, then three add ins, plus you can add meat for $3. I got roasted garlic, roasted red pepper, and cilantro for add ins and went with bleu cheese and brie for the cheeses. The cheese combo wasn't great (this was my fault not there's). The add ins were pretty minimal, meaning hard to find. It was served in a little skillet that had me wondering where they would put the meat if it was ordered as well. I don't think I'd order the pasta again, $8.5 for the size was pretty steep IMO. Weekend domestic drafts were $2 a pint, smoking deal there. I'll definitely be back, but just not enough TV's to be my regular spot for Sunday morning football. My minimum criteria is being able to sit at a table where I can see at least 8 different games at once for fantasy football.
