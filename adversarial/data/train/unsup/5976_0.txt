I've been here many, many times for drinks and had a great time, and for that reason I'm adding an extra star to my two star review. I went here for lunch yesterday and the food was REALLY underwhelming and I would not recommend it to anyone. \n\nService was great and so was the music (Air's \"Moon SafarI\"). One of the cooks went to turn the volume up and was promptly YELLED at (no exaggeration) by two elderly gentlemen who didn't want music with their meals. He barely flinched, apologized and left the volume as it was. I would have really been gritting my teeth at the rudeness of the two customers but the cook handled it well.\n\nNow the food. I was really intrigued by the wonderful options on the menu: baked mac & cheese with swiss, cheddar and shaved reggiano, bean and beet burger with dilled cucumber, red union, grainy dijon aioli and German potatoes, lamb and chevre burger, quince and chevre quesadilla. Lots of veggie options.\n\nMaybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but I can't help but think that a burrito is pretty basic food and hard to screw up. I ordered the black bean and sweet potato burrito ($10) with sour cream, avocado and salsa and it was incredibly underwhelming. The burrito was expertly packed\/grilled but the flavour was bland. They used short grain white rice and canned black beans (not that I was expecting dried - I mean, no one should have to slave over a pot of soaking beans) but they were watery and poorly rinsed. I like my Mexican rice to be a little \"dirtier\". There was NO spice or flavouring to speak of. The sweet potatoes were boiled and flavourless and the tomatoes...\n\nOh my word, the tomatoes.\n\nCANNED.\n\nI do not appreciate canned tomatoes EVER, unless in a chili or other soupy type of food where there are a million other competing flavours to suppress it. There is no excuse to use watery canned tomatoes in a burrito. It really ruined the burrito and made everything else inside it rather mushy and 'tinny' tasting. This burrito was a real failure.
