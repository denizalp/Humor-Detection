I was really hoping something would succeed here since so many businesses have failed in the past at this location. The decor is pretty nice so the place has potential but... I'm not going to even talk about the bad food I had here. \nMy biggest gripe about any business is bad service. If you just get that right with friendly attentive staff, customers can overlook other shortcomings. \nWell at Neche the bartender acted like we didn't exist. There was only about 4 people in the whole place besides my friend and I. The bartender spent the whole time on the other end of the bar talking. When we could finally get his attention to order something they would mess up the order. Then we had to wait another 30 minutes to get his attention again so we could get the order fixed. I'm pretty sure this is the worst bar tender I've ever seen. \nI wonder how it is in the evening when it's busy. Early in the day it's a ghost town... With bad service.
