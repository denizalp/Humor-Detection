After my last visit the owner had contacted me to come and give another chance. I was unhappy last time on the way the nail tech had filed my nails with acrylic on and the fact that some nails were uneven. The owner stayed past closing and personally did my nails for me. I had asked for coffin shaped nails last time and even showed her a picture of my nails and the shape wasn't even close. I still liked the shape but this time Kevin actually shaped them like coffin nails. The gel was beautiful and he took his time to make sure the were exactly what I wanted. If you come to Buddha Bar ask for Kevin or schedule your appointment with him you will be very satisfied. I now know who to go to when I want my nails exactly how I want !
