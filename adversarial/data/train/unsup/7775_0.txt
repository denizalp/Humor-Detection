suuuuuper cheap good eats. they'd stay open late for our fellowship group on Friday nights. So nice! i enjoy the visual stimulation from the food pictures on the walls (helpful if you're not familiar with what \"sunshine pork\" looks like... ), as well as the fact that they \"would not add MSG.\" The typos typical of Asian menus are quite endearing here. The staff here is also SUPER nice. \n\nThe House special fried rice is reallllly good... and actually, i haven't met a dish here that i didn't like. Granted, it's not THE BEST food i've ever had, but it's good, and did i mention how cheap it is? I think almost everything is under $6. It's fun because the menu also offers a bit of a variety of different asian cuisines. \n\ni recommend the beef stew curry. mostly because it comes in its own little mini wok, which is SO FREAKIN CUTE! oh yeah, it tastes good too.
