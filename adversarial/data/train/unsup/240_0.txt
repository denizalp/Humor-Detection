In fairness to these guys, I tried them out again after about 4 months since my last visit. The negatives that stood out for me were that the service was a bit slow and there was a rancid stench in the air almost like raw sewage.\n\nWell im happy to report that the smell is gone and the service is much better now.\n\nAs usual, I got the Pastrami Burger along with Chili Cheese Fries that me and the fam shared. For you newbies, just get the Pastrami Burger. It's the best of both worlds. It's a huge burger and with the meal they give you a lot of fries.\n\nNot sure about the drive thru for I havnt tried it out yet. I remember the first few weeks these guys opened, that the service was really slow and that some folks actually waited about 40 minutes to get their orders. I think that has been worked on for I dont really see any recent reviews in regards slow service at the drive thru.\n\nKeep it up guys! Who knows, maybe the next time I go, I might be even more impressed and have to do another update.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #143 \"Aint nuttin wimpy about the Pastrami Burger!\"
