I can officially say that after living in Las Vegas on and off for the past 12 years I can finally cross this off my list. I had the Peppermill patrami burger. I ordered it medium rare it came out medium well. The drink service took forever and my wife's eggs Benedict were mehhh! I will visit again but only if entertaining people from out of town that would like to visit for nostalgic reasons. Check it off the list. Been there done that nothing special in my opinion.
