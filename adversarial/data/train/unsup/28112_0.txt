We stayed at the hotel and since it was late we decided it would be easiest to eat at the in house restaurant.\n\nWhen we sat ourselves the servers ignored us for about 15 minutes, one of the servers actually just glared at us while he was serving a difference table(the only other table in the restaurant mind you) so we weren't holding out much hope. We were just getting ready to leave and try somewhere else when a different server who had been mixing drinks at the bar approached us. She was apologetic and pleasant. She promptly took our orders and brought us drinks.\n\nEveryone at the table got burgers, I got the stampede BBQ burger, my husband got the flames burger, my sister got the veggie burger and her boyfriend got the chinook burger. Cute names for burgers. \n\nThe guys got onion rings with their burgers which were delicious, but fairly sparse for how much more they charged extra. \n\nEveryone enjoyed their burgers, my sister said the whole corn kernels in her veggie burger were a little strange but she got through it, and said it was pretty good for a veggie burger. The patties of the real burgers were great, a non-premade patty makes all the difference.\n\nThe prices were pretty average, I'd probably go here again if I were staying at the hotel, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there for dinner.
