This place is a must if staying at the MGM! The staff are very friendly and efficient. \nThe bar has open seating which is great for stopping by to grab your favorite drink or meal. The restaurant seating is huge as well and there's great music so if you're looking for a nice dinner spot before you hit the casino or club floor, definitely give this place a try. \nThe pearfect martini is incredibly refreshing & flavorful. If you have time for dinner, try the carmelized cauliflower and house made gnocchi. Both dishes are fantastic and just the right portion size. Even though those are the only two dishes I've tried, everything else I've seen looks equally impressive. \n\nI even received a coupon for a temporary membership to check out house recipes online!
