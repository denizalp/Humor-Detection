The overwhelming impression of our meal here was how darn cold we all were from the overblown AC on the top floor. Really it wasn't that hot outside. \n\nAnyway, the food here was decent. The fried cheese curds were average but the jerk pork tacos were quite tasty. Others in our group liked their meals but again their taste buds may have been frozen!  \n\nOn the plus side the old fashion was well made and the service was good.
