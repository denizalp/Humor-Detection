Let me make this short and sweet. I wish I could give zero stars. \n\nCorporate was called from this visit couple weeks ago. I never do that. Ever. \n\nI witnessed staff calling a customer names such as liar, a bitch, and an asshole. The staff, including the manager, was yelling at this gentleman, pointing their finger at his face, and laughing. The man was asking for something in his order they forgot. Whether they really did or not is not the point. Their unprofessional attitudes took it to a whole new level. People were leaving the restaurant because of staff's reaction. The manager ended up wearing the rest of the mans order...that's how far they pushed him...over an item that was $2.50. Hhhmmm\n\nMy turn...they wouldn't let me use my rewards coupon and I'm not sure if it was because they were now upset they had to clean up a mess or what but the same staff kept loudly telling me I couldn't use my free coupon. The email CLEARLY states the codes to enter to use it. At one point the manager asked me if I was a boy because they email from ThEIR headquarters had a mans name on it. (It was an example on the coupon.)She said since I wasn't a boy that email wasn't mine. Omg. The combined IQ was about 4...no wonder they couldn't figure out the coupon. \n\nI have never seen such disrespect in my life in a business. Corporate offered me a free $5.00 coupon for my trouble. Are you kidding me? Another coupon to try and use with rude and incompetent staff...yeah right.
