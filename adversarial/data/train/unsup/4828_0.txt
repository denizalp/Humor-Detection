I'm a firm believer that cooking an egg should take longer than 30 seconds. Also, it should not be formed in a perfectly round and oddly fluffy disk. And warm cheese that doesn't melt is disturbing. And sausage patties shaped to the exact same size as the egg disk is bizarre as well. Food just doesn't exist perfectly in nature like this! It's wrong!\n\nOtherwise, the bagel was alright. Just know that the everything bagel is covered in rye seeds, which is weird. \n\nThe coke from the soda fountain was the best part of the meal. I was wicked hungover.
