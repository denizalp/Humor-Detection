As far as sub sandwiches go, Dibella's is about as good as it gets! I saw that today was the opening day and decided to give it a shot due to restaurants seriously lacking in this area. \n\nThe ordering process was a bit chaotic and disorganized but once I figured out what I was going to order, I was not at all disappointed. As a newbie mistake, I ordered a large cheese steak (which ended up being enough food to feed a small village). I am 5'11' and 240 lbs and half of this sub put me to the point of bursting. While $12 seemed a bit expensive for my meal, I quickly changed my opinion on the matter when I realized that it would feed me for at least 2 meals.\n\nBesides being massive, the sandwich was also amazingly delicious. It can't even be compared with the likes of Subway, Jimmy John's, or Quiznos. They are simply nothing alike and Dibella's is a million times superior to those places. The bread is what makes all the difference. It is soft and dense on the inside but slightly firm and crunchy on the outside.\n\nI was blown away by my first experience here and it certainly won't be my last.
