So there's this time we went to Hey, and we had 6 adults and a baby and a 4 year old. We travel as a pack see? \nSo it's been a long day, and it was hot, so we got Sangria (which is juicy, fruity & made with love!) and I decide it would be fun to play a game of pretend lollipop with the 4 year old (who is one of my favourite little people) and the baby needs to eat so his mama is breastfeeding him at the table, lots of laughs, everyone catching up on their day, when the 4 year old grabs the invisible lollipop back from me and in turn, pulls the entire pitcher of cold, delicious Sangria, onto the quiet and peaceful breastfeeding baby and mama.\nWell, you can imagine a really cute baby drenched with delicious Sangria, which of course is preferable to the reality of a 2 second stunned silence, followed by a squelching wail of a child interrupted. The baby, so mad because he is now so cold, and not nearly old enough to drink the Sangria, screams his little red wine covered head off, and we all scramble to clean up mama, who took most of the pitcher to the crotch.\nLong story short, staff was amazing! Re-seated, new pitcher of Sangria, baby and I took a walk down Roncy ringing everyone's bells on their parked bikes (hot tip to all the aunties out there, works like a charm) until he was at peace with smelling like the delcious baby covered in fruit and red wine that he was.\nI had the Rodfather (meatball sammo) which was just as delicious as I wanted it to be, with a side of rapini, more Sangria & something chocolately for dessert. The staff really saved our bacon, and we had such a lovely night (and the baby smelled good too)
