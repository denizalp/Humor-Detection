If I could give it no stars I would. Guy Fieri must have been on a nostalgic journey at this dive! The service was beyond poor and the Stromboli was a total disappointment. They refused to make a combination pizza style Stromboli and insisted we only order one of their premade ones. It was undercooked in places, lacked cheese and flavor!!! \nBeyond that...it was a TOTAL dive. Stay away!!!
