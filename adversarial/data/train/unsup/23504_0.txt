Eh...not exactly what I was expecting. Unfortunately, we came a half hour too early for lunch so we ended up just getting offered the breakfast menu.\n I wasn't in the mood for breakfast... soOOooOoo I didn't order anything, just a water. \nMy hubby ended up ordering some blueberry pancakes for $14.00 and my daughter had the chicken and waffle for $17.95 YIKES.\nYes, just one piece of fried chicken on one waffle. Nothing fancy. \nI did take a small bite and it tasted ok. Nothing out of this world. You'd think for that price they would of put a whole fried chicken on 10 waffles.\nMy hubby liked his pancakes. They were big and fluffy, but again.... not worth the price. \nI had to remember....It's about the experience. ..right?\nSoOOoo...we sat outside over looking the Vegas strip. Interesting, may I say the least.\n Almost reminded me of being in New Orleans during Mardi gras time.\n\nYeah...Nope.
