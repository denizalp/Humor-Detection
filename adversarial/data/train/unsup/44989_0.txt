Please try Salud - you will NOT regret it.  Run by two hipsters who also double as band-mates, this isn't \"authentic\" Cuban (rather Cuban-American) but the food is fresh, tasty, and the service is top-notch.  If you tried Salud when it first opened, it was run by different staff and I encourage you to give it another chance with the new management.\n\n@Curtis G and I live right by Salud, and have been meaning to stop in here for months.  We finally made the time, and we were glad we did.  Surprisingly, we were the only diners at around 9 pm on a Saturday.  Our server did mention that Fridays are usually their busier night.\n\nSalud is Farm to Table - meaning the menu changes frequently based on what local fare is available.  They post their menu updates on their Facebook page (they don't have a website).  The menu offers fewer options that other places, however, I don't think that's a negative as I love that the food is fresh and local.\n\nI'm a terrible Yelper b\/c I really can't remember the name of my dish, all I know is that all the ingredients were flavorful, and the argument for more Farm to Table restaurants is evident when you are enjoying mango that's bursting with flavor because it's so fresh.  The chef came out to check on our entrees, always a classy touch and showcases the passion of the staff.\n\nOur adults beverages were amazing, individually-made and with all fresh ingredients.  I'm picky about my mojitos, and have been known to send them back if they aren't to my liking.  Salud's mojito was cool with the perfect amount of fresh mint.  It's def in my top mojitos in the city list (new Yelp list idea?).\n\nAnd if you like ghost stories and anything with a macabre history....this is another added bonus for you to try Salud.  I won't ruin it for you.  I encourage you to ask the bartender about the history of the the previous tenant (Salac's - a bar where dirty cops used to cook the books, allegedly!).
