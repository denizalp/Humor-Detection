**Summary**\n       - Selection - The selection seemed to be limited and the food was mediocre at best.\n       - Value - For the price we paid for dinner, I was expecting a little more. This seemed to be on the level of a $12 buffet but with crab legs and shrimp.\n**Price**\n       - $15.99 Breakfast Mon-Fri 7am-10am\n       - $19.99 Lunch Mon-Fri 11am-3pm\n       - $26.99 Dinner 3pm-10pm\n       - $24.99 Champagne Brunch Sat-Sun 8am-3pm\n**Items to note**\n       - Prime Rib - The prime rib was overcooked and completely dry by the time I got back to my table.\n       - Shrimp - The shrimps were of decent size for the price. I think this is the only item I couldn't complain about (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw?select=Kp3AOIz9Ztv38-gkYZdPCA).\n       - Crab Legs - The crab legs were split and dry. The shell side was brown on most of them and it seemed like they were sitting there for way too long (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw?select=YdVxZbw2SodAIWfmfwnbRw).\n       - Deserts - The dessert selection was minimal and wasn't very good.\n**Recommendations**\n       - I wouldn't recommend this place. Stations has a better buffet for a cheaper price. If you're going for the higher priced items, Bellagio is a way better choice.
