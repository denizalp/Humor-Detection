My friend introduced me to this place \nEverybody who knows me, knows I'm a meat-eater to the core but I love healthy food to balance everything out. \nWe had the red and yellow fresh juice: absolutely lovely! \nMy favorite was the red which was a mix of beets , green apple, ginger and lemon. \nI do not have a sweet tooth and I rarely drink juice so this juice was the perfect mix of flavor: a tad sweet and acidic. \nWe had a burrito which had brown rice and tuna. \nThe star of the show for me was the tuna tataki salad and that Sriracha Lime Hoisin dressing! Wow!
