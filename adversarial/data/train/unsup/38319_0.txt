We have been dining here for over 3 years! Both lunch and dinner are wonderful. Full flavors of Thailand. The curry is my favorite! I also love Pad Thai, eggplant, pork and chicken dishes. Staff is very friendly and attentive to our needs. Very fast and reliable service. The half-roasted chicken is the bomb!!
