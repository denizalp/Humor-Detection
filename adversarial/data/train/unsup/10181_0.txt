I really like the cultural touches such as their Thai cultural attire for their uniforms.\n\nI love the different style drinks with the ice cap which is perfect for our hot summers.\n\nOn this occasion I ordered the pad thai which I can't say was great, they are from the southern region of Thailand so perhaps I should have tried a specialty from their region. The portions are fairly large though and nicely presented.\n\nThe best part was the service very friendly and I love the Thai touches throughout the restaurant overall and okay experience.
