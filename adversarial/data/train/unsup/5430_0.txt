This place is wonderful! My low tire pressure came on and really need to learn how to be more independent with my car, went to O'Reilly first and bought myself a tire gauge which kept giving me inaccurate pressures. Called Big O and spoke to Ryan over the phone. He told me he'd fix my tires for free depending on what's wrong with it. Made a U turn and brought my car here immediately. Ryan was available right away and they found a razor in the passenger rear tire. Removed it and fixed it for me for free! These guys are so friendly and helpful. I am so coming back here for any future problems. I showed the guy fixing my tire, the pressures I was getting from the gauge I had just bought and they were inaccurate. Threw that in the trash! I also tried to tip them but they are not allowed to accept tips. That's too bad cause they surely deserve it.\n\nI have to add that Aaron fixed my tires and Ryan was the guy in charge. I now have 2 places to go to, for the car I love so much. Here and Firestone.
