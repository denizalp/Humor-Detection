Sad to add this review. Just had lunch there today and was very disappointed. Food was good as usual but service was very poor. Waitress took our order, served our food and never came back to check if we needed anything else at the table. We have been going to this place for several years and have enjoyed it very much but, with the steep price increases and the service  now we probably won't be going back.
