I was disappointed how hot it was inside the stadium, the roof was closed and A\/C was on however, myself and everybody around  us were incredibly hot and sweaty the entire game. We decided to order a beer and a water to cool off from the small beer kiosk just outside our section and both the beer and water were warm, awful. We were in section 302.
