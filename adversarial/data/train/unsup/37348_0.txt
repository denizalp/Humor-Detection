Had to try this place because it has jjambbong, my absolute favorite! Once again, still no New York or LA :(. So far I've tried the one in Greenland Supermarket, Jin Mee, Elephant Snack, Beijing on S. Eastern, and 2010 (which is more like udon there, but still delicious).... nobody has a 5-star bowl of jjajangmyun or jjambbong yet! If anybody knows of another place I should absolutely try please message me and let me know!\n\nAs for the food in general, their jjambbong is not bad. It's right about the same ranking as Jin Mee or Elephant Snack in my book. It's definitely better than the one in Elephant Snack. I like that you can order a small bowl of jjajangmyun on the side and enjoy the best of both worlds. I went there with a friend and he ordered the fish with black bean sauce and it was fantastic (a little salty). I asked for my usual bowl of jjambbong as spicy as humanly possible with extra noodles and a small side of jjajangmyun to share with my friend. They can be more generous with the seafood in the jjambbong as well... I think I only had one mussel and 2 pieces of shrimp. \n\nThe service is nothing special.... it's a typical Chinese Korean restaurant in Vegas. Not very friendly, but not rude, and the food comes out pretty quickly. \n\nThe bill came out to about $20, which is a great deal! \n\nHonestly, I will keep coming back here until I find a place with better jjambbong. In the meantime, their price is reasonable and their food is overall decent so it gets a thumbs-up from me.
