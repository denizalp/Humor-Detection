10\/24\/12\n\nCrust celebrated its 5th year anniversary today, and as it has in the past four years, it did so by offering 50% off everything on the menu, dine-in only.  Glasses of wine and and a handful of cocktails were also offered for $5 each.  We celebrated by ordering a Strawberry salad, Meatball sliders http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=skLo5ITLHCYc-7KTQ097pQ#skLo5ITLHCYc-7KTQ097pQ, Filet mignon sliders http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=9NBWbmur1iGAYDRAQyfP6w#9NBWbmur1iGAYDRAQyfP6w, a Rustica Bianca (sub artichokes for the tomatoes, $1.50 extra) http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=gBqV2d_OzEapAwM7Ih7EIw#gBqV2d_OzEapAwM7Ih7EIw, two glasses of Mango moscato, and a glass of Hey Mambo, a red blend.  Oh, and an order of Warm chocolate chip cookies and ice cream sandwich http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/ApHiz1xxENwjkp8MKrE4Dg?select=85Xw1x9f7gzbpLARkjZEhg#85Xw1x9f7gzbpLARkjZEhg.  All were, of course, delightful, although the rustica wasn't as crispy as Mom and I wanted it.  No matter, as I pointed out that we can toast the leftover pizza at home and just enjoy the other items we ordered at the restaurant.  An hour and a half later, our stomachs full, my wallet $72 lighter (which included a $17 tip), and my ears ringing from the deafening noise indoors (my second complaint, which I can overlook on this special date), we left happy and contented.  Thank you, Crust!  \n\nCongratulations again to Mitch, Michael, and Duke, and everyone else at Crust, for yet another anniversary milestone, and we hope you have many more!
