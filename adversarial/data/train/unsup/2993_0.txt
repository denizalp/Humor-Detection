Found on yelp - 3 stars for decent job -2 for crappy customer service. It's $50 For the full service for 9 lb shih-tzu. I was quoted $46-49 the day before.  I didn't appreciate them not honoring what I was told or the discount on yelp. Owner, a petite, attractive older lady, said they quoted minus tooth brushing but I asked specifically about it the day before. Why $50 if told 46 or 49? She felt greedy and fake. Probably won't go back.
