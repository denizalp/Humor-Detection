Price: Very cheap at $25 for dinner\n\nCustomer service: Awesome!  Our waiter was so friendly and constantly came around to collect plates and refill drinks.\n\nFood: So many to choose from! You will never be able to try every single thing they have in one meal.  I am definitely going back to try more in October.
