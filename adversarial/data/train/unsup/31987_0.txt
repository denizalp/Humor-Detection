Best food we had in Vegas! I ordered the shrimp tacos and my bf ordered the chicken poblano enchiladas, and they were both delicious! My bf won lunch with the enchiladas - the sauce that came on them was beautiful and tasty. Not to mention, the margarita we ordered was on point. The endless brunch items looked yummy as they passed by too, but I would definitely recommend trying the normal menu items! The prices weren't outrageous either - two meals and two giant margaritas (as in the equivalent of 3 regular margaritas each) came in just under $100. Oh, and the chips and salsa were awesome too!
