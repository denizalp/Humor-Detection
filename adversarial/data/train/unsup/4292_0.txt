I live in the neighborhood down the street from McCarthy's. I thought they were a decent business until they tried to charge me $105 just to plug in an OBD to test a check engine light to see what the problem was. My battery had recently died and I was thinking something needed to be reset. I was also informed that anything beyond this (including a simple reset) would be an additional charge. I drove down the road to Autozone, got a free test and free reset. I will not be recommending or using McCarthy's ever again.
