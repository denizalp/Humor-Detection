So I went in to the store with full eyebrows only needing a clean up. Everyone was friendly and all but the aftermath was just atrocious! I got way more than just a clean up! Sheila, the \"brow specialist\" started doing my brows about 30 minutes after my original appointment time. Once she started, I thought that everything was going fine, even stopping a bit (when she walked off to get me some water) and checking the progress and it looked fine. But, then she moved on to my other brow and finished, she showed me the results and it was just awful! She had taken WAY too much on the other eyebrow and had rounded it out more. When I told her about it she said she saw nothing wrong with it but CLEARLY one way WAY MORE thinner than the other. When I tried to tell her, she started getting very defensive and said she saw nothing wrong with it. She said \"brows are not twins they are sisters\". My eyebrows now look atrocious and I will NEVER EVER get my eyebrows waxed at this brow bar ever again. This Benefit Brow Bar is most certainly not up to the standards of the other ones. Save your money and your brows from Sheila, go somewhere else.
