If you're in this part of town and don't feel like driving another 3 miles to get good Poke then, yes, go here. But really, take that 3-mile drive.\n\nThis poke place is located in the same shopping center as Whole Foods, and Edible Arrangements on Lake Mead and Tenaya. We were the only customers when we walked in at lunch time. And they had 3 employees manning the counter and the 1 chef in the kitchen. Service was soooo slow and lots of mistakes on my food.\n\nI ordered a Wrath Poke Bowl with brown rice. It's supposed to have salmon, spicy tuna, edamame, cucumbers, sweet onion, lemon, avocado, rice puffs, and cilantro jalape√±o sauce. I was given tuna instead of salmon, and I didn't get rice puffs in my bowl. The guy preparing my food took 10 minutes reading from a list and still messed up! I watched him put one edamame at a time. Portions were very skimpy. The onions were red not \"sweet onions\". The fish was not that fresh and they were small pieces like they don't really want to feed you but they just want to take your money.  \n\nI also got the Sloth Sushi Burrito. I've had better. Honestly, the only thing that was good here was the fruit water\/ juice. I tried watermelon and that was pretty refreshing.\n\nThe employees look scared\/ stressed and I don't know why when the place was empty. They didn't seem happy to be here. No smiles, no nothing. Needless to say, I won't be rushing to come back even to redeem my 50% discount after writing a Yelp review offer that they have. This place needs a lot of work.
