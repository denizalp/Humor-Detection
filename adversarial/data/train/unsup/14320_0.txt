I wasn't so much disappointed at this place at surprised at the ordinariness.  The four and five star reviews led me to expect something better. The food was okay, but there is definitely better Mexican food in Las Vegas. \n\nI had the chicken taco and chicken enchilada. They were certainly adequate but not extraordinary. My sister had a ground beef taco and her feeling was the same. I thought the sauce lacked a kick and anything that might make it really stand out. \n\nThe decor was pretty much standard and the place was a little loud. \n\nI will say that the service was good. There was a line waiting and I was with old friends catching up. I thought the fact that we had overstayed our welcome was well-handled. \n\nI'd say if you live in the neighborhood and need a quick meal, this is a place to go. If you're looking for great Mexican food Las Vegas has better choices.
