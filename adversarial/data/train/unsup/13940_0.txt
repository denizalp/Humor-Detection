THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BAD ASS POOL ONLY!!!!! (You have been for warned) - \n\nPROS - - \n\nBig beds (king size?) with lots of pillows to catch rays on! Some covered with TVs and ceiling fans in em! oh yeah. My fav beds are the ones in the middle of the pool area. Under the rows of palms. Lotsa pillows! \n\nREALLY great music played from speakers over head in palms. \n\nLg. teak lounge chairs w\/ cushions to, ya know LOUNGE!! \n\nCocktail servers that are fast and friendly! Yay! \n\nChic pool and sandy beach w\/ lounges you can drag in the water w\/ sandy floor. \n\nWater pads you can lay on lounges in like 6 ins of water - in the pool! \n\nVery cool bar! Air conditioned. Sells sunscreen and glasses! \n\nGreat menu w\/ yummy salads, wraps, frozen grape bowls, hagen-daz bars, nachos like no other! \n\nREALLY soft stripped personal cushion lounge beds right along the pool. \n\nBeautiful girls! They hand out summer passes to Hooter girls, show girls, strippers. Straight up hot bitches. \n\nLocated next to spa. \n\nGreat lush landscaping. \n\nMisters in all the trees and cabanas. \n\nCONS \n\nCabanas are over priced and over rated! Far from main pool. Much smaller and slimmer \"VIP\" pools. Did I mention its a waste of $$$? \n\nSometimes the towel girls can be bitchy (must be the heat). \n\n\n\nThey have outdoor concerts and events at night that rock! I saw LL Cool J in a summer concert here! It was soooo good! The stage was over the pool and their were people in bathing suits, dresses, pants! LL looked and sounded AMAZING!! They pour heavy on the alcohol and security is pretty calm. They were very 420 friendly and didn't hassle me and my GF (who was waaaassssttted!!) If i could give it 10 stars - I would! Many great memories were made here by me and my girls! Its been too long - must go back asap!
