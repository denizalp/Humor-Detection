Complete garbage. No shepherd's pie. No redbreast. I got a mediocre burger with 2 quarter slices of bacon, because Irish wasn't an option.\nI also got a very small shot of thin Midleton Rare for $28. And a black and tan (but no Harp....just Smithy...because they don't have Harp either).\n\nWhat a shit show. But the staff talks in an accent...so just throw your money on the ground, get a limerick, and walk away. Soul is a block down.\n\nI won't be back. Irish my ass.
