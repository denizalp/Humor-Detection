Meh is right.  We sat up at the bar so we could watch football on their 2 TV's there.\n\nI will say the bar staff is very friendly\/attentive and will try to strike up a conversation with you. The music, surprisingly, was really good. The decor is right on for a higher end sushi place that also boosts a very nice selection of moderately priced Sake [me=fan].  Got a bottle of sake for under $40 700 ML #score.\n\nOrdered a spicy tuna roll first to share as an appetizer. It was rather bland for me. Definitely needed more spice, rice was a little underdone for me, and overall lacked the depth of flavor I would've necessarily associate with a \"spicy tuna roll\".  It got a D in my book.  \n\nAsked the bartender his favorites he said \"Hong Kong noodles\" {under $20}. Looked it up has a mixture of pork, shrimp, chicken with lots of veggies on top of noodles. OK so I order it [no mushrooms please-they gross me out] and my friend orders Sesame Chicken which comes with Jasmine or Brown Rice, he goes with the latter choice.\n\nComes out looks...OK.  Tastes very bland but salty??? WTH?!  So I ask for some Sriracha that should help it....meeeeeh maybe not.  And then I found a couple random mushrooms hiding in there- grossie! So not my favorite meal. I gave it a D\n\nSesame Chicken was MUCH better but it's fried Chicken in a sticky brown sauce with brown rice, how could one really mess this up?  I gave that one a solid B [it was better than mine].  Total bill for 1 roll, 2 entrees, and sake $88 w\/out tip.\n\nSo what this place really needs to work on is their food and for a restaurant in Las Vegas, that's a tall order!!!
