Gigantic resale and costume rental shop. Entire selection is grouped BY DECADE!!! Thousands of hats, shoes, dresses, jackets, and funky finds. Almost everything is in near perfect condition. Men's selection is cool, but small. Upstairs costume rental is pretty run of the mill- but some good finds if you dig. Hours aren't the most convenient, but the selection is top-notch. A cleveland must-visit.
