I went there 2 years ago, looking to get into vaping. It was in a building on a Saturday afternoon. I sit down in a office. Not knowing anything about this stuff, I was listening to him ramble on. He sold me a ego set for $100. Which later on I ended seeing it else where for much cheaper. Then he gives me some free liquid from a jug he tells me its from China. I was a noob so I didn't think anything of it. I didn't do enough research!
