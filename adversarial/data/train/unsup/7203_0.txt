Ramen pork belly sliders! Caught your attention? Good, because they caught mine too. They were on special for happy hour when I met a friend for drinks here after work one day.\n\nGoro + Gun, IMO, is an improvement on what was once a gigantic 3 floor bar that was never all that full, nor impressed me enough to keep coming back. My favourite part of our visit was drinking sake out of a little square bamboo cup (can you call it a cup if it's square?). Your server will bring it over and pour it out over the glass and into the cup for you. Watch for leaks, my first cube had one, very minor, but you don't want to lose any of that precious liquid! Hot or cold, you can have your sake either way.\n\nThere are plenty of booths to hold you and your friends, though I haven't tried the full menu, this would on my list of after work go-tos downtown for an enjoyable experience and reasonable pricing.
