I've come here two days in a row now for lunch......so I guess that means I love it?\nWhen you are big fat preggo lady, you need to stay away from lunch meats. However, I figured its heated pretty thoroughly it should kill any lurking bacteria. Yesterday I had ordered the Woody. I thought it was pretty delish, but the Tabasco gave me heartburn (thank you pregnancy again). My husband tried the other half and he thought it was WONDERFUL! He said he would make the drive to Henderson to get a fresh one himself. \n\nToday I went back for lunch since I am lazy and it was a short walk from my office. I decided on the skinny dipper. It is pretty tasty and no heartburn this time! People say its a bit pricey, but I've never seen so much meat on a sandwich before. It's definitely filling and worth the price. The bread is never soggy even though its heated! Definitely a winner!\n\nI definitely will be back and this place will be in my weekly rotation for lunch!
