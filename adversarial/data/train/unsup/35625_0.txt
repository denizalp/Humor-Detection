So far so good. Delicious seasonal craft cocktails? check. Attractive and attentive waitstaff? So far after five visits, check. Delicious Breakfast and Brunch options? Praise the sweet baby Jesus, check. Dinner Menu? Um...well, hopefully they will work on that. The variety for late day or evening meals is quite limited in scope. In the meantime enjoy the scenery of the lovely ladies and gents who work there enjoy the great, open space and on nice days they open up the glass windowed walls to let you take in the fresh air. It packs it in quickly so you may not want to go at peak times such as right after 9-5pm work time or on Sundays after folks get out of church. The staff is great but during busy times even they have limited resources. Cafe Hollander also has a nice selection of cool, fairly priced tee shirts and I bought one of those and wear it often. I don't live close by Cafe Hollander but it really says something when I will go out of my way to drive to an establishment like this. I put \"no\" for good for kids because I don't believe young children belong in establishments like this for people going to pay a premium for a dining experience. Leave your kids at home or go to IHOP or Perkins. M'kay?
