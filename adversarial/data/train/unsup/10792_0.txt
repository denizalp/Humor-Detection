My boyfriend and I ate at this place last night. We left with upset stomachs and no reason to ever come here again. \n\nThe atmosphere upon arrival seemed cute, slightly hippie\/hipsterish. We were excited to dine here as we're both a fan of mom and pop places.\n\nWe ordered the Thai Tea to drink which was interesting to say the least. Full of flavor but wayyyy too much sugar and coconut cream! \n\n\n30 minutes into service we finally got our cucumber rolls. These don't need to be cooked... I could make them with my eyes closed. Not sure why they took 30 minutes but they were delicious! And the peanut sauce, ONE OF A KIND! \n\nBut then we waited another 30 minutes for our dinner to come out. I ordered pho and my bf ordered the imperial noodle dish. A few bites in and he ran to the restroom to heave.\n\nThe pho was OK. Nothing fancy. The fake beef was really gross. \n\nWe had his noodles taken off by the owner which was nice of him but In the end we both left with tummy aches.\n\nOne tip if the owners are reading this: You need more than 1 cook back there and maybe a waiter with a little more experience (the gentleman running the floor messed up a few orders around the restaurant and seemed very stressed)
