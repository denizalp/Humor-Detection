Been here a few times and every time it's always something. Whether it's the ice not being crushed all the way down or the drink isn't perfectly balance like how a smoothie should be. I ordered a orange dream machine and it came out really watery than other locations I've been to. \n\n3 stars for the effort  \n\nI will be returning with low expectations so if they ever get it together I wouldn't be as disappointed.
