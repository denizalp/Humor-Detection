This place is cute! I like any place that has unique drinks. and good food . Its not uncomfortable at all, you can sit or stand do whatever , very casual.  Ordered the Radler, which is Hefeweizen and lemonade. SoOo good. Also got a REALLy good 007 vodka martini. Every time we go there kimberly is our server\/ bar tender. She is really awesome. !! Have to order some of the interesting looking drinks, Irish nachos are criss cut fries with nacho stuff.. actually good.
