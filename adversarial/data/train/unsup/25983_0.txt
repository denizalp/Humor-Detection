I went to Cafe Tranquilo over a month ago and despite being extremely distracted and busy I wanted to give my positive feedback for the food and staff.  It was my first trip to the hotel or restaurant and my fiance and I found the staff to be extremely on point with their service. \n\nWe had Jacob as our server and he had awesome scotch recommendations along with recommending the steak special which I found so good that I returned a week later to order the same dish.  We sat on the outside patio and we found the atmosphere to be relaxed but upscale enough to feel as though we were having a special night.  \n\nI have recommended this place to my friends and I will be returning for the delicious steak special!!!!!
