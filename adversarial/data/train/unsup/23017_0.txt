GREAT place for eavesdropping.  Coffee house conversation is hilarious and this place tops them all.  There aren't really any other options to sit and meet for a cup of coffee in Tremont, and it is actually very cute and quaint inside.  Ss go get on with your bad, pretentious self, here at Civilizations.  \n\nAlso, I do stop in frequently to get coffee & a croissant, so I'm not totally dissing it.  But god it's entertaining.  The outside seating is also a great location for people watching.
