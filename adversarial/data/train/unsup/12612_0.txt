Places like this make me nervous. I'm not a very adventurous eater and on top of that I'm a vegetarian. To me,  \"Fancy\" restaurants all seem to just mix weird stuff with other weird stuff and for some reason people rave about it.\n\nCrop has their share of weird stuff  (I'm talking to you martini with a deviled egg in it) but were super nice  and prepared my meal with plain soba noodles instead of cinnamon noodles. The service was really good. Everyone dining with our group seemed really happy with their meals.  It was a fun evening and I would go back there any time.
