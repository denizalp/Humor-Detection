My husband and I made our way down to Fremont street after spending the majority of our time on the strip. We figured we would find a bite down here but when we started to explore Fremont Street nothing looked good until we stumbled upon Cous Cous. Cous Cous is located near the Heart Attack Grill. I refused to eat at the Heart Attack Grill for multiple reason so greek food it was. My husband ordered the gyro supreme with fries and I ordered a gyro with onion rings. The difference was his gyro had cheese and mine did not. I thought for an extra $2 it was sort of a rip off but who I am to judge a cheese lover.\n\nThe gyro was decent and really hit the spot to help soaked up some the booze I drank earlier. Our order did take a few minutes to come out and there was only one other couple inside the restaurant. The fries were more than enough for one person and I would suggest sharing an order. The onion rings could be also enough for sharing but honestly I polished them off myself since I was quite hungry at the time.
