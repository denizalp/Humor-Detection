Stopped in here for a quick bite before heading to Le Reve. Fast service, delicious satay and edamame (can you mess up edamame?)\nThe reason I give it 3 stars is because of the drink we ordered and the service. The description did not match the drink and for 16 dollars, you expect to get what you order. \nAlso, we never had the same server. One person took our drink order, another brought it. Same with food. When it came time to leave, we had to wave someone down.
