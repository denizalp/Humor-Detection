What? 4 stars? Come on now, yelp, I know this is Charlotte, but this is not good BBQ. Truth be told, the meat alone would warrant a 3 star review; for context, Sauceman's is the only BBQ in the city worthy of a 4.5 star review, with Midwood coming in at a 3.5 - 4. But the sides are horrifically bad. Mac and cheese that tastes like it's made with processed cheese. Tasteless fried okra. Cornbread that tastes like it comes from a box. \n\nOn the bright side, the sauces are good, so grab some to go and get better smoked meat elsewhere.
