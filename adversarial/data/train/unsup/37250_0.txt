I recently moved out of downtown, and I've been going to same salon for over two years with the same technician. If my nail breaks or I want a colour change, I've been looking for a back up. I'm particular cause I always get bio gel with shellac for manicure. And I like shellac on my toes. And the nail tech downtown is so good - she knows exactly what I like and paints the colour smooth and flawless (no bumps or ridges). The downside is it takes her a long time to complete cause she takes her time. \n\nAfter reading various reviews with salons that use bio gel and trying out a few in Scarborough I wasn't impressed. I looked in Markham instead. And found this salon. Reviews were good, decided to try.\n\nI went yesterday. All the ladies were attentive when I walked in the door. One lady took my hand to look at my nails and the other took my name. \n\nThey had a pretty good selection of shellac. I've seen more at other salons, but they had variety. They didn't have much OPI, which I prefer. But they had a ton of bio seaweed, which the colour always lasts well with this brand for shellac. \n\nThe pedicure was super fast. The paint was flawless - no bumps, smooth finish. I did a colour change shellac - again excellent paint job. The woman reshaped\/filed my nails exactly the way they were before. Which was awesome, didn't even tell her. Again this process was quick. \n\nThey had all the latest hip hop hits playing in their ceiling speakers - wasn't a bad atmosphere.  Must have been an iPod, since no commercials or announcements like Sirius. \n\nDefinitely go back for colour changes or pedicures. Not sure if I'm ready to give up the downtown location for bio gel refills. But Who knows, I may be open to changing after a few more visits.
