Best steaks in the city. The front desk area is crowded and small af but once you're in, you're okay. I'm brown and can sometimes get snooty people serving me. Not here. I felt welcome. The rest of the restaurant stared at us but f*** them, the food and service is awesome!!!!!! I had the 14 oz rib eye medium-rare and it was heavenly bruh. I highly recommend this place for that special occasion. We celebrated my girls birthday and my one year sobriety. Bless
