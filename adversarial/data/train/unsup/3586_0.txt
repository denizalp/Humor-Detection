This is probably the best tax service I've had so far. Tim, my tax preparer is very knowledgeable and efficient. He did both mine and my girlfriend's tax return in less than 30 minutes. The price for the service is cheap too compared to other professional tax service such as H&R Block. To top it all off, the refund we got is way more than what we usually get from our usual tax preparer. My girlfriend's W-2 have almost no changes since last year but she got at least $300 more refund than last year. Definitely worth trying. Look for Tim. He's the best.
