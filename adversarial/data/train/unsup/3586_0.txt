I have only tried Grid Iron during their breakfast hours and haven't been disappointed yet. The staff is friendly and pay good attention to their customers. Every time I have a guest in town, we are going to Grid Iron for breakfast. I've been 2 for 2 thus far. Looking forward to trying other things on the menu.
