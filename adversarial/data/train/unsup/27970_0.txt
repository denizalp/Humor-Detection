I would have given it 3 starts if it wasn't for the excellent service. The food is pretty good..not amazing, but certainly fresh and good salads and dessert. The butter chicken sauce was good, chicken itself was a little dry. The roast beef looked good and one of my guests said it tasted delicious. For the price these days in Calgary, I felt it was good value overall.
