This place was hell!  A friend and I who went to high school together dared each other to go into this place one night when we were driving past.  I would rather have entered the strip club from the movie, Dusk Till Dawn, than push open the black door to this place.  \n\nWe walked inside and the bartender asked us if we needed to check any beer at the door.  BYOB!  I didn't know they did that at an established business, but this place wasn't very established anyways.  We grabbed a drink and sat near the stage on some lawn chairs!  We made it through a couple of songs and a couple of cocktails mixed with the famous Aristocrat vodka before we laughed our way out.  Honestly, just go there once, I dare you.
