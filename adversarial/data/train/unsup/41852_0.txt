I went here with my buddy yesterday and I am soooo glad I did. It's a cute, cozy place with such gentle and genuine customer service. We were the only ones there at the time, but I know the customer service will still remain the same whether it's busy or not. I would not recommend getting the thai tea as it is really just sugar mixed in a cup for $4. My friend ordered dry curry with rice and I got the pad kee mao, I believe. It was sooooooo heavenly. I honestly dreamt about it last night. I cannot wait to go and try other things. I recall being sceptical about the place because it's not your most fanciest place. You do have to park on the street. I also will not recommend the mango sticky rice, but to each its own. We had the garlic shrimp also, but there wasn't that much shrimp. Overall, I cannot wait to return here again. Only faults were the sticky rice, lack of shrimp and the tea for those prices. Other than that, it's exceptional.
