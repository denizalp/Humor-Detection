As an addition to my previous glowing review, let me tell you what else I witnessed at Loblaws today. I was checking out with a cashier, and a manager came over to her as she was dealing with my groceries. He unwrapped a bandaid, wrapped it around her finger, they both smiled, the cashier said thanks, and he walked away. She was still smiling long after. \n\nI swear, I'm looking forward to the day when they replace the floor tiles with grass and moss, and have baby deer and bunnies nibbling at the produce while bluebirds flutter overhead.
