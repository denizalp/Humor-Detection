Best car wash & friendliest employees, such as Daniel Thomas, excellent.  Well worth the wait since we have excellent weather I rarely have to wash my car.  Also well worth the wait for two people playing keno & the video poker machine.  One guy won $500!\n\nI love the gift shop items such as pop-up cards, magnets, flasks, shot glasses, kids bibs & toys, lots of items w\/ funny quotes, along w\/ car scents & so much more.  They serve coffee & other beverages too. \n\nThe outdoor seating area has heating lamps for chilly days like today.  It's all hand wash & they do such an excellent job.  You can watch the whole process from the indoor window as well.  Conveniently located by Lee's Liquor & in walkable distance to grab sushi or breakfast while you wait, or just bring something to do.  The guy next to me is reading a book so they obviously get a lot of regulars.  From 30m to over an hour on busy days, they also offer windshield chip fixes, deodorizer & a variety of washes to choose from.  I trust them w\/ my car overall other washes for indoor & outdoor & as I sit here so does the Highway Patrol lol.  I have seen very nice sports cars here too.
