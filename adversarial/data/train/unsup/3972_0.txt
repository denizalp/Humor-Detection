I've had polla a la brasa (rotisserie chicken) all over LA and even multiple cities in Per√∫. This place tops all my pollo pleasures. Tender, smokey, fresh and juicy. Add yellow (mild) or green (hot) sauce and it's a pollo party. For one person, I recommend to either get a 1\/4 or 1\/2 chicken pollo combo.  The beans go great with the rice and order a passion fruit juice to wash it down. \n\nThe waitress is very accommodating, like a sweet Latin mother. Food comes out timely. Seems family owned but I'm not certain. \n\nThere's plenty of parking in a small strip mall. Small, cozy spot with a Latin TV channel playing in the background. \n\nThe prices are very affordable. Two people can eat full large meals for about 20 bucks (including tip).
