If your out cougar hunting and coming up empty, go to The Vig. Its like a scene out of National Geographics. I've definently had my fair share of kills here, but thats not why I go. Just like Georgeanne says below, I live extremely close. Roughly 30 seconds closer then her and my walking stride might be longer so I'd say about 7 minutes walking and 6 power walking. I am a MASSIVE fan of getting drunk and not having to drive home. Whether its cabbing it, hitch hiking, or walking, I will not get a DUI. The food here is slightly above great and below \"drop your pant and put yourself in it' amazing. The beer selection is good, not great, but they rotate drafts quite often which is nice. The staff is extremely friendly and courteous. I think I've hit on the hot manager nearly everytime I've been in and still cant remember her name. The patio is the shit! Its larger then the inside part and it has botchiball. Drinking+botchiball=funny Kodak moments!
