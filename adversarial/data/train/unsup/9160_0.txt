It seems to me that this is one of those ideas that I should have had... but I didn't. Opening a popsicle shop in Phoenix? Hello?\n\nPaleta's Betty offers high quality popsicles and ice cream bars in flavors that I would not have dreamed up. My favorite is the pinepple cayenne pepper. The chocolate was decadent. The arroz con leche was divine. The arandao was flavorful.\n\nI love grabbing a treat from Betty's and walking downtown Chandler with Hubsky.
