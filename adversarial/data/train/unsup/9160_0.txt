Great place for all your printing and copy needs. Each page is 3 cents! How can you beat that? Now I know why a lot of students like to come here. Service was pretty much non-existant, there were two Vietnamese ladies, one who was chatting on her phone all day long and another one who came to cash us out. She wasn't super friendly but wasn't rude either. I photocopied about 53 pages and total came to $1.80! Binding is an extra $1.50.
