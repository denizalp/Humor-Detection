\"Ubriaco Depravazione\" stop 1. \nThe other diners were already sipping on some Moretti La Rossas(7%) and cocktails when i arrived. I had a LaRossa(mostly because i like Tony LaRussa). The al fresco dining experience on the last day of September was just warm enough to not require heavy coats, but cool enough to wipe away the memories of one of the most brutally hot summers ever. \nI sampled yelper #*!$#!#^ 's calamari. Pretty good. I ordered the antipasto platter for us all to share. It kinda blew. Little meat and cheese and heavy on chick peas(i could go the rest of my life without ever eating a chick pea and be happy), tuna salad, eggplant, olives and leftovers from earlier diners' plates. Service was very good and interacted with our group in a fun way. \n\nI used to eat here a lot in the 90's when i had family working here, so it was nice to go back after almost a decade absence. Can't vouch for the pasta, but it is a pleasant place for a quick app. If said apps don't suck. Very casual vibe.
