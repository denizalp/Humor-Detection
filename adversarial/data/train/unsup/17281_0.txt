You should do it for the sake of knowing how it feels like you're about to fall off the edge on the 108th of a building, but I kid you not you will walk out feeling you just get ripped off. The ambivalence here is you know you want to do it, but you also know you won't feel satisfied after you do it. It's kinda like eating a stale bag of Lay's when you really want chips in the middle of the night. \n\nThe appeal of this ride is solely based on the fear of \"what if the brakes fail.\" That's what's on my mind from the moment they strapped me in till the end of the ride. There is no excitement in the sensation of falling or acceleration, because there's none. What the ride does is really to roll you out to the edge and brake to a stop (hopefully), move backwards and do that all over again. No adrenaline rush or whatsoever. Who knows, maybe when you're on this ride you'll start pondering about your life and life after death and time to connect with the Buddha or Jesus. Maybe it can be a life-changing moment for you, hallelujah! But too bad I didn't get that transformation, and I would not pay another $23 to get on this ride.\n\nDo the Big Shot though! Buy the 3 ride package and get on that ride for 3 times and you'll be happy!\n\nUh... X-Scream, more like X-Lame.\n\nWould I recommend it? YES!!! If you haven't been. There are just certain things in life you only need to do once....
