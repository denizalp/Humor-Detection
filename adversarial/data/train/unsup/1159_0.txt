The best martini list I have ever seen--the menu is thicker than the Monday New York Times. Martinis range from sweet to tart and spicy with a lot of great variation. The portions are extremely generous. After 1 I was in probably one of the best moods I've ever been in. A friend described the martinis as \"betch bomb good\". I'm not sure what that means but I agree. \n\nAtmosphere is relatively quiet and laid back. There is enough room for a party or a small group of friends. \n\nAnd on the plus side, it's easy to reach and on a bunch of bus lines (safe driving!). \n\nI love this place
