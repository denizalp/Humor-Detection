First off, I agree with previous reviewers that the food quality is high for a food court booth, yet it may not be competitively priced for First Markham Place.\n\nKashmiri BBQ caught my attention because I enjoy masala a lot.  I have a bottle of masala sauce in my kitchen pantry.  Therefore, I ignored all the discounted offerings and dived for a Masala Lamb Shank on Naan for $9.99.  The price was steep for a lunch for me, so I hoped to get something authentic and bold in flavour.  What I got was something that was 1) home style authentic, 2) bold in flavour and unfortunately 3) not pretty looking.  In other words, the food didn't look appealing, and I enjoyed it when I bite into the lamb meat and the naan.  The lamb shank was a full 6 inches in length.  I could eat it by holding on the bone as if I was eating a drumstick.  The lamb meat was tender, and the flavour sipped deep into the meat.  The naan was surprisingly soft and warm for a food court booth.  I enjoyed the naan dripped with the masala sauce.\n\nI will revisit Kishmiri BBQ to order its curry entrees.  I think I will enjoy the naan with it, too.\n\nFood only - 3.5 stars\nValue - 2 stars\nOverall - 3 stars solid if you enjoy this ethic food.  It is home style authentic after all.
