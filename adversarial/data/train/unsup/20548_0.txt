Sometimes, we all have to ball. \n\nWhen I'm looking for a one-stop shopping centre filled with nice things and horrible people, I come to the Yorkdale Shopping Centre. It is a veritable who's who of botoxed women in high heels, screaming children being pushed around by nannies and men sitting on the provided leather couches staring at their iPhones. But the truth is, I have to really be in a bad mood to notice these people. \n\nI find it hard to be in a bad mood when I'm hustling between Top Shop, Holt's, Anthropolgie, Sephora, etc, without being rained on in this nice of a setting. The hallways are bright, wide and luxurious, and sometimes even the biggest advocates for shopping local need to treat themselves. \n\nFeeling whimsical? Too bad. There is no longer a Rainforest Cafe in the mall. All of the sad faces.
