I arrived skeptical of the show.  I left completely amazed.  Be sure to grab a seat a few rows from the stage and be awed by what the human body can do.  The flexibility, strength, and skill of the troupe is amazing.  Yes, the format is a little risque but definitely not outrageous.  A sexual yet refined storyline and choreography.  I'm a big fan!
