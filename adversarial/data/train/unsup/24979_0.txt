Let me explain to you something. I didn't know, until I moved 12 hours away from here, what a magical place Taste of India really is. I also didn't know, that when I fly into Pittsburgh, I would directly be driving from the airport to pick up take out before seeing my family. Helllooo! Here is your daughter you haven't seen in over a year, she comes reeking of curries and spices every-single-time! \n\nCan we start with the fact that the service here is spectacular?! My friends and I have been coming here for years. The owners are cute and funny and we are terrors when we are there because we bring large parties and we are so excited to order an entire table of plates.\n\nWhat fills our table? \n\nBooze, yes, they have beer.\n\nBread: Chapatti (Yummy Whole Wheat Goodness!)\n\nVeggie Options:\nPaneer Jalferji (Cheese and Veg)\nDal Sag (Lentils)\nPaneer Makhni (Cheese and Peas)\nChana Masala (Duh)\n*Personal Fav: Malia Kofta (These little fried vegetable balls with creamy tomato sauce and almonds!) --Haven't found this one anywhere else as good as theirs! Ah! I am drooling thinking of it. \n\nWhat do they do to this freaking food? I just don't know. Go soon! Ask for spice level of 7-8 if you want to tantalize your taste-buds with some fiery food and if you would like to ship me a container of the Malia Kofta I will be more than happy to message you my address.....\n\n\nOh, and my favorite date in Pittsburgh? Taste of India and dancing at Brillo Box. So iconic. So Pittsburgh.
