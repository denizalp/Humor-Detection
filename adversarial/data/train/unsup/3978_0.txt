This was my third visit to Naked City Pizza on Paradise and Chef Christopher Palmeri keeps upping his game.  Some of the dishes we tried are evolving works for the new restaurant the chef is opening.  This place is so much more than a pizza shop.\n\nItems served:\n\nBacon candle with crusty bread\nCarpaccio\nBacon risotto\nSouth Buffalo breakfast sandwich\nHot Mama\nBreakfast porchetta\nPizza-half with pepperoni\nNutella donuts and apple\/berry compote\nCookie milk and cookies\n\nThree adults and one youngster ate here and tried some of the newer items Chef Palmeri is working on as he creates this brunch menu.  I'd had the bacon candle before but the dish has evolved so that the candle does not melt as quickly as before and the mixing with the balsamic is just about perfect.  The addition of the salt adds to the dish for me.  The carpaccio was house made bresaola with crispy caper, shaved egg, rocket arugula, and shaved parmesan-reggiano with EVOO.  The bresaola was quite good.  This was a salad with a small amount of meat creating a base.\n\nTwo sandwiches really caught my fancy.  The first was the South Buffalo breakfast sandwich.  It was cured and smoked in house pastrami, sharp cheddar, sunny side egg, Naked City mustard on a brioche bun.  Breaking the egg and letting the yolk run down the pastrami amde for a very flavorful sandwich.  The second was the Hot Mama sandwich.  Egg bread, salami, in house lonza, provolone, Alfredo, and sunny side egg.  A wonderful blend of flavors again and very appealing.\n\nNear the end, we had the breakfast porchetta consisting of cured pork belly, Maple sausage, sage, basil, rocket arugula, and lemon.  It was very tasty.\n\nThen came the desserts.  Cookie milk and cookies.  The cookies were quite good but I'm not a big fan of milk so the milk was OK but the dessert would not be something I'd order.  I'd take the cookies and run but not the milk and cookies duo. On the other hand, I could have eaten all the Nutella donuts.  The apple\/berry compote served with the donuts was not needed but was very good.\n\nOne thing I liked about the menu was that Chef Palmeri listed where almost all items are sourced.  Not only is this informative but it shows you how much is done in house.\n\nI look forward to going back to Naked City and I look forward to the new restaurant when it opens.
