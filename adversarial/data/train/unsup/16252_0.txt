I'll start out with the good:\nThe store has an impressive stock; they carry a ton of products.  The prices on incense and shisha, and some of their bowls are pretty decent.  If you need something quick and cheap, Smoke Shack is a good option.\n\nBUT:\nA lot of their glass is mediocre and generic quality at best.  Don't come here looking for the best quality.  If you do find it, you'll pay more than you should for it.  \n\nAnd they REFUSE to budge on prices.  I saw a great quality hookah there that they had marked for 190.  I saw the same hookah online for 150 with no shipping or tax.  I told the owner\/main manager that I didn't expect him to go down to 150, but if he could go down a little bit, I'd rather support a local business.  Not only did he refuse, but he did so in a condescending manner, almost as if he was offended that I'd even ask.  Said something as I was walking out to the effect of \"everything is cheaper online.\"  While that might be true, a good businessman finds a way to get customers to spend money at their store.  Asking me to pay $40 more and getting angry when I ask if he'll meet me in the middle on price is not a good way to do that.\n\nNot only did I not buy that hookah there (bought it online, saved money, and am very happy), but I will not patronize that store any more.  If they go out of business, they'll have brought it on themselves.  If not, it's only because there are enough well-to-do college kids who don't even know they are getting ripped off.\n\nLike I said, this place is only good if you need something quick and cheap, without much regard to quality.
