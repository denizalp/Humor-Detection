C-U-S-T-O-M-I-Z-A-B-I-L-I-T-Y \n\nCheeriful owner\nModern decor\nHuge Rolls \n\nSushi Fuku is poppin.  I got a tuna, cucumber and avocado roll.  It was stuffed with fish and veggies, unlike Qdoba and Chipotle I did not fill like I was getting jipped out of fillings. The sushi chef just kept packing it in going back for more and more tuna to add to my roll.  There was a lot to choose from.   I was a bit confused as to how to order sauces so I opted for no sauce...but next time I do believe I'll ask for wasabi mayo. \n\nFun, spot, sells exactly what is advertised and lunch was less then $7.00.
