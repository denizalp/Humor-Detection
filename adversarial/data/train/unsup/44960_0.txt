The windows in our suite did not open, but I'm not mad at ya, Venetian. It was a little stuffy, that's all..\n\nWe really did enjoy the spacious room though. There were 3 TVs, one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. I wish my apartment were half as nice as a suite at the Venetian.\n\nThe 24-hour cafe downstairs served up huge portions of well-made foods. I had spaghetti carbonara which was so delicious.\n\nMy bf's two complaints about the hotel are:\n\n1) They seem to pump some kind of perfume through the internal air system to combat the smell of cigarette smoke. (He has sinus issues, so this was a minor annoyance. It didn't really bother me.)\n\n2) The hotel\/casino has a more confusing layout, especially in comparison to the other hotels.\n\nIn summary, the Venetian, and its newer counterpart the Palazzo, have the best rooms in Vegas, competitive with the likes of Bellagio and Wynn. Every room is a suite, so you will always end up with a living room area, bedroom area, huge bathroom and 3 TVs.\n\nI'll probably stay at the Bellagio next though, because it's right across the street from Bally's and Paris, and those hotels give convenient access to the monorail. \n\nSide note: \nThe monorail seems to be the most cost-effective and timely way to travel up and down the strip. There is a 3-day unlimited pass for $40 which I will definitely get next time. Trolley is too slow, buses get caught in traffic, rental cars cost more money than you'd think, and taxis are too costly. Monorail is the way to go!
