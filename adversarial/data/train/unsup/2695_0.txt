The stores in this mall are decent, even though at present only about half of the store spaces are occupied - a combined effect of the economic crisis and a decline phase in recent decades. But the mall has gone through a renewal phase as well; at present the whole complex is clean, brightly lit, and well-maintained. Hopefully it will overcome the  stigma that arose from its past decline, and the recent appearance of several new commercial and dining establishments in the MetroCenter vicinity should help.
