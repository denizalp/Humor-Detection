this place is so packed at lunch time and that's because it's SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!! \n\ni can never seem to order anything other than the yellow curry. i get a level 3 heat. i often get it to go and take it back to work.\n\ni have dined in a time or two for their lunch special which is dirt cheap and enough food for left overs. it comes with your selection of main entree, soup or salad, and choice of rice. \n\nit's seriously so good. \n\nif you're on a lunch break you can easily enjoy a quick sit down meal here.
