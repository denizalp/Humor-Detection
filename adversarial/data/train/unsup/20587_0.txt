There are a lot of places in Phoenix Metro where you can get a good Italian sub, but only a handful where you can score a great Italian sub. Guido's is one of them.\n\nTheir subs, hot or cold, are some of the best in the area. I say this tongue in cheek, mainly because if you're from New York or Philly you'll disagree with my 'great' assessment. But do try to keep in mind this is the desert. \nWhere we don't have decent breads unless the deli is buying local from MJ or Arizona Bread Company, which they typically don't.\nThe cold cuts are Boar's heads and not imported. \nAnd the tomatoes are desert tomatoes, not Jersey sweets.\n\nSo there IS a difference, you're right NY and Philly, but once you get off your high horse and figure out there aren't a whole lot of places to choose from here, you'll eat Guido's and you'll like it goddammit. Ughhh.  \n\nI visit here regularly to restock my fridge with fresh olives, imported provolone, and Margherita pepperoni, one of the few places that has it. They also have decent homemade biscotti and pizzelles. Their homemade sausage is tasty too. Not the best, just tasty.\n\nIf you often find yourself eating at any of the chain sub shops around town, give yourself a break from the insufferable shit they call 'Italian' and try Guido's. \n\nGuido's.\nWhere in light of everything, easier (and cheaper) than a trip to New York, Philly, or Atlantic City.
