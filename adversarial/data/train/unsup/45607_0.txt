This chipotle is like other chipotles. Set up, assembly line, wait, etc.  \n\nThis particular location is convenient as I can stop by after a flight on my way to the hotel or out of town. It's got the long lines of every chipotle in the country, but I occasionally manage to get in and out without a long wait. I will say the parking lot for this one is tricky at times. There are a ton of other places to eat right there, including Burgatory, which means it can be a beast trying to find a parking spot. \n\nStaff is friendly and fast, location is pretty good, and I love Chipotle. Win all the way around.
