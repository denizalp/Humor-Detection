Small room, oversized furniture. The dark paint and wallpapers made it worse. I felt confined. The walls are paper thin. I can hear the people from the next room and they weren't even being loud. The bathroom sliding door would work better if there wasn't a gap. You can accidentally see the person on the toilet doing their private business. TMI. I know! Speaking of bathroom, why isn't there a vent? And the stupid tricky mirror becomes see-through when the room is dark and the bathroom is litted. This should be an option. We all need privacy time to time. Sure, they give you free slippers to take home but it's pretty useless unless you're a size 10. Sorry ladies.\n\nOne star for the no brainer self parking. Another star for the Muk iron straightener that I just had to order one online. \n\nThis boutique hotel does not live up to the cost. No thank you.
