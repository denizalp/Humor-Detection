I don't even know where to start.  I am originally from the midwest where all the steak restaurants are excellent.  I don't eat steak too often, but when I do, I like to find a really great one.  Well this was it!  I had been craving a good steak for quite some time.  Being from the LA area, I had tried 3 times and just not quite met the mark.  Taylors downtown was great but not perfect.  Mastros the same, great but not perfect.\n\nThen I went to Las Vegas and heard about N9ne.  I had been to the one that used to be in Chicago and knew it was great.  We were greeted immediately by friendly and efficient hostesses (unlike Lavo the next night).  Then we walked in and the ambiance was just great.  They had a bar and beautiful decor and a big sheer tent with a large table in the middle.  I think the UFC owner was eating in there.  The place had a great vibe for a foodie place, so I was already happy.\n\nI ordered the bone in filet which is apparently pretty hard to find.  I ordered it with the truffle egg on top because if an egg is good on a burger, then why not on a steak?  It was a good decision. It was one of the best steaks I have ever had.  Craving satisfied.  IWe also had the garbage salad and the wedge salad which were both excellent.\n\nOur waiter Jacob was very friendly and helpful.  We declined dessert and he asked if we would eat it if he just brought one and we politely declined and told him we were full but it was very thoughtful.  \n\nThis place is even better than the midwest steakhouses just because the decor is so unusual and trendy and the energy in the restaurant.  I don't go to Las Vegas often, but I am definitely going back to Nine and to the Palms.  I love the makeovers.
