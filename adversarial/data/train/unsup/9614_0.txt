The food is really bland and somehow they manage to both under- and overcook it. It's also predominantly frequented by the elderly crowd which is adorable, but that and the friendly service are the only reasons my review is two stars and not one.\n\nI've had a vast array of foods here: omelettes, pancakes, breakfast specials. None of which have been very good, but for some reason, my grandma really likes it. So I keep getting return visits. Maybe one day, I'll find that one dish that I can enjoy at this restaurant. But until then, I guess I'll just get to push eggs around on my plate with my fork while my grandma talks about our cousins' new babies.
