I had the fortunate opportunity to come here for a massage on the day of my actual birthday which was so nice. The spa is ravishing, seriously so unique and mystical with Spanish influences you seriously feel like you're in Morocco or somewhere in the South of Spain. Absolutely stunning and one of the most beautiful spas I've ever been to. Their outdoor private pool terrace overlooking camelback mountain is just amazing, I seriously could have spent all day there, which you are allowed by the way if you book spa treatments at the Joya spa. You can even eat lunch on the terrace. I mean it is just amazing. It was super hot the day I was ther so I couldn't stay too long but I did get to swim a little bit in their private little pool before I went in for my massage.\n\nThe girl got me right on time and we headed to our private room for an incredible 50 minute massage. It was only after minute two that I regretted not ordering the 80 minute massage, so my suggestion to you is that if you're already splurging you might as well get the longer massage because you will feel absolutely relaxed afterwards. I literally almost fell asleep which I never do after a massage, which shows just how relaxed I got.\n\nBack to the actual spa facility, it really is huge and I almost got lost on my way to the locker rooms, but there are private showers with all the necessary essentials, there is cucumber water in the waiting room, you need it, they have it. It truly embodies luxury over here. I honestly was blown away by their incredible service. My only issue is that the prices are super high, like super high, but I guess you're paying for the view. It was an incredible experience and yes, I would definitely come again and try more of their services but definitely would get that longer massage.
