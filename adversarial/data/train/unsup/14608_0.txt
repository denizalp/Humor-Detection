New to PHX ... and feeling not into much... someone in my industry took me out for a late nite bite... what I love about FEZ...its open late...and its stylish.. good music... good drinks...different salads and kisras... a trendy place for a late date... and in my career that is an important thing.. The staff is always nice.. the restrooms are clean.. They always have specials...and as weird as it sounds, if you follow them on facebook.. you will be in on the FEZ'know'... of the specials.. break your diet and get the sweet potatoe fries dusted with cinnamon..... and they serve up some kick ass girly martinis... but if you are there with your straights.. and that would be me.. then get your wine on.. they have some I bet you havent seen before... Ive been here at least a dozen times.. the only bad thing is driving home.. yikes..
