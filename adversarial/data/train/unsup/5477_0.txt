Ask for John, single ladies.. He explains things well for women and takes care of things no matter what! Also they are honest in telling you whether you need brakes or not...Very refreshing today! My young niece came from CA ready to get brakes because she had been told by 2 places in CA she needed them. However they explained to her not only were her brakes fine, but in the state of CA it is illegal for a place to let you leave without fixing if your brakes are that bad.
