This is a nice addition to the list of \"things to do\" while in Arizona. This type of aquarium is long overdue for the Valley and for those who can't make the trek to Sea World to see dolphins and sharks you now have a place to see them. \n\nBut...from my personal experience, the dolphin show was a two star exhibit. First, everything at this aquarium is spread out so in the AZ heat, we found ourselves shuffling around from the main aquarium to the dolphin exhibit which I guess is also an outdoor pool and restaurant? I don't know, it was totally confusing. Then the Butterfly exhibit is in another building! All designed as if we lived in Hawaii where the temps don't reach 115 degrees. Anyway, we waited for 30 minutes for the dolphin \"show\" to start and basically you are sitting on some scattered lawn chairs by the dolphin pool. There's no formal sit down theatre.  The only thing the dolphins did were jump up and down. So, if you have small children, older esteemed family members who have never seen a dolphin or for those who can't make it to Sea World and have never seen a dolphin, then this is your place. But we ended up leaving after 15 minutes of the same routine.\n\nThe main aquarium was immediately intriguing. Upon entering we were asked to go to the bathroom!  Yes, go do it! Instead of a mirror over the sink you get an up close visual of the shark tank! Super cool!\n\nThey do have a snack bar, so we grabbed a quick bite (hot dog, chips) and lots of places to find souvenirs.\n\nA little moving theatre has a cool show of some sea lions so don't miss it. Its not the cheapest activity to do in town but overall we will be back and hopefully do the dive in the tank.\n\nUpdate: management was kind enough to respond to my review which I always appreciate. So FYI the dolphin and butterfly exhibit are different companies and are not affiliated with the aquarium.
