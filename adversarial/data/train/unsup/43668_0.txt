Overall, I like the place. The food is reasonably priced for Vegas. I'd go back. \n\nWe sat in the bar area as they have a number of couches and tables. The service staff there is excellent. They are working hard and constantly moving. Very attentive.\n\nFood:\nGet the fried chicken - it is great.\n\nThe mac and cheese is very good as well. \n\nDeviled eggs were ok.\n\nGreen beans were ok. \n\n\nThe beer selection is good with a number of micro-brewery selections.\n\nIt's a bit loud in the bar area so it can be hard to talk.
