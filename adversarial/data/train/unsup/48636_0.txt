I've always loved Texas Roadhouse where ever I go because they're very consistent with food quality and service. They have great food at reasonable prices.  The atmosphere is always fun too.  I've been to almost all of them in the east valley and it's our go to for dinner and drinks before concerts on the west side. This particular establishment has the same food quality and service but's freezing inside!! My food got cold right away because the fans are on so high the cold air blows your napkin around.  And it doesn't matter where you sit.  The place in an ice cube.  I asked the bartender and a hostess if there was anyway to lower the fans and vents but it was no help.  \nThe draft beer is ice cold and served in chilled mugs which would have been nice to enjoy if I didn't feel like i was sitting in a cooler.  We live in always sunny Phoenix but that day was about 67 degrees outside and inside felt about the same. I looked around at other customers and I could tell they were cold as well.  Later we went to visit with some friends and they told me that this Roadhouse is always freezing inside and to that they bring a hoodie when they go there.  I'm not kidding! \nSo the food was great even though it cold before I could finish it and the service was nice but I doubt I will go back to this restaurant unless I'm wearing proper cold weather clothes.\n JAH
