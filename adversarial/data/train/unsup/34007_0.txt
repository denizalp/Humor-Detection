I'm not sure why it took me 10 years to try out the Rio Seafood Buffet...cause of all the Vegas buffets I've tried, I notch this one at the top of my list.  All the lobster tails you can eat ( some were small but who cares just eat double) crab legs, crab claws, etc, which were all dunked in a nice bath of drawn butter!  Hmmmmmm!  They also had other selections other than seafood such as prime rib, Asian entrees, pasta, and much more, which were all good as well.  The overall size of the buffet was a bit smaller than other buffets, but here quality surely surpassed quantity.  \n\nOverall, good food, good overall price, and good service.
