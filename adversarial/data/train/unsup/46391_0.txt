Beware-- Need someone to get back to me ASAP... So I booked this trip and I typed in promo and now I'm being told the promo isn't even showing up. Agent #6724 Ron in call center said I must not of typed the SAVE50 promo and I should have because i would of got $50 off plus 2 buffets per day. Then to top if off the total is now $250 cheaper.. This has been a mess with you guys from the start. I booked and canceled within 24 hrs and it wasn't canceled. Also was conveniet that call wasn't recorded per people that work there. I'm tired of getting screwed over by you guys. i want something done about this. i atleast want the $50 off and free buffets or be able to cancel with no fees and just use for future travel considering I travel with you guys all the time.
