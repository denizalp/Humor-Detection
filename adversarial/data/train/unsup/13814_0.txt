If you couldn't get in to crowded Caf√© Mediterranean, you probably wound up at one of its sister locations; this one is located two buildings down. Similar atmospheres, similar food and drink menus, prices are about the same. Although, for the summer, La Brava offers sheesha (shisha? It's not an English word, so spelling varies) for $9.95, but expect to spend a minimum of around $15, since you can't sit down without ordering a drink (water doesn't count), and drinks start at $4.50. \n\nIt's not bad, even though the waitress struck an attitude when we wanted to sit in one of the corner seats, rather than the crowded middle section she was trying to jam us in to. She dropped it when we told her we were going to be joined by a couple. Service here is slow, despite getting served by 3 different people; don't expect to get refills (paid or otherwise), and fully expect to ask for your glass of water 2x. \n\nSheesha flavors vary, I usually opt for the mango or berry flavors, but they were out of pomegranate for the night and the coconut sounded good. I wasn't disappointed. There's no alcohol here, but you can get either tea, juice or a virgin cocktail. What I do appreciate about the service is that they don't rush you out the door, so you can sit and relax with friends and talk in to the wee hours without someone side-eyeing you for copping your squat and only ordering one drink.\n\nHey, I would've ordered another if I had been asked by the server. :)
