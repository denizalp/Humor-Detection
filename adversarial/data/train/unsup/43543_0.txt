Since Wana did me the honor of writing a long review, a could cut mine short (see Wana L.).  Went here for my bachelorette dinner and the decor and ambiance was very chic and modern.  It's a pretty small restaurant, but we got the best seats right alongside the window (with no glass) to observe passerbys or for them to observe us 12 girls.  The food was family style and we had ordered boky choy, kung pao shrimp, mongolian beef, ma pao tofu, and penang noodles.  My favs were the mongolian beef, penang noodles, and the kung pao shrimp.  Portions were pretty big.  My friends also loved the bok choy but wished they would cut the pieces a bit smaller because they were hard to chew.  If you like PF Changs, it is similar to that type of \"Chinese\" cuisine where it's an attempt to recreate Chinese dishes with a modern twist.  Service was A plus and I even received 2 complimentary desserts: coconut ice cream and a mango pudding\/custard. I don't like coconut and the mango dish was confusing - some of the party said it tasted like \"refrigerator\".  If that sounds confusing, imagine something you left uncovered in the fridge for a few days.  In any other city, this might stand alone because of the concept and decor, but here in Vegas it's not quite cutting it.
