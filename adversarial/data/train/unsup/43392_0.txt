My husband and I came here because it had amazing reviews (and quite honestly, we had a coupon). We were promptly seated in a lounge area and ordered the chicken and waffle and watermelon plate with a side of fries. The chicken was crispy and moist, but watch out for all the little bones! The waffle was also pretty good too. I love chicken and waffles, but thought this place didn't stand out from any other places I've been to across the nation. The hint of mint in the watermelon was nice and refreshing though!\n\nThe food came out quickly and the staff checked up on us frequently (though water refills were scarce).\n\nOur favorite part of our lunch was the water glasses. We ended up finding them online and restocking our kitchen at home with them because we liked them so much.
