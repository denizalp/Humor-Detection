We came here about a month after they opened.  The place was clean and the decor was very tasteful.  The staff was nice, but the food was just awful.  Perhaps we are spoiled by being from Seattle, where some of the best Thai food in the country is available. \n\nAnyways, to continue this short review of Gaati . . . \n\nWe always start our test of a new Thai restaurant by ordering two dishes:  Tom Kah Gai and Chicken Pad Thai.  Here, the Chicken Pad Thai was greasy, burnt, oily and salty..  \n\nThe Tom Kah Gai was awful.  They used milk or cream in it, which does not belong in this dish normally made with coconut milk.  Not only did it have milk or cream in it, but it  had actually curdled!. It was nauseating.  We suspect the cook had some semantic confusion between the word \"milk\" in coconut milk and actual milk.  \n\nWe didn't finish the food and never went back.  We were very disappointed.
