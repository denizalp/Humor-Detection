Love this bakery..it's actually the only Korean bakery I go to. The lady is always so sweet and happy and the interior is warm cute and comfortable. I love the tapioca bread which is a chewy plain bread.and the custard filled bread is my boyfriend's favorite. We also get the shaved ice all the time. Oh and small downside is you have to pay cash unless your purchase is over $20.
