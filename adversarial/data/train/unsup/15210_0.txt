Wow, only one review? Ok... I'm not surprised.\n\nWhen my friends first got there, they asked, \"When does this place get busy?\" and the bartender said, \"It doesn't.\" When the rest of us showed up, the doorman said, \"Oh thank god, PEOPLE!\" \n\nEnter a room, split level, decorated to look like a mid-70s crack den. Red walls with faux brick lay \"crumbling\" away from them, mismatched bar stools and velvet couches, some odd glass closet in the corner that at no point in the night shows its purpose, and a DJ table... But no DJ, just a burned mix CD playing on repeat on the overhead. (Hey! Whitney Houston! *45 minutes later* Hey! Whitney Houston again! *45 minutes later* Hey! ...I think I've been had. *45 minutes later* Goddamn, if I hear Whitney Houston one more ti... Damn it)  \n\nAt the bar stands a tall glass of water imported from Hungary, tanned and clad in nothing but itty-bitty, tiny-winy black panties aaaaand the two people you're meeting... And no one else.\n\nThe draw of the place, if you're not a dive bar devotee like myself, would be the CHEAP drinks and friendly service. 2 for 1 specials until 3am. We partook in Tequila Sunrises (2 for $6), Surfers on Acid (2 for $5) and something yellow that we got two of and paid $4 for. All poured heavy and poured immediately, OBVIOUSLY, what else is the guy doing? He was nice enough but remember that this IS a gay bar and he was noticeably LESS nice when the girls showed up. Suddenly the guy who was shooting the shit and hooking up the drinks was completely disinterested and suddenly charging just to take a picture with him, breaking the heart of my friend who was convinced he had met his future husband.\n\nApparently, the thing to do here is go at 9pm for the cheap cheap drinks, get plastered and stumble across the parking lot to the dance club the mutual owner loves more. We never made it over there, so I can't tell you how that place was. I can tell you that if you're looking for a mellow night away from the Vegas rush, drinks that'll mess up your morning but barely touch your wallet and feel like staring at a half-nude dreamboat, you could stay here all night.
