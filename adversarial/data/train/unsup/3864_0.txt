I have taken break dancing classes at City Dance Corps and it was super fun! The instructor was fairly knowledgeable and motivating.  The class sizes were fairly small, which was nice because most of us did not have any break dancing experience.  Expect for that underground illegal dance fighting league that I was kicked out of=) haha. The studio was small with hard wood floors and mirrors lining the walls.  It was on the ground level with large windows so that street walkers could peer in and see your moves.  I was not bananas about this aspect. My moves are a secret=) and are only unleashed after ingesting several spirits and being challenged to a dance fight. \nThey appear to have a large selection of various dance classes ranging from a Hallowe'en thriller dance series to salsa, hip hop, break dance, to contemporary.  I think next year I will get some friends and try to sign up for the thriller workshop.  They also offer drop in classes so that you can experiment with different styles and then you may decide if one is right for you.  City Dance Corps classes are an excellent way to have fun, gain strength, flexibility and coordination. \n\nI recommend this dance studio.\nBut make um understand its Westside foe life
