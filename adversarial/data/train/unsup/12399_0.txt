What are we rating here..the outward appearance of a store? the merchandise it carries? Sure Safari is not your typical 4 walls of dirty undersized cages filled with overly neglected animals....its got all the bling and flash of a store worthy of its location in such a busy mall...yet anyone celebrating this pet store and any other should do some research on puppy mills!\n\nQuebec is home to some of Canada's biggest puppy mills.\n\nBefore you decide that breeding siblings with eachother is ok for dogs, and then overpricing them while denying that those very dogs could have serious health complications....you really should educate yourself more.\n\nDogs priced for almost $2,000 at Safari can be bought from real breeders on places like Kijiji for about $400-$600 and your money will be well spent!
