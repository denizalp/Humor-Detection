ENVY The Steakhouse has always been a restaurant we passed by, heard about, but never really thought about dining at.  Sure, we heard amazing things about this place, but it's another steakhouse in Vegas.  We finally took advantage of their restaurant.com coupon and had a cozy dinner for two.\n\nFirst up - I made reservations on OpenTable.com and requested we sit side by side.  Although I do note this in the reservation, it's rarely and sometimes noticed and acknowledged.  In this case, the booth had two settings specifically set up side by side.  Nice!\n\nAfter a slight delay, we got our beverages and menus.  It wasn't too hard to decide.  We barely made a dent in our warm bread and butter when our entrees arrived.\n\n* Bone-In Ribeye, 17 oz with Wild Mushroom Sauce ($45)\n* Bone-In Ribeye, 17 oz with Brandied-Pink  Peppercorn Sauce ($45)\n\nBoth orders came with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted seasonal vegetables.  One thing I appreciated from our waiter (Joshua) was that he told us that we probably had enough food without ordering sides.  And this is usually the part where they push the sides on you, but not in this case.  And he was so right!  The 17 oz is a big piece of beef, and there's really not a whole lot of room left for much else.\n\nThe steaks were perfectly cooked rare, and tender and tasty!  So tasty that we didn't even bother with our respective signature sauces that came with it.  Rather, we didn't even care for the sauces at all.  The meat was flavorful all on its own and that's what you call a good piece of beef!  Of course, half the fun is experimenting with their three salts and seeing which one goes best with your dish.\n\nThe garlic mashed potatoes were also good, and the roasted seasonal vegetables also had a good mix of veggies which surprised us.  Different kinds of squash, beets, and mushrooms were part of it.\n\nOverall, we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of service and food.  Service was top notch and the food had us interested in the rests of their menu.  Of course, coupons definitely help in this department.\n\n4.5 stars.
