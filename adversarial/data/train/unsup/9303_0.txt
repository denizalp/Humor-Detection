One of the last few true diners in toronto and the oldest restaurant in toronto. Its got an old school charm to it. This place has been featured in many places including \"You gotta eat here\" and the Monocle guide books. I can understand the charm, but the food is pretty average. The service was more friendly than I would expect from a diner. \n\nThe system is to stand in line until a hostess seats you. No need to get a number or to put your name down. Just stand, which makes it a bit awkward as some other potential patrons don't understand personal space. You get a bill at your table, but walk up to pay at the cashier. \n\nWe went for breakfast\/brunch. My friends got the senator breakfast and I got the burger. The burger was average - nothing special and a bit under seasoned. The shoe-string fries were not bad. Prices are slightly above average compared to other diners. \n\nThey pride themselves on fresh, local-ish ingredients. (i.e. farm fresh, organic milk, cumbraes meat, etc.) The cream for the coffee had little pieces of curd in it, but the waitress said its because its so fresh... Skeptical at the time, but no one got sick.
