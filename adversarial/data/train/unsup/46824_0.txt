This was the first breakfast place we went to. It is cute and trendy! the wait was short, they have English menus. We went there on a Monday so it wasn't busy, the coffee was great and the staff was super nice. If i could eat here everyday I would. i got the steak and eggs and loved it, the French toast was a bit undercooked though. Other than that i would def recommend this place to anyone whose coming to montreal and staying on Saint Catherine
