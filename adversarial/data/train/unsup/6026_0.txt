Worst experience of my entire life. George down at M&M auto body is 100% dishonest and does not follow through with any personal guarantees he made at the onset... He tried to overcharge my insurance company and worst yet they did the worst fix ever. The repair was so bad I didn't even feel comfortable driving my car any more. The body work still showed signs of bondo applications and misalignment panels and short of masking tape and superglue he uses the cheapest replacement parts (used etc) known to mankind. He even went to the extent of installing Pep-Boys stick on chrome trim as my fender trim which didn't even match the rest of the car (can you believe it?) When confronted he had no excuse except that the car would not leave until the job was paid in full, even though any reputable body shop would never let a car back to the customer is such sub-par condition. The fact that he claims to be a professional body man is beyond me. I'd actually consider suing him for such shoddy work, but I'll let my Insurance take that course of action.\nI ended up taking my car to a \"reputable\" repair center, to get the entire job redone correctly. Unfortunately at my expense. \nDO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND STAY AWAY FROM M&M. LIFE IS TO SHORT AND PRECIOUS TO PUT YOUR YOUR LIFE IN THE HANDS OF NON-QUALIFIED IDIOTS. Just goes to show you any idiot can hang a shingle out in front (in this case a banner) and claim to know what they're doing. I guess my first clue should have been the absence of any tools in his shop and less than professional \"sons\" that all work there looking to scam their next victim. \nShame on me for not reading the signs. \nShame on M&M for claiming to be a body repair center. Someone is going to get hurt by these guys if the state doesn't insist on some licensing checks and balances. \n\nIf there was even a proto-typical scam center that gives the auto repair business a bad name, you have found the poster children here at M&M.
