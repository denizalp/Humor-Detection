just ok. MGM's number 1 dining spot is still wolfgang puck. yes, its a little fancier than wolfgang puck and more romantic, but the food isnt better. its tapas style but they charge for a huge entree style. the knocked stars are for portion size and price.\n\nservice was great! can't complain about that. they were very very flexible with our semi-large group and accommodated whatever we asked for. \n\nreally not much else to say here but just that it was aites.
