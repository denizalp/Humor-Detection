We've been to bell honda before and got our last car there and loved it. The people where so helpful. This time we wanted to up grade to a bigger car. Jarrid Gabel was amazing he really helped us out and worked with us. After we got our new car we notice they forgot to give us floor mats. I just emailed Jarrid to let him know and he was on top of it. He would email back through the weeks to see if I heard from Service department about my floors mats. He was really on top of things. If ever I need another car I would so go to him. Also the Service department is awesome they've really taken care of me when I've gone in.
