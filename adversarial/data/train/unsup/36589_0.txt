Being from California, I've never heard of this place, but we were hungry, so we stopped here for dinner. \n\nFood was good, but big! I couldn't finish. I had the meatloaf sandwich. The others had a cheeseburger, chicken strips, and a sandwich. We took it all home, with dessert! And omg, the eclair I ate at home was fantastic. Yum!\n\nI took off 2 stars for the service. Our waitress Kelsey (?) had a bad cold. She wasn't very attentive. We waited a long time for little things like a straw! What annoyed me the most was the workers (and our waitress) sitting in the booth next to us, talking loud, and inappropriate at times. My 2 kids had to listen to it. So yeah, not good service... \n\nI'll be back to try out just the desserts.
