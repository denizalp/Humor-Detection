Still load music, but we were seated in back room and music was not on there.  Good start.  We did have to wait for a table and hostess made sure we knew how long and was very helpful!\n\nHad the Buffalo BBQ Burger, is suppose to have Buffalo BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese and bacon.  Only had a dollop of BBQ sauce so basically one bit had the taste...that was it.  Ordered the burger medium it came out well...so tasteless..so overcooked.  Waitress brought Mac & cheese as a side, but I ordered the Sweet fries...she checked her slip and corrected immediately...good job!  Left the Mac & Cheese for us also (Oh So Good) Good Sweet Fries!  S had Build a Mac Skillet that was Oh So Good!  The MAC may be the best thing on the menu...Oh Yes I stole a few bites...more than a few.   Also had the Homemade Potato Chips and they were over cooked.  I like my chips crispy and cooked but this was overcooked\/fried...to bad!\n\nOh yea, the burgers and MAC come in hot skillets that meal is cooked in.\n\nIf you go, get someone to order the MAC built your way!\n\nNotice that they do do brunch on weekends.
