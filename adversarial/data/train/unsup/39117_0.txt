Mitchell's is by far the best ice cream in Cleveland. I have never had something there that I didn't like.  The ice cream is full flavored and they have a huge variety of toppings as well.\n\nThey have amazing seasonal flavors and they make everything fresh in store.  They also try to use local products whenever possible and they tell you when they used local materials with the M100. \n\nMy favorite flavor is their mint chocolate chunk which consists of fresh mint ice cream and huge chocolate chunks.  But I also love their seasonal flavors as well.  I can't wait until christmas when they have their Great Lakes Christmas Ale ice cream.
