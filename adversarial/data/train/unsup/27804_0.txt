I was always certain about Chinese food until I ordered from here. I am going to admit that I'm a picky eater, I don't like steamed chicken, just ew. And in the menu section is doesn't specify that the chicken is steamed. Once I order I was experience GRILLED chicken and ended up with a 10$ trash waste. I thought the wonton soup was delicious the first time I tried it, but the second time it was a bit too soggy. The breaded lemon chicken was ok. Tasted kinda like fish which my girlfriend didn't like because she hates seafood. The rice was way to dry for he liking as well; the vegetable rolls were just straight up disgusting. Overall it was ok. But not the best.
