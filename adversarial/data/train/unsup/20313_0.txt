Great nail shop with wonderful staff. Leslie and Johnny are very sweet people and know what they are doing. You can tell that they love what they do and their number one goal is your satisfaction. Johnny did both my mani and pedi, and I am very happy with the service I received. He will listen to what you want (unlike some nail technicians, if you know what I mean) and is very gentle. I also got some hot tea while getting pampered ;) The only downside is you might have to wait because it seems like there isn't too much staff :( but the wait will be worth it. I'll be back again :)\n\nThank you Leslie & Johnny!
