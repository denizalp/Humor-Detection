I sat down with a good friend on a cold December night, drooling for a bowl of Pho. It was cold as a Witch's... Um, stare outside. Not wanting to drive all the way to Robinson for Loving Hut, we saw this place and, luckily a parking space right at the door. \n\nThe waiter handed us menus and I asked if the pho could be made vegan and he assured me it could. With a raised eyebrow I agreed to try a bowl. \n\nI got the greasiest, nastiest, most unappetizing bowl of pho ever, and it had beef in it. The waiter came back to bring me the forgotten lemon, bean sprouts, basil, cilantro and mint, and again, I asked if this was vegan, he assured me it was. Not trusting the kitchen, I scooped out the suspect \"meat\" and just slurped on the noodles and left the broth, not sure if it was beef or not. I doubt ill come back because to this day I'm not sure of they were honest with me or not.
