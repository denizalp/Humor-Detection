The atmosphere is great. Comfortable booths and tables with cushioned chairs. A large full service bar is in the back. Great tables for large groups. The food was fantastic!  Very fresh and delicious. The presentation was excellent. We had Shrimp Tempura, California Rolls and Crab Rangoon. All superb!  Entrees we ordered were Bacon Wrapped Scallops, Red Snapper and Teriyaki Chicken. All great and not a bit of food leftover. We will be back!
