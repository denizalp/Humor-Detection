My first visit here was ok, average tomato soup & sandwich. Second visit was a whole different story. I ordered the chicken soup for takeout with a sandwich. Seriously, it was filled with hard pasta and get this...one tiny strip of pulled chicken. One. The soup also needed lots of salt. \nThe ham & cheese sandwich was also soggy and boring. I do better. \nBut contrary to another guest, I found the two people working there so unfriendly I thought of walking out without the purchase. No customer contact at all. I even asked if the chips & roll that come with the meal were in the bag so not to insult her by opening the bag in the store. Guess what...not there when I got home. \nNot ever going back.\n\n\nUpdate:  Positive.  After receiving  a message from the owner I found out the person behind the counter was not representative of the establishment and apologized for my experience.\nI went back recently for a Turkey bacon griller and that in itself was great and I was pleased with the courteous service. No longer any reason not to frequent Ladles.
