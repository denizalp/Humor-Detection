Such a little gem!\nWas working in Mesa and found this place on yelp! \nSuper cute, very small, but very welcoming.\nWe had the veggie sandwich, the pickled cabbage was amazing, the reuben, different than other rueben's but the sauerkraut was delish and homemade. Wr got chips w our sandwhich and holy cow, so good! fresh made. Kelsey gave us a blue cheese sauce to dip the chips in and it was so amazing. Not too strong, had chives in it, seriously amazing. We also got the house made lemon rosemary soda and it was so refreshing.\nThe produce and sauces are locally sourced. Milk is from a local dairy. Seriously, stop by. I heard the banana pudding is worth a try, but I had no room after half a sandwich. Such a great spot! Their brunch looked equally as amazing. Fresh and delicious!
