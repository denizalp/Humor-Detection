We just tried to go on Sunday July 19. While I waited outside with our dog my wife went in to order. \"Where do I order?\" she asked one young lady who snarled \"Over There\" and promptly disappeared into the bathroom. \nThe unsmiling lady \"over there\" then proceeded to serve the people behind my wife who she knew.\nVery rude service.\nWill not go back. \nFood looked mediocre.\n\nLADY YOU ARE IN THE SERVICE WITH A SMILE BUSINESS. \n\nIF YOU DON\"T LIKE DOING THAT THEN GO AWAY!
