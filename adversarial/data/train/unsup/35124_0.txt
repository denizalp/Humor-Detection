The Keg King West \nThis is not your average Keg. \nUpscale and a good time had by all \n\nI've eaten at the Keg all over Canada, and this is the One. I do mean THE ONE. The menu is the same the service seems to be more high end Supper club than your traditional Keg. \n\nThis King west like location has some of the most beautiful people to ever serve you food. I always sit at the bar to watch the crowd and the bartenders at work. The Bar staff at this Keg work hard and seem to make perfect drinks with style and grace. \n\nCrystal my server was a new Keg employee. When the Keg opens a new restaurant they generally take people from all the other Kegs to complete their staff. I watch this server make drinks and serve me to Keg perfection.  Kudos on her Kudos on the staff around her. \n\nNow to the meal. I ordered the 10oz filet as always. Today was medium. \nLet's start with the salad. I've been to Kegs where the salad smelt like the fridge. Not this Keg fresh Fresh is the word. \n\nNow the Steak. Perfection is the word. There's something different about this Keg. This Keg is a Keg by name only in my eyes. Hands Down Best Keg I've ever had a meal at. Jacobs is just around the corner and the Keg is just as good or better. Not as stuffy. This is the Best Keg Staff around. You deserve this title you earned it. Sorry Keg Mansion. This is a must eat experience to be had. \n\n\nSide note. This must be told. Crystal while bar tending broke a glass near the ice. She did the right thing and changed the ice right away. Believe it or not I've seen other places Not change the ice. \n\nSo to the Keg you've out done yourself with this location. best Food Best Staff Best Design in this writers opinion. My other favorite Keg in Ontario is Waterdown Ontario.
