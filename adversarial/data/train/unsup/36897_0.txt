My better half and I came here for dinner during restaurant week and were pleasantly surprise that there wasn't a wait for a table. We were also lucky enough to have visited on half price bottle of wine night, which in my book equals buy one get one free!\nOur server was very friendly and attentive and helped us navigate the menu and figure out how much we should order so that we didn't have left overs, which we didn't because everything was delicious! \nThe ambiance was intimate and inviting and I absolutely love the handcrafted chandelier that added an artist, warm lighting.\nDear Fern, I will be back for more!
