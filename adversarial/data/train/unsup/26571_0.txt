Really decent Japanese food! We were the first ones there at exactly 1130AM when they opened. Though we were a group of 6, they were able to accommodate us in the small space by combining tables. I would definitely recommend that any groups bigger than 4 people should do advance reservations if possible.\n\nThe food took a bit to get to us, but the wait was worth it! I had a sushi bento box that was beautifully put together and everything was so fresh. Everyone else had really amazing looking bentos as well. There was quite a quantity of food and we all left extremely satisfied.
