The Strip District is amazing and the prices are reasonable. I think going their in April is the best time to go because it wasn't crowded when I went and it was easy to find parking spots. I've been a Pitt fan for 27 years and I didn't see a lot of Panther clothes, jersey's, etc, but I'm sure if I go during Pitt football season, I will find some. I'll try to go back when I visit Pittsburgh, again. Amazing city!!!
