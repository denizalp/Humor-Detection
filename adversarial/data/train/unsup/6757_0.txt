For the most part a theater is a theater is a theater. They have big screens, show movies and serve popcorn that almost always makes my belly hurt. Red Rock is modern, always clean and the employees friendly. They also will show films besides the mega-blockbusters from time to time. However, the bad is that it definitely gets crowded, the concession lines are longish, and several of the theaters are small. When you add the negatives together, it means you better arrive plenty early if you don't want to be sitting in the front row.
