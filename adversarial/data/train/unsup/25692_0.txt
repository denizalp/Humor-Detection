The people that work here are very knowledgeable and truly care about customer service. I went in to get new tires for winter and the man came back and said that he honestly did not think that I needed new tires because mine actually looked brand new (he used a special tool to determine this). He said I could still get the tires, but he would feel bad taking my money. I feel like no other place would be that honest with customers, especially since most places only care about money. They are a good, local business, with friendly workers. I will go here from now on to get car maintenance.
