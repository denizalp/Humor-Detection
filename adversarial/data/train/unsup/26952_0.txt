My wife and I visited for the second time in about 6 months yesterday. The first time we thought everything was so so and this time it just wasn't good. I ordered the Euclid Beach medium and my wife got the BBQ burger medium well. The Euclid is a basic cheeseburger with the works. It was cooked a little more than medium which was fine but the bun engulfed the burger...there was a solid inch of open bun around the burger. Way too much bun Fat Heads. The meat was dry and pretty flavorless. If it wasn't for the french fries and the excellent service I would be rating 1 star. It was that bad. My wife's burger wasn't much better...flavorless and dry and the onion ring on top was burnt beyond recognition. I don't know how it left the kitchen looking like that. After the Euclid beach I kind of understand why their burgers are so dressed up...to hide the poor quality of the meat. One more thing...the French fry\/potato chip rule is really stupid. I don't care if they are \"free\" with your burger\/sandwich...they really aren't bc the price they charge for a sub par burger more than covers the fries\/chips. The rule is ridiculous and people should have a choice. I don't get the hype with this place...and most likely will not be back.
