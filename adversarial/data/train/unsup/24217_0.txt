Great for outdoor concerts on warm summer Vegas nights.\n\nNot so great for relaxing and laying out.  The sand can get annoying.  The service is sub par.  \n\nGo to MGM Grand Pool, service is much better and the pools are better too.\n\nOh and the kid who was manning the back entrance that tried to hustle us for money to get into the pool is an extortionist.  You are a douche bag.
