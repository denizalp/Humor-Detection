I came here after consulting with 2 other doctors who told us we were a lost cause and IVF was the only way. I was a little nervous since they were new but the few reviews I found were positive and all the big places seemed to say the same thing which wasn't good so I thought we'd take a chance and try it out. Especially since a lot of times you can get better service with a smaller practice. Our first consult I was quite surprised. He sat with us for at least an hour going over our options, his thoughts on what our issues may be and just answered all our questions. Since I was feeling short on time due to age and didn't want to do a bunch of procedures that might not work and still end up at IVF we decided to do IVF but I knew I didn't want to start until June to try and miss that christmas birth time frame so we started with an  based ultra sound and then offered to do clomid to start to at least take a shot at it. The ultra sound he did himself instead of a tech person which meant I could ask questions that he could answer instead of hoping the tech had the right answers. And in the end thanks to him suggesting clomid we were able to get pregnant on our first round and now looking forward to a christmas baby.  Also the staff is super helpful and will call you back and suzette is very accessible by email and would return all my emails I sent which was very appreciative. Must friendlier and more helpful than the other places. Also my medical records to went over to my OB on time without me having to follow up with them which to mean is fabulous since every other place I'd have to hound to get my records sent over.  We'll definitely come back if we run into the same issues when we start trying for our second.
