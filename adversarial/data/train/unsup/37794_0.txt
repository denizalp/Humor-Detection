A great local beer and wine store. They have a great selection of craft beers as well as wine. I don't particularly get into the wines myself but I could easily see how someone would enjoy their vast selection. As for the beers, as another reviewer pointed out, they have a much better selection than any grocery store and most bottle shops. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a good beer selection with friendly service. The staff is very knowledgeable and is glad to special order anything they do not have in stock.
