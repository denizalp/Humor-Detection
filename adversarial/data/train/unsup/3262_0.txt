Well, another miss in our search for great Mexican food in Vegas. Service is good but the food is nothing to rave about. \n\nWe're always in search of good Mexican food in Las Vegas and decided we had to give Fuzzy's a try. I should've known that it wasn't going to be very good when we checked out their website and they were advertising a sandwich. Not exactly a Mexican food staple. The establishment was very clean but I would expect it to be since it's pretty new. The food in itself wasn't very good. A few things that led to my lower rating are listed below:\n\n1) Salsa wasn't really salsa, basically tasted like Cholula hot sauce. \n\n2) Tacos were very flat and lacked substance. See the attached picture. \n\n3) Enchiladas were very sparsely filled with meat and very small in size. \n\n4) Flavor of the dishes was not at all authentic and reminiscent of canned enchilada sauce. \n\nYes, as a Texas girl my standards of Mexican food are pretty high. This place is cheaper in cost than most of the Mexican restaurants in Vegas but I can't give it more stars because of the cost itself. Sorry this place just wasn't my cup of tea.
