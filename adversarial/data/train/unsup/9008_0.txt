I opened the door to Gordon Biersch on an afternoon recently and was met with about two dozen high school-aged children standing around, looking bored, with low music playing in the background.\n\nI went to the bar and asked for a beer and was rudely told to leave. I stood around confusedly for a few moments, got the attention of another bartender, and was told that they weren't serving alcohol until later in the evening.\n\nI turned around, walked down to Casey Moore's, had lunch, drank several beers, and wondered if I had hallucinated my Gordon Biersch experience.
