I check this place out often on Friday afternoons after dropping my son off for his activity.  I find more gently used clothes to buy for myself at this thrift store than at any other in the city.  People are always asking me at work where I got *insert lovely clothing item here* and I tell them to head down to the Glenmore Sally Ann.  The staff are always kind and helpful and greet me with a smile on their face.
