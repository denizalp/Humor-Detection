I don't mind paying top dollar for a wonderful and memorable meal and this was neither. I was really disappointed with what we had.  We ordered the cheese dish, bacon wrapped dates and about 3 pasta dishes. We had the lobster ravioli, the agnolotti, and the rigatoni.  They were all bland, just nothing special.\nOur server was very nice.  I would suggest they control the temperature in the restaurant a little better. It was a little too warm for me and the rest of the group.
