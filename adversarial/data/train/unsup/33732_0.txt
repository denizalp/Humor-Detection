Cute little niche. I think the seating could be a little better. I think it can get a little crowded in the winter when there isn't as much fresh air. Great selection of yarn if you are interested. Prices are slighting higher but if you are used to Starbucks this should be no surprise, and I promise it will be more genuine, homespun, local and equally delicious coffee or other beverages.
