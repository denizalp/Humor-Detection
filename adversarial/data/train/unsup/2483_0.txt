We just parked in front of this store to do some shopping in the plaza when immediately after we got out of our car, some bozo employee starts barking at us threatening to tow from this lighting store. We were simply going to go get a sandwhich and he was talking rude to us and literally watched us walk down the entire sidewalk to the sandwhich shop \"Cheese and Stuff\". \n\nI've never been treated like this by any retail store EVER and we were even shopping!!! What's even more funny is we actually need a new lamp and this guy clearly doesn't want ANY customers!!!!!\n\nStay away from this place whatever you do as rude people don't need to be in business.
