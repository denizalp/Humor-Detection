Recently my partner and I visited PHo  Kimboss Bistro for dinner.  It was by happenstance. After visiting a neighbor pho restaurant a few doors down, we  decided not eat there when we learned that 1.  They put MSG in their dishes.  2.  They insist that they cannot put  MSG from their dishes.  Fair enough.   In the end, we were very happy to walk a few doors down the street to try this very charming restaurant.  We were greeted by the owner, who turned out to be this amazing cook.    He was also lovely and welcoming as the host and server. Even better, the food turned out to be equally yummy and charming.  I had the vegetarian noodle soup, which was delicious.  I asked if he cooked with msg and he said no because everything is home cooked and it definitely tasted home made and not packaged.  My partner had the grilled chicken.   When we inquired about the tea, he graciously provided us a bag to take home while providing us with  fresh squeezed orange juice and fruit.   What a lovely restaurant and we are glad it is not far from home.  We will definitely return.
