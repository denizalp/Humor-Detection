Went there this afternoon lunch and was subjected to very rude and insulting behavior. \n\nThe waiter had too much attitude and was extremely rude. We asked for extra naan and he said he will charge us because some people just fill up on free naan.\n\nOh btw - I an brown Indian so I guess that was the problem \n\nHad been going there for long but won't be returning again.\n\nIf you are an Indian please avoid this place
