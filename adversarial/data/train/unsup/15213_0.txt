A family-owned restaurant with a great wine list in my own neighborhood? Yes, please! My husband and made a reservation for 8pm and were promptly seated. Our waitress was very pleasant and attentive. \n\nWe each loved our wine choices - and both were reasonable for the quality at $9\/glass. We started with the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp with Horseradish Aoli. At $13, I feel this appetizer was a bit on the expensive side but, as I'd heard, the sauce was outstanding. We both moved on to a Spinach Salad with Peppered Strawberries, Red Onion, Goat Cheese, Egg, and Candied Walnuts. It was a delicious iteration a traditional spinach salad - and both my balsamic and my husband's raspberry vinaigrette were excellent. For dinner, I had the Twin Filet Mignon with Blue Cheese and Port Wine Demi Glaze. The meat was expertly butchered and cooked; the sauce was a good consistency and flavor; and, my portions of the two sides - green beans almondine and roasted red potatoes - were gigantic. My husband had the Stuffed Lobster Ravioli in a Cream Vodka Tomato Sauce, which looked a bit small on the portion side; however, he cleaned his plate and I didn't hear any complaints.\n\nOur entire bill--two glasses of wine, an appetizer, $2 upcharge on the salad choices, an entrees (which included the two sides)--was only $85. I find this to be extremely reasonable for piping hot, fresh, well executed food that (1) I can walk to and (2) can support my local economy. We absolutely plan to make this our new \"spot\" for date night!
