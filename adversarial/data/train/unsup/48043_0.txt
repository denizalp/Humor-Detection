The service department is a scam. DO NOT USE THEM! \nOur 2016 Passat overheated. The fans had stopped working. After having the car all day for the diagnostic, they called 5 minutes or so before close\/6pm to advise us it was the fan. It's out of warranty. And that they couldn't complete the diagnostic until we fixed the fans or we risked damaging the engine. The quote to replace the fans, around $1000, included 2 sets of fans. We were told that the diagnostic could be completed later. We had Bob Herbold email us a copy of the estimate so we could shop for prices. Oh. And of course we were told the vehicle wasn't drivable. Which is bullshit. We added coolant and monitored the temperature closely for the drive to another location. \nSo first thing the next morning we called Performance Automotive and Tire Center in Mesa off Superstition. HIGHLY RECOMMEND PERFORMANCE AUTO! The quoted cost was half what Berge provided. With a longer warranty on the parts and labor. We went back to Berge to ask if they'd match or negotiate the price. And their response was \"We can't do that\". Ok. Got the car (40 minutes later??) and drove to Performance Auto. \nAs Performance Auto started work we find out that Berge was over ordering parts on the estimate. One set of fan includes everything that is required. \nObviously labor is more at the dealership. BUT TO PURPOSELY OVER CHARGE CUSTOMERS FOR DUPLICATE PARTS IS ILLEGAL AND IMMORAL.  Had we actually used them I would pursue it further. For now PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM!!! And if you've gotten work done. Double check at another location to assure that they didn't over charge you!!\n\nWe will never shop or use any Berge every again. This review would be 0 stars if able.
