Came in for a quick breakfast and was not disappointed.  It's a pretty nice, family-style restaurant.  The breakfast menu has all the usual suspects, plus a Greek skillet, which I tried.  Eggs (done just how I wanted,) home fries, gyro meat, feta, tomatoes, olives, etc.  Perfectly done, great combination.  Service was good, prices are low, and I would not hesitate to come back next time I'm nearby.
