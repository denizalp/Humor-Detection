Sticky:\n\nCarpets should never be sticky.\n\nMold:\n\nShould never be present in the shower.\n\nSmoke infested:\n\nYes I know this is a casino, but it smelled smoke laden even in the non smoking floors.\n\nThe wall:\n\nWas not a great view.  Seriously? a wall?\n\nLoud:\n\nIt is 12 am.  Some people have come to Vegas to compete in an event and need to sleep.   Others have come to Vegas to gamble, drink wacky beverages and press buttons while listening to clanging bells,  while being visually assaulted with flashing lights and endearing yet tacky decor. \n\nThose people rock.   \n\nThe ones that came to  Vegas to congregate in the hallways and scream like crazed feces throwing monkeys confound me.   Really?  You came all the way to Vegas to hang around a hotel hallway and \"drank your dranks\" and knock on strangers doors playing ding dong ditch?  Could you have possibly have done that in Idaho or wherever it was you drove from?  \n\nNews Flash!  You could have done all those things (with the exception of the feces toss) the in the casino and the beeping slot machines would have drowned out the noise.\n\nSheesh.   And another thing, a statue of Elvis in the casino with all of the fingers missing and duct tape to hide the damage?  Tacky people, he was the king, not the king of duct tape.  \n\nIn conclusion.   I did not like this hotel and plan to stay elsewhere next time I have the opportunity to visit Las Vegas.\n\nPaula has left the building.  Thankyaverrmuch
