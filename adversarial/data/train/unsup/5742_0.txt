Seriously, I'd go negative if I could. I have NEVER EVER walked out of a restaurant in my life until I came here.\n\nRUN DOWN DENNYS + SENIOR CITIZEN HOME = SIDEWALK CAFE\n\nI got super trashed at XS the night before so I had to skip out on my reservation at Craftsteak. I didn't want to go there looking like a zombie. Sidewalk Cafe was the closest spot getting off the elevator. GF and I got seated farily quick. One girl taking order for drinks. Steak and shrimp dinner special for $11.99? Alright! Ok not really. 15-20 minutes go by. We are staring at each other like, \"Where the hell is our server\". Then we see 1 lady serving and bussing over 10 tables. \n\nConclusion: Forget it! Downed our waters and walked out.\n\nI tried to make a second attempt here because this is the ONLY place in Bally's that actually serves breakfast. But nope, that line was super long and I knew that line wasn't the only thing I'd be waiting in.\n\nAttempt #2, failed.
