So my wife and came here this evening, first time as they are new to the area.  We have been waiting to go and were super excited to visit.  \n\nThe first thing we noticed when we were in line was customers complaining that they didn't have lids for the salsa bar.  One of the employee kept informing people that they were indeed out of lids.\n\nSo finally we got our chance to order, my wife went first and ordered a Chicken Avocado Wrap.  When the cashier informed us both that it would be 15-20 minutes before the chicken would be ready.  So I asked what chicken we could order and he said that they didn't have any currently available.\n\nWow, just wow.  Such a huge disappointment.  I don't expect a chicken restaurant to run out of chicken.  \n\nDeanna Carter sang a song \"I shaved my legs for this?\" \n\nThat about sums it up!
