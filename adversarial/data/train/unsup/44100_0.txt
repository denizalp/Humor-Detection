Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! The only problem is that they were overfilled and we had to sit outside. We ordered takeout and ate it outside. The guy at the front, kind of served us like we ordered inside. My wife LOVED the meatloaf and the grilled cheese for my children looked outstanding. I had the Cobb Salad and it was good. I would have liked more dressing, but no complaints. I love this place and will return for breakfast in a few weeks, which is better than awesome.
