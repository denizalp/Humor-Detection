When the first words out of the server's mouth are, \"So! Did you hear the great news about Osama?\" I question how the meal is going to go. Let's leave the politics at home, please.\n\nI've never been the biggest fan of Maggiano's. Used to eat there in Florida from time to time. Sure huge portions can be a good thing; if those huge portions actually taste good. \n\nBruschetta dish was eh. My pasta was soggy. They brought out the wrong one and had to go back to correct it. The meat sauce had hardly any meat. \n\nOverall a disappointing meal. An upside was the private corner booth they gave our party. I felt like Al Capone. . .\n\nWould recommend steering clear of here. It's about the show here, but the execution and delivery leave A LOT to be desired.
