Pizza is a misnomer.... it should be called Loft BEER... this place is kinda ridiculous because its SO Cheap to have a beer here. They always seem to have a deal on something (Bud Light or Miller or whatever). Every time I come back to Ohio I end up at the loft in one of the wooden booths drinking a LOT of beer here, and I almost never can even get to the credit card minimum!  Great place to just relax and have a drink.
