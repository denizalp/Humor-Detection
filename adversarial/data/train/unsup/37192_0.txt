I didn't see half of any particularly interesting flavors I thought this place was going to be special first one in AZ and all! Their aren't any in CA either. Maybe my expectation's are too high?!?! Their website had me checking daily to see if they were open, they were a month late on their announced opening. They cater which is cool. You can mix flavors of course. I had cookie dough its so my weakness it was good I didn't have an \"O\" moment or anything. The staff was friendly and you can taste your heart out. It will be my duty to go back and have the Tiramis next time but Paciugo you let me down and now I frown. Maybe you cater these better flavors???   \nMamma Mia Apple Pie\nSweet Corn Thorntree Honey\nMascarpone Chocolate Rum\nSweet Potato Organic Maple Syrup\nMediterranean Sea Salt Caramel\nChocolate Jalapeo\nDiSaronno Amaretto Soy
