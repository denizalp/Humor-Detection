I love this place.  Frankly I'd rather go to pinkberry than an ice cream shop- and I'm not a health nut or anything.\n\nI enjoy the tartness of the original, and my usual order is a small original with mango, raspberries and maybe some mochi.\n\nSometimes I like to go for half original \/ half chocolate... however, although I do love chocolate, I found that getting a whole cup of just chocolate was overkill.  I think if you don't have the original in there for contrast, you eventually stop being able to taste the chocolate by the end.\n\nThey have a seasonal peppermint flavor that is just fantastic (with peppermint bark and dark chocolate crisps, it's great.  Also, try some pomegranate seeds... oddly they work well together).\n\nAll of their other flavors are tasty, but it's the original that keeps me coming back.\n\nOh, and I recommend the fresh fruit topping instead of the candy (except on the peppermint)... it just works better.
