Right when you walk into this awesome popcorn shop, you can small the aroma of fresh popcorn and you're suddenly reminded of the concession stand at the movie theater. The friendly staff on hand are always ready to assist and they offer various samples.\n\nOverall, the layout reminds me of Cracker Barrel's retail section with sports memorabilia items around the store. I was quite pleased with everything that I sampled. Especially the Cinnamon Toast flavor. It was light and consistent with a perfect balanced taste of cinnamon powder, sugar, and butter. I would come back for this particular popcorn. I also really enjoyed and would recommend the white cheddar and sea salt caramel.\n\nPro Tip: Makes a cool gift idea! Especially for sports fans, family gatherings, parties, and company functions.
