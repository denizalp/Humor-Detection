Dr. Bessie Campouris is a really great doctor. She is very patient, kind and caring. I went to the same eye doctor my entire life before moving to Arizona and I have been a patient of Dr. Bessie's ever since. I am very glad I decided to follow her to her new office here at Paradise Valley Eye Care and look forward to my future visits. I highly recommend her for any eye care needs!
