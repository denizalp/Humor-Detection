I have been there SEVERAL times. Sat at the bar as well as tables they are quick with drinks (soda n a bottled beer) but, the food ALWAYS takes SO long. The server\/bartender came by several times to check on us but, no food. The owner\/manager was even there and gave us a discount because there was a problem with our food. A few hours later we were sick!!! It has happened EVERY time we ate there. I will NEVER go back,  unless I need to loose a quick 5 pounds.
