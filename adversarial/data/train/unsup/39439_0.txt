We had high hopes for this place... Great concept BUT horrible horrible service! Over and over and over again we tried this place and every time AWFUL service! Who has 8 bartenders behind the bar and 6 people at the bar and no one can get a drink? While one of the bartenders drinks a redbull, people wait to be helped. So we try again and sit outside at a table, once again no one would acknowledge us for (not exaggerating) almost an hour. No one would ask us if we needed a drink or food. Servers walk by over and over again. This place is a JOKE! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible service! An amazing concept... Great outdoor seating, great setup, this place honestly has a lot of potential.... But management needs to Fire their whole staff and try again!!!! Sadly a disappointment.
