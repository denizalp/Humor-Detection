As soon as I walked in the door someone offered to help me. The estimator offered to take my car in the back and attempt to buff out the scratch on my car before he estimated it. He said that this may solve the problem with no paint work needed. He said that if it did solve the problem he wouldn't charge me. Even if it doesn't solve the issue, I will use Kales just for that reason alone. I like a company with a heart, and a helping attitude.
