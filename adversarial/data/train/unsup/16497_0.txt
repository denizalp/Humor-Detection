I feel that breakfast food can sometimes get repetitive. It's generally the same thing in different forms. Waffles Incaffeinated has put a fun twist on breakfast food. When I showed up there was no wait which I was thankful for. I'm impatient and almost never stay at a place where I have to wait or can't make a reservation. \n\nI started with a gingerbread latte which was perfect!! I will forever compare all gingerbread lattes to theirs. For my main dish I went with Breakfast Magic. It was a savory waffle with eggs bacon cheese green onions and some sour cream. I also got a side of pico de gallo. It was great. I do wish the egg would have actually been scrambled and not like an omelet with nothing on it. If I'm wanting a waffle this is a place I wouldn't mind visiting again.
