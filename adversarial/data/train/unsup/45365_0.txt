The Soup in a Bread Boule is hands down the best, tastiest invention ever!!! Sooooo delicious. I would recommend the Potato Cream Cheese!!! \nWe usually order from the office, and this time around I wanted to actually come by the restaurant. Laura took care of me and she was soooo polite and pleasant. I love good customer service! Thank you guys for the great food and an unparalleled customer service!
