Meh, not impressed. It's like an Aldis but without the surprising European chocolates and other food products. True, it's very cheap. But the selection is pretty limited, especially the produce. Very, very basic. Good if you don't have to follow a gluten-free diet and need just the essentials. Also, the atmosphere kind of gave me the willies. Not the store in itself but some of the customers. For what it is, I'm sure it works well for some people. I just felt that it didn't suit my needs well.
