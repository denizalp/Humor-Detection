We came just after 10 and we and two other people were the only ones there. \nThe music was better than most other clubs I've been to in the area and the drinks were cheap (although a little hit and miss content-wise) so we gave it  a better chance. \nHowever we stayed til 11:30 and no one else came in.. so we left to find somewhere busier.
