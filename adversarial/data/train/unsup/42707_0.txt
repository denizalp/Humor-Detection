I had so much fun at this place! It really brings out the inner child in you but it's not only for children. Plenty of adults painting away, working on their masterpieces. My friend made an owl mug and I made a cow bank. It's pretty straight forward, you pick an item or two from the several clay moulds they have, then you select the colours you want to use, pick up your tools, and start painting. If you're anything like me and need some time to get those creative juices flowing be prepared to spend a couple hours there. It's on the pricier side so I'm not sure how frequently I would go back, but it's a great experience so I would definitely recommend you try it at least once.
