Let me start off by saying thank you so much Peter!! I love my nails! It's really hard to find someone who does nails exactly like you ask. I'm very picky about everything. From good customer service to precision. I've been looking for a good nail salon close to home and now I've found one. I don't like to be haggled to try other services while I'm in a nail salon, which most places do. But here, you ask for what you want and you get what you want. It's very quaint, they offer you something to drink (which is always nice) and they're very friendly. Because of work I need my nails a certain length. Peter actually takes the time to do your nails just the way you want them. Once again .... thank you!!
