Mom's Teriyaki is a must try if you're looking for authentic Japanese food! My bf, niece and I found this hidden gem sparingly driving around town. I ordered the beef bento box which is a perfect portion for anyone. It came with salad which was fresh and the dressing was a sweet creamy texture. It also came with miso soup which had the right amount of saltiness not the overwhelming seaweed taste. The bento box consisted of California rolls which tasted like any other Cali roll but the tempuras  were all nicely battered with a nice crisp. The beef teriyaki was SOOOO DELICIOUS! tender and just the right amount of teriyaki sauce but I think my favorite not pictured because I took bites from my nieces box was the salmon! It was perfectly glazed and the sides were nice and crispy and the fish was not dry very very juicy and flavorful. I will definitely be coming back very soon!
