A free coupon in the mail coupled with not wanting to drive for food lead me to give ClusterTruck a try. Although the concept itself isn't new , the value in it is perfectly seen through these use cases. \n\nThe menu is very extensive with choices from pizza to tacos to chicken and many others. Also I'd say the food is fairly priced. I ordered the \"tot-chos\"(tater tots with nacho toppings) along with a cheeseburger. The ordering interface is very user friendly. You select your food item along with all the toppings you'd like to include. Once I clicked submit on  my order it only took about 20 minuets for it to arrive at my location. The food was still very warm and also the food itself was actually very good quality. The convenience factor added with the actual food quality makes this service a good choice I'd recommend. I'll certainly give this place another try and I look forward to trying some other items on the menu.
