Breweries are popping up like mushrooms or whack-a-moles around town. Most of the time I would rather drink a High Life in a dark hillbilly bar instead of shelling out a lot of money for beer that tastes like my weirdo friend made it in his basement. I did the flight of beer at Noble Beast and enjoyed each one. I love the location. I used to work at Cuyahoga County Child Support in the welfare building at 17th and Superior. This place would have been useful at that time in my life. I was drinking heavy to deal with the stress. I am still drinking heavy to deal with stress, just of a different source. Noble Beast is located on the outskirts of downtown. Very close by to Crazy Horse. This patch of town makes me think of the Springsteen classic \"Darkness on the Edge of Town.\" I admire them for opening here instead of the near or west side in general. If you build it, they will come. The food here is great. The Polish Boy and burger blew my mind. They made a salsa with watermelon that was also inventive and tasty. The staff enthusiasm level was also encouraging. They believed in their product. I do too and will return.
