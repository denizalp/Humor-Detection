My company ordered food from here and it was just sad. One bowl had very little rice and the fruit was way to hard to eat. Another bowl was short of rice. I just think if one is paying $13 a bowl it shouldn't come poorly made. Called back and tired to explain and only thing was said was I'll talk to my cooks. Never once asked if we would like it remade or anything. Plus the guy said, no their is no manager here today. Very unsatisfied.
