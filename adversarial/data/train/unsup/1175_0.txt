This Port of Subs was located right next to our Gate at McCarran Airport. We were running on empty stomachs and wouldn't be eating for another 2 hours, so a Port of Subs breakfast it is! They have bakery items sold by Mrs. Fields, and we opted for two chocolate croissants ($3.89 ea.). They tasted artificial and I couldn't scarf down the last two bites of my croissant. I asked for a cup of water and was basically told the only option available to me is bottled water ($3.49). What is this, Encore beach Club?? A bottle of coke was $3.19 - in what world is water more expensive than soda? Criminy! All in all, this paltry meal set us back $15.63. There's no seating available, just a few high-top mini tables to stand around. Should've ate at the Burger King instead.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #197
