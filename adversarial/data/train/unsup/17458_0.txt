This is by far one of the best bakeries in Las Vegas. I appreciate the great quality of baked goods and the selection of bakery items for sale in their display case. I also don't appreciate the selection and quality because there is way too much greatness to select from! \n\nThe service received on recent visits from Megan were stellar. Manan bakery needs to employ more friendly and outgoing staff like her.
