Just over the border (the pin is in the wrong place), this QuikTrip has a very wide pump area and plenty of room for navigating. And because it's in SC, the gas is cheap cheap cheap because the South Carolina gas tax is 18 cents less than North Carolina. Probably not worth a special drive to save ($2.70 saved for 15 gallons), but if you're headed nearby then it's worth it.\n\nAs with other QuikTrips, huge drink section for fountain sodas and coffee with ALL the fixings.
