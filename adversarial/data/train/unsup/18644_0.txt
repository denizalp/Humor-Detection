This is a review for the 'Being Jewish' class I am taking with my fiance. \n\nWe decided to take the class, for both his and my benefit, to get to know the background and history of the culture. He's not orthodox by any means, and a lot of the traditions are performed just as any family would do certain things. Me, I am atheist - but I want to understand the meaning behind it all because it is important to him. The things we do for our life partners. \n\nWhat I like about the course is that he focuses on the culture not the religion. This isn't a conversion class, but more a class for general understanding. It's like learning about the history behind traditions done on Chinese New Year, for example.  Just in the same way, this class you learn about why things are done on the high holidays and why some decide to keep kosher (and others do not). \n\nThe teacher is energetic and seems to like to talk. We have discussions, but it throws him off track. Although it's nice to see that people have to same questions as me. \n\nThe class is mostly engaged inter cultural\/faith couples, and some older folks just wanting to learn for their own knowledge. \n\nI'm sure that most of this is available on the internet these days, but lots of questions  has lots of interpretations. The teacher is very open minded about all aspects of Jewish life, and encourages you to come to your own conclusions, which is nice for an atheist like me. \n\nIts also nice to talk with other couples that have the same challenges as us, and also great for meeting other folks also planning a similar wedding. I like the discussion and getting other people's perspective.\n\nI would recommend couples to take this instead of the conversion class that we came across. There's no need to really go through a university equivalent course unless you truly are going to convert. This 8 week course will get you a great overview of Jewish life and culture, and help make synagogue a little more interesting. .
