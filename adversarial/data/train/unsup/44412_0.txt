My dtr came in from out of town and needed some minor dress alterations.  She went here based on the yelp reviews.  Took the dress in one week ago and was told it would be ready by Thursday.  I called to verify it was ready wed afternoon and was put on hold while they tried to locate the dress, which they never could.  I asked to be called back once they found it and was not.  We were hoping to pick up by 9 AM.  My husband called this morning and again no one could find the dress. He then stopped in the shop and again no one could locate the dress or my dtr's name.  He asked to be called again as the owner was supposed to be in by 9  No call by 10 so again he called.  Instead of an apology we were told they had never guaranteed it would be done.  Again no apology for no call back as promised and acted as if it was our fault for being upset that the dress was not found .  It was still not done until late afternoon.\nI would not recommend this store!
