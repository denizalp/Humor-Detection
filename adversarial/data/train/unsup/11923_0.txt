I understand that you maybe don't want all of my old clothes Buffalo because I don't really want them either. But it makes me sad that you offer me ridiculously low amounts of money\/trade for the clothes you do take. Especially when I have to watch your angry hipster buyers judge my taste in clothing. \n\nAnd on that note, maybe you should work on the way you price your items? $15 for a pair of jeans from Forever 21? You do know that Forever 21 jeans retail for $15, don't you? \n\nOn occasion, I do find some pretty sweet deals. Like today, I got a pair of Diesel jeans that look brand new for only $25. For the glimmer of hope that I will find a sweet deal, I will be back. But for your lowball offers, I feel like I would rather just give my clothes to Goodwill.
