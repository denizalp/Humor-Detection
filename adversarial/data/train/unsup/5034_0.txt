I haven't had a Strawberry Julius in years and stopped by the Aliante Station Casino today because they mailed me a bunch of free $15 bet coupons. \n\nThe Orange Julius is also a Dairy Queen and is located in the food court of the Aliante Station Casino. I looked over the menu and noticed that they had a hot dog\/chips\/drink combo. I asked if I could have a Strawberry Julius as my drink. The girl behind the counter said that was only a Dairy Queen Combo and I couldn't sub the drink. I guess I'm not getting a hot dog then...Next I looked at the prices and notice it was $4.79 for a medium julius. I remember it was only $2 in California. I won the $15 free bet so I bought it anyways. It was just how I remembered....except the price.
