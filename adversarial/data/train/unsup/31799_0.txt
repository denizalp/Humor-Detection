This place was not in the middle of the city, it was a little outside the center in Little Italy. The ambiance was very nice, many of the people in the resteraunt were very familiar with the owner so it is obviously a popular place. The owner was very nice, he came out and read us the meals, and he made great suggestions. I had a stuffed gnocchi which was amazing. The food came relativeley quick and was not too expensive. I highly suggest this place, if you are an Italian fan you will definitley enjoy this little place.
