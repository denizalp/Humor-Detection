I started going to this gym at the beginning of this year and I really gotta say that I like this gym.  I go really late at night so it is always dead and the equipment isnt bad either.  I have been to the one on Silverado and that was isnt as good as this on in my opinion.  The equipment is a little better than at this one but anyway getting off topic.  I really like the steam room they keep it relatively clean ( no water bottles or anything like that in there) and the pool I really like.  I am big on swimming and the fact that its the perfect temp and empty at night is exactly what I was looking for.  My boyfriend likes lifting and its perfect for all his lifting needs.  The lifting area is for the most part busier than the other parts but he still gets to use everything he wants without waiting.  I also like the ellipticals at this one better than the other one I have been to.  All in all I really like going to this gym and me and my boyfriend come here multiple times a week. I say a winner.
