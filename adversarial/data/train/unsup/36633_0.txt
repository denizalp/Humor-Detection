If you are looking for anything RV related these are the key people you need to deal with at Blue Dog RV... First and foremost ask for Jared Munk as soon as you arrive, he is the best sales person we have had the pleasure of dealing with. You will leave feeling like you have made a new friend, he is not only professional, knowledgeable, attentive and will shoot you straight without feeling any pressure when making your decision!! 2nd person when you have found the perfect purchase, deal with Caleb, Sales Manager another professional key person!  Then when you have agreed on your deal and you need to wrap up the financing.. Yes i know everyone hates going to finance and contract managers as they keep you in there forever.. well not this person Sarah, she is a true caring individual and very professional and Fast!!! Lastly when you go to pick up your new baby, make sure your PDI and instruction is handled by George, this man was the icing on the cake, he answered all our questions, took his time and was an absolute pleasure to deal with. I have to say when leaving Blue Dog RV, Las Vegas you have the happiest feeling knowing you have made the right decision and had come to the right place. Even the after service follow up is amazing, Service Advisor Tim called us and then to ensure our satisfaction after the sale a week later a man named Tim Johnson called. Its a truly awesome experience.... Believe me, we have searched high and low, been to many dealers, spent many hours and come across many key people in the RV world but none to the degree of expertise as these people. Follow our advice you will not go wrong believe us. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!!!! :)
