My sister was discriminated against by Joshawa Gray yesterday. She went to buy a suit for her son and was told it wasn't economically correct for her. He then walked her and her kids to a cheaper section in the store. She was judge by the color of her skin in front of her kids and other customers. If you spend over $99 shipping is free so why did a employee try to charge her a $100 shipping when the suit she wants to buy is $800? This location needs to be reevaluated. Treating customers disrespectfully, being rude and racist!? Joshawa need to be fired for making someone feel unwelcome and sad because of the skin color they were born with! She came to spend money not to be judged!!!
