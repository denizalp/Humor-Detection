So I am stunned this place has five star reviews. We called another company to do an estimate, and they sent Ray out to us. He in turn told us about Puckett's and said they could do the job for a little cheaper so of course we said yes.  Not only did they send one poor man out to do a large tile job but they assured both me and their employee that the job could be done in three days (he called after I said something). The man who was very professional and helpful stayed late into the night to chip up all our tiles just so he could keep the timeline.  \n\nOnce the tile was done, it looked gorgeous. My husband waited around till 10 am on the day of our carpet install and when we called asking where the team was they said that they didn't have us scheduled. I called shenanigans and asked to speak to Ted who i was told was the owner. He bumbled about on the phone saying that they could do Friday which was unacceptable due to our jobs and the fact that we had been promised a three day turn around. Once I asked for a discount on the price all of a sudden a very capable team of four men came to my house with my new carpet.  The job was done efficiently enough accept that I had to call them back after stepping on a nail that wasn't covered correctly (ouch) but it was fixed quickly enough.  The workers are great but Ted and Ray left a lot to be desired. I wouldn't be putting up much of a fuss accept that I was told multiple times by both that it was a three day job, just admitting we got lost in the shuffle instead of hemming and hawing would have gotten them at least three stars but I had to get pissy and ask for my money back to get any sort of positive action.
