All the waitresses wear low cut tops and the food is pretty good.  There's an Asian guy in a baseball cap that runs the show.  I don't get it, where's HIS low cut top? It's weird because this is a sports bar, but it's not Hooters so why is every waitress so well endowed?!  The chicken tenders and sweet potato fries are out of this world and I didn't notice any weird smells like other reviews have said.   Even though I liked this place, I really thought it was strange that the women were kinda pimped out, cleavage-wise by this manager. As a woman, I must say, UP URS to the management.
