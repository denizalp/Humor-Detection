Do you like it when you sit at the counter in a diner and the waitress calls you \"Hon\"...\"Sweetie\"...\"Darlin' \"? \n\nI know...I do too! It makes me feel like I've stepped back in time, to some mis-remembered past that probably never really happened to me (I may have watched too much TV many years ago...in fact when I walk into Jim's Coney Island, it seems to be in black and white, to me:) \n\nAfter my workout today, I was looking for a good place to retox:) \n\nI hadn't been to Jim's in quite a while, and this seemed to be a good time to get back to the lunch counter at Jim's:) \n\nJim's throws the love at you...in any other hands this stuff is just regular diner fare...you know, the blue plate specials...the patty melts...the ham and cheese sandwiches...the clam chowder from the big white one gallon can...the frozen chicken fried steaks...you know, just good, solid diner food:) \n\nBut, when they call me \"cutie\" as they serve my coney island and fries, it just makes everything...better:) \n\nWhat can I tell you...I'm a sucker for flattery:) \n\nThat's not to say that Jim's serves crappy food and makes up for it with flattery...in fact it's all very tasty (including the actual coney island hot dog...not chili dog...coney island hot dog:)...but it's not really special food. \n\nSo, what is special about Jim's? It's the atmosphere, ambiance, the nice people, the varied and eclectic menu and specials (Liver & Onions, Greek Feta Salad and Bacon\/Avocado Omelet, all juxtaposed on the specials menu today, along with the normal 100+ items on the regular menu:) \n\nAbout the only thing I would add to Jim's, would be homemade pie...a lunch counter like this needs 4-5 great pies, so I would have a place to go and have a cup of coffee and a piece of banana cream pie...but that's a quibble, not a criticism:) \n\nJim's takes me back to the days when I could sit down at the counter for lunch, next to Hugh Beaumont, and get an open faced roast beef sandwich for lunch, served by a wise-crackin' waitress that always calls me \"good lookin\":) \n\nEven if it never happened, that's how I remember it, Hon:)
