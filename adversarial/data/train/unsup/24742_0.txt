Love this store. I buy all my jeans here! No exception. From time to time, I do buy other things besides jeans.\n\nCustomer service is top notch and the stylist are great. Even if you're really in love with a pair of jeans and they don't think they suit you, they will let you know. No pressure to buy!\n\nI am in love with their Fidelity jeans, and own most of the ones they have in store.  They have some great brands and all range in price. If you're in the market for a new pair of jeans, go check out Espy. They will take great care of you.\n\nGreat shopping experience everytime.
