If you've been waiting for a quick bite that will make you exclaim, what the schnitz! ...You've come to the right place.\n\nThis is Schnitzel Hub's second location, but the first time I've visited any of their locations. I was very impressed by the clean and modern surroundings. There is an open kitchen and little wooden mallets decorating a feature wall. An ode to schnitzel!  \n\nI ordered the Toronto Sanwhich with veal, and it comes with fried onions and mushrooms. The schitz itself was fried to order and SO delicious. The bun (ciabatta?) was perfectly crusty and there seemed to be a lemon aioli that was a nice, delicate touch. The goulash soup (a must-order wherever I go) could have had a bit more meat in the meat:vegetable ratio, but it still warmed my soul and was full of flavour. \n\nAlso, I preordered the food via the Feedback App, so not only did I get a discount but it was super easy to pick up! These guys know their stuff.
