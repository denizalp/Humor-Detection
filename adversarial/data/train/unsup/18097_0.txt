Between Madison and Misty you can never go wrong. The ladies craft the most amazing cocktails ever. Sure it gets packed to the hilt on the weekends but then thats most places. I primarily have been here on the weekdays (does that make me sound like an alcoholic?) and I can say that the service is second to none. Its just nice to walk into a bar and to be able to order a Brooklyn and the bar tender knows what it is and isnt out of Picon Amer. \n\nThey do have all the high brow bourbons like Pappy and what not (too rich for my blood) and a good selection of single malts. More importantly they know their drinks. They dont pour you a single malt and drown it in ice.. well maybe if you asked them to but why the heck would you ? I digress... So to get back to the point, do yourself a favor, stop by and indulge in the craft of making drinks. Cheers !
