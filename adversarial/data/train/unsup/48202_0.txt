Is it weird to review a funeral home?  I guess so, but at least it'll give anyone who's reading this review an idea of what it's like on the inside.\n\nUnfortunately, I've had to come here on a coupla occasions within the last few years and the interior is surprisingly modern, yet warm, and NOT creepy.  There are skylights, so each room is nicely lit.  \n\nJust alongside to one of the rooms on the ground floor is a self-serve caf√© where family\/relatives can take some time to make their own coffee\/tea and chat.  I've also been to a room upstairs and it was welcoming as well.\n\nStaff at T&P seemed very respectful from the beginning straight to end of service.  So don't let 1 unfavourable review discourage you!
