I was really torn about this review, our first room left a lot to be desired, However we were given a different room which was much better. The pool staff were amazing and we had a great time there! We tried to eat in the Stratosphere restaurant up top... and that was a disaster!  The staff associated with that with the exception of one person were short and rude. Our waiter saw that we already had drinks from the lounge and just walked away half an hour later he still hadn't returned. We ended up leaving with out having dinner there. We ended up eating in the Italian restaurant - That food and Service were great. We also ate in the steak house and diner - both were awesome!
