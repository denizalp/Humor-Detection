We hosted a small client party at Forte and everything was excellent. The servers and bartenders were friendly and helpful and the food was AMAZING. I am talking appetizers with delicious duck, and steak frites, which was thin slices of medium rare beef wrapped around a few french fries. HOLY $*&!! That was amazing! I could have eaten the entire plate.\n\nI really have to get back here for a meal, because those tidbits of food were great.
