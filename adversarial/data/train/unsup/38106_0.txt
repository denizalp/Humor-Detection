Coming from Toronto we often eat Gryfe's bagels which are way different.  This was a nice change.  I expected a dense thick bagel but it wasn't and it was just right in density and size.  We got it hot off the line and we out smoked salmon and cream cheese on it.  Too bad there's no chairs or small seating area but there was a table available to assemble our breakfast.  Wish we could bring a few home as it was a nice change from our regular!
