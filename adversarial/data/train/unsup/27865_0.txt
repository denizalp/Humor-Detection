The decoration is fancy, much better than the pevious restaurant of the same address.   When passed by the fish tanks, there ae not too many seafood there.\n\nThe durian dessert smells strong once you stirred it.  Lucikly the waitress is fast enough to collect the glasses once they are done.   The pork dumpling with the scallop all over the place, not on top of the dumpling.   The presentation has to be better.  The congees are very good, comparable to the specialty restaurant.  The rest of the dim sum is average.\n\nThe toilet is clean.  With patterns engraved on the floor tiles, it may be very difficult to clean in the future.  \n\nAfter we chat with the manager about the dim sum and ask him for a dinner menu, he forgot once he left us.   For a newly open restaurant, he should be more enthusiatic to promote the business.\n\nIf the chef is really from Lee Wah Heen,  the standard is disappointing.
