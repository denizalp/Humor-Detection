I find some of the negative reviews on here pretty funny... these ice cream sandwiches are like $3. $3! .... wait... did you miss that... $3. I'm sorry but I have a hard time complaining about tasty treats that only cost $3. Especially when they are homemade from scratch cookies with delicious ice cream. Someone complained about the ice cream selection... umm... they have over 20 something flavors. I don't know where that guy goes for ice cream but I'd say that's pretty damn impressive for such a small little shop. But I get it... everyone has there own opinions... but c'mon... $3! Lot of debate on what an ice cream sandwich should be.... well then open your own ice cream sandwich place. Not all ice cream sandwiches are created equal.\n\nAnyway.. enough about everyone else. I experienced very friendly service, really good cookies (tuxedo) and tasty ice cream (vanilla... yeah i'm boring... so what). Biting into it was a bit difficult and I had to split it in half like an oreo. I don't mind the extra work! All going to the same place.\n\nUntil next time....
