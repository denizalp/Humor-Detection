Another great night! Atmosphere is hip and casual with a twist of Sexy! I love Love Love this restaurant.\nTonight I wanted to try something different on the menu, so for starters we ordered the Shrimp Taquitos and the table-side Guacamole. The Taquitos were Heaven in my mouth, Yes they are that good. Nice big shrimp and the perfect presentation. The table-side Guacamole was just as tasty as I have ever had. Its a very large portion, so is good for four people easily, I actually took some home as the two of us couldn't finish the whole portion.\n\nNow as I have said in previous reviews, if you check in, you will receive Free Flan! Yes! This is my favorite thing about the restaurant. And of course Chef Paco came out to say hello and extended his happiness that we love his Grandmothers Flan recipe. Truly outstanding.\nAnd also, all day Monday its now 25% off your entire bill by showing your local ID.\n\nOk everyone, Go check it out! Its all about the party in your mouth! I sure had a party, now Im stuffed! But happy stuffed.\n\nThank you El Dorado Cantina and Chef Paco. Absolutely Divine!!!!!
