Check your bill, check it twice!\nWe came here during the Marquez Pacquiao fight after asking around for the best place to watch the fight close to my house. they were charging 15.00 dollars cover charge which I thought it was fair, went inside, sat at a booth and asked for menus. we ordered a bucket of beer, some raw oysters and other appetizers. we kept ordering beer and appetizers all through the fight. the food was good, the service was outstanding and the atmosphere was tense betweeen Pacquiao and Marquez fans as I kept diving into the oysters while my friend had their eyes glued to the TVs. \n at the end my friends and I were as happy as we could be. lots of good food, lots of beer and victory for Marquez we couldn't ask for anythings else......check please. :(\nOk, we were drunk and happy but not that drunk, I had more mercury than alcohol in my system and I noticed that the prices on the check were different from the prices on the menu. Everyone In the restaurant wanted to leave after the fight so waitresses and cashiers were busy a the time so we didn't want to make a big deal so we just assumed that the prices were higher during special events, we paid the bill and left the restaurant hating them in silence.\n I've been back few times after for the oysters and they also have good deals on pupusas but the check keeps being inconsistent with the menu prices or regular prices during advertised happy hour but now I make sure to point it out, I'd like to think that they're just honest mistakes.....lots of them.\nIf I was to rate this place solely by the food, this place would get 5 stars. But I hate going to a place where I can't drink to the point of obvibion for fear of waking up the next morning and realized that I've been fuc'd.......I'll be back.
