EXTREMELY overrated! I have been here numerous times and the only good thing about this place is that they squeeze you in even if you call last minute. That's also part of the problem. They rush through to make money and it is evident. I have had a nail infection after a peddy, A shoddy peddy where the polish lasted 48 hours and the lady doing my feet was absolutely bare minimum and downright rude (I didn't even get a massage!). I have had a honey wax that left multiple bruises and I have had my eyebrows tinted black\/blue even though I am a ginger and this choice of colour was completely inappropriate. The convenience and location of this place made me continue to go, despite having these negative experiences. But, after realizing how many times I have been dissatisfied and the pattern in services received, I  am now willing to boycott this place altogether.
