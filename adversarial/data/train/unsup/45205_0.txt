The AAWL is totally awesome.  I volunteered here on and off for a few months before I adopted my doggy, Mickey Mongo.  He's a chihuahua\/shiba inu mix and a great dog all around.\n\nI thought of going directly to Maricopa County Animal Control, but I'm glad I went to the AAWL.  The AAWL is Phoenix's oldest no-kill shelter and really concentrates on training and working with behaviors.  They have great assessments and plenty of pets to match any personality style.\n\nThe volunteers and staff both have the dogs and cats best interest in mind.  Before I adopted Mickey, I fostered him.  I really wanted to make sure that he was the right dog for me.  After careful thought and plenty of conversations with the adoption specialists, I knew I had to have him.\n\nMickey was up-to-date on his vaccinations, microchipped, and the first vet appointment is free.  Also your adoption fee goes to ensure that the AAWL can continue to operate in our community.  \n\nIf you are looking to adopt a family pet, please stop by the AAWL.
