Yelp 100 Challenge * 100\/100 \n\nMadhouse coffee is located less than a mile away from where I live and I can't believe I have kept myself away from this Hippie, San Francisco-esque coffee shop for so long!\n\nLate Thursday afternoon and pretty tired out from schoolwork, I came here for a More Cowbell sandwich treat - roast beef folded into a slice of herb infused focaccia bread and topped with cheddar, lettuce and tomatoes - and a Nutella white chocolate frappe. \n\nAs if they weren't filling enough, I made an effort to take myself out of study mode to appreciate the cool artworks around the cafe and random funny deets on the cashier. That fed my artsy soul pretty well and I came out of there physically and spiritually refreshed. For $10 or more spent, you get a wifi code. There's a patio out for peeps in need of a smoke and did I say this cafe is open 24 hours? \n\nComing here to study again soon and get things done!
