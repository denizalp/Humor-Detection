The Pickle Barrel at Yorkdale is the worst.  The fish and chips and burger were cold, and the spanish paella was Luke warm.  Sent back the fish and chips and burger.  My new burger was still cold and the cheese not even melted, no flavor at all.  The restaurant was like a sauna making it a very uncomfortable experience.  The waiter was not attentive.  When seated the utensils and napkins were placed in the middle of table, so we had to set the table ourselves.  Stay away from this restaurant.
