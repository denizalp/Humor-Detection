A trendy and popular restaurant in downtown. The hosts struggled at the beginning - skipping us and giving tables to a party after us - but more than made up for it by treating us to a round of drinks. Thank you, Manager!\n\nFood was excellent, especially the pork risotto. However, the margherita pizza needed  much less tomato sauce and much more mozzarella.\n\nI recommend, especially if hanging around downtown and want quality drinks with quality and rich food.
