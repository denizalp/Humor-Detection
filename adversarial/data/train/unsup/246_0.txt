Motel was created as an outlet for owner, Christover Sven, to drink with friends and listen to the Strokes. Most of the art on the walls predate 1850 and at least six of the feature paintings adorned the walls of the Palais Royale throughout the depression and post World War 2.\n\nThe vibe is fun, easy, and strangely frusturating (the pinball machine is rigged). There's no dance music, no hip hop, no bullshit of any kind. the jukebox is stacked and Pbr is only $4 on tap.
