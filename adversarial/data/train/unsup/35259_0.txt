This buffet is bad at best. We went in at 5:30 thinking things would be fresh, everything was dry and looked like it had been there half the day. The selection was not great at all. The only positive thing I can say is the manager was really nice when we asked for our money back. He didn't hesitate at all. Pay the extra money and go to MGM Buffet.
