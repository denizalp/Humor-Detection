I watched his show when I was a child and remember when all the kids were running up there to be part of his show I shyly sat low in my chair and tried to hide.  Now my crazy self would run up there begging to fly around in that car!!!!!! I went recently and I rather enjoyed the show!  The price is pretty steep but what show in Vegas isn't?  I don't want to say to much to kill it but I recommend it!!
