Came in here and they have so many vegan options yay! I had trouble choosing. Wanted a calzone because I haven't had one in so long, but ultimately I don't like vegan cheeses (except nut cheeses like cashew and almond) so I got the ravioli. It came with tomato sauce, tofu filling and garlic bread. For some reason I had it in my head that they would have a cream sauce, there was no reason for this, so I was a little disappointed when I saw the tomato sauce. That was my own fault for not asking and just expecting it to be a certain way. I didn't think to ask but should have asked if they would consider doing a cashew cheese option in the future. The dish was really good, couldn't finish the whole thing so did have leftovers. Would come here again, they have vegan pizza, apps, and baked ziti too so plenty more to try!
