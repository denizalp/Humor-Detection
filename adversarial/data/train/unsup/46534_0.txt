FIVE STARS if you live here!\n\nArgh...this is one of those reviews that is both a 5 STAR review and a 3 STAR and it pains me to 3 star it. However, I believe that most of whom will read my review will not live here or in the surrounding area and as such the 3 Star review will more aptly apply.\n\nLike I say above, if you live here, in the apartments above, or immediately surrounding this is an awesome little place that has a few sundries as well as a great cup of coffee\/late, and a pastry\/snack. They also said they were going to be adding some beer taps for happy hour on your way into your apartment. In fact I would probably be stopping by everyday on my way in and out if I lived here. \n\nNow, if you don't live here, there are much better places\/coffee shops for you to take your time to seek out and stop at.  Access is not easy, at least when I was there it did not readily have access from the street but you instead need to walk through the apartment entrance.  This creates a small annoying issue of being asked by the sales office what they can do for you every time you're just trying to get a cup of coffee. Actually, a lot of the features that make it great for someone that lives in this building are reasons it makes it not so great for those of us seeking a place out. \n\nIf you life here, GO HERE (without a doubt), If you don't, then seek out another good spot.
