Don't like tobacco \/ hookah smoke? Sit outside with a view of the parking lot as you *inhale* their absolutely delicious and satisfying Falafel wrap. At $9 and change, it's all the money for a falafel wrap, but I think their spicy serrano 'tapenade' is so good (similar to Sababa's spicy green spread) that as long as some of that comes with it, it's totally worth it! And they're open late. The true test will be rolling over here at 1:45AM trying to order 4 Falafel wraps for me and my buds.\n\nNo tap water available. Ask for \"water\" to accompany your wrap and you'll receive grocery store bottled water ($2).
