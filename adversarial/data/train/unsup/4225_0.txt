I ordered a cheese pizza and wings for delivery last night. The pizza sauce tastes like bland tomato sauce from a can! It was so gross I couldn't eat more than a couple bites and I forced those down. I got sick because of how gross it was. My husband wouldn't even eat it and I have never known him to not only waste food but waste PIZZA! The wings... The flavor was merely okay! But they were tough! We threw almost all of it away! I have never had such BAD food in my life. I called back and politely informed the girl that it was so bad it made me sick and she apologized and said her manager would call me when he comes back in 2 days. I just received a call from him and he was immediately defensive. He called ONLY to inform me that the pizza couldn't have possibly made me sick! That I must have a virus! I told him NO... I am fine! The pizza was so disgusting I threw it up! And YES that CAN happen! Does he think he's a Doctor? He was completely unprofessional! I almost would've preferred he never called me back then call me back just to argue and be a cry baby about his pizza being disgusting! What a child! I will forever warn people now about not only the crappy food here but the rude and unprofessional manager!
