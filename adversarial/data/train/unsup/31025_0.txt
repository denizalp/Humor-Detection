My husband got a alarm from them and had them install it. I am here again for the 3rd time in 2 months to get it fixed AGAIN. For the 3rd time now the truck won't open and the wires fall out from under the dash because they don't know how to wire OBVIOUSLY. Now I am back again cause of the trunk and when we turn the highbeams on the alarm sets automatically. So in other worlds when we open the car door from driving somewhere the alarm goes off. I was talking to the employee (skinny male with a ponytail) I was telling him we have had nothing but problems with it. He acted like he doesn't even care and he has a bad attitude. He also said \"how much extra money did you spend to make the alarm go off when you turn on your highbeams?\" All I can say is \"REALLY\" Myself personally I have always gone to Audio Express and with the $1 install and I have never had any problems at all. Now I just had the installer come in and say \"I have never seen this before, it's custom.\" WTF YOUR PEOPLE INSTALLED IT... I was looking at stereos cause in bored and waiting and they asked if I wanted to buy one, I laughed. This is a joke, I don't know how they are still in business
