Have to agree with most of the reviews as this is just another typical Indian Resturant were everything is just enough to were it passes as Indian. Naan on a buffet got old and chewy. Most dishes were cold so I'm assuming these are left overs from the previous day. Sad when you're at such a prominent location in town.
