Let me start by writing I love their breakfast burritos.   My wife and I went inside and ordered two.   We waited, and waited, and waiting.....    watching cars come and go through the drive through.  After twenty plus minutes, I went to the counter to inquire about my order - it was not ready.   I asked the clerk if drive through customers  get served first?  She did not respond, but the crowd of people inside waiting for their food were all nodding.  I asked for my money back which they promptly provided.   No apologies however, and the cook in the back was glaring at me which made me uncomfortable.   I will probably be back - through the drive..   They need to improve their customer service and processes.    We ended going to McDonalds and  we received our food promptly.
