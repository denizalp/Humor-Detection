Great staff here. Love Danielle and Oksana in the leasing office. Manintenence requests are always promptly completed, usually within the same day. \n\nI've never lived anywhere that actually shows appreciation to their residents. Here at Falling Waters, there is a monthly \"Resident Appreciation\" which is in the clubhouse and they get food catered for all of the residents. Nothing major, but it's definitely a kind gesture from the Owner and Management. It makes it fun to get to know other residents and the staff here.
