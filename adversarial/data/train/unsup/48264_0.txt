A guest and myself rolled up to Happy Dog on a weekday at about 9. We did not expect to be hit up for a cover charge. I am overall not holding that against the \"Dog\" in my review. I sucked it up and paid the cover at my guest's encouragement. I will say if it is past \"get in free time\" I would pass it up and go somewhere else because it essentially made my hot dog a 10 dollar hot dog, because honestly I wasn't feeling the band that was there that evening.\n\nNow, to the food and the experience. my hot dog was exactly what I expected which is awesome because that so rarely happens. It was tasty the toppings were silly good and I felt appropriately proportioned. I had the hot dog sauce, bleu cheese coleslaw, truffle mustard . I also liked I could drink a tasty Black Label for only two dollars. Overall I look forward to going again. I hear that \"The Underdog\" is cool. I will just make sure I go in before cover time.
