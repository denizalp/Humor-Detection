@moxies_square1 #MOXIES #SQUAREONE #YELPGTA\n\nI am a sweatpants shopper, especially more-so on New Year's Day - I don't feel comfortable walking around in heels after a night of heavy drinking. So, when I walked into Moxies, I didn't expect to be treated like I would, if say, I walked into Oliver & Bonacini in sweats (and it would be justified). \n\nSo dear dear Moxies - this isn't a review, it's more like a reality check. You are like Pickle Barrel, Jack Astors or any other chain around. Here's where highschool boyfriends bring their girls for \"fine-dining\" and for us, working professionals, this is simply our alternative to McDonalds. So when, I walk in in my sweats there's no reason for the girls you hire to stare and then completely ignore us. \n\nHere's what happened - we asked for space in the dining room; the lady  at the reception clearly said there's none. It'd be believable if I couldn't see the three empty booths where this very lady sat couples and families who walked in after us. I witnessed this while I waited for a booth at the bar. I would've walked out if I wasn't hungry. \n\nRedeeming factors: \n1. The renovation is excellent, clearly they are trying to be more upscale. \n2. Cocktails were perfect - we tried the Blue Zen Martini and the Grapefruit Mojito. The latter is a MUST try. \n3. Food was top-notch - we ordered teriyaki wings for appetizer, and for our mains, my partner ordered a tenderloin steak and I got myself Chicken Madeira Rigatoni. The teriyaki wings were great and I would totally order it again. And as for the steak, it was a rare case of \"cooked to perfection.\" (I tried some). My pasta wasn't bad either. \n\nAm I coming back? Not to the Square One location\nMargarita rating? Another time! \n\nWe paid $100+ for our meal and drinks, you think they could hire smarter girls?
