I don't quite get it to be honest (all of the very positive reviews).  The burger was edible but certainly not fantastic.  They were out of pretzel buns which was obvious after a lot of shouting between the cook and cashier.  Another review mentions they were out of thousand island dressing.  The potato salad did taste like it was from Costco as another review mentions.  The french fries were like saut√©ed potato chunks, not real french fries.  \n\nA cool little place from a location perspective although even the decor could be a bit snazzier.\n\nI know this is a family run operation and I'm sure the owners are very nice - but at the end of the day this place is way overrated.
