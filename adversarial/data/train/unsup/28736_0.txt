If your looking for good service don't go here.  The waitress was interested in talking with her friends and playing on her phone then doing what she gets paid to do.  \n\nWhen we first arrived and seated ourselves at a table the waitress came over a few  minutes later and just threw menus on the table and said here you go and walked away.  We waited and waited, watched her chat with people at the bar and play on her phone.  So we decided to just walk up to the bar and order drinks.  The bartender said he will send the waitress over for the order which we replied to \"when\" we have been waiting.  He finally poured us drinks after going back and forth and did not let us pay, he said the waitress would ring us out.  \n\nSo we drank our beers and was waiting for the waitress to stop by and possibly offer us more.  10 minutes went by with an empty drink so we decided to leave, guess what, we had to interrupt the waitress from chatting and playing on her phone to get our checks.
