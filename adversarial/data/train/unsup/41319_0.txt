Great food but the service is horrible!!! Not greeted and had to wait for almost 20 minutes to get seated. There was a party of 4 in front of us. The hostess never did greet us (party of 2). Once we were seated after about 3 minutes the non-smiling waitress took our order.  I never got my coffee. The person bringing us water put it down and never spoke. Waitress said \"oh I forgot ur coffee). Terrible way to start a day!
