I love coming here, especially when it's cold out! The fire-cooked enchiladas warm me to my core and the flavors are phenomenal! All the ingredients are laid out for you to see, allowing you to customize your enchilada or taco. It can get pretty noisy, so be sure to speak up so the servers can hear you! The staff is fantastic and always project a pleasant attitude. The food may take some time to cook, but it's pretty quick considering it's all put together fresh to your specifications!
