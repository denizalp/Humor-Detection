Situated in the J-Town Complex by the cosmetics shop, Studio T is a hair salon that offers a variety of services including: cuts, perms, and colours. Their prices are quite reasonable considering that most cuts in Toronto range from $65-100.\n\nThe 'T' in Studio T stands for Taro... I think. Taro is both the owner and an amazing hairstylist himself. His parents are Japanese, but he was born and raised in Toronto. Once finished high school, he decided to go to Japan and discovered the world of hair salons.\n\nHe's fluently bilingual in Japanese and English. Mind you, if you're reading this and you've understood most of what I have said, I think the Japanese means nothing to you. He has three other stylists working under him. As I have never experienced their services, it's hard to comment, but their clients seem to be quite content when leaving.\n\nBefore cutting your hair, Taro consults with you in terms of the style\/look that you're going for. You do not have to be Japanese - lately I have noticed that his clientele reach to a variety of groups of people. Even my non-Japanese father goes here.\n\nBook with Taro in advance. I had to wait a couple of weeks to see him on Sunday. The weekend appointments are hard to come by.
