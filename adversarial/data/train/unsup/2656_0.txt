I thought pasties were those patches that cover a woman's nipples, but in this case they refer to a raised semicircular comestible made in the tradition of Cornish miner's lunches. After seeing all the Yelp reviews, I had to make it to Cornish Pasty Company. Great options for vegetarian and carnivore alike. Great beer selection on tap. Service here was great, the staff seemed to genuinely want to make it great. They definitely have a system here to serve up all these pasties, from freezer to fridge to oven, but the end product was still fresh and served piping hot. A unique experience, and definitely worth a visit. Now where in Phoenix can I find the other type of pasties?
