Okay, so yeah, the macarons and croissants are TO DIE FOR. We came at the top of the morning, so they were SUPER FRESH. Though we were in a time crunch, we managed to get 1 chocolate custard croissant ($5), and a dozen of their famous macarons ($25). \n\nAll of the macarons were delicious! :) With an airy initial bite, followed with the chewy filling, simply perfection in my book! My favorite was the peppermint\/eucalyptus flavor, followed by the strawberry cream. The size was bigger than what I expected, especially after what other Yelpers said. Regardless, it's quality over quantity for me, and each bite was refreshingly sweet without being overpowering; just how I like my desserts. Since we didn't get to sit in and munch, we didn't get to try their coffees or teas, so that's probably the only thing that I would have loved to pair it with. Next time!\n\nThe chocolate croissant was sooo good too. Flaky without being too light and crumbly and not too buttery, the flavors were so balanced. Even though the chocolate wasn't the dark chocolate kind, it wasn't too sweet either. I'd prefer a bit more bitterness, but it was still wonderful. Filling to pastry ratio was balanced, if not a bit more generous than what I expected.\n\nThe storefront itself, as others have mentioned, is really modern and minimal. White walls, and clean display cases showcasing the works of art (I mean, pastries). I simply adored their packaging, reflective of Nadege's philosophy and brand image. Across the way, there's Trinity Bellwoods Park, with plenty of space to hang out and lounge. Parking, as with most places in the city, is a pain and practically non-existent. You're better off trying to take the TTC, but if you're an out of towner like me, circle around until you're dizzy and\/or park on the side streets. ;)\n\nBottom line, pricey but worth it. Next time, I'll take the TTC in so we can enjoy a sit down experience on their outdoor seating!
