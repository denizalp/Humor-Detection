Never have I ever even uttered these words, much less put them on this dang thing called the Internet for the martians to read in space. Ready? \n\nI love the lunch buffet. I can't believe it either. Usually I see the buffet setup in restaurants and the first words out of my mouth... \"can we order off the menu?\" \n\nWe strolled in, took a seat and hit the bar! Yummy, spicy enough, plenty of choices, I just can't stop thinking about it today. There are a few choices for Ethiopian in Charlotte, I like them all. But I might be partial to this lunch buffet, because of price and selection. \n\nLentils, collards, cabbage, spicy potato mixture and plenty of injera to sop it up. Hell yeah.
