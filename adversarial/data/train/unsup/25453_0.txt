The staff here is exceptional!!!!! I've been debating on the Givenchy Antigona and the Nightingale so I came in just to browse. Upon entering we were immediately greeted (warmly too!!) by the sales associates. We were allowed to browse without being watched like vultures, but when I did show interest in something I was immediately helped. \n\nYana was the sales associate that was MORE than helpful. She was so happy to drag out all kinds of pieces that I never even thought of wanting- Hello Antigona Envelope Clutch!!! In fact my fear (with three kids) was that I couldn't fit my necessities in it. She was SO helpful, she even suggested I empty the contents of my bag and fill it in the clutch to see how it would work and how it would feel. She even let me walk around the store with it filled to let me see the comfort level of it!!! \n\nI couldn't decide between the Antigona stud bag or getting the envelope clutch in a fun color (subliminally sending a message to my hubby a that BOTH would be great for Mothers Day coming up!!) so she let me walk on it and told me at any time she could ship me my items after I decided. I am definitely coming back to give her my sales!! Thank you Yana!!
