Why the two star review? I LOVE the concept of being able to choose the perfectly personalized cupcake that eats at your heart. :) And I love the edible glitter :)\nMy gushing stops there. I have tried Mad Hatter a few times getting at least a half dozen or more. This first time I went I got my self lemon cake with lemon frosting. Okay so upon tasting my cupcake there was something off, not rancid off, but like ew no more please.  So I after I thought about it, it was EXTREMELY fake! Yuck!! I gave it to my moms dog. \nThe next time, my mom made me go with her or I wouldn't have gone, I ordered vanilla cake chocolate frosting. I thought how can anyone mess this combo up?? The vanilla cake had no flavor to it!! I can make better BOX cake then this! The frosting wasn't horrible but I'm not one to just eat frosting! So no more!! I wish they could have the quality of Sprinkles with their idea!!! \n\nDisclaimer: I am a Sprinkles Cupcakes snob :) so my standards are pretty high! If I can make better cupcakes at home why buy them??? In mad hatters case Smiths has better cup cakes....
