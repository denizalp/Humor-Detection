Probably one of the best locations I've been to, but that's not saying a lot because Dutch Bros is pretty much great everywhere! Their staff is awesome to say the least.\n\nLocated off of the 101, there are two lines entering the drive-thru making service efficient and because this place is always packed it's nice to see some method to the madness. Super easy to talk to workers take your order while waiting in line and you get to pick up your drink at the window. Love that this location is 24 hours! Loved my last recommendation here and was told there is about 300 possible combinations of drinks that can be made and got to try one of their secret menu items, a White Zombie Breve. This drink is an White Chocolate Annihilator taken to the next level, while toning down the sweetness. The White Zombie Breve is a white chocolate and vanilla breve indeed to make you feel like you can take on the world. Drinks here come out perfect as expected and love the little notes they leave on their cup lids, small acts of kindness definitely makes one day.\n\nThey now offer pastries here! Don't forget your stamp card!
