On January 26th, Calgary Yelpers took over Higher Ground for an Elite group event, and man, did we get the royal treatment!  \nI have always thought of Higher Ground as more of a coffee place, but tonight showed me that this establishment is WAY more than just a coffee house.\nFellow Yelpers showed up at 5:30 for a \"Vegging Out\" event, where vegetarian appetizers and drinks were served to tantalize the tastebuds.   \nHigher Ground is promoting a global vegetarian night, and based on the appetizers we enjoyed, I expect that this will be a hit with both vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.\nI sampled the Pesto Pasta salad and it was amazing.  It was very flavorful and garlicy (as yummy pesto can be).  The pasta was orzo.  Lovely!\nI also enjoyed the Red Pepper & Masala Dip.  Both dips were amazing.  I went lighter on the bread, and spooned a bit of it on the side of on my pasta salad.\nThere were dessert squares that looked lovely, but l am watching the sweets.  Like many in January, I am battling a New Year's Resolution to watch the sweets.  \nThe ambiance is both busy and laid back at the same time.   I will definitely be back at the Higher Ground.  The entire menu looks fantastic!  Please check it out here:  http:\/\/www.highergroundcafe.ca\/menu\/menu.html
