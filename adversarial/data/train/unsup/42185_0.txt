Moving from Henderson out to Centennial was an adjustment for me, when finding places to do my hair, car oil changes, etc. I started to drive to Henderson to my shop I've been faithful to for 3 years but then I said this must stop, I have to trust and find someone to to do my nails. For a fill? I have to find somewhere. I'm always at Chevron getting gas and I happen to see this place. I said okay I'll give it a try. I am so happy I did! Vivian did my nails. All the girls there are so funny and friendly! The fact it is only a few blocks away I have found my new spot. She took her time and made sure I was happy. Nail shape is perfect. A little on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. :-) i will be back soon for additional services. I came on a Wednesday morning and got lucky to get in. They were starting to pick up as I was leaving. The shop is clean and stylish with all kinds of fun color options. I got the cat eye and I am so happy I did! Thanks again guys!
