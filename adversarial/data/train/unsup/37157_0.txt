Food was excellent! Portion sizes were appropriate (vs. a plate full of stuff). No dogie bag necessary.  Our meal was the Valentine 4-course meal @ 2 for $80.  Service was prompt and courteous and the owners stopped by our table.  We arrived before the crowd so there was no wait.  Restaurant had been open 1-2 weeks. Great ambiance. Beautiful setting and excellent light - low but you can see the menu without eye strain.
