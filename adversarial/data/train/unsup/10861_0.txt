While house sitting in Avondale, I decided to hit Yelp for a recommendation on a good dinner spot for my best friend and I and we ended up at Claim Jumper.  (What kind of a name is Claim Jumper anyway?) I had never heard of it but I guess she had been to the one in Chicago and loved it.  \n\nWe went for a late dinner on a Saturday night and had absolutely no problem getting a table.  Great service and nice atmosphere made for a great evening!  We started with the artichoke appetizer which I absolutely loved and found very different.  The artichoke was grilled and sliced and served with a delicious tomato topping.  For dinner I had the seared scallop salad and Ashley M. had the slider trio.  At the end of the meal we were both satisfied as we drooled over the desert menu but decided we were simply too stuffed.  Based on the review of Kym S., we may have missed out on glory but that just means I will have to return!\n\nNext to the hostess stand there is a big barrel of apples.  Is it stealing if I took an apple on my way out?  woops...
