I went to a graduation event here. I fought traffic down Camelback to get here. Note: turn in to the parking ramp on 33rd avenue. The attendants guided us in and through the parking ramp. The entrance to the arena area was crowded. They were doing a bag check at the door. Once inside I found a seat. The audio visual system is good. I was able to hear and see the whole graduation clearly. The climate control was just fine. It wasn't too hot or too cool. What was a pleasant surprise was the departure from the campus. We went from the parking ramp to the street in a matter of minutes. I was expecting a bottleneck and quite a wait.
