I had pretty high expectations for this place, especially with an additional $17 holiday surcharge.\n\nService was fair, as our server was taking away our plates, he was in such a hurry, he ended up spilling food all over the floor next to us.  He didn't come by very often. \n\nNow onto the food:\n\nAngry Mac and cheese was surprisingly better than expected. All the other pastas, not so much.\n\nPass on the eggs Benedict.\n\nFried chicken was comparable to KFC.\n\nCrab legs really exceeded my expectations, except for the fact they didn't have crab forks and were poorly cracked, so I had to work hard.\n\nThe Asian food section wasn't bad, it was okay, better than Panda Express, but nothing close to authentic.  Sushi is Safeway quality.\n\nFried egg plant was okay.\n\nRisotto was pretty good.\n\nI was impressed that the POG was actually good and not watered down.\n\nMeats were just all average, with the exception of the pork shoulder, it was quite good.\n\nLast but not least, the dessert bar...it was excellent, can't go wrong with sugar!!!\n\nValue wise - it is probably okay at the normal rate if $28, but for $45, not really a good value.
