When planning my wedding, I decided that I wanted a dress created from three vintage gowns: my mom's, my mother-in-law's, and my grandmother's. Needless to say, my grandmother's dress needed some rehab since it was worn in 1954. Organicare lovingly restored it to a white I didn't think it could be. \n\nAfter having my dress made, I brought it back to Organicare to be preserved and yet again, they did not disappoint. I'll be bringing all my dry cleaning f here from here on out!
