My husband's anticipation for the fried chicken and mine for the shrimp and grits was overwhelming.   We arrived for late breakfast early lunch.  We were seat promptly and the service was great.  We started with the appetizer of fried green tomato with pork belly and a dash of some kind of jelly spread.  The tomato was crunchy and the pork belly added a salty meaty tasted.  It was great.  Our main entrees arrived and looked  quite appealing.  My husband's plate was overflowing with fried chicken and waffles.  My shrimp and grits arrived with plenty of large shrimp.  While the food was quite tasty and the service was great $107 for lunch seemed a bit much.  ok not a bit much it was too much but then we were at the Palazzo.  While the food was good not great the value was not.  Great experience though.
