Joe was out to my home last week.  He had to work really hard to battle lots of pet stains and old carpet dirt.  My carpets are about 12 years old and they turned out beautifully!  He was also able to arrive earlier than planned which worked well with my schedule.  Both he and Michel are responsive, punctual, kind, and professional.  Thanks guys, see you next time!
