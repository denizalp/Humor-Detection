We loved the Venetian!  We have tried 5 other hotel\/casinos in the past and this one wins hands down!  Loved it!  Rooms were luxurious and comfortable!  Restaurants were wonderful!  Parking was free and convenient!  We do play slots and we were successful!  From now on, we are staying at the Venetian!  We go to Las Vegas 3-4 times a year for recreation and relaxation!  FYI!  Their pools are gorgeous!  We highly recommend the Venetian for the discerning traveler who wants a facility that is as good if not better than home if home is wonderful!  Mr. Adelson, you have a destination that was beyond impressive!
