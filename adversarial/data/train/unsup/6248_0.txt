I swear I have never had a relationship more stormy and fluctuating than with his store. It feels almost like dating a good looking guy who is a complete jerk to you but occasionally buys you flowers. Yes, you guessed right. They sold me rotten fish. Again. The entire $20 worth of the  exotic trooper.  I am boycotting the store till the end of winter. Amen.
