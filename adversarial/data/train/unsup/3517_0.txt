There used to be no greater fan of viva chicken than me. When they first opened, I was there once a week or more.  I often let them know how well I thought of them. I would take friends and fam there.  I even once declared, \"I want to marry Viva Chicken\" on Yelp.  But no more. The honeymoon is definitely over. LOL!  The staff has gotten rude.  The management is argumentative, does not value loyalty, and does not appreciate its long time customers. The pricing - which has always been on the high side - for ubiquitous things like rice, beans, and chicken - has increased. The reward point value was slashed. The set up is even more awkward than it was before now that customers have to wait in line to pump their own condiments. And the kicker is that the chicken can get dry and stringy if you don't time your purchase right and you will definitely need the toothpicks they now make available. How disappointing.  Qué lástima. :-(
