Sitting home alone on a Friday night, I needed to do something different, and try a new restaurant. I had a craving for steak, but didn't want to shell out $100 at one of the super fancy steakhouses. Something about Echo and Rig rang all the bells for my desires. \n\nI rolled into the restaurant, which has a bar and a butcher shop downstairs. There is a main dining area upstairs, but I settled into the only seat open at the bar, between a visiting guy from Texas and a retired Navy lady living locally. They both were very friendly, which makes eating alone a little easier. I ordered up a Stoli cranberry which was made with white cranberry juice providing a little sweeter taste and a nice change from the routine red one. A brief look at the menu brought me to the Spencer steak, which my new friend from Texas was enjoying. He has a cattle farm and raved about the steaks here, so I simply followed his recommendation. Good choice as the steak was prepared perfectly medium rare, served with my choice of sauce (bernaise), a stuffed mushroom, and some potato chips (this I would have preferred the choice of a baked potato). Plenty of flavor in the steak, a little salty but then I\"m one of those who never salts any food. A delicious meal it was for a nice price of $26. \n\nI\"ll try a few more meals here. You should give it a try too.
