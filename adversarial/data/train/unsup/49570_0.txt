Atmosphere is legit. Service from the server was awesome. Very attentive. But do not order the rice au gratin with chicken. It felt like I was eating a meal out of a can. Absolutely no flavor at all. Told the manager who picked up our dirty dishes, that I did not enjoy it. And his response was \"that's too bad\" and walked away. Not even offering to replace or comp or even offer a desert. I've been in the food and beverage industry for almost 10 years here in Vegas. And I've never experienced a manager that didn't have any integrity to save a customer experience. I was thinking about having my wedding here, as they offer such services. But I wouldn't appreciate them talking to my guests like that. So I'll take my business elsewhere.
