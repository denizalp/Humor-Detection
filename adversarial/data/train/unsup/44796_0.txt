This a cute little store front that has carries cookies, popcorns and customizable sodas! The staff is super friendly and let us take pictures and all kinds of videos for our YouTube page.\n\nThey have chocolate chip cookies, sugar cookies, peanut butter cookies and chocolate peanut butter cookies. They are pretty thick and weighty cookies. Tasty!\n\nTheir drinks were my favorite! I got a Diet Coke with coconut and lime and it was really good! They have even more creative drinks with fruit pur√©e and creams inside but if you want to do a regular Coke you can do that too. \n\nThe popcorn was seasoned really well too!
