Elegant Chinese Restaurant is located at the plaza at the corner of McCowan and Hwy 7. It is tugged right at the corner, and sometimes it is not really visible when you drive by unless you really look!\n\nThey have dim sum specials from Monday to Friday the whole day and Weekend\/Holiday before 11:30 AM where you can get S\/M\/L size dim sums all for $2.40. This is really good compare to the regular price when a L is $5.00!!\n\nDropped by on a Sunday afternoon around 12:30 pm. No need to wait for a table but the restaurant is 80% full. When you enter in the restuarnt you will see this big fish tank.. ok huge fish tank with assortment of tropical fishes. No those are not for us to eat.. :P The live seafood is hidden somewhere at the back of the restaurant.\n\nThey have all the usual selections but with a little twist. We ordered chicken feet in abalone sauce, shark fin and shrimp dumplings, siu mai, a congee and a few others. Yes they all tasted much better than the cheaper dim sum places.\n\nI will definitely come here for a nice Sunday Dim sum with the long wait in line even I need to pay more. Sometimes it is so stressful to wait over 30 min just for a table in other busy restaurant. And for sure will come again for the dim sum specials time slot.\n\nThey accepts Visa and Mastercard.
