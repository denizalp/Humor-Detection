I would give this place zero stars.  This is the worst place in Vegas. I don't know how much they have to pay Food Network to show them on TV, but you couldn't pay me to eat here again.  Why? When I go into a Thai restaurant and order in Thai, I expect authentic food prepared with authentic ingredients.  I do not expect jalapeños in my somtum, and I do not expect the owner to try to convince me that a jalapeño is a Thai pepper. No-go.
