Have passed this place several times and finally stopped in to try it out.  RCH is a great little spot overlooking the park.  Staff were friendly and accommodating.  \nSat out on the patio and enjoyed a latte, cappuccino and espresso.  I like Te Aro beans so was happy with my drink.  We shared a lemon pound cake, lemon ginger scone and a cinnamon bun.  All were acceptable.\nWhat makes this place special is the great view, outdoor dog friendly patio and great service.  I will try the drip coffee next time.
