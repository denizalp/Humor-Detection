I like fast cars and faster jet planes!  \n\nHaving recently seen the air show at Miramar in San Diego, I have been bitten by the jet bug. Absolutely amazing to see these fighter planes up close and personal, talk to the pilots, and then watch the air show as the jets zip by with their afterburners blazing and the roar deafening.  Luke Air Force Base was very well organized, they had thousands upon thousands of parking spots with great directions. The walk to the actual show it was quite far in excess of a mile perhaps even a mile and a half. There were lots of vendors selling water for reasonable price of one dollar per bottle.  They must havehad over 1000 Porta potty's located everywhere.There was a huge selection of food vendors, and what I really liked is all the food vendors were spread out over the entire facility not bunched up in a little area. It can get pretty hot on the tarmac considering all the concrete. The highlight of the show was the reenactment of the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor including rebuilt Japanese Zero replicas used in the movie Tora Tora Tora, and P 52's. They even had B-17 bombers, and the MC made sure to tell the whole story of Pearl Harbor. I'm a World War II buff, and having recently been to Pearl Harbor, it was exciting to see this reenactment.  Another real cool thing on this hot day, was the use of rickshaws shuttling people back-and-forth to the parking lots. I'm not sure how much they cost, but for the elderly population they seem to really enjoy this perk.  \n\nThe best part, the entire show was free!
