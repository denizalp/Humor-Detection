My friend felt it was the best Middle Eastern they've ever had - and I'm inclined to agree.  For you Vancouverites, this joint is better than Cafe Babylon of old in my estimation - yup, it's that good.\n\nWe stumbled into this joint randomly for some pre-drink eats before continuing our trek down Crescent.  Yelp said it was good - and Yelp was right.  This place is *insanely* busy - for good reason.  After a long line-up and fighting with their non-stop ringing delivery phone, we finally got our orders in.\n\nMy friend really liked her vegetarian plate and the chicken shawarma sandwich I had was insanely good.  Juicy chicken, fresh veggies and pita was a good amount of char which gave it a nice crunch.  Yes, it's greasy... but good greasy.  I was sitting there wondering, \"Wow - how good would this taste if I drunk?\"\n\n... well... I found out a few hours later because we decided we want more Boustan after drinking far too much with the kiddies on Crescent.  Sober - this place is damned good.  Drunk - this place is \"fuuuugin' ammmazzzzing\".  And we were not the only fans - people were asking if they could take pictures with the man behind the mystical food, Mr. Boustan.  Being drunk, we got in on the action as well.  Funny dude - as he handed our food order over, he commented that he liked my friend but not me.  This was a bit of a shock for me -- I thought I was the 'cute' one.  Oh well.\n\nDespite being drunk, I actually had the presence of mind to grab a take out menu before leaving.  Skip forward to the next night - after stumbling back to the hotel after failing to find anything appetizing on the walk back from the bar.  I find a Boustan menu on the desk and I think to myself, \"Drunken Johnson - you magnificent sexy beast - you are a genius!\"  Seriously, I'm so good that I scare myself sometimes.\n\nThese guys deliver until 4AM.  I repeat... 4AM!  For free!  If they only delivered to Vancouver... hmmm....
