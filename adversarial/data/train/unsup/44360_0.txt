We had our anniversary dinner here and were very pleased with the service and the location. We started with an amazing flat bread pizza along with their fresh pesto and bread. I ordered the scallops which were recommended by our waiter. I'd have to say they were the most perfectly cooked scallops I've ever had. The lasagna my husband ordered was good but my scallops were better. Do your self a favor, order them! Also the burnt honey ice cream was crazy good.
