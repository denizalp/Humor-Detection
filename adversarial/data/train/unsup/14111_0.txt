I haven't been to a Cirque Du Soleil since the 1980's when it was in San Francsico...I thought that one was really magical.\n\nThis was not my first choice, but my relatives who live here had seen almost every other one. So KA it was. \n\nPluses: Beautiful theater, comfy chairs with built in stereo speakers, amazing stage settings, and some unique pyrotechnical effects.\n\nMinuses: slow paced, lethargic action, flimsy to no plot...almost a snoozer, and rather expensive for an hour and a half show of that quality.\n\nI think going to O, Love, or Michael Jackson would be better choices.
