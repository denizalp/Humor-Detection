First time here, I'd rate it 3.5, food was good, house blonde delicious, Moscow Mule quite tasty, we had the spicy chicken sandwich and roasted chicken sandwich.   Service was slow but friendly. Open and airy atmosphere even when packed doesn't feel crowded. Easy to get to secluded from the Town Square business. Would go back.
