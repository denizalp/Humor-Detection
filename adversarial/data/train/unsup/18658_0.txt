What is the point in ordering ahead? Called, placed the order, pulled up to the \"Curbside Carry Out\" Call Upon Arrival .... I make he call, and the guy answers the phone - actually laughs and says you'll have to wait another 15-20 minutes before I'm coming out there ...you 7 orders ahead of you. Seriously?????
