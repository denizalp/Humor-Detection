I would have to agree with most of the reviews for Dickeys...\nI got what I thought was a great lunch deal....a brisket sandwich with 1 side and a drink for $6.00.\n\nThe bread was ick...nothing at all special , the meat was dry and VERY bland with 2 tiny rings of onion and 2 small pickle slices....if it wasent for the average bbq sauce I would have tossed the sandwich and learned where NOT to go for BBQ!\n\nI chose cole slaw as my side which like the brisket was bland and nothing to speak of.  One  of the people in my party had mac and cheese....\"can you say boring\"?\n\nAlthought another person got the \"baked potatoe casserole\" as a side which was actually really good..... in fact I would say it was the best thing I tasted there.\n\nA nice perk is the mini ice cream cone you make yourself.....especially when you put it in a cup and add Root beer!   \n\nDickeys is the closest BBQ place to me and yet I would rather go without or take a drive to the next closest place.\n\nFood is s personal preference and I am the most PICKEY person I know and the only reason I would go back is to get some more of that potatoe casserole!\n\nYou decide....and in the meantime....\n\nBon Appetite'
