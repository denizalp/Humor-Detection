I think that this place is a lot better than the reviews make it out to be. There are some reviews that hate on the service, but it's a small place with one server - get em a break! I was here on a quiet night and the service wasn't speedy, but it allowed me to actually catch up with the friend I was having dinner with! Didn't mind at all.\n\nTheir food selection is interesting and quality. I thought it was worth the price.\n\nI'd recommend this place and I'd come back. Don't hate on the ma and pa businesses!
