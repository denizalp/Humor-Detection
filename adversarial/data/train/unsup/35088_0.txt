Visited this location yesterday, split an acai bowl with my sister and left. I also grabbed a cold pressed ginger lemonade which one of the girls was nice enough to ground more ginger in for me. Bad news is that a plastic bag was in my sisters bowl and a few pieces of plastic in mine. Yep I said plastic. I think they must prebag the acai brick or something and some genius didn't take the plastic off before sticking it in blender...so we had to throw our bowls away...we were already home...ate about 1\/3 of the bowl before I found my first plastic chunk but pretty sure I had already swallowed some...yuck
