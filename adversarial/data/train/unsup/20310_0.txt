I'm feeling like a star, you can't stop my shine\nI'm lovin' cloud nine, my head's in the sky\nI'm solo, I'm eatin' solo\nI'm eatin' solo, I'm eatin' solo, solo\n\nYeah, I'm feelin' good tonight\nFinally doing me and it feels so right, oh\nTime to do the things I like\nGoing for the maki everything's alright, oh\n\nNo one to answer to\nNo one that's gonna argue, no\nAnd since I got that hold off me\nLivin' the Sushi life now that I'm free, yeah\n\n----\n\nTiny little sushi restaurant run by Japanese folks in the heart of downtown (which is a bit of a rarity in t-dot).  You'd miss it if you weren't specifically looking for it. \n\nThe restaurant was fully booked with us having a group of 10 and another group of 8 behind us.  Sushi was fresh.  Good selection.  The highlight was probably the self brewed soy (don't bother asking for low sodium, this is the homemade stuff).  Great quality wasabi.  Service was a tad slow, especially since there really was only two groups, but we got service with a smile.\n\nhttp:\/\/app.toronto.ca\/food2\/DineSafeMain?userRequest=view_history&ESTABLISHMENT_ID=10346539
