1. This place is very disappointing. The tacos are NOT WORTH what you're paying for @ 2.25 each. The tacos are extremely small, in Los Angeles, we buy the same tacos for $1 each. \n\n2. The quesadillas are the exact same size as the small tacos, only difference that they put a little piece of cheese on it. \n\n3. There is a long line for each type of meat, which is absolutely ridiculous, as everybody more than likely will be ordering 2 different meats every time. Wait time is approximately 45 minutes. \n\n4. By the time you receive your tacos, you are waiting for the other meats, and finally pay, your tacos are already cold. \n\n5. Dining in is a challenge as there as like only 5 tables inside. We were lucky to get a table, but it's super uncomfortable eating when there are a bunch of standing hungry people waiting in line next to you. \n\n6. This is my first and my last time coming here. I would definitely opt for going to \"El Tizon\" as they actually make burritos there.
