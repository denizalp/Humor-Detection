Mona's was Rock-n-Roll..i.n.g when we arrived with plenty of hands on-deck in the back kitchen rolling out an incredible amount of Fresh Roti Breads.  It was weekend dining hours so we got the orders and settled on one of their 2 Tables available for the random eat-in Diners.  \n\nAll staff were quite Friendly, Accomodating and worked in unison between themselves and the Music(West Indie Vibe Music and some Michael Jackson).\n\nThey continuously worked the 1,400+ Fresh Roti Breads in the back while the others met with consumers thru the door to provide Curries, Roti Wraps, Roti Skins(Dahlpuri $2, Paratha $2, Whole Wheat options $2.25), Stews, and various other selections of Meal or Products...  Btw, that was the Trinidad Flag near the Register.\n\nGoat Curry Roti(Bone-in)\n\n- Delicious even prior to a dose of spicy sauce.  The Roti Skin does make a difference.  Good mix of ingredients.  Enjoyable.  Afterall, the name of the place is \"Mona's ROTI\".\n\nStewed Chicken\n\n- Looks of a good mix of ingredients however I found it lacking flavour to other versions elsewhere.  Served with Rice & Peas as one of the $6.99 \"Special of the Day\" it's considered good value to comparison of styrofoam portion offered.  3.5'd
