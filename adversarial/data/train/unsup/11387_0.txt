I might seem a little harsh compared to other reviews and it's not that I didn't like it - I did but I think it was just around the time I went I was a bit under the weather is all\n\nThis place is a little bit out of the way from UNLV to just grab a late lunch - it was pretty packed when I had went and it was about 3:30pm \n\nI had gotten the curry sandwich and Bun got the something with goat cheese - my curry sandwich was good but over time it got a little much and don't underestimate its size because oh my will it fill you up - it's a bit on the pricier size, think around $16+ for just two sandwiches but it is a pretty upscale cafe\n\nI wanted to get the lattes in the big cups but wasn't feeling it at the time. Customer service is almost tho - I'll be back if I'm in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way for here
