I went here for the first time last night.   The restaurant inside\/outside is beautiful.  It is very big\/spacious, great decorating.  The chips I think are great, they are the very thin ones that you can just eat and eat until you realize you ate the whole basket (oops!)  I got the chicken fajita chimichanga drizzled with rancharo sauce, rice and re fried beans.  The portion was HUGE!!! The taste was great! I loved all of it.  My boyfriend got the fajita combo, chicken and shrimp next time we go there I am def getthing that.  whatever they marinated the chicken and shrimp in was to die for, I could have ate the chicken and shrimp all by itself.  Our waitress was great, extremely friendly!
