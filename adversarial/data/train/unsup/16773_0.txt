The food really is the MVP at this place! The servers are always pleasant and attentive as well. The local color commentary was fun the first time! I've never seen someone negotiate the price of soup ‚Äç The ambiance is lackluster and the dishes are straight out of a hospital dumpster but the food is quite diner tasty!
