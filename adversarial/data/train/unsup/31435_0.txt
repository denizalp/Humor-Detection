Yessssss! Pricey but it's Vegas & This place is so worth it:-) Southern comfort food with an awesome cocktail menu: \n\n1. Location: Venetian hotel casino floor\n\n2. Reservations: Yes!!! We called at 7pm and the next availAble table for 2 was 9:15pm. We walked from our hotel, arrived around 7:30ish and awkwardly hovered by the front desk waiting fir people to vacate the bar area or lounge. We lucked out and a group left within 5 minutes of our arrival \n\n3. Ambience: chill vice, dim lights, the front area had bar seating and an open Lounge with sunken chairs and comfortable sofas. \n\n4. Drinks: try their southern peach lemonade cocktail :-) drinks take up 3 out of 4 of their pages \n\n5. Food: You must order the creamy shrimp & grits (Yum), any of their biscuits (you can order 1-4 & the regular buttermilk biscuit comes with a tasty apple & spice jam; the devilish eggs are good, annnnnd I recommend their fried chicken plate . Honestly  everything is great and filling \n\n6. Whatever you order plan on spending at least $40-$50 on yourself
