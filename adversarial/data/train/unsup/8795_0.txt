This place is really good! Best Greek food I've had in town in awhile. The people at the counter were really nice, helpful and patient. We liked how their menu had pictures as well as descriptions. They did bring food to our table which was nice.\nI got the spinach pie plate. Came with spanikopita, two dolmas, hummus and tomotato with cucumber and onion salad. It was soooo much food but it was all really good. The seasoning on the dolmas was the best I've had in town as spiced it up, the spanikopita was nice as actual pie not those silly triangles people claim are spinach pie. The hummus was seasoned well and the salad was a nice touch. It's nice how they have wheat or white pita options as well. My friends got the gyro combo and the falafel combo and they both loved their food. They got fries and loved how they were seasoned. The falafel she hadn't had since Europe and was quite impressed. The kids all got dessert. Rice pudding they liked but the hit was the warm NUTELLA and pita! They couldn't get enough of it! Nutella in a Greek joint... Definitely a hit for kids! \nWe all enjoyed and are definitely going back! \nThe only reason not five stars is there were 7 of us and we had to sit separately as no table for more than four and some other tables were taken so it wouldn't have been possible to move tables together. It also therefore was crowded at the table for four once the food came.
