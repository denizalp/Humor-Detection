I thought this place had sandwiches made out of Bison meat - but no... \"Bison Witches... Buy Sandwiches.\" Get it?\n\nI know I'm on a roll with the 5 star reviews here, but this place deserves it as well. So incredibly good. It's a great little bar tucked behind the bank and the food is amazing. I loved my sandwich. I'm definitely going back. \n\nWhile I was sitting there eating my sandwich, a bus rolled up and a girl's college volleyball team piled off to come in and eat - they were all wearing their uniforms and some had ice packs taped to their knees or elbows etc... I won't say that this swayed my review score, but it didn't hurt. This is a lovely place. Eat here.
