Since Downtown Summerlin's Victoria's Secret opened, I haven't come to this location in the Fashion Show much lately, but since I had so many other stores to visit, we decided come to here.\n\nMy favorite part of the Fashion Show's VS is how spacious the fitting room area is. Fitting rooms are located on both sides and in the middle there is a large ottoman to sit and wait. Additionally there is great lighting and mirrors inside each of the fitting rooms.\n\nLike any other VS, there are always staff to size you and give you recommendations. After all, what's underneath truly matters in an outfit. Of course when you check out, there are lip glosses, makeup cases, and perfumes to test your willpower. \n\nSo come on down to Victoria's Secret in Fashion Show Mall and get yourself something hot and sexy.
