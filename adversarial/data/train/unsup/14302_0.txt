Maker Pizza is dynamite! Move over North of Brooklyn, Queen Margarita, Blaze Pizza, and Pizziolo. \n\nThis place is hidden in Chinatown for a reason - only locals know about this. From Cameron House, walk north until you see a pizza shape sign on the east side of the sidewalk.\n\nThe pizza toppings are an expert blend of flavours and the zesty notes of lemon are ingenious. We had the Coop and it was sinfully delicious. Smalls give you 4 slices, nice for a snack and just under $20. Go with medium or large if sharing for 2 of more. \n\nPro tip: order in person, you'll wait 20 mins. Order delivery and you'll wait 1-2 hours.
