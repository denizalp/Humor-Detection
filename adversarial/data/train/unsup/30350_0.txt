I love this place! We have 3 dogs and they are a handful. The staff is so helpful. It was 114 degrees outside and they even came to the car to help me get the dogs. We got their nails done and gave them a bath. You get to wash them, condition them, give them a blueberry facial and then dry them. After, you get to pick a cologne that can be juniper, blueberry, peppermint, lavender, etc. The total was $69 and it saved us from having to clean our tub and deal with them trying to jump out and getting water everywhere. Give it a try! Our dogs love it.
