Food was okay, I am not waiting all day for it though.  If I could go in and get a table right away I'd eat here again, but waiting more than 10 minutes, no thank you!  I would rather walk to Matadors or First Watch....\n\nP.S. Go for the rosemary potatoes not the hash browns, unless, of course, you would like some hash browns with your grease.
