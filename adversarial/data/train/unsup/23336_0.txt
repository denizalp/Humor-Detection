It's a bit of a 3.5, but it'll do.\n\nI've been eyeing King's Sausage during my fairly regular trips to the weekly \"Food Truck Party\" gathering outside Total Wine & More near Fry's, and I finally opted to try them today. It wasn't quite my first experience with them - that happened last year when I shared decent but perhaps overly salty pierogies with friends at another food truck event - but I decided to give it a proper go today.\n\nThe woman operating front-of-truck, if you will, recommended the bratwurst when I asked. I decided to order this (presumably listed as beer brats) for $8, and it was prepared quite quickly atop a pretzel roll along with the complimentary toppings that I'd requested: caramelized onions, mustard, and a side of chipotle sauce. I was actually browsing another food truck when she surprised me with my order.\n\nFlavor-wise, the sausage and toppings combine to make everything you'd want in a bratwurst sandwich. I ended up using all of the chipotle sauce too when I realized that it wasn't that spicy, especially when spread atop all the other non-spicy components. Maybe I'll try the pickles next time, although I was concerned for it being too sour. My main gripe was that the pretzel roll became more and more the dominant part of the flavor profile, and on top of that, didn't have quite the chew that you'd want in a good bun.\n\nPerhaps I'll have to give King's Sausage a 3rd try next time. One gentleman nearby seemed about as outwardly impressed by his pierogies as you can be, and I need to double-check with the gentleman from the other food truck on what he specifically likes on this menu. For now, I'm rounding up to 4* because of service and because I tend to expect less from food trucks in truck.
