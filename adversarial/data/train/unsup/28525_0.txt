If you like Indian food this, Origin is as good as it gets. All the meat is halal which is nice but if you're a practicing Muslim. If not then you have to order some cocktails off the very creative and extensive list created by resident bartender Joseph. He's crafted some very complex drinks using the same herbs, spices and ingredients the cooks are using in the kitchen. \n\n I recommend the Black Mamba if you're getting something hearty like the lamb or chicken tikka. The Cucumber Pearl was light and  perfect for a vegetarian dish. The Lal Dupata (Red Veil) was also very good  with the chicken curry. We had a few more but I don't recall the names. Keep in mind these take a few minutes to make.\n\nVery well done in the kitchen and the bar!
