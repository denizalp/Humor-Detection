Brandi is incredible! She takes time to listen to you and then makes suggestions on what would look good on YOU. She has cut off many inches from my hair, taken my hair to blonde and back to brown. She is not just an amazing stylist, but a great person as well. She is kind and loving and every time I leave her salon, I feel beautiful and refreshed. I couldn't recommend a stylist more!
