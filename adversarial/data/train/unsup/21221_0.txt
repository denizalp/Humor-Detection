Hands down the best vegan bakery in Toronto! \n\nTheir donuts are perfect. Fluffy freshness all around. My favorite flavors are, Boston cream, cookies and cream, pumpkin, apple cider, chocolate raspberry truffle, and the berry. Ok, pretty much all the donuts I've tried are my favorites. \n\nI recently ordered a pecan pie from them and it was the best pie (vegan and non-vegan) I've had. Just the right amount of filling and the crust was \"buttery\" Crisp. Even the non-vegans were impressed. Which is annoying, as if they never had bad tasting non-vegan food. PUHLEASE! \n\nMind you, I ordered the pie with gluten. Just because I'm vegan doesn't mean I'm gluten free, but they did have gluten free pies available for you celiac intolerants. \n\nSomeday I will eventually try their meals, but with all those donuts, I tend to make them my meal replacement. :X
