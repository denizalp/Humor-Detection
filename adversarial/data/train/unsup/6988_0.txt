I've been here 6 times now and tried their most expensive wash, their cheapest wash, and most of the in-betweens.\n\nFirst off I think the place is extremely overpriced - they definitely seem to want to turn away the \"under $25 car wash\" customers.\n\nThe first two times I went the washes took 70 minutes to complete.  It was a busy Saturday afternoon, but an hour and ten minutes seems a bit excessive to me.  If I wanted to spend that kind of time getting my car washed I would have done it myself.\n\nOne of the last times I went I was preparing for a trip to Vegas where I knew I was going to be the only driver shuttling 15 people from the airport and back, so I put my industrial-strength rubber mats (for camping) in the car.  I paid a few bucks extra to have them cleaned so I could at least enjoy a clean car on the way up, but about half way to Vegas I realized they never put the mats back in my car.\n\nYes, I probably should have checked for the mats, but it didn't occur to me that they would take them out, wash them right next to the car, and then somehow neglect to put them back in.  When I got back from my trip I went back in to retrieve my mats and the guy tried to sell me an interior cleaning because my floors were wrecked from shuttling that many people around.  Fuck you, buddy.\n\nTo give you an idea - I live in the apartments right behind this place and choose to drive a few miles away to get my car washed rather than patronize this business.
