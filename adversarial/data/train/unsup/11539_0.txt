We finally got up early enough to try this place and wanted to see what all the hype was... but sadly I didn't see it.  Maybe breakfast eateries are scarce in this area making this place popular. \n\nWe came in early, a little after they opened, since we read and heard that all their popular pastries are gone within the first few hours they open, like the monkey bread.  Speaking of which they did not have any ready at the time we arrived, we asked about their other specials and they were also not ready. I truly don't get this. The host told us 9 am or later...umm you open at 7 am right?   She said it takes a while to make, okay fair enough, but then why wouldn't the baker come in prior to opening to be ready when the establishment opens or why not open at 9am. If it were a brunch Item I would understand, but that is not the case at all.   \n\nOkay we decided to run some errands and then come back at 9 am.  Unfortunately the items we wanted to try were still not ready at 9am.  We decided to place our order anyway and we would order breakfast and hopefully the other items would be ready by the time we finished eating breakfast.   \n\nWe ordered their breakfast burrito to share, which consisted of a chile relleno, cheese, chorizo, and scrambled eggs.  Sadly I did not care for the taste and honestly I was starting to second guess this place and the great reviews.  We then got our Monkey Bread and Kouign Aman.  I didn't find anything special about the Monkey Bread except for the presentation.  I thought it was overly sweet and just good on the first bite. The Kouign Aman on the other hand was delicious. \n\nThe place is cute, the service was friendly, but nothing over the top food wise and I can't see a reason to return.
