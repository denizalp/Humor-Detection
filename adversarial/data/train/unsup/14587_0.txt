The first time we drove by El Taconento was on a Sunday evening and we were bummed to find out that they were closed. On our street taco scramble this past weekend, they were opened, and they had a small group of people waiting for their orders which was also a good sign.\n\nRun by a husband and wife team (I think) they have a nice selection-Tacos,Tortas, Quesadillas, Burritos and something no other vendor offers, Huaraches(Slippers).\nThey also offer six types of meat selections-Asada, Lengua, Cabeza, Pollo, Al Pastor(He has an Al Pastor Carousel inside) and Birria, another thing no other vendor offers.\nTraditionally made with goat, Tacontento's version is beef, kinda sorta like picadillo(if you had Cafe Rio's Chile Roasted Beef, it is very similar to that)\n\nSo we shared a Taco de Al Pastor, Taco de Lengua,($1.50\/each) and a Huarache de Birria($5) The al pastor had very good flavor with nicely charred bits, and the lengua was oh-so-soft and tenderlicious! There's nothing like a fresh handmade tortilla, and this is the only way tacos are made here .\n\nThe Huarache is a 1\/4-inch thick by 10-inch oval of masa that is griddled to perfection\ntopped with beans, meat of your choice,shredded lettuce, crema Mexicana, and Cotija cheese.Just as good as the ones I've had in the streets of Cancun, and much tastier than the huaraches served at Los Antojos. Wait times vary, depending on how busy they are, but if you are patient, the food served up here is definitely worth the wait. easily becoming one of my favorite street vendors...ALOHA!!!
