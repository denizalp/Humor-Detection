Just go there. Order some sake. Order any appetizer. Order the Tuna Bowl. Order the ice cream (I prefer sake or matcha flavour). Have one of life's culinary fantasies fulfilled.\n\nI'm not kidding. This place is amazing. Sure. you'll wait over an hour to get in because they don't take reservations. Sure, you will be squished while you eat, but it won't matter because everything is so delicious, the staff is so friendly, and you are in one of the most fun places in town.\n\nSeriously.
