The absolute worst car rental experience ever. Would not recommend Hertz to anyone. They have no vehicles on their lot to choose from. They gave me a car with a faulty tire that deflated every other day and told us we had to fix it. When we went back a week later to exchange the car they still had no cars on the lot. See ya Hertz! On my way to Enterprise to solve my car rental problems!
