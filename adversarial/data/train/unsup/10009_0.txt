Crud. The reviews are true. I was hoping my experience would be slightly different from the pack but this place is noisyyy. Even after I asked for the room furthest from the rails - top floor on the opposite side and I could hear the outside commotion all night. I'll admit that I'm a light sleeper but I had hoped by being proactive and asking for the quietest area in the hotel that this wouldn't be such an issue. The staff I encountered were friendly enough and I'd like to give a shout out to the restaurant for letting me order toast and ginger ale via room service even though its not on the dinner menu when I was sick.\n\nThe room itself was a little tired compared to most Aloft locations I've visited - the bathroom could use an extra scrub down (easy fix) and the roll down curtains were cheap\/not super functional. I'll opt for a different location the next time I'm in town. Side note: I'd recommend having the valet crew dress up a bit more - the uber casual vibe threw me off a bit when handing over my keys in the evening hours with limited signage on the lower level of the building.
