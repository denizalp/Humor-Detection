Went in this place last night and I really liked it. So this review is on punctuality. They have so much cute stuff in there. Thought I'd come back in the morning (today, Saturday), to get my wife some stuff while she was away. The sign on the door says open at 10 am. 10 am the doors are still locked. I'm not gonna stand aro\nund and wait for the pleasure of giving you my business. If your sign says open at 10 am, HAVE YOUR DOORS OPEN AT 10 AM!
