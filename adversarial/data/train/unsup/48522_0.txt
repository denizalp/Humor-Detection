As others here have noted - the front staff are pricks.  The middle aged guy and the old guy are funny in a farce kind or way; they both remind me a bit of the comic shop archetype.  You know, the smarmy 'I make myself feel superior by being condescending and snide to the muggles I'm forced to deal with' , which is really just masking insecurity and projecting their presumptions onto others.       \nThat analysis aside, the store is well stocked, reasonable prices, and I've never not found what I was looking for.   Cool place to introduce like minded people to, do the tour around and giggle at the two cranks.  (funny how that reverse superiority works with pretentious low self-awareness types!)
