NO-SHOW and NO REPLY from \"Customer Service\"\n\nBought a groupon for the Chocolate Tour.  Redeemed it online and booked a spot on Friday afternoon. Got to meeting point 15 minutes early.  No one showed.  Went to the first stop and the staff said they were not aware of any tour.  Checked my phone for messages - got nothing.  Left 3 voice-mails on their 1-800 support line, no replies even 6 hours later. Later contacted their chatroom support and was told tour was cancelled, and a text was sent but not to me.  Was offered to re-schedule, but wasting $ and time today was enough.\n\nI go to many tours in Toronto, and this has NEVER happened before.  Will never deal with this company and its poor customer service ever again.
