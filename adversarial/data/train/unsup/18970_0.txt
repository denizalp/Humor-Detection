This would have been a 4 star review were it not for the fact that you feel like you're walking thru the Cabo or Cancun airports the second you try to walk inside. There are at least 3 or 4 nested people at each door who try to stop you and say \"are you staying here? Do you want to see the shows? Want tickets? Are you stupid?\" Maybe not that last one, but that's how they make you feel. Really? Are the shows doing that bad that they have to keep asking? I had someone chase me down as I walked to the bathroom trying to sell me tickets. ugh!\n\nWe got there around noon, which was several hours before check-in, but they still let us check in withoout any trouble. Our room was good. We finally got the king size we always ask for. AC worked, bathroom was nice and big. Our room theme was Sister Act 2, which was kinda weird. Made it hard to do certain things under the watchful gaze of nuns :)
