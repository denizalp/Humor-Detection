My husband and I had been going to their Arcadia location since we moved here about 18 months ago. Frank had been taking care of us. He's a great guy, fun to talk to, and gives a superb hair cut. When he told us he was moving to a new location on 7th Ave., we wondered what we'd do - 7th Ave is a good deal further away. But today we went to their new location on 7th Ave., as always Frank gave us both great cuts and made sure we had a good time and shared a few laughs. We'll definitely be going back to work with Frank. He's just too good and the shop too nice.
