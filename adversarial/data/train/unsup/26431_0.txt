Chilis must be doing very well to ba able to turn away customers. I sat at the bar, chose what I wanted, changed my mind, took a picture of a drink my wife likes, talked to the guy next to me and never got served (~15 min). This place was not busy either. The waitress served the guy I was talking to, looked at me, AND WALKED AWAY.  As I'm collecting my things to go a waiter finally asked if I'd like a drink...not bloody likely!!  It's a shame too, I like the Chilis in the Edmonton airport.
