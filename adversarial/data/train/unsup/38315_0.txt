This location is right next door to the Market mall and it is on the third floor, it is quite an easy location to get to by bus as it is situated right next door to the Bay.\n\nThe waiting period was next to nothing and because most of the staff here is Filipino, I was able to chat about food and my family so the wait went by so fast.  The lab work was quick and easy and it was actually a delightful visit, the waiting room is huge and the place is very bright and clean, a very convenient location to get blood work done, do it before or after shopping at the mall.
