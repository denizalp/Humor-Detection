Not the worst Thai I have ever had, but it was definitely lacking in a few areas. For one, the Tom Yum Soup had microscopic pieces of tofu floating in it that tasted freeze-dried and the ginger tea hot pot came out lukewarm borderline cool. Bummer, because my nauseous tummy was craving ginger, or at least something hot to put it out of its misery. My Basil Chicken, which was supposed to be a 5 in the spicy meter was waaaaaay too saucy and not spicy at all! I mean, I can dig a saucy meal most if the time, but this sauce left me painfully searching for the bell peppers, basil and chicken slices. There were no chopsticks offered to us as well. \n\nThe waitress was very nice and attentive with the water. That was the most positive part. But if you are really craving Thai and cannot venture any further into the city, give it a whirl. For an area bombarded with chain stores and fast food joints, Papaya provides a more unique dining option.
