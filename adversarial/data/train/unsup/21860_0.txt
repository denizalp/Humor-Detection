You know those people who take their babies to pubs? They're total jerks and I'm one of them. I really like this pub because I could be all jerk-like and my baby girl can peacefully sleep since the noise level here is really low, even on a Saturday night! \nThis is such a nice, comfy pub! \nI've only had two meals here and I ordered the same dish - the brie sandwich with roasted asparagus and sun-dried tomato pesto. It's a delicious sandwich and the portions are pretty big. The fries are thin and crispy. \nService is friendly and quick. All in all, I would totally let my daughter get hammered here when she grows up.
