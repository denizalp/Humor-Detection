Why did I come here for buffets so many times?  I think everything here is average.  Not worth the price (not that it's really expensive but you can seriously get the same food at the buffet in Sahara for 1\/2 that price.  I think I am done with MGM Buffets for now. I always have high expectation because of their name but always leave disappointed.
