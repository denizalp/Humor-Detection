Very good. Not a bad experience. \n\nJust got a beef bowl, brown rice, and stir fried. Very good, and I'd go back when I want to grab a quick bowl. Extra sauce is always good! So if you're craving teriyaki, you cant go wrong with this place. \n\nI also loved the fact they have fried tofu as well. I'm trying that next time I go there!
