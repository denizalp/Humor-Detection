We came to look at 3 different vehicles.  One being a car my husband announced he would never drive, much less buy.  Okay then, expect a much larger car payment dude.  The second vehicle was out of stock.  So we looked at the third.\n\nSalesman was supposedly a retired Jersey cop...gruff I guess you could say.  Tried to tell me I wouldn't want the vehicle they didn't have...uh, look out front, I'm driving one.  Pulled all the usual stops like asking me what kind of payment I was looking for, etc.  I especially liked that he lit a cigarette in front of us outside.\n\nBut my favorite part, worthy of an extra star was this:\n\nHim:  \"So what else are you looking at?\"\nMe:  \"a Volkswagen\"\nHim:  \"Oh God (grabs his face in his hands), why the hell would you want that?  Those people can't even fight a war.\"
