Somebody please enlighten me about what I'm missing!\n\nLive close to here so noticed it when it first opened. Didn't go right away, but kept seeing awesome reviews so we decided to try it out. \n\nWe arrived about 10 minutes after they opened for lunch on a Saturday, already 3 tables seated so we thought to ourselves, this is going to be awesome!  \n\nFirst of all, the club music was so loud, I couldn't hear the hubs sitting across from me. Easy fix, asked the server to turn the music down. Much better. \n\nWe ordered:\n-Edamame - this was delicious, fresh edamame with nice truffle flavor. Not worth the price though...\n-Firecracker shrimp - this was pretty good, but I'd rather spend $6 at bonefish grill's bang bang Wednesdays and get a heaping mound of it. Wasn't \"wow\"\n-Lotus chip tuna - similar to the tostadas at Soho. I really liked the lotus chip, but felt the tuna was lacking (both in portion and in taste\/freshness)\n-All 3 tacos - this is when things started to go south. The first one I tried was the tuna, and the only thing I could think of was \"wow, this tastes like that powdery Mexican spice you get from a packet with some mush in the middle\" The Mexican spice was so overwhelming that I couldn't taste the tuna at all. The second one was the beef and I thought \"hmmm, Mexican spice taco shell with Korean bugolgi\". The salmon was the best (nice freshness of fish\/avo\/sauce), although still too much Mexican spice on the taco.\n-Bone marrow - I think these came from a starving cow. Very little marrow, too much crap on top, and greasy tortilla chips on the side. Why would you need salts\/spices on the plate if the marrow itself is already seasoned? (if you want to try an amazing bone marrow for less the price and more portion-wise, try Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Paris)\n-Scallop - too much sauce, couldn't get the scallop. Scallop wasn't quite seared enough on the outside so tasted too mushy.\n-Foie gras - ehhh, have had better. Sauce tasted burnt.\n-Banana dessert - pretty good, nice caramelization on the outside.\n-Green tea creme brulee - you know those crunchy strips of noodles you get at a Chinese buffet to dip in the bright red sweet\/sour sauce? The cr√®me brulee was topped with something that reminded me a lot of that (besides, if there is good caramelization on the brulee, why would you need noodle strips?)  It also tasted way tooo burnt, like I was spooning burnt custard in my mouth. \n\nI think we got something else, but neither one of us can remember what it was...  I guess it just wasn't memorable enough.  On the plus side, service was awesome and the plating is beautiful. Prices are a little steep for what the food is. Don't get me wrong, we don't mind paying for good food. But this just wasn't it. They also need to figure out that a Mexican spiced taco shell plus some salmon poke does not fusion make. \n\nI really like to see little businesses succeed and I hope they do, but unfortunately, I cannot recommend this place to anyone nor will we be back.
