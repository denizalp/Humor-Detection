I usually expect Chinese food to be family style: big dishes, shared. Fu is definitely single serving, which is perfect because I ended up in Vegas alone. I was looking for a vegetarian place and Fu popped up. \nThe menus is ok. A lot of Americanized stuff, as well as some Thai dishes for some reason(pad thai, really?)\nI got the vegan chicken kung pao and was pleasantly  surprised. It came with rice and was well seasoned. I never like regular kung pao but I finished the whole thing. \nSpecial commendations should be made for my waiter, Thomas. He offered hot sauce before I asked, brought out water and chopsticks for my meal, and even apologized when I ordered a drink with cherries, which I am allergic to, even though it was my fault that I didn't read the menu. Excellent service!
