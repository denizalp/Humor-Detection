Excellent Place! From the minute we pulled up to the Hotel Valet, which is separate from the Casino valet which is nice, you don't have to walk through the casino, if you are just staying in the hotel and not much for gambliing or smokey casinos. Friendly, Helpful Service from the valet staff, check in was quick, easy and friendly. The rooms are amazing,  modern, clean, ambiance is superb, one cupper free cofee makers in the rooms, excellent down pillows and super awesome beds. Quality and ambiance! The center bar closest to the hotel check in is a great spot for adult beverages! 247 Cafe, TINA our morning server was SUPERB, helpful, friendly and more. EXCELLENT SERVICE!  Ling and Louies Asian Bar and Grill, nice ambiance and good wine, not too pricey. The Showroom for Live Entertainement: Excellent, the staff, the sound techs and everyone WERE AWESOME! We will be back for another vacation and be sure to telll all our friends and family about this AWESOME RESORT!  The gift shop staff was sweet and nice too-Lots of Cute Things in there!
