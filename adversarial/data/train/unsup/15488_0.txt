Thank God for tattoo removal! A few years back I got married to my childhood sweetheart, (which I thought would last forever) and to commemorate our love we decided to get matching tattoos with one of them being our \"wedding bands\"... And long story short, things ended up not lasting forever, and I've been stuck with an unpleasant reminded of a guy who left me. \n\nI went into Reset tattoo today and was enthusiastically greeted by Blake which was a great welcoming. Then, I had a very honest conversation, and was given great info about the whole process, and what to realistically expect from each laser removal session. \n\nOne of my top concerns, was having the removal done by a top of the line laser. Upon my own research, I found out that some places use low grade lasers that are not even meant for tattoo removal, and that to me is no bueno. I was assured by Blake that his laser was top of the line, and he even showed me his expense receipt to prove that his machine was indeed a costly top of the line laser. \n\nSo after the whole process I can say that I am pleased and happy with the results, I am excited for the future sessions so I can completely erase any memory of my ex. Thank you Reset!
