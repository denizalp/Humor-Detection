I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant and the food was mind blowing, the service was the best I have ever had.\nWe didn't have reservations but they found a way to squeeze us in. \n\n8 courses and I had the best cavier, my first Frog leg(yes it really does taste like chicken but so small, what is the point?) every dish was a surprise and a delight and I did not want it to end.\n\nThey catered to my every need.\n\nIf you want to impress someone and they love foie gras and fine dinning and fomenting and enjoy a wonderful experience, this is where you need to go
