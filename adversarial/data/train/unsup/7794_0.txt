This place owes me money! I mean, serious kickbacks!\n\nI learned of Sweeties at the fantastic Yelp event at Ft. McDowell Adventures in March. I ate a candy, grabbed a bag of candy, and won a $10 gift card in their \"Plinko\"-esque game.\nSince I rarely make the trip to the east Valley, and I don't each much candy, I gave the gift card to a coworker. She came to work the next week, glassy eyed and sugar rushed and sharing candy left and right! She admitted she was overwhelmed upon walking in - she really had no idea there could be so much candy in once place.\nYeah. She's right. The place is HUGE. And overwhelming. And So.Much.Fun! It's impossible not to be in a good mood here - and it's impossible to only buy what you were planning when you came in.\nWell, the first coworker I sent in now makes Sweeties a regular part of her shopping routing. She told another gal at work who lives in Anthem. (I didn't tell her about it, or give her the gift card - as Anthem is just so far!) Well, last weekend my coworker who lives way up north happened to make a trek to the east part of town. And happened to add Sweeties to her list of stops. While in sugary nirvana, someone called her name. Yup - it was the other coworker - the one I first told about Sweeties in March. I think she lives in there now. \n\nSo - thanks to Yelp  - not only have I found a sugary place of goodness, I have turned at least one and possibly two coworkers into regular customers. Yeah - I want a finders' fee. I will keep sending people in, I will continue to enable and encourage addictions (including my own from time to time), and Sweeties can pay me off in future dental work! So worth it!
