I have to agree with fellow reviewers - this is the best fish and chips in Toronto that I have found. \n\nMy partner in crime, Christine C, and I headed to Olde Yorke to prove that there is some good fish and chips to be had in this city and so I could indulge in a deep fried Mars bar ; ) \n\nWithout stealing my brother Vivek's \"punder\", this place was great, just for the \"halibut\"! The fish to batter ratio was stellar. The batter was thick, but not concrete wall thick. It was deep fried goodness, but not greasy. The chips were seasoned (unlike Reliable) and dense, but not soggy. The portion size was large, but if you arrive hungry, you will finish the plate. \n\nChristine had the fried clams. Man oh man...I may have to have these when I come back!! \n\nThe decor is very cosy, like you are in a pub across the pond. Even the bathroom is cute. \n\nThe staff are helpful, friendly and seem to be enjoying themselves. \n\nThe deep fried Mars bar is gross-good. You know you shouldn't eat it, but you do because it is ooeeyyy goodness. I did leave a piece of fried batter on the plate. An offering to the Fried Gods.
