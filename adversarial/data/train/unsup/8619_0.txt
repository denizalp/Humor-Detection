Ever since my buddy took me to a cigar lounge in San Diego, I have been hooked.  I can't remember a more relaxing time out.  I have since scoped out some spots here in Phoenix, and Churchill's has been fantastic! \n\nThis spot is super chill!  They have a large humidor with an almost infinite selection of cigars.  They have a couple of TVs (One huge one near the front of the shop), a fully stocked bar etc.  Customer service has been amazing the 2 times I stopped in here.  Great ventilation and incredibly comfy chairs will keep me coming back.  \n\nPrices may be a tad more expensive for certain cigars, but overall, I will pay a little bit more to be able to sit back and relax at this joint.  Can't wait until my buddy comes out to Phoenix to take him here!  I have been incredibly impressed and will continue to come back whenever a cigar craving comes about!
