My cousin and I went to try the place \nSalad and breadsticks was ok \n\nThen came the dinner \nLet's just say it tasted frozen out of a jar \n\nWe took one bite and told our waitress \n\nShe came back and said that they wouldn't take the money off our receipt \n\nWe had a bogne pasta and Marsala \n\nThen we asked for the owner and the rude manager came out and said he was out of town \n\nThen she accused us of eating half of it and we didn't \n\nFinally after waiting an hour for our receipt \n\nThey end up adding a 20% charge to the bill \n\n\nDo  not EVER go there \n\nWorst service \nRude manager.
