Pretty good little steakhouse for being on the outskirts of Vegas. I came here with a vendor for work with a party of about 20. The prime rib was awesome, baked potato was overwhelmingly huge and super good. We had shrimp cocktail some other various appetizers that were good, check out my photos. \n\nWould I come back? Yes, but only if I was in the area, which I don't know why I would be 10 miles off the strip. If you're near, I highly recommend!
