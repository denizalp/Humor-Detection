Nothing more to say about this place than it's a must try.  Amazing food, great food and great service. We ended up going here since the main location on Adams had a 2 hour wait. Lucky for us, the owner and chef, Chris, was at this location. He even came to greet us on his way out to head to the restaurant on Adams.\n\nGo try this place. You won't be disappointed.
