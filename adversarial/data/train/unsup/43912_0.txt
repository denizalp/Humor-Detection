One of the most satisfying buffet choices in Vegas for the money.  At Cravings you don't need to deal with huge lines like you do at Bellagio, Rio, or Aladdin.  The food is fresh, turnover is high, and the price is reasonable.  Advice:  Don't make rookie buffet mistakes!  Walk past all the bread, pasta, and salad choices; the seafood is hidden all the way in the back of the room.
