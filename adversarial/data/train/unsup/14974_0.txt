What an awful dinner!  Server was the worst we have had in a while!  Extremely slow (took 15 minutes to get my wife's soda, which we probably wouldn't have gotten if I didn't search her out to ask again for it) and could care less.  Food came out in a timely fashion and was less then stellar!!!  Over fried chicken fingers to he point that they were dry and tough and apparently when the wings are on special you only get 50% of them covered with sauce!  I remember not too long ago when this place was average; unfortunately it is no longer that!
