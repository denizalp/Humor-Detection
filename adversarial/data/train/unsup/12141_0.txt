I was having a really nice night with my friends.  They go here a lot.  I wanted another glass of red wine.  I am local. I rarely go out because I travel for work. \n\nTonight I could not pronounce Pinot Noir to the bartenders expectations. (Which my spell check just picked up).  I was told I was too drunk and escorted out by a big Samoan man. For no reason at all. This is not the first time this has happened to me at this venue.  I hadn't even had 2 drinks.  Your bar tenders are pushing away good locals.  Born and raised in Vegas, I will never recommend this place again.
