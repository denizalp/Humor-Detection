Stopped at Raw Food Express for a Meet Up group and was there on the wrong day or so I thought. It was the wrong day as the meeting was set for the up coming day but it wasn't the wrong day to meet Xavier and his welcoming spirit.\n\nRaw is such a cool atmosphere I ended up engaged in a great conversation with a very nice young man, enjoyed a green smoothie and took home a wonderful Kale salad. \n\nMy advice would be to stop by on purpose try the samples and enjoy the great food and wonderful hospitality of Xavier. I do plan on coming back to Raw for more of their wonderful food as well as my friends and family members I shared the tasty Kale salad with!
