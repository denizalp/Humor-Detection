The thin crust pizza with pepperoni, sausage and garlic is one of my favorite pies in all of Phoenix.  So good and so addicting!  I pretty much stick with that when eating at Fatso's.  I tried their wings and the Big Johnson specialty pizza.  Wasn't really a fan of either, but I'm telling you, you won't go wrong with a thin crust with pepperoni, sausage, and garlic pizza.  It's INSAAAAAAAAAAAANELY good!!!  Dip the sucker in some ranch, and you got yourself a deliciously, decadent and gluttonous meal. Damn, that's some good $#*%!
