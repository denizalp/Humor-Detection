I called about a month ahead of time to check and see how it would work to have a group of girls come and do a wine tasting for a bachelorette party. I made a reservation for the day and time we wanted and decided we would do their \"bachelorette\" tasting which is 5 tastings for $18\/pp plus tax and tip. The regular tasting is 5 for $12\/pp I believe. The only difference is that they \"wait on you\" meaning they come to your table and pour your wine... which I guess you would have to go inside and get each tasting if you didn't. Seems odd that having someone come by and pour isn't just assumed, but I guess it's because it's a small place with only two people available working. We probably didn't need a reservation even though it was on a Saturday, but they don't charge you for a reservation so it could be a good idea. She forgot we were coming anyway, but the patio was open so it worked out fine. They have a deal where if you buy two bottles you wave a tasting fee, but that isn't included in the bachelorette pricing. I would say just pay for the regular tasting and save some money. A plus is that you can bring your own snacks--cheese\/crackers\/fruit, which was nice. The wine is pretty good and it's a cute and quiet spot. Overall a pretty good experience!
