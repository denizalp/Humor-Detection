Been here many times for bar and tables.  Food always good and bartenders can be anywhere from overbearing to downright non-existent.  Depends who ya get.  They never seem to make small talk though.  Place gets packed for brunch.  White people LOVE brunch.  Bloody Mary bar is cool.  Only thing that gets me is that the place is WAY overpriced on their booze.  Snifters of beer for 12.00?  C'mon.  Better come with a reach-around.  Guess now they have a limited late night food menu that has good deals so just have a few and mosey on down the road....
