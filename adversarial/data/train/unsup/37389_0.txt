If only I could keep 32 Shea g-14 classified forever! It's that rare gem you don't want to share because you would rather keep it a secret. The coffee is on point every time, my favorite is the rosemary honey latte. The staff is uber friendly, so friendly you wish you can give them a hug for their awesomeness. Breakfast (try the lox) lunch (must have roast beef) , or happy hour (try lemon drop) you will not be disappointed. Dog friendly too which is an A+! Last but not least the patio is remarkable. It's the perfect ambiance to enjoy reading a book or catching up with a friend. 32 you are worth the drive from Scottsdale every time! Other coffee shops need to drink your \"kool-aid\" because you are awesome sauce!
