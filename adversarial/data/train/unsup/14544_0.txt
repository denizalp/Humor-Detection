Pretty decent venue. i went and saw a show here and was on the guest list so i can't really tell you about prices but from what i hear the are relatively low -$10-$20. So not bad. They do search you before you go in also... so leave your damn guns at home okay..mmkaay thanks.\n\npretty big inside. Nice stage area. Small but you can make due patio outside. Good beer bottle section-they had Guinness so they won me over in that dept. One thing that sucks is you can't bring alcohol over by the stage. So you either gotta watch from \"behind the line\" or leave your beer and hope you can come back to it and its not taken or have a rufi in it.  \n\nIm big on bathrooms- and this one was not the cleanest so ladies squat don't sit.
