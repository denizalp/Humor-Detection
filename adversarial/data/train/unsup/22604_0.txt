FAT PEOPLE STAY AWAY \nThey have the smallest bathroom I've ever been in. If you're pushing anything over 300lbs you may not fit and I'm 100% honest on that one. \n\nThe beds suck and the pillows are just air, I was better off using my arms to sleep.\n\nShower was quite useless and the AC has 2 settings, freezing or blizzard . \n\nCustomer service was also crap. Our room had 1 or 2 bath towels tops when 4 people are sleeping in it and we called in for extra towels and after 2 hours NO ONE SHOWED UP. \nPlus good God I mean there were only 5 families on front of us at check in and it damn near took 45mins to check in . \n\nOnly stayed here because it was extremely last second . I never plan to be here again.
