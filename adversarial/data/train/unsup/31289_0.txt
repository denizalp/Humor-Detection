I have been a patient of Dr Morantes for about 15 years. He has always been truthful and very compassionate about what was needed to be done on my teeth. My last visit he said I needed two crowns and after a discussion with his friendly and helpful office staff we worked out a payment plan that will allow me to get my crowns. Thank you Dr Morantes and your wonderful staff!
