Imagine Denny's with portions twice as large, food quality a little better, and a decor that is totally fun, old school, 80's Las Vegas. Oh, and add pretty servers in short skirts.  This place is 5 star fun with 3.5 star food.  Definitely a good deal and a great place to sop up the booze with a big, late night breakfast.  Don't forget to take a peek at the fireside lounge before you go.  It's fun too.
