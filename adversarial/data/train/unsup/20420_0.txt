Haven't been disappointed, yet! We have gone to Lazy Dog at lest once a week since they have opened. We've had the best experience every time - from service, to food  and ambiance. The bar area is perfect for watching games and the patio is perfect for open air dining...but be warned - MUST LOVE DOGS - because there can be a lot of them in all shapes and sizes. We haven't seen any dogs misbehave or worse (insert emoji - you know which one I mean)...it's been a really pleasant experience.\n\nRecommendations: hummus platter, calamari, vegetarian lasagna (incredible!), fries with the lemon aioli sauce, veggie burger, fish tacos and ahi. We don't eat meat so it's great to have so many options on the menu.\n\nSo many things left to try! We'll keep going back.
