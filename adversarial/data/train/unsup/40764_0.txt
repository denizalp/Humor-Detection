I'm a fan because i can go to the salad bar for 8$ and my man can get a big sandwich just the way he wants it too.. Great deal, fresh and not expensive at all... \nTheir salad bar is always fresh and organic is a plus!!! :D\nAnd another plus : i think it's the first place i went to that offer 2 sizes of portion but not \"normal or XLarge\" but \"normal or light\"!! and that is definitely a great step!!! ;)
