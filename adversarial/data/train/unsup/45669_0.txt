Audio Contractors did a great job for my house.  They rewired the speakers upstairs and installed their own surround speakers downstairs and built the 5.1 system with my receiver I brought from my old home.\n\nTheir estimate was so much better than competitors and John never delayed or missed any appointment or schedule.\n\nThey are very knowledgeable.  The other competitors initially said installing speakers on my basement ceiling was so hard but Audio contractors did not even mentioned about that and wired them without any problem.
