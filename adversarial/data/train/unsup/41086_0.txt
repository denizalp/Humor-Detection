Solid stack of half BBQ ribs with decent sides to pick from when getting a dinner combo is a bit on the pricey end since the sides seem to have gotten smaller (in a tiny container). The fries that came with the ribs were also soggy, so not sure if it's cause we waited too long to pick up the order. The tiny container of beans were delicious, just wished there was a bit more. \n\nI can see why the ribs may be considered award-winning, as half of the menu is just a list of awards they've won in the past. The beef brisket was also tender and delicious, but I personally like the ribs over the brisket. The corn and mac n' cheese are also good sides as well, just again wish it was bigger portion than was was given.\n\nEach take-out dinner box had a fork and knife (even though on the menu it claims that utensils cost $0.50 extra, so just keep that in mind). Parking can also be tough as there are only a few spots located outside the restaurant and just keep an eye out for coming in and out of the small parking lot.
