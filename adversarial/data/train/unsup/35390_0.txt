Out of towners - call ahead even on weekdays! We showed up tonight (monday) and the only space for us was at the chef's table, overlooking the kitchen. That was actually very pleasant to watch the food prep, but it was surprising that all the tables were booked for the next 1.5 hours when the space is large and the patio is huge! Also, it meant having to sit on high stools with very difficult to reach hooks underneath the counter for our purses.\n\nDecor is gorgeous - high ceilings, Edison lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling, candles, huge glass walls looking onto the patio & canal... Very romantic and chill.\n\nOur server was very friendly and pleasant. We had asparagus bruschetta, bacon wrapped dates, the sweet potato cannelloni, and tried both sangrias. All tasty. Had toasted coconut and white chocolate raspberry gelato for dessert. Food was good quality, focaccia & pesto were great for setting the Mediterranean\/California vibe.\n\nThe general manager even came to check on us and we enjoyed chatting with her. Lots of friendly people in a beautiful relaxing place with tasty food. Exactly what we were looking for (minus the high stools) on our vacation!
