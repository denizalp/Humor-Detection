We're going to keep the good times rolling here with another two stars on the hit parade!\n\nCandlewood is an odd beast. Being an extended stay hotel I would have to imagine that most of the occupants are college\/university students. That reason alone should make you think twice about showing up on St. Patty's day weekend. We were on the ninth floor and lucky enough to be away from the louder gaggles of children but it was wall to wall 18 year olds in the lobby when we came home at night.\n\nOur suite was a good size for two people. A relatively comfy couch and an easy chair provided some seating and the kitchenette was a welcome home for all the cheese and meat we bought. The exhaust for our stove was attached to the room next door however so our room smelled like whatever they were cooking or smoking at the time. My most confusing moment was the combination of weed and buttered toast. I wasn't sure if I had a contact high or was having a tasty stroke. Then the fried chicken smell took over and it was time to leave.\n\nHousekeeping will come if you ask for it but it's once a week otherwise. You have to take your towels and sheets down to reception if you want clean ones or you could wash them yourself in the laundry room for a few bucks.\n\nThe hotel is clean and the staff are very very nice. The elevators work and you can watch tv...ummmm...yeah that's all I've got.\n\nSo, if you're looking for an inexpensive place to stay for a while and you don't mind some quirks or obnoxious neighbours, Candlewood is alright. You might want to find a place that's a little more quiet and doesn't constantly smell like cigarettes though. Your call.
