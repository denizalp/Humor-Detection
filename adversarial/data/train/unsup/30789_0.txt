My partner and I received a 2 for 1 deal on the buffet.  I was pretty sure I was going to love this buffet, and it was OK at 1\/2 price, but I I would not pay full price.  I did not care for the wine at all, and the only complimentary beer offered was bud light. Personally,  I don't consider the free beer and wine a perk.  You pick up your drink from the bartender, so that is a separate tip from you server...not so free since the glass of wine isn't even worth a buck.  There was nothing here at the buffet that wowed me.  My partner liked the prime rib, but as usual he says it tastes like roast beef and not prime rib.  They are too heavy with the peppercorn as a seasoning on the outside.   The chinese broccoli and asparagus looked really fresh and delicious, but looks were deceiving.  They looked fresh, but both lacked flavor, were too oily and tough.   They have someone tossing your salad for you, which is a nice idea to have one person handling all the salad items, but the reality is a long line at the salad bar.....ugh.   Why not hire someone to make fresh sushi rolls instead?   The fresh fruit was nice, but in typical Vegas buffet fashion, the desserts are more for show than for taste.  Even the sorbet was way too sweet and tasted artificially flavored.   Too bad, I like the mirage poker room and would like to visit again and have a nice, reasonably priced buffet on site  next time I visit.
