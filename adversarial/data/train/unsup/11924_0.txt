Me and my Curry kick are at it again.\n\nWhile others complain of it not being Hot enough, I Ordered mine mild and it was a bit spicier than other places \"mild\" but it was just right to me.\n\nI was first served a bowl of broth with a few veggies(see pics) it was good.\n\nI ordered the Red Curry with Tofu (see pics)\nI thought it was OK, it was mostly bamboo shoots and peppers with tofu, there were only two green beans and 4 very small pieces of eggplant in there. \nKinda disappointing after the abundance of veggies I've gotten at other places.\n\nAnother bummer is they don't serve you that yummy little egg-roll with your meal either.\nI was really looking forward to that, so I ordered them separately (see pics) and they were not as good as I hoped.\n\nNo choice of soup or salad , you just get soup and No egg-roll. So while it wasn't bad, It wasn't fabulous either. \n\n\nNEXT!\n\nP.S. on their daily special board they misspelled Broccoli as Broccori...hee hee hee
