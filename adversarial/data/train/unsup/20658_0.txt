What happened?\n\nMy favorite place lost some stars:(  \n\nBummer!  \n\nGlad I didn't bring any new guests on this visit. \n\nThey must have gotten a new chef?\n\nOrdered the Korean box (Bilgogi) which came with a side salad, mini Cali roll and macaroni salad.  Sorry to say the bilgogi was bland and dry. Very disappointed.  It came with a Miso soup and it was never brought out?  Mac salad was also bland. They always bring out some little appetizers and those were tasteless as well.  \n\nService was good but music was terrible.  \n\nThe hubby was disappointed with his meal too. \n\nHope they get it together this was my favorite spot:(
