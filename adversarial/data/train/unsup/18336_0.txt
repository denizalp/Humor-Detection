Alcohol ice cream in Old Town? Lee, you are a genius. Talk about looking at the demographic to figure out what fits best and liquor immersed in a frozen treat is it. \n\nWhen I heard about two of my favorite likes joining forces into a bionic ice cream, I added it to the top of my list to check out and I'm disappointed in myself that it actually took me this long. But, today, after a filling meal at a delectable wine bar down the street, I knew that the only way to get through the 115 degree day was by stopping by Lee's to check it out. \n\nTrue to my ice cream feign self, I tried nearly every flavor to the point that my waistline begged me to walk out and leave before I did something I would regret. But I didn't listen and continued to taste test and figure out what flavor was going to make the cut. The lemon drop was by far the best alcoholic flavor. It was refreshing and alchie filled all at the same time. For the chocolate lovers like myself, the peanut butter chocolate chip won favorite in my book. The ice cream was definitely creamy and delicious. The peanut butter chocolate chip had real chips and large scoops of fresh peanut butter. Yum! \n\nNow this ice cream isn't exactly, low-cal but I did learn that they don't use any eggs and it's preservative free. So that has to count for something right? It's pretty thick too, so I was easily satisfied after only half of my cup. Can we have the option of mini sizes Lee? Please!? My waistline will say thank you. \n\nSo that is the end of my summer afternoon visit to Lee's. I will definitely be back again and again. It's also right next to Oh My Dog, so it would be genius if they offer iced treats for the doggies too!
