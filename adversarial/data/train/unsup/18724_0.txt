New poke spot across from UNLV. It's right next to Bowlology and Cafe Rio. This place is very comparable to Soho and To See Roll. It fills my sushi and poke cravings. I had their dragon bowl but I also customized it with other toppings. The food here was really fresh and flavorful. Their unagi (eel) is my favorite. Plus they offer brown rice ! I love that they also have seating along the wall if you prefer eating by yourself , which I do a lot during my lunch breaks when I'm at school.
