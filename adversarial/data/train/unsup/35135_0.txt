What once was a five star rating has now slowly declined to an average experience. In the past three times that I have visited, errors were numerous. It seemed like staff were less interested in amending issues. Quality of food and presentation seems very dependent on whether or not Tory Miller is in the kitchen that evening. \n\nThe menu has been shortened and simplified in the past few months. There are some veteran dishes and some that rotate. We regularly enjoy the goat cheese and some of the pintxos. One of the popular dishes here is the grilled octopus. It was so simple but so good; tender, warm, served with potatos, paprika, olive oil, and salt. Once one of my favorites. My past visits have included issues of the meat being under cooked  or the dish being extra salty.  The restaurant has been around too long to have issues like these. \n\nThe desserts remain strong. Basque cake is still a must and something that all the guests that I take to Estrellon die for.\n\nThe service remains a strong element of the experience. Staff on the whole are courteous and prompt, with exception to the issue noted above.. \n\nStill a good dining experience, but, some of the original luster that I associatied with Estrellon has worn thin.
