My kids went to this location years ago. After having to take several days off to treat them both for pink eye on more than one occasion (never had that problem before), I decided to contact the director. I asked her if this was something they saw a lot of. She informed me that when there is a large volume of kids in one place, pink eye is very prevalent. I informed HER that my daughter (not enrolled there) had been in public school (a place with a large volume of kids) for the last five years and she NEVER had pink eye. I continued by asking if they were having the kids wash their hands regularly. She looked at me as if I was speaking Chinese and said they do that before they eat. I asked well, what about when they come in from playing outside. Another blank stare... \"Well, if they're very dirty, we'll wash their hands\". I said, \"You do know that if they have been playing in the dirt and they put their hands in their mouths, they can get worms, right?\" She laughed and said, \"That's an old wives' tale.\" Wow. I was stunned. \nIn addition, my son is lactose intolerant. I had to pick him up and take him to the hospital because some moron put cow's milk on his cereal. When I asked the director why he hadn't been given the Lactaid that I had provided, she said that he had run out and she didn't think that little bit of milk would hurt. What a moron! I ended up having to quit my job and pulled them out of there.
