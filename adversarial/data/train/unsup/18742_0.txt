There's no reason to go. I can't express how disappointed I was with this museum of rock n roll. It's a hodgepodge of disconnected galleries that make no statement about music or its evolution. The costumes and instruments they have on display are interesting for a while, but are either on loan from private collectors or just plain fakes. Several times I looked closely at the \"hand-written lyrics\" and \"hand-written notes\" only to find that they're photocopies of originals. The museum label didn't state that I was looking at fakes, but photocopies with hand cut edges are quite obvious. Just a few of those made me doubt the authenticity of everything else on display. Sad, and disappointing.
