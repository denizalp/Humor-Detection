If you're not familiar with this airport, it can be a little difficult to navigate through as far as which terminal to drive to for drop-off\/pick-up. If you're being dropped off by a taxi, Uber, or hotel shuttle though, you should be alright.\n\nThe first few times flying out of here, going through security didn't take that long. However,  my most recent flight was two days after the shooting at the Ft. Lauderdale airport, so security seemed more amped up than usual and took a lot longer to go through. \n\nWe were required to put not just laptops in a separate bin, but also cell phones, tablets and all other electric devices. Not only that, apparently certain food products are now causing censors to go off- I was required to go through extra screening because I had too much candy in my backpack. Go figure.\n\nOverall, it is what it is. This airport serves it's purpose.
