The food was good.  Service was okay. Neither were spectacular.  In my opinion, the prices do not match the product.   I personally feel like I shouldn't have to pay as much for my lunch to stare at a gallon can of garbanzo beans.  Again, the Antipasto salad was good however ummm it is salad people.  Just salad.  I feel that Vegas is lacking in good Italian places so I understand your stiffies for this place but for me, it just didn't cut it.
