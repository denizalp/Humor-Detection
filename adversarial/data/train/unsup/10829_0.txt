If I was French, and had a nice ass, I'd have a Gallic-rear. This mall has nothing to do with that. But it's scary looking out of the windows, for sure. In that sense, it's an Eerie view.\n\nThis mall is mostly for people who work downtown and is really not a great mall in terms of shops - and even less so for food options which are minimal and not particularly great. But the YMCA here is pretty awesome. And there's a really cool tall building right on top of the mall which can be seen from miles around.
