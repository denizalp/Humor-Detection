I've been to Papa Chang many times before and I have noticed the quality of food deteriorating over the years. I usually order the minced pork rice with sausage. I like how they minced the pork into small strips instead of using standard ground pork -- it makes a LOT of difference in taste. \n\nPapa Chang recently opened in Pacific Mall and my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try at this location. I ordered the minced pork bowl again. To my surprise, I see who I persume to be Papa Chang himself inside (same as picture). Anyways, I was watching the server scope and minced pork and chop the sausage -- I just casually asked if she could put more sauerkraut. Papa Chang told her  \"Put the normal amount, sauerdraut is extra cost.\" RIGHT IN MY FACE.\n\nAwkward moment for me and my boyfriend standing there. I can't believe they can be so stingy. I told my boyfriend -- if they don't want to add a few pieces of sauerkraut, they could have not said anything and gave me the normal amount. If they let me hear PUT THE NORMAL AMOUNT...before I even eat my rice, I've lost all my appetite.\n\nNow the critique of the minced pork with sausage:\n- mushy\/watery rice, very hot\n- the egg tastes bad (I just ate the egg white and threw away the yolk)\n-the pork tastes normal (thankfully, not a total waste of my $6 ) \n-overall I give 2 out of 5 points, but I must deduct 2 points for the bad service, so in the end it will be 0 points... \n\nNever coming back.
