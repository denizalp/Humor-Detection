Very impressive buffet for $50 on a Saturday. They had prime rib, several different kinds of fish, lobster ravioli ( you need to pick out the Lobsters in this dish), lamb, pan fried quail (not good at all - no taste and not very good texture even though it looked good), salads, kobe sirloins, etc. I think they had some Chinese style dishes (one was roasted pork belly). This place sure has lots of variety and for the most part fairly good quality control. There were some odd dishes and some dishes with very poor quality control which is why this place doesn't get a 5 star. They had a nice selection of desserts, but not the best overall quality. The ambiance is nice and comfortable like an indoor country style setting. Maybe a little too much Chinese style influence on the food (esp with the strange stuff like quail and pork belly). BTW the quail was nothing like true authentic Chinese style roasted quail which is way way way better than Bellagios. Just b careful not to overeat... This will be my last buffet in a long long time if not ever...
