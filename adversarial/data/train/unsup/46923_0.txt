This place is fantastic.  The owner chef has a gift. I am so spoiled. \nWe eat mostly lamb and chicken curries, spicy, they have never sent out a dish that wasn't pipping hot and perfectly spiced. The owners are very nice people as is their staff.  The only possible negative thing to say is the lunch buffet  can get picked over and be very slow to replenish. \nI imagine if I got there early it would be better, so....if you like buffets get there super early.  Like 11:00.
