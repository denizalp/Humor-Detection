Imagine eating soup out of a bowl and when your done the soup you can eat your bowl. That is exactly what you can do at panera bread. Panera offers a great variety of breads bagels, soups, sandwiches and salads. The food is always made fresh daily. But with freshness comes issues. If you come to this restaurant at night for diner they may be out of the bread or the bagels that you want to eat. Most of the meals come with either an apple or the kettle chips. There is a large variety of drinks available and the service is great for a fast food restaurant. I highly suggest this restaurant as it is a sit down fat food restaurant probably in and out within 30 minutes.
