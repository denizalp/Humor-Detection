Compared to all the other restaurants that serve Japanese food in the area, I really think this is one of the best ones. It's arguably the best bang for your buck and even though you might not be getting the atmosphere like Red, you're going to have the same quality of food in a corner shop feel. \n\nI really enjoyed it because for the price, you wouldn't think you'd get the presentation they provide but it's got a real Japanese feel to it.
