I have never eaten food here.  Moxie tells me there is no food served in the evening, just drinking, but that you're welcome to bring food from somewhere else to go with your beers.\n\nThe good:\n- Good selection of draught beers and very good selection of bottled beers - Coopers and the special edition Innis & Gunn\n- Cheap.  We had 4 or 5 Coopers and it was like 24$\n- Great staff - very cool people, very cool recommendations, great time all around\n- Great crowd - it was a bit older, people who live in the area, everyone was happy and there for a good time, no one was out to cause problems\n\nThe bad:\n- it's hard to get to from my house.  Seriously, I can either take a trolley and a bus or a trolley and the subway.  I want to only take a trolley.\n- I wish they had SOME food\n\nWould I visit here again?\nYes.  Yes, yes, yes.  Absolutely.  If it was easier to get to it would bump Prohibition for my local.
