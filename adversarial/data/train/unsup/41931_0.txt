I've been seeing my Primary Care Physician at this location, and have occasionally opted for Immediate Care's after hours health check, for the past several years.  Parking is free and I've never experienced a wait time longer than 15 minutes.  The only downside I've seen with seeing both my Primary Care Doctor and also immediate care here is:  You better walk in with your symptoms and questions list in hand, because they only see you for 10 minutes!
