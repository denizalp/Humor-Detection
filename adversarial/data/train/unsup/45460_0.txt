Their portions are pretty generous but definitely on the more pricey side. If you want to experience some Thai street food this would be a good place to start.\n\nI really enjoyed the soft shell crab pad Thai, it's great to share! Their som tum (papaya salad) was pretty Spicy too so if you're not too afraid of a good spice then definitely worth the try.\n\nGreat ambiance for some bites and a drink!
