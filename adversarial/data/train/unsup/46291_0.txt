What a five star treatment \nI'm from Washington and was down in Las Vegas for a meeting and broke a tooth\nSomebody suggested Bella smiles and what a vip treatment I got \nNot only was the Dr very gentle but the staff was very helpful and worked great with my insurance \nI will fly back to Vegas for any major treatment I know now for sure
