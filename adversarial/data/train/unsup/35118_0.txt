Visited for lunch today.  We have not had Thai food as good as this since visiting NYC.  Nice young man helped us navigate the menu.  We had a sample of crispy wonton for app along with cup of Tom Kha for myself and fresh spring roll for my husband.  We both had seafood drunken noodle for entrees and green tea.  Everything was superb.  Will be back and telling friends about this new place.
