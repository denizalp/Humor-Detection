I finally made it to Crab Corner during my visit in early February and enjoyed our visit. The service was great from the moment we walked in to the ending of our meal. We visited the week before Valentine's day and they had the special menu for 2. Our special menu for 2 choices were the appetizer trio which came with crab cake, bacon wrapped scallops, & bread with crab dip and for our entrée we got the lobster and snow crab legs. The entrée came with choices of 2 sides, we got 2 rice, garlic beans, and cole slaw. A bottle of red wine and for dessert we got the caramel cheesecake with ice cream. My other half and I enjoyed our meal. Everything was delicious and by the time we got to dessert we were so stuffed that we only finished the ice cream and I had to take the cheesecake with me to the hotel. I am not sure if  the special menu is just for Valentine's day but this is a great deal. Reading the latest Yelp reviews, I am not sure what happened, but we had a great experience. I can't wait to be back again @ Crab Corner.
