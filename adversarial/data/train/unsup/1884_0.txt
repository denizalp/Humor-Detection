Went in for breakfast this morning around 10am and got seated right away. Good size restaurant and patio with casual atmosphere. Our server was Cathy and she was phenomenal! Very nice, constantly checking in with us, and always made sure our water, coffee, and creamers were full! \n\nStarted off with coffee that was delicious and steaming hot! Served in a huge 12-14oz black mug. Good flavor with different kinds of creamer on the table to choose from. For my meal I got the 3 pancakes with fresh strawberries and whip cream. It's was delicious! The strawberries were very fresh and sweet. The pancake itself was huge, thick, and fluffy. \n\nI got bacon on the side as well. Came with 4 large slices of bacon Very Crispy. I love my bacon crispy so it was perfect but if you like it a little under done make sure to request it and they are happy to accommodate(they did it for my friend)! \n\nOverall everything was great! Good food and awesome service. Looking forward to coming back and try something new.
