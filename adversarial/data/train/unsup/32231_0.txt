I love their dim sum! So far it's my favorite place in town for it. I'm a shrimp fan and they have so many options for me. The coconut buns and sesame balls are delicious. This is a place that any dim sum fan should try at least once.\n\nI haven't tried their regular menu items, but I've heard great things. I intend on checking this place out for dinner so I can see for myself.
