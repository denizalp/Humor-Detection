I tried Olive & Ivy for the first time and it was amazing! I love the decorations and the atmosphere. The 2 hosts at the front, Whitney and Natalie, were really sweet and helpful when I mentioned I wanted a table outside. I got the market soup (cauliflower) which was delicious, and some of the bruschetta. Our server Joe was  awesome too! The atmosphere and food is great but the staff makes it even better Would highly recommend and I'll be back soon!
