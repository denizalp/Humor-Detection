Not having been in here in years, I was reminded of how many locally made products there are out on store shelves. Whilst haunting this store I discovered items and delicacies from...\n\nBrunton's Dairy in Aliquippa.\n\nFontana Pasta in Verona.\n\nGrandma Ann's in Gibsonia. \n\nDonatelli's in Pittsburgh (Liberty Avenue).\n\nBackyard Garden in Ohio Pyle.\n\nZum Zum Pierogi in Lower Burrell.\n\nForbes Buffalo Farm in New Castle.\n\nAnd I'm sure that's not even the half of it, but they were closing in an hour so we had to make it snappy. \n\nThey also carry products imported from all over the world and lots of other items from within the U.S.; offbrand items you would never find in a Giant Eagle, Foodland, or Shop N Save. \n\nWho the heck took the Strip District, complete with Wholey's and Whole Foods,  and squeezed it all into a suburban grocery? Really, this place is nifty and is bigger than what it appears to be from the outside. \n\nThey also have a HUGE meat counter. You look at all that fresh pork, beef, deli meats (Boar's Head), shrimp, crab, and fish under that glass counter, and suddenly you want to buy it all and hold the neighborhood cookout of the century. \n\nThere's fresh, wet, crisp produce for miles as well. Yes, this is in Castle Shannon of all places. \n\nEnter: McGinnis' potato salad. \n\nYou know how I am.\n\nThey let ya taste stuff. \n\nI had already planned on getting tater salad from Frisch's not far away,  but it looked SO good and tasted even better. THICK pieces of potato. Creaminess. Crunchy bits of bell pepper.\n\n\"We make it everyday, dude,\" the large gentleman behind the counter says to me as he looks at me with one eye, gauging my response, banking on me not walking out sans a tub of the tater salad.\n\nSo our family meal ended up with 2 pounds of tater salad-one from McGinnis and one from Frisch's. \n\nBoth were very different yet would go to an even draw if they fought. \n\n$5.39 a pound! Ooof!\n\nThat would be my only caveat about this grocer: everything's a little pricey, but I guess that's to be expected when you buy organic, locally raised food. \n\nIf you can afford it, stay away from Wal-Mart, and give McGinnis a try, be it this location or the McGinnis Sisters shop on Route 51. \n\nThe McGinnis family schism has made for more variety in our local grocery scene. Be thankful.
