The owner\/lady in authority started an argument with me cause i paid 18 cents less in tips, then tried to explain to me that i was legally required to pay more tips cause the food inspector told her so. When i suggested gratuity is my choice and not a service charge and i could even choose not to pay if i wanted to. Thats when she started yelling at me infront of every guest in the restaurant. I have never been in such a ridiculous situation in life. The food and the price is not worth dealing with that behavior. NEVER GOING BACK EVER AGAIN!
