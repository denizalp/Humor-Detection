I like it here, more for the rows of vitamins, lotions, herbals, homeopathic, than the food. Fairly large produce but not all organic, decent frozen section, oddly small grocery section. They have flowers, cut and growing, a couple plants, and growing herbs.\n Friendly staff, who actually escort you to things you ask the location of. It's usually clean, large parking lot, located by a Robertos.  :D\nLol
