Sushi Roku will always have a special place in the heart of my wallet. I was in vegas for a bachelor party. Initially my group of 16 was going to eat at Texas de Brazil, but after a couple days of buffets and steaks the guys in my group couldn't handle it anymore. We made last minute reservations at Sushi Roku for a party of 16 on a saturday.\n\nI arrived a bit later but when I did some of the guys were getting hooked up big time at the bar with shots and drinks which was real cool. We were seated after taking some shots and just started ordering an assortment of sushi rolls and king crab fried rice. The king crab fried rice was simple yet so pleasing. It really hit the spot and filled us up quickly. Sushi rolls were all pretty decent. Of course we all partaked in sake bombs. \n\nThe service was off the charts. The waitresses were so accommodating and polite. Upon getting our check they said we could take $400 dollars off. This was absolutely mind blowing. Apparently one of the guys of our party was chopping it up with the General manager unknowingly and complimented the dude on his $1600 dollar armani suit. BAM instant savings son. We all suspect he performed sexual favors to get us the discount. You do what you got to do when you are a team player I guess. I kid I kid.\n\nAnyway the meal was decent, the service was ridiculously good, the restaurant decor was swanky and chill, and the bill for us, vegas standard wise, was an all time winner.\n\nGeneral Manager Johnny. Compliment the guy on his suit *cough*. The dude is an all time legendary great.
