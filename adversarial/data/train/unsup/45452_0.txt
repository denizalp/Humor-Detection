Ok, so maybe I do things wrong. I start with a place's Happy Hour to see what a venue is like. I have to give the wait staff at Cien Agaves 5 stars. They were awesome, but the experience was less than memorable. They had some issue where they did not have chicken tinga. Coincidentally a Happy Hour item. But then, it took 20 minuets to get guacamole. In the mean time my party ordered a quesadilla with grilled chicken. Guess what?  We had steak instead. I understand the sh** happens, but the management can't make substitutions?\n  Maybe try it again, but, maybe not
