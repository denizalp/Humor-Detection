Well, ya see, we were having trouble to get my girlfriend to help out picking apples out of the orchard tr ees.  She lost her courage from seeing papa take a dive off the roof a couple years back that crippled him up pretty good.  But we need help picking and the more hands the better.  So I herd about this climbin place and we thought it was really nice.  They just hatched out a nice litter of pups which were really cute to.  Anyways we pay the man the money and get all harnessed up to have some fun.  I goed first and made it to the top no problem but my girlfriend had a hell of the time lettin me down.  She got her hair all caugt up in the rope device.  Then somethin terrible embarrassing happened.  It was her turn to climb and she done alrite enough but dang it if she werent warin any britches under her skirt and lord have mercy when I looked up it was like starin strate into nothin but briar patch and butt crack.  I let out a bit of a yelp and others came over to see what was the matter and since I was so embarrassed I couldn't get the rope device to work either.  I yelled up to mama to cover up but she wouldnt let go of the wall.  By this time mama was gettin all panicked about the heigt and we finally got her down.  Alls good as ends well I guess but holy mary full of grace it was embarassin to have the whole place laughin away like that.  we will go back if mama needs more trainin.  the man at the desk says she ain't in trouble and she can climb for free if she wants to come back and he is workin.  Really nice folks all in all.
