My niece has attended Delta West Academy since first grade, and is now 16 years old. During this time, I have watched her blossom into an intelligent, poised, and confident young woman.  Having met some of the teachers and administrators at Delta, I am absolutely convinced that they have played a major role in my niece's development, as they care so much about each student, and they make sure each student knows this.  If we lived in Calgary, I would not hesitate to send my own children to Delta West Academy.
