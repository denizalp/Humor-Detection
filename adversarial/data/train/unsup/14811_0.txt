So, me, my bf, and our friend roll up on Hot n Juicy. When I invited my friend, she says, \"Oh, crawfish. I haven't had crawfish since Miami. We used to go to crawfish parties all they time and they'd have BUCKETS of crawfish.\" So I'm getting all riled up. I've never had crawfish. \n\nSo we get there and each of the tables are covered with a plastic table cloth and there's a roll of paper towels. I'm like, \"Aw, shet. Things are gonna get messy.\" \n\nSo I order a pound of crawfish ($9), hot n juicy special seasoning, mild. Because I'm a pussy like that, I have spice issues. What. Bf ordered the same thing, but spicy. \n\nThe waiter gives each of us a bib that says \"Let's get crackin'\" and has a lobster on it. Let's get crackin' indeed. I thought I was gonna be the only asshole with a bib on, but apparently everyone does it. So it must be alright. Like unprotected, premarital sex. And crack. \n\nI was looking forward to this all day long. I had a three-hour long, GRUELING work out, and all I could think about was some hot n juicy craw daddies. \n\nThe waiter dropped our crawfish in plastic bags. Little crawfish in a puddle of awesome spices. \n\nWhen we started to dig in, we realized we didn't know what we were doing. And our friend that went to crawfish parties in Miami? Didn't actually eat the crawfish there. She just drank beer. So we asked the waiter for help and he obliged. \n\nOnce we got the hang of it, it was all cherry. It just seemed like a lot of work for a small meat yield. \n\nIn the beginning, I couldn't bring myself to suck the juices out of the head. But then I removed myself from the idea that they were once living animals. With eyes. That stare at you. \n\nThere are places that are good for drinking beer with food. Not only is Hot n Juicy good for beers with food, its not only perfect, its down right necessary. I almost didn't oder a beer, but halfway through my hot n juicy and spicy meal, I had to get a beer. \n\nI ordered fries, too. Which came in handy in soaking up the extra juices.  The seasoning was so good. I was licking off the excess from my fingers and pulled away a stub. \n\nFor the two dozen crawfish, four beers, and fries, we paid $46 before tip; average $15 per person. I would not recommend going here hoping to feast on a budget. \n\n(I hit this place up, because of Famous Teri's review http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/hot-n-juicy-crawfish-las-vegas#hrid:1Kovc8dDQe3xUhdKabbpFw) \n\n* off the strip, non-casino
