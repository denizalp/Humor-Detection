When in Vegas...\n\nLooking for a legit Mexican food spot?! Phat Phrank's is the REAL DEAL. Believe the hype, it's real. Phat Phrank's was found (luckily) on our Yelp app by searching \"breakfast burritos\" - imagine two people from Hawaii (where we have zero legit Mexican options) who just got off the airplane at 7am. My hubby is from Cali and misses good Mexican food on the daily. So, of course, I'm not going to say \"no\" to breakfast burritos. And a five-star worthy breakfast burrito?! C'mon, #feedthehubby\n\nWhen we pulled in, there were zero cars in the lot and zero customers. Not gonna lie, I was suspect. But, trust #YelpNation to get it right. Jacob greeted us with a smile and recommended basically ALL of the breakfast burrito meat choices. My hubby and I both decided on carne asada breakfast burritos. Winners!!!! They were tasty, not greasy, fat, and I am totally in love with the thin fried potato - my mouth is now watering, just great. Jacob also gave us all the salsas to try and they were all super tasty. He was super friendly and made our meal at Phat Phrank's that much more enjoyable. To top everything off, we got a holy yumminess of 32oz Horchata #happybellies\n\nThis place is a serious gem and I wish we could have stopped by for lunch or dinner. But, there's no doubt, Phat Phrank's is in our rotation from now on \"When in Vegas...\"
