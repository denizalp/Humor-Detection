not great... was waiting so long for our food that i believe a manager or owner asked me if i needed anything else and i told him our food would be nice... omelet was overcooked, corned beef hash was obviously from a can... had a side of biscuits and gravy that tasted like dish soap... .. potatoes were of the previously frozen variety and more or less flavorless... its unfortunate because the breakfast joynt was actually a decent restaurant and i recognized some of the staff from its previous incarnation but perhaps the cooks were not some of the carry overs...
