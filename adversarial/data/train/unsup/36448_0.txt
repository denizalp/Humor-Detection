I should have followed my gut instinct and turned around when I sensed they don't cut women's hair - but the sign said they did and they could take me right away.  In my 57 years of living, I have NEVER had a bad haircut until I let them cut my hair.  The virtually bald barber kept remarking on how much hair I had as he proceeded to hack away.  In the end, the right side was noticeably longer than the left side and there were numerous sections that were an inch longer than the rest.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough - didn't even argue when he told me the charge was $2 more than originally quoted.
