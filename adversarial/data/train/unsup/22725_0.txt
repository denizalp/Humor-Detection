Basically, if you combined all the pottery stores with all the antique stores, and threw in some place that made weird metal sculptures, then this is what you'd get.  This place is packed full with so much crap you don't really know what to do with yourself.  The inside portion is rather uninteresting, with lots of stuff that looks like you could get it all on the Mexico border.  A lot of the stuff is unfortunately not unique as I saw lots and lots of multiples of things.  Outside however is a different story.  There is pottery for days and all sorts of iron work to keep your eyes entertained.  venture a little further and you will find an entire room full of Native American drums and a giant orange leg.  You really have to see that one to believe it.  Wander some more and you will see a metal version of pretty much every animal and plant you can think of.  This store is great for entertainment value, but not really for buying anything.
