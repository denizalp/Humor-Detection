One of the most wonderful places I have gone to in a long while. The food was AMAZING and the service was OUTSTANDING.\n\nOur server's name was Paul. He was quick to explain the menu and take our order. This server's knowledge of the menu was phenomenal!! He knew how everything was prepared and what ingredients were used. He was polite, witty and even remembered all of our names at the end of the evening.\n\nThe food came and everything and I mean everything, had such fantastic flavors & presentation. We enjoyed the Caesar Salad, Mac n Cheese and Meatball Pizza. BRILLIANT! And finished off with a scoop of ice-cream that MELTED our minds. Salted Carmel Chunk! Booya!\n\nYay for you Honeysalt!! Give your boy Paul a raise. He's a hell of a server and asset to your restaurant.\n\nThe only thing I would have liked is a more intimate ambience. I can tell they've worked the space the best they can but it was just too open and slightly noisy. But don't worry. The flavors in your mouth will make you soon forget where the hell you even are. \n\nChances of me coming back? How does as soon as my alarm clock goes off tomorrow morning?\n\nThanks!
