Came here to test out for work as a potential catering option. Had such high hopes, maybe it was a fluke. Co-worker had told me how delicious, moist & tasty the food was when he had it at a wedding-sadly I was let down. Ordered the BBQ Sampler-Deluxe (pulled chicken, pulled pork & brisket). The pulled chicken was dark meat & very tasty to my surprise. The brisket & pulled pork both was dry & bland. With all the meat a dinner roll would have been nice, but no. Baked beans were yummy & peppery. Mac&Cheese was a bit grainy. Workers were really nice, but a bit slow for the lunch time crowd.
