This is the only store where pants fit me. Size 0 SHORT. They have it. Hallelujah!\n\nI feel like everything else is overpriced.\n\nCustomer service is really good. Commission maybe? CSR showed me where the jeans are and grabbed me a couple different styles when the one I tried on wasn't fitting me the best. And she gave twizzlers to my kids (daughter was crying and she was totally cool about it).\n\nThe fitting room was GROSS. I see the pics on here from last year and it still looks they way, actually it's worse. Like they haven't cleaned them at all. I didn't take my shoes off ( which made trying on jeans super difficult). I don't get it. Every retail job I've ever had you'd have to sweep out the fitting rooms and clean the mirrors EVERYDAY. How is that being overlooked?\n\nI come here for the pants. In and out.
