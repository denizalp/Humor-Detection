I like my chocolate like I like my shoes: shaped like shoes.\n\nAnd at Sweet Designs you can find the highest of heels composed completely of decadent European style chocolate, ready for a hard night of clubbing or to feed the inevitable craving brought on by rejection and visions of long-term loneliness. DJ, play my jam!\n\nIn all honesty, the samples I sampled (a dark chocolate covered potato chip, sea salted caramel and a button of milk) melted in due time and with a tempered slowness. Cheap chocolate disintegrates once touched and stuff too rich with cocoa butter has a fatty mouthfeel. Sweet Designs product is smooth and sweet without being cloying, making for quite the dandy candy.\n\nThe ladies behind the counter are all too eager to toss you a sample, and I believe the master chocolatier graced us with her a presence, along with a tray of freshly prepped chocolate-drizzled popcorn. Her exasperation and projected sleeplessness let us know the supply works tirelessly to meet demand, and that demand ain't dwindling.\n\nPrices are to be expected with truffles running $20-25\/lb and dipped goodies a shade less. Get a few singles, walk out $5 poorer and show your best O face, because this cocoa is more like cocOOOH YEAH! \n\nHorrible pun. It's late. Deal with it.
