I'm not the biggest lover of pie. As a chocolate lover, I always found apple pie (a family fave) to be a disappointing dessert. SO when I started hearing amazing things about The Pie Shack in The Beach, I never really jumped on the bandwagon... What a regret. This isn't your average President's Choice Loblaw pie that your mom reheats. It's fresh, flaky, thin pastry crust that is packed full of fruit. When I arrived, they had a lot to choose from: raspberry, strawberry and cream, strawberry rhubarb, bumbleberry, and apple and cinnamon. I opted for the raspberry, heated up (no ice cream). And my friend (shout outs to Kent P) selected the strawberrry rhubarb. We also shared a pot of chamomile tea. The bill was $16 - not bad!  The raspberry pie was very tart, and reminded me more of a large sugary raspberry turnover than a piece of pie. I love raspberry-filled everything, so I was in pie heaven. The strawberry rhubarb was a bit more traditional with more of a buttery crust (mine was better). The space is very rustic with large wood tables and cottagey decorations. The owner is so helpful and was quick to refill our pot of tea without us having to ask. There's also a very cute old dog that hangs out by the bathrooms - very sweet. Worth the trip to The Beach!
