In the past couple of years we've been back to The Harp a few times and always have had a good experience, except for one thing.  We stopped in for a late lunch on 12\/20\/15 and I've saved the receipt this long to remind me I had to update my review to mention how bad the mussels were.  For $12.99 we got a bowl full of clear, flavorless broth, with some onions sprinkled throughout and about 12-15 sketchy mussels.  Three or four had not been debearded, 2 weren't open, 2 empty shells, and well, it was just the worst 13 bucks I've spent on an appetizer in a long time.  The description says \"with white wine (no), onions (some), and herb liquor (what?) broth\".  The accompanying bread was cheap and barely warm.  Fibber Magees and Tim Finnegan's are way way better.  Someone from The Harp needs to go check them out.  \n\nWe didn't send them back because my husband said he would eat them anyway, but after I had to pull the beards out of two I gave up.  Just no.\n\nWe also had the chicken and leek pie and the beef, mushroom, and ale pie.  Both of those are good, but the beef pie has a richer flavor.  Marci took great care of us at the bar and made a beautiful Black Velvet for me.  We'll still go back, but no way on the mussels.
