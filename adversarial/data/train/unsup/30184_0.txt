Great guys. I was involved in an accident and the offending driver had Statefarm. I looked up the collision center and with 180+ 5 star reviews it is hard to avoid them. I dropped off the car on Saturday and it was ready by Thursday. a little hick up along the way mainly because Lexus didnt send the paint onetime but no biggie. Most of my issue was with Hertz rental car and their lack of costumer service but ended up leaving the rental car with LV collision center and they took care of rental pick up for me.  Special thanks to Mark Stewart for his help with the rental situation. \n\nThanks again
