Solid ramen bowl.\n\nI chose the shoyu (clear) broth with the pork belly and was not disappointed.\n\nFrom the extra I chose (egg, corn) none really worth it. Half an egg is 0.75$, the corn was 0,75$ for probably 1\/5 of a cup, or a small handful. \n\nKnowing that one full egg is 0,25$ (3$ carton) and a can of corn is around 1$. It's a bit high, the extra 1.95$ for noodle, I totally understand because it's labor intensive, same for broth. But dumping corn from a can, that's not.\n\nThe sad thing is, I think the soup needs the corn. It adds just a little bit of crunch and sweetness that balance well the broth. \n\nI know it's ridiculous to pick for 75 cents, but I feel kind of ripped because I know I could get a full can of corn for that price.\n\nIf they would just give me 1\/3 to 1\/2 of a cup of corn, that would be well worth it.\n\nI might go back and haggle for more corn.
