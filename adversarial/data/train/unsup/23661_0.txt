It was the perfect cozy hole in the wall we were looking for on a rainy night. Great service, good drinks. \n\nI'm docking a point because I thought it was kinda overpriced for the neighborhood, but maybe they're trying to scare away the college kids?\n\nThe Habs game was playing, and I would definitely come back for another sporting event. It's cool though, there are televisions very accessibly located for viewing, but it absolutely does not feel in any way like a sports bar. \n\nClean restrooms, friendly clientele, lots of green. Also, very important, a covered patio for smoking. Boom.
