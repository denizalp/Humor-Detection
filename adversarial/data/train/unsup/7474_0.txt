Disgusting. Ordered a 4 cheese pizza and they used something processed instead of cheddar. \nImagine a layer of Velveeta on a pizza. Then they had the audacity to say it tasted processed because the oil from the pepperoni and sausage leaked on to it. \nIt's 11pm, I'm high with the munchies, I waited an hour, and this pizza is inedible. How nasty does a pizza have to be that a hungry stoner can't eat it? \nIf you're a smoker, boycott this buzzkill
