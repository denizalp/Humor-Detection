If you run a business and want to lose your customers, select this company to deliver your products to your customers. I complained to Amazon.com so many times about this delivery dis-service that they actually changed the code in their shipper assignment system to now allow a carrier to be deprioritized. That means that if you call Amazon.com and ask them to \"Deprioritize Ontrac for your address,\" starting 2 weeks later you are unlikely to get another delivery from Ontrac!  Hallelujah. That said, it has still been too much hassle reaching this point. And Ontrac could care less until enough people have them deprioritized that Amazon simply stops using them entirely.\n\nHere is the content of a Better Business Bureau complaint I filed against Ontrac over a week ago, asking only for a phone call addressing my concerns as satisfaction of the complaint. Note that Ontrac's response has been ... \n\n... [insert crickets] .... \n\nThey don't even care that they offer a lousy service. \n\n*** BBB complaint text below ***\nI have been having ongoing problems with your delivery service since purchasing this home in this new location last summer. The delivery driver for my neighborhood seems absolutely committed to intentionally providing the most incompetent service he can manage, though thankfully it is mostly passive aggressive and only once did he actually yell at me. \n\nI can't even tell you how many times he has left my gate wide open after leaving a package, which has 4 times resulted in my packages being stolen before I could retrieve them, since he also doesn't ring the bell or call out to let me know he has made the delivery. I do not have this problem with UPS, USPS, or Fed Ex drivers, only this one from your company. I went to the effort of buying a door sign that says \"please keep gate shut\" and putting it on my front door, but still he would leave it open. I called Ontrac supervisors 5 times to complain about this and was told they would go over delivery procedure with him. The result was that the next time I saw him he yelled at me for getting him in trouble by complaining. \n\nStill trying to improve the situation, I calmly told him that I had thought about it and figured out a solution that might solve the problem, namely that the other delivery drivers all pulled in front of my driveway then entered and exited by the side gate to the front yard, whereas he always parked across from me in front of my neighbor's house then entered and exited through the street-side gate. That gate is harder to shut, needing a firm slam, whereas the side gate shuts with just fingertips. \n\nInstead of him taking this information in so that he would be more likely to shut the gate as intended, he yelled at me again that it wasn't his job to listen to me, and walked away in a huff. I then bought a lock to lock the front gate, and put a sign on it saying to please use the side gate, with an arrow pointing toward it. Still he and he alone would leave the gate open, only now the side gate because he couldn't get through the front one. \n\nAfter that I stopped complaining to your company and started complaining to Amazon.com, which is the company that keeps selecting your company to deliver my purchases. I told them that I didn't want them sending me packages through Ontrac anymore. After 5 such complaints, they changed their policy to allow delivery companies to be \"deprioritized\" so that it is unlikely they will ever be chosen for a given address. \n\nUnfortunately, it seems impossible to 100% guarantee that is the case, which is what I want at this point. I'm tired of my packages being left out at the street, as yesterday's delivery was, instead of being brought to my door. I'm tired of large packages being left up against the door so that the door cannot be opened from inside. I'm tired of small packages being left right at the edge of the step so as to be sure to be in the rain, when 90% of the front stoop is covered. I'm tired of the gate being left open, which is an issue not only for theft but also for my dog running out of the yard if I open the door to get the package. In short, I'm tired of Ontrac. \n\nSince I can't seem to get Amazon to stop using you 100% for my address, and am reluctant to stop purchasing from Amazon since I use them a lot and have for about 8 years now, I am writing you as a last recourse. It is my hope that it is possible to get a different driver assigned for my street. Surely it is impossible that all your drivers could be like this one, when no driver for UPS, Fed Ex or the USPS seems to have any trouble bringing the packages to the door, setting them beside the door well within the doorway so that they are not in view from the street nor out in the rain, then ringing the bell or calling out to let me know the package has been left.\n\n*** End of ignored BBB complaint ***\n\nObviously I wrote this before reading all the other reviews here on Yelp. Clearly bad service isn't an exception, but the rule at Ontrac.
