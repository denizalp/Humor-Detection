Riding a horse remains one of the more iconic activities for anyone visiting the western United States. The Koli Equestrian Center on the Gila River Nation is just outside the urban area allowing for a taste of the open range close to the city.\n\nOperated by the nation residents, the center offers several great options including sunset, sunrise, and wagon rides good for everyone. The guides come from the area giving real insight into the land and the experience. They are also very good with the horses and helpful with riders of all levels. \n\nMy sunset ride was perfect. We mounted the horses and took off into the desert. You have free reign over the desert with the guides deliberately meandering around. The horses are fine with riding side by side or nose to tail and are well trained. Sunset was about halfway during the ride, and margaritas at the end capped off a great time.\n\nThe prices are very reasonable with lots of good specials. They are great for families, couples, and everyone in between. Koli is a great authentic horse experience in the unspoiled desert and should not be missed.
