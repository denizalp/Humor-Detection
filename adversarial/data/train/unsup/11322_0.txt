Service, ambiance and food I give 5\/5. Spacious seating, clean restaurant, friendly staff, and food came out fast.\n\nSo I can't believe I waited this long to try this place as it is so close to my house! Wish I got our servers name because she was pleasant and attentive the entire time. \n\nWas in time for happy hour which is daily from 9PM-1AM (closing time). Nice selection for happy hour and prices are not bad. $5 for appetizers and $8 for entrees. And definitely come hungry because the portions of everything were generous!\n\nMy favorites:\n-Fried Dumplings - good starter food, very crunchy\n-Gan Jjajang - the black bean sauce was salty but when mixed into the noodles it was just right. So much flavor!\n-Stir Fried Mushroom - Again so much flavor in these sauces. Rice is a separate charge but definitely order a bowl if you order this because it is a very wet dish.\n-Buchu Jap Chae - comes with 3 buns to eat the pork and veggies with, ugh I'm craving it as I type!\n\nMy friends ordered a lot more items but sadly the food coma hit me so early I could not go on lol. But everything I was able to try was seriously delicious. Probably one of the best Asian places I've had in Vegas, and there really isn't that many that stand out for me but I was impressed with this one.\n\nAnd I'm super freaking happy they are open late because while my sleep schedule is all F'd from working night shift, it's always a struggle to find good late night food that's close by. Great experience overall.
