Wow!  What a cool find - in the PV Mall!\n\nRight by the Southeast entrance of the PV Mall (just south of the glow-in-the-dark mini golf place) is Maya Ice-Cream Rolls.\n\nI saw their sign, and had never heard of ice cream rolls, but hey!  They had me at ice cream, right?  Was it going to be ice cream sushi?  No idea!  But had to find out.\n\nWhen we arrived, the very nice lady behind the counter gave us menus, order forms and pens, and explained the process.\n\n1) Pick your ice cream flavor (chocolate for me this time)\n2) Pick your concept (I went with the Monkey Roll - Nutella, Banana and Strawberry)\n3) Pick two toppings (I went with banana and coconut)\n4) Pick your sauce (chocolate - sounded like the right flavor profile for this combo)\nBonus - Whipped cream or no (duh...yes!!!)\n\nWhile the gentleman was making our dessert masterpiece, we got some information on the product.\n\nThe ice cream isn't scooped out of a pre-made\/frozen bucket - it's in its liquid pre-ice cream form (made fresh every day)\nThe mix-ins are put on a chilled marble slab, then the ice-cream-to-be liquid is poured on.\nEverything is mixed\/chopped\/spread\/remixed\/respread\/repeat until you have a freshly made ice cream full of fresh goodies in a thin sheet on the freezing marble.\nThen, the maestro of mixation curls the sheet of ice cream into rolls about 3\" long.\nThese are assembled into a cup, where your toppings and sauce are then added.\nAnd, of course, the whipped cream.  :-)\nThen, you have a seat, and sit down and enjoy!\n\nMy daughter commented what I was still figuring out...each of the flavors was individually detectable, and that was a good thing...usually, the mix-ins kind of blur together, but, for whatever reason, you tasted each individual flavor in the ice cream rolls...\n\nBottom line, this is a fun, and very tasty dessert.  The people running it are very nice people as well.\n\nSo, stop reading this.  Get in your car.  Drive to PV Mall.  Give Maya Ice Cream rolls a try!\n(You can thank me after you finish your dessert)
