I normally do clean my house bi-weekly but due to some circumstances, I badly needed a cleaning last minute. And so, I found Fast Friendly Spotless here on Yelp and inquired through their website. I was able to communicate with Pam who was very accommodating, helpful and friendly! Since I haven't used a cleaning service before, she assured me that I'll have a good experience through them and that surely was what I got! I got 2 living areas, kitchen & dining areas, a half bath and a full bath cleaned by Dayana who was professional and nice. She did an excellent job all throughout my house and would definitely recommend their services!
