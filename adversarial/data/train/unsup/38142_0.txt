I ordered the wild berry iced tea and mango...juice? The result is it sucks! The juice tastes sour and a little bitter. I could bearly find out my drink is actually fruit tea except for the color. Apart from that, the waiter made us feel like he wants us to leave as soon as possible cuz we just ordered two drinks at midnight. He kept asking us if we want to order more and before I ask him for the bill he just put it on our table.
