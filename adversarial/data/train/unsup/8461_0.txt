Not recommended.  Very expensive.  Tries to push new A\/C units and service policy.  \n\nI called them to check the status of my A\/C which wasn't as cold as it should be.  Before they even started the diagnostics, the technician explained to me how much of a money pit my A\/C unit was, how the main air transfer shaft was for a different AC unit (no it wasn't!), and how I should buy a new unit.  Again, let me reiterate, he hadn't even started inspecting the unit.  Also my unit was only installed 5 years ago. (but out of warranty)  And the part he said was old and wrong, well it's a custom part that ONLY fits my A\/C unit to the hole in the roof.  He was totally trying to sell smoke up my you-know-what.  \n\nTurns out my unit was low on the \"freon\".  The typical A\/C guy response is there must be a leak.  Well besides that, he said it would cost thousands to diagnose the leak, so I should consider buying a new unit.  He must work on commission as was really trying to push this new unit.  I told him to fill it up, and if I have problems, I'll go from there.  \n\nAs for the inspection, all the tests turned up fine.  The unit was clean on the inside, motors were running in top order, there was nothing obvious or wrong.  Just the low freon.  \n\nAnyways, he filled up the freon.  Said he put in 5 pounds but only charged me for 4.  And the total bill?  $400!!  Do you know how much freon costs?  About $5 per pound.  So that's a $380 markup before business expenses.  On top of that he tried to push the service agreement virtually guaranteeing another \"free\" visit pushing expensive services.  No thank.  \n\nOn the plus side, they did wear disposable \"booties\" when they walked in the house. \n\nI don't recommend Parker and Son's.  They are big company with high expenses and charge their customers up the wazoo.  I see their trucks all the time, and it makes me cringe that I used these guys ONCE.  Never again.\n\nPS., check out the \"filtered\" reviews at the bottom of all the reviews.  It's a rather obscure link that hides many negative ratings.
