If you are in the mood for superb brunch in Vegas, Terrace Pointe Cafe is definitely a good choice.\n\nAs it's located right by the pool of Wynn, to make the most of the beautiful view and to indulge in the feeling of truly be on vacation, asking for its patio seating is the only way I'd do it.\n\nAs to food, I'd highly recommend their French toast, smoked salmon with eggs and bagel, and crab meat Benedict. We loved all three dishes, no doubt!\n\nSpent $118 for three people, including drinks, tax and tips. It's worth it for the quality of food, service and view.
