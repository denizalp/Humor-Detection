DO NOT MOVE HERE!! They lied to me about move in specials, and left me stranded at a hotel my first day in Vegas because of electricity issues in my apartment that weren't disclosed until the minute I was set to move in. They charged three times what I agreed to pay, and knew I had no choice. (A uhaul, a dog, and no time to find somewhere else). I didn't get the apartment I was showed, they moved me into an upgraded \"black appliance\" one for $100 more a month and one less bathroom. \n\nThe apartment is old and cheaply put together. The floors tear easily and the walls look like a child painted them. The ac hasn't worked half my lease and only after putting in 20 work requests do they do anything about it. Lily and Chris in the office are completely unreliable and very rude. They don't see the residents as people, just another annoying part of their day. Also, this complex, while one of the cheaper ones in town, it's for good reason. The sounds of kids screaming and what sounds like baby rhinos running above you will keep you up at night because no one knows how to control their children. (They've thrown rocks at my door on more than 2 occasions) However, if you enjoy getting your door knocked on by random crack heads and trying to figure out if what you just heard was a gun shot, car backfire, or firework; than these apartments are for you!\n\nAlso, don't forget to check out the google reviews the office workers wrote about themselves!
