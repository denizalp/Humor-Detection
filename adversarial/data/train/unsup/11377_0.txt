This Spartan Race was about 9.5 miles and 20+ obstacles in the blazing sun and dry desert of Las Vegas\/Gravel Pit. There were many, many, many uphill and downhill dirt climbing trails. Very dusty  and no grass or water in sight. The rocks\/dirt made this race that more challenging, actually rolled my ankle twice, but fought through it to the end. The toughest part of the race I would have to say would have to be the barbwire mud crawl over jagged rocks\/mud. I'm not the smallest guy and with all my legs cramped up, a true challenged conquered! AROOO! \n\nOverall, when all said and done, its an indescribable experience of achievement and lots of fun. 2 more races this year (The Beast and The Sprint)...and then I achieve the coveted \"Spartan Race Trifecta\"\n\nIf you have thought about or have been wanting, stop thinking or talking about it and just DO IT! You won't regret it! G-LUCK! AROOOO!
