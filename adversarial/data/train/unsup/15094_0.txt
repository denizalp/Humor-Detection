Schwartz's, you are the stuff that smoked meat dreams are made of.\n\nI've been coming here my entire life.  As in before I learned to crawl!\n\nSome detractors may speak negatively about your long lines and your lack of customer service.  \"P'shaw\" I saw to these detractors.\n\nI love the karnatzel - ask them to throw it on the grill for a few minutes.  All the better.  And - sacrilege as it may be - I like my smoked meat old fashioned and LEAN.  I don't feel that ordering it lean at Schwartz's dries it out.  It's perfect.\n\nTop if off with a black cherry soda, and welcome yourself to the cool crowd.\n\nI can't wait to be in Montreal in September... my taste buds are already excited.
