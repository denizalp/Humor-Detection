Called and made an appointment to get carpet done on a job that is ready to go. Appointment was set for the next day at noon. I texted and called 1 hour prior to confirm. Didnt hear back. At 12, time of appointment, I got a text that he would be 1 hour late. Waited 1 hour and 15 minutes, made a couple calls at the 1 hour mark. No response and no show.\n\nHate to leave 1 star reviews but a simple call or reschedule would have stopped the review
