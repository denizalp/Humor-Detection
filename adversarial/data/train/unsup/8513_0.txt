I'm always happy to have a new Mediterranean dining option, and when I heard Two Bald Bros moved into the downtown area, I headed over pretty quick. Menu has pita sandwiches, plates, and a few specialty dishes like their shakshuka. Unfortunately, a recent change in hours means that you can only get your fix on weekdays before 6PM. Kind of a bummer, hopefully not a harbinger of closure.\n\nFIRST VISIT: Came in to signage hyping their falafel, opted for the wrap. This was rolled up taco style and served with a tasteless tahini. If they included hummus, I couldn't tell because there either wasn't much of it or that too lacked seasoning of any sort. The portion size was large but I prefer the more classic smaller, stuffed pita sandwich as this one didn't hold up well and resulted in a mess. Falafel was pretty good though, nicely crisp on the outside with a soft interior. Adding options for a spicy sauce, red cabbage, and pickled veggies would make this really pop.\n\nI saved this as a draft and planned to return for their shakshuka for my second visit before posting a review. unfortunately, the business closed before I could make the weekday only hours fit my schedule. You really can't limit your business that much and survive in DTLV.
