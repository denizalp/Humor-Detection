I visited this place with some friends to have brunch. I think it is a nice place with good staff. \n\nThey had a breakfast buffet, I think mostly for free breakfast patrons of hotel, but we opted for menu. It is a little overpriced for what they serve. My omelet was good but not exceptional for the price. Wait staff was very friendly. For tea, there is not much selection considering the price. \n\nI would rather go to other reasonably priced places at walking distance next time I am there and I am paying out of pocket.
