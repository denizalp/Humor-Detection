The food was delicious. I have to say we started off great and went downhill. Roger our waiter, seemed overwhelmed as the dining room got filled up. Items were forgotten, yes mostly mine. We are entertaining an out of town guest, this was a bit embarrassing. \n\nThe best was one he lumbered over with a pathetic Birthday something, and walked away - leaving us without any silverware. I ordered cappuccino. It was lovely that the bus boy came over after my friends got their coffee and tea and said \"Roger forgets our Cappuccino machine is broken.\" \n\nHe brought over a plate of 3 tiny desserts to make up for it. \n\nNot impressed. Back in the day, they just seemed to care more. \n\nStep it up.
