Senza Pelo med spa is awesome.  Great & fair pricing with overwhelming support and willingness to help skin and cosmetic goals. Maria quickly and painlessly removed a few cherry angiomas. Don't try to do it yourself!  Staff is communicative and informative to helped direct to a treatment that will be best for me personally. I'm excited to meet their nurse in the next few weeks for treatment consultation.  Give this place a try.  Phoenix's hidden gem for all. Thank you, DeeDeeR
