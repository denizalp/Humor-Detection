The food is good, but if you're in a hurry and want to order take-out, don't come here.  Even on nights when there is hardly any one in the place, the service is extremely slow.   The prices are too high for a take-out diner too.  The only saving grace is that if I order the \"large\" portion, I can get two meals out of it.
