My review was deleted, so I must rewrite without naming names.\n\nAnyways, although Dr. Grant is friendly and makes you feel at ease, the staff is what caused me to find another office.  There is a certain non-gentleman there that accused me of trying to get a refund for contact lens that I had bought 3 months back (a 6 month supply).  I had just put on a brand new contact lens that morning and my right eye became blurry.  Of course I had to assume it was the contact lens because prior to putting it on, my eye was not blurry.  \n\nFast forward, I dropped by, Dr. Grant was on lunch, so the non-gentleman was there.  I was very upset at the accusation.  Though there was a video camera, it does not have audio.  Oh I so wish it could record the conversation because his accusation upsets me so much, it was totally uncalled for.  \n\nI came back later to see Dr. Grant and upon checkup, reason for the blurriness was because the contact lens is not breathable enough for my eye, hence the infection.  I placed another order for a different brand, paid for it, and found myself another office to go to.\n\nYes, the ladies that worked at the front are not very friendly.  One of them has very poor etiquette.  She doesn't treat you like patients, more like a sore thumb.  I believe they all know each other for a long time, because with that bad attitude at a different office, they would have been pushed out the door.\n\nHate this office, would not recommend anyone to come here.  If this office is reading this, I hope you volunteer at Opportunity Village and learn something from the Clients.  They treat people better than you!  You horrible people.
