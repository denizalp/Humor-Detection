We went for breakfast on Friday Morning and it was really good and well worth the wait. I really enjoyed the eggs Benedict. \nThe buffet has a lot to offer and I really enjoyed that they would make your French toast right in front of you. The selection was above average and the food quality could be tasted. The waiter was very nice and kept our drinks full. It was about a 20 minute wait which we didn't mind. We would def eat here again.
