I found this place on yelp and I'm always up for trying new breweries but ended up being disappointed. \n\nFor entrees I ordered the green chili Mac and cheese and added machata to it. Which is a shredded typed of beef. It was a bit spicy but good. My boyfriend ordered the carne asada tacos and these were extremely disappointing for $11. The two tacos were only a little bigger than mini tacos. It came with rice and beans that came in those sauce cups that you use to put your salsa in. That's it? \n\nFor beer I ordered their Christmas ale. It tasted really good in the beginning but I'm a slow drinker. After a while it got really flat and tasted really bitter. I was disappointed that they had such a small selection of beers for a brewery. The only plus for me was our waiter was very friendly and knowledgable of their beers.
