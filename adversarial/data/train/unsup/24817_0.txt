Not the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  But the second worst.  (The worst was El Toro Taco in Homestead, FL.  I actually joined Yelp so I could write a review of that mess.) \n\nAt both places I would have been better opening a can of Old El Paso and eating it cold.\n\nI am STILL angry I spent $27 on absolute cr*p at this dirty place.  And that's the first time I've sw*rn in a Yelp review!\n\nP.S. I only ended up here because I was visiting Pittsburgh.  Ended up downtown, starving, and couldn't get a signal on my iPhone to consult my Yelp app. to help select a place.  I will never go cold turkey again!\n\nP.P.S.  The server was actually very nice.  But how could she have lied to me and told me the food in the restaurant was good?  How could she have even called it food?\n\nP.P.P.S.   I knew from the first bite it would be a mistake. The chips tasted like they were cooked in old oil.  The guacamole was crusted in brown (sent it back).  And the salsa?  Just tasted like good old sodium.
