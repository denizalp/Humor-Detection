The most amazing hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. My friends and I miraculously got some deal here for spring break and it worked out to be super cheap for us to stay here for a week. We were probably the only people there under 35 and were definitely the only spring break students. This suspicion was only proven when we called the front desk one night at 4am asking for late night pizza delivery places and they had no idea who to call (they ended up looking in the phonebook for us). \n\nAll kidding aside, this is an absolutely magnificent hotel. The lobby, clubs, and shops were all beautiful, expensive, and of the highest quality. Our room was extremely spacious and we had a breathtaking view of The Strip out the window. Whenever you laid down on the bed you could not help but melt into it and fall instantly asleep since it was so comfortable. There was enough space in the bathroom to handle the cosmetics and toiletry items five college women on spring break with no problem. \n\nAlthough the pool was closed when we visited we did have access to the Encore's amenities instead so we were able to use their pools. Both the standard and \"adult\" pools were lovely and the jacuzzi was extremely relaxing. With the mall across the street you can also easily go shopping, find some cheap things to eat, or drop by the liquor store inside.\n\nIn summation, the Wynn is absolutely brilliant and no other hotel in Vegas (except the Encore, I guess) can hold a candle to it!
