I came here expecting creativity. Sushi I've never experienced before. And yes, that's what I got. I visited this place to celebrate my birthday with friends and wasn't disappointed by the food, or the service. Yes, it's pricey. Yes, there's a hint of superiority. Yes, you'll need reservations. Yes, you should prepare to be adventurous and to taste flavour combos you've most likely never had before. Don't expect traditional, straightlaced sushi. This is avante-garde sushi, and we were very happy with most of our meal.\n\nFirst, the service. Thanks to Hien for such attentiveness, friendliness, and efficiency. One of us had to head out earlier and Hien made sure he figured out the bills in record time, in addition to getting our food out faster than normal. It really makes a difference when your server actually cares, and he made this birthday experience a great one.\n\nSecond, the food. We ordered a couple of appetizers and a variety of rolls. I'll note that, if there's one part of the meal that was just average, it was the appetizers. The seared scallops were okay, but didn't thrill me. The tuna tartare was fine and very fresh, but the flavours didn't wow me. The sushi, on the other hand, contained bursts of flavour. This is where they excel. The Salmon Oshi Sushi was my absolute FAVOURITE. The tops were sweetly seared, the sauces were unbelievable. The Miku Roll was also quite delicious. The fish was incredibly fresh, and the flavour profiles featured such well-envisioned complexities that completely wowed us. Everything was so carefully prepared, we wouldn't hesitate to come back for more of this!\n\nOverall, Miku is innovative, not traditional. It aims to give you a unique experience in a classy, sophisticated setting. It's great for dates, for small dinners, even large group gatherings (it's a pretty big space). Upscale feel, and a good variety to the menu. It's pricey, but, for the most part, you won't be disappointed.
