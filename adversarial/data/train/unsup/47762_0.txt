Yardbird inside of the Venetian is great! This atmosphere is beyond impeccable.\n\nGreat for social gatherings, date nights, and time at the bar with one of my favorite bar tenders (ask for Rob). They truly know what they are doing when it comes to incredible drinks, mouth watering food, and an atmosphere fit for any occasion.\n\nThe management is so polite and happy to introductions to guests who want to praise the great service! The bathrooms are clean (which is a huge plus) and have great lighting which makes the experience of being at Yardbird even better.\n\nSuch a great place to unwind after work. I will defintiely back!
