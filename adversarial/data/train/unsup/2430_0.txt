The waiter asked me what I wanted.   I told him the Southwest Burger.  But he knew me better.  He knew I actually wanted the Southwest Charcoal Burger.  He asked if how I would like it cooked.  I said medium.  But he knew that I actually meant throw the burger away and put a piece of charcoal between the buns.  Every bite I took it reminded me of my grandfather's stories of mining for coal.  I recommend RnR to everyone who appreciates the struggle.
