Wow, 2 spoonfuls of rice in my to-go order and an extremely hot panang curry when I asked for mild. I can't eat this, and I'm already back at work so I can't go return it.\n\nI thought having competition nearby (Thai'd Up, Thai Elephant, Thai Hut), would make you work harder for my patronage. I guess not.
