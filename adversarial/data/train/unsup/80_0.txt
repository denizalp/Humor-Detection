The Skinny: unique farm-fresh produce that you can't find anywhere in Vegas albeit the market is small (5), service - great, with lots of tastings of farm-fresh produce (4), value - Hit or miss. But, I got a black truffle the size of an apricot for $25. 'Nuff said. (5)\n\nFinally, got to get to see this market today and boy! was I ever happy I heard about it. It was totally amazing - both in quality and variety. I've never seen some of the produce they have on sale. (and I hang out at Asian markets too... so I see a lot of weird stuff).\n\nOkay, it was pretty small. But I think the produce quality is better than your local Vegas Whole Paycheck (Foods... hee hee hee). Pricing really varies depending on the stall. I found that the largest stall, while having the largest variety, was the most expensive stall compared to the smaller stalls(ie, got summer squash for $2\/lb vs. $4\/lb in the larger stall).\n\nThe highlight of the trip was the stall that sold mushrooms - great, rare varieties for $6 per 1\/4 lb. I got some great morels and was really salivating over the chantrelles. Also bought a whole black truffle, the size of an apricot, for $25 (works out to be 0.45\/gm) !!!! I swear, I almost had a foodie orgasm right then and there. What a deal!\n\nI swear this is the best find in Vegas so far... bar none.
