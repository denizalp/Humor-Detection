This is the best place to get your furniture, HANDS DOWN!!! I have gotten everything from them! Two couch's, recliner, 3 different beds, a bed frame, kitchen table, and I'm sure I'm missing something else too. Great products for a GREAT price and the people there are amazing. The owners Alec and Whitney are awesome and always treat me and everyone I send in there right! Please do yourself a favor and check them out if you ever need furniture of any sort.
