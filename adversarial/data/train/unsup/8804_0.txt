I've been here a few more times and have been impressed with the friendly speedy service. The burgers are a step up from other fast food type burger chains with a slightly crisp exterior and juicy meat. I think the best burger to get is their double California steakburger due to the balance of burger, toppings, and bun. Other items I've had such as the patty melt and the Hatch chile burger have been disappointing. The shakes are pretty tasty since they are made with frozen custard. Upgrade one star!
