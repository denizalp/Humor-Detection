Their website says, \"Our physicians go to Chandler Regional Hospital and Banner Desert Samaritan Hospital, and see our newborns in the hospitals,\" but their office staff just told me they, in fact, don't go to Banner Desert and only work out of Chandler Regional.  Bummer!  \n\nOtherwise, they seem very reassuring and kind to this soon-to-be-momma.  Their website contains lots of helpful information and direction which this newbie parent appreciates a whole lot.
