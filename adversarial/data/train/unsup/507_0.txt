Me and my girlfriend decided to visit CHOAG after reading some of the glowing reviews on yelp.\n\nThe atmosphere in there sucked.  There is no A\/C or even a fan to keep customers cool.  I was melting in my seat (it was 40 celsius).  We decided to go ahead and order some regular breakfast.  They charge 7.75 for 4 pieces of toast, eggs, home fries and some cucumbers.  That is seriously overpriced considering that in Kensington most breakfast meals are at least a dollar or two less and give bigger portions.\n\nSuffice it to say I would like to know what drugs the people who gave this place anything more than 2 stars were smoking because I must be missing out.
