Head down Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd and see all the apartment complexes overflowing with hoards of people, trying to live the Scottsdale life. Very few, if any, actually have anything. \n\nI'm glad I got this town and city out of my system several years ago. \n\nI do have to agree on some points, there is some good dining here, but you're going to pay out the rear-end for it. \n\nThe people, by far are the funniest. Everyone is pretending to be something they are not.
