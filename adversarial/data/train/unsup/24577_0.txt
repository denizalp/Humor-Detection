This was my first time at this salon.  Based on my overall experience, I'm giving them a below average rating.  The salon itself is clean and modern.  However, because of the loft ceilings, sound seemed amplified.  It was busy, very noisy, and the complete opposite of a relaxing experience.  \n\nThe receptionist was friendly and offered a beverage upon arrival, which was much appreciated.  \n\nMy stylist (Marie Nee) did not meet my expectations, and is the main reason for my below average rating.  During shampooing and conditioning, she applied an extreme amount of pressure to my head\/scalp.  It was harsh and unpleasant.  When she finished the haircut with my wet hair, she never asked if I liked the length.  She was conservative on how much length she took off.  (I suppose it's better to be conservative than to cut off too much hair.)  However, it's the responsibility of the stylist to check with the client on how much length they want cut.  My stylist did not do that.  She then blow dried my hair and dry-cut long layers.  I requested face-framing layers, but the stylist stated that my hair would look like a mullet.  What?!  It appeared as if she did not want to finish the haircut.  (Not sure if she was running late and had another client waiting or what the deal was.)  She seemed to rush me out of her chair and told me to go home, and if I needed to get the haircut fixed, I could return to the salon in the next few days.  Wow, really?  If she did a good job, there would not be a reason to offer that service!\n\nUpon returning home, I ended up fixing my own face-framing layers.  It's always a bad sign when you have to fix your own haircut after a \"professional\" has cut it.  Thumbs down.\n\nI may or may not go back to this salon.  I will certainly request a different stylist.
