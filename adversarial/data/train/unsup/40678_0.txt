I'm new to the Mesa area and ive always enjoyed Roasti's in Chandler so I decided to purchase a couple groupons for this location. First time I came in to pick up my order, no one was at the front desk and the bell they have there is broken. We waited for someone to ring us up and I showed them my groupon. Both times ive came here with my groupon coupons they accepted it but didnt really seem to know what groupon was or what the deal offered. Please educate your staff on groupon promotions your restaurant is involved in. Ive tried the pizza (pepperoni), bone in wings, mozzerella sticks (which are $6.99 for 6) and cheesey bread. All of these items were awful. Ive never been to a pizza restaurant and received food I absolutely didnt like anything about. Their ranch cups are 50 cents each and they are PREPACKAGED. So, no in house ranch. You get the same ranch cup youd receive at pizza hut. The wings looked odd and just gross, they were chunky and not appetizing. Pizza was like eating cardboard. And the cheesy bread was a joke. I was really hoping to like this place! But I will never be coming back. Its not worth the time or money.
