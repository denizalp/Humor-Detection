I have lived in Toronto for over ten years and one of my earliest memories of this city was my first subway ride. (I was a teenager and had moved here from a small Northern Ontario town where the only transportation I had known was my mom's minivan.) \n\n For whatever reason I related the Toronto subway system to some kind of romantic old-time tram, where the stops were called out in sing-song and people gave up their seats to little old ladies. (This, pleasantly, I still see to this day). I think it was a naive notion that the busy city and the busy transit made up this wonderful nostalgic feel, and I couldn't wait to experience it myself.\n\n So, the day came when it was time to take the subway. Back then the fare was about $1.25; manageable, especially when you think of today's cost. I remember the station was big and people were EVERYWHERE. It was chaos, or at least to me, it was chaos. I paid my fare, got on the train, took my little red seat and waited in anticipation.\n\n  The now inaudible 'ding, ding, ding' to signal the doors closing rang in my ears and my excitement grew. The ride was pleasant enough; nothing like the volt of a plane engine. It was rackety, but not as rackety as I had imagined, and to my grave disappointment I couldn't walk between the cars. Well, you aren't really supposed to, but I have seen some daring souls do this and I envy their courage.\n\n  It isn't so much the ride that is worth talking about, but the memories I've gained on the TTC. I suppose that many wouldn't give commuting a second thought, but I can honestly say that,  for the most part I appreciate our transit system.\n\n Sure, it could be better. Buses and streetcars could come on time; the subway could be faster without signal problems; I could live without the constant overcrowding; it could be cheaper; we could all get everything we wanted, whenever we wanted it, without question...but that isn't reality. \n\n  I definitely share in the frustrations of daily commuters, and there are improvements needed, but until then, let's try to look at the bright side, shall we? For the ten plus years I've been a regular TTC rider, I can say with honest confidence, 8 times out of 10, I am a happy camper. \n\n  The TTC is clean; it's safe; it usually gets me to my destination in time; every one I know who visits the city loves it and it's a great way to see Toronto. I think perception has a lot do with people's opinions about the TTC, but don't take my word for it; check out Randal Paul's ode to our transit system on You tube: \" I get on (the TTC)\"...\n\n All in all, the TTC and it's domains (bus, streetcar, subway) is what we've got in this city so why not suck it up and bare it?\n\n I have complied a list of general rules that I think if everyone understood, our TTC would be gold! \n\n As follows:\n\n 1. TAKE OFF YOUR BACKPACK. IT IS PURE COMMON SENSE THAT A HUGE, BULGING BAG PROTRUDING OUT OF YOUR BACK WILL MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR OTHERS TO STAND AROUND YOU. JUST TAKE IT OFF, MAN!\n\n2.  There is always more room at the back of the bus\/streetcar. Venture there, and you shall see.\n\n3. When you see a subway car so full at your stop that strangers are chewing each others gum, do not get on. I know you're running late, but just don't. The next train will be along in about 2 minutes.\n\n4. People do need to go up stairs as readily as they need to go down; give them room.\n\n5. Do not throw your garbage, food wrappers, newspapers or leave your half empty pop bottles on the subway. There are garbage and recycling cans at every stop. This ain't your bedroom!\n\n6. Do not shoot up or snort up anything on the TTC. This should be a given, but I don't want to elaborate further on some of the things I've witnessed.\n\n7. Continue to give up your seat to those older than you. It is a nice thing to do.\n\n8. Please don't make out on the TTC. (See #5)\n\n9. Line up in a single row fashion as we do up at York U when waiting for the bus. Sure, it looks like your in kindergarten again, but its fast and keeps people less angry. \n\nand most importantly;\n\n10. When there is clearly a seat next to you that is empty, do not pretend to use it by placing your bag there. Your bag did not pay $2.75 for the ride. \n\nThank you.
