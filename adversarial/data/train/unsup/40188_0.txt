There was a line up (about 10 people) but it took more than 30 minutes to wait for my turn to order.  Not sure why it would take so long to take each order but it looks more like trying to keep a line up there at all time.  As for their products, they look gorgeous and beautiful, perfect for IG and Facebook likes... however, there's NO flavour of purple sweet potato at all, the purple looks so artificial that it's not real although it looks very pretty.  The only flavour I can taste was only the condensed milk and the sugar.  Surely it's a hype and great job with the advertising and marketing that made me and others came all the way here to try this out.  However, for $9.95 for a condensed milk flavoured iceflakes and $5.95 for the not much flavoured purple sweet potato ice cream, I would spend my money (or even less) to go to the tsujiri or iHalo for full-flavoured soft served.  Will I come here again for this... very likely not again... unfortunately.\n\nAfter all, yes, very pretty as per the picture.. does it worth ~$18?  you can be the judge.
