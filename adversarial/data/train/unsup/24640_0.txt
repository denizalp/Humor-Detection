I'm seriously not into writing reviews for doctors or dentists, but since I wrote one for my doctor's office, I figured I'd write one for my emergency dentist stop. My girlfriend and I went to visit her parents in Vegas and while out and about on an interesting Friday night in Vegas, one of my teeth started hurting.\n\nI asked my girlfriends parents for some dental advice, since the pain was unbearable and they recommend to come here. Not only because it was close by, but because they're the best.\n\nI stopped by to see if my dental would cover it and it did. For dropping in without an appointment on a Saturday i was greeted with a warm smile (despite not being able to smile myself). They took me right in and did a quick check up. I found out I needed some work done immediately. Lucky my insurance covered it and I was able to get most of the work I needed right then and there. In addition, I managed to get a quick teeth cleaning.\n\nThe doctor was professional, experience and exceptional in his work. The service was outstanding and the office was very neat and sanitary. I couldn't have asked anything more. I received the best service anyone could from any dentist and more. Thanks to a great recommendation and great care and service from the staff here, I am a smiling more than when we saw Cirque Du Soleil. \n\nI only wish I could have them move here to Los Angeles. Maybe then I'd be more inclined to see the dentist more often and not eat so many apples.
