Place seems like a serious scam! I called to ask how long of a wait there is for a new patient. I was told they only accept new \"functional medicine clients.\" I would need to pay $250 to get started and a crazy quarterly fee as well. Besides the fees they would bill my insurance. Mind you I never even said what my problem was that I was calling for. What a JOKE!!! Craziest first phone call I've ever had to a \"professional doctors office\"
