I've been going to Happy Nails for the last couple of years and would never go anywhere else for a shellac manicure. Trish is by far the best nail tech - So pleasant, friendly and talented. She always asks what you prefer (nail shape, length, etc) and gives recommendations when asked. I've also seen Helen for my eyebrow waxing and she does an excellent job as well, complete with a relaxing temple \/ forehead massage (so much better than it sounds!) In the last 10 years, I have gone to at least 4 other nail salons and this is hands down the best. The environment is classy, clean and welcoming. They also have an ATM inside the salon that does not charge any withdrawal fees - Bonus! \n\n$40 for Shellac Manicure, $45 for French Shellac Manicure. \n\nI recommend Happy Nails to everyone. Book your next appointment with Trish!
