This review is long overdue. I contacted Noble to clean the carpets in my mom's house that we were putting up for sale. Due to needing to get some repairs done and the house cleaned before we did the carpets I had to reschedule multiple times. Each time I contacted the office they were understanding and accommodated my schedule. Jacob was my technician and he arrived right on time. He listened while I explained my concerns about the condition of the carpet and assured me he would do his best to get it looking as good as possible. He definitely delivered on that promise. The carpet was probably 30 years old and had some heavy stains in certain areas. I was amazed at how clean he was able to get the carpets and how good they looked when he was done. It literally changed the entire appearance of interior of the home. He also very nicely gave me a couple of booties to use while I was still needing to move some items out of the house so I didn't get the carpet dirty. I highly recommend Noble and will be using them in the near future.
