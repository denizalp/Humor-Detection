We were invited to a birthday dinner and had no idea this place existed! It's a good little find whose claim to fame is their fajitas which was good. Not being huge fans of peppers and onions, you can't really make sense of our choice. The drinks were okay, not the best but good for the prices offered. The service was not the best; our server wasn't very friendly and didn't have a stellar personality to match his profession. \n\nWe could take or leave coming back.
