I can sum it up it three words -- Philly Cheese Steak! I visit Las Vegas often, very often, for two reasons, one is for friends, the second being Caf Verdi. I accidentally found them when ordering in after arriving in the middle of the night once. The guy said sure they deliver and we ordered Pizza and a Philly. Well the delivery guy couldn't find the hotel and then couldn't find the room, but we did finally get the order, unfortunately it was cold and an hour late, but even so, what I tasted was bliss. Going to the caf the very next day we ordered it again, fresh this time and it was ecstasy. The weird thing is that their Philly Cheese Steak it not quite a real Philly, it is a weird Las Vegas Mediterranean version of one that is just fantastically delicious. If you go to Las Vegas and like Philly Cheese Steak, Caf Verdi is a must.\r\n\r\nOverall Rating: 5+\r\nPros: Philly Cheese Steak, Close to Downtown Las Vegas, Reasonable Price\r\nCons: Delivery gets lost, Small Dining Area, Tables wobble\r\nCost: $$ of 5\r\nRecommendation: Highly Recommended
