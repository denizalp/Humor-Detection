The Yoga Sanctuary is coming uptown! Opened up recently first week of September and for their Grand Opening Specials all the classes are free till Sept 30!!\n\nThis location used to be Yoga Plus http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/yoga-plus-richmond-hill. The Yoga Sancturay did a great job giving it a facelift, not only giving it a new layer of paint.. a new partition has put up and divided up the reception area\/practice room. The washroom has been totally redone too.\n\nClasses are all non heated but concentrate on Ashtanga and Vinyasa with some Hatha. So You will get a good workout even in a room temperature studio.\n\nFront desk is super friendly and cheerful. She remembered my name already after the first class!!! \n\nAshtanga class I attended was free sequencing with some postures from Primary Series. The instructor was inspriing and class full of energy.\n\nI would try to drop by for a few more free classes and they also has new students special $20 for 10 days.
