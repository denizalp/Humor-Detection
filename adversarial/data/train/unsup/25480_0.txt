Omni was great!  This was my brother and sister-in-law's first trip to Las Vegas and I wanted to make it special for them. The driver arrived on time in the baggage area with a tablet with the names of my brother and sister-in-law on it.  My sister-in-law loved that!  The car was immaculate. Our driver took care of all of the luggage and was very personable and polite.  I had to call Omni to give them the names of my brother and his wife inasmuch as they had my name and the operator politely made the change to ensure that the signage was correct at the Airport. I cannot recommend Omni highly enough!
