Only place in the GTA that serves my favourite Singapore\/Malaysian breakfast food - kaya\/butter toast with soft boiled eggs (eat with pepper and black soya sauce). 2 toasts with 2 eggs for $4 - super deal. I like their roti prata with chicken potato curry and fish balls noodle soup. Their Malaysian sandwiches are also very good. I will try their bak kut teh next. And their milk tea is a must try as well. I am there for brunch most weekends.
