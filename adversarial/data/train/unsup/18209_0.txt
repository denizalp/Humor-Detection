Fairgrounds Roastery Cafe for sure is cute, ethically correct, friendly, organic and any of those goody goody descriptions you can use to describe it would be appropriate. \n\nIt is always a breath of fresh air to find independent coffee shop out of the downtown core.. and here Fairgrounds even roast their own coffee! \n\nSuper Friendly barista with this big smile makes everyone feel so welcome. Cappuccino was not too bad, but I had better.. It tasted more like a latte..and with too much milk and foam. \n\nMy friend's Matcha Latte for sure was packed with tons of antioxidants as it has so much undissolved matcha powder and it would really help him to cleanse out all the toxins in his body. (just close your eyes and drink up!)\n\nIf you want freshly roasted coffee beans, Fairgrounds does carry quite a few different roast.. \"Rich Bastard\" which is one of their house blend dark roast does sounded interesting. There are also certified organic roasted beans from Indonesia, Africa and South America. \n\nBTW, the dry spaghetti at the counter are not snacks to go with your drinks.. they are used as stirrer. May I suggest Linguine may be a better choice? (damn I just crushed my spaghetti stirrer! and it is cooking in my cappuccino!!!)
