Yes this place is beside a Starbucks in that crappy parking lot where no one can figure out where the out is. But, you should ride your bike to get there, or walk or skip. Actually, I recommend biking or skipping because Terra's food is rich and succulent and you will be glad for the exercise after. My dining  partner and I decided to share four appetizers to get the full Terra experience. Our meal began with complimentary bruschetta which was the freshest bruschetta I have ever tasted. I can not even put my finger on what made it so amazing but I wanted ten more. The bread was crusty and fairly standard. I had a great dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives (sigh) and my dining partner was recommended a glass of wine which surprising was only $9 when the check came. Not bad for such a ritzy place. \n\nWe split: Duo de Canard \"Traiteur\" - $12 Duck Pâté and smoked duck breast, served with a truffle honey emulsion. \n\nVery smoky and decadent. The smokey flavor of the duck breast was a bit much for me but he loved it. We also shared: \n\n    L'Assiette de Charcuterie et de Fromage - $18 Selection of meat and cheese plate\n\nLarge and varied- some soft, others semi-soft. Olives, pickles- etc.\n    \nRavioles de Veau au Beurre de Truffe - $12 Homemade veal raviolis, served with a truffle cream sauce.\n\nDramatically increased my waistline. So rich. So creamy. So well done.\n\n    Petites Merguez Grillees au Couscous Israelien, à la Menthe Fraiche - $12 Grilled lamb sausages served on bed of Israeli couscous with fresh mint\n\nThis wasn't my favorite but my friend cleaned this plate.\n\nThis was an ample amount for two people to share and be able to sample their unique menu.\n\nWhat an amazing special occasion place. White glove\/napkin service 5\/5 there. or if you are well-off I would eat here weekly.
