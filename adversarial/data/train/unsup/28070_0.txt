Muse has a fantastic brunch buffet with a wide assortment ranging from sushi to custom scrambled eggs made in the middle of the room and brought to your table. \nFabulous service as you would expect from a Ritz. I also happened to show up on a game day and all the wait staff had  brown t shirts on to support their home town team that day. It was a fun unexpected home feeling you wouldn't expect to see in such a high end place. \nIf I'm ever in town again I would definitely come here again:) Great experience!
