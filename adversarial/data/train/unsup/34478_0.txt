I'm just writing this so Victoria can go to Disneyland!!! She was super awesome as is the rest of the staff. I wish I was this happy in the morning. My boyfriend and I are local and this is our favorite breakfast\/lunch spot. There's usually a wait so we like to just sit at the counter. Everything on the menu is great, but my favorite is the tuna melt. Probably the best one I've ever had!
