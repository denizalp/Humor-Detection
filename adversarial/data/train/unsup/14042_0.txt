I probably can't say anything bad about this place that hasn't been already said. They are scamming people and should be reported to the BBB. Avoid at all costs.\n\nIn my case I was charged for 2.5 gallons of gas ($29!!) two days after the car was returned. When I returned the car I gave my gas receipts and the gas gauge was checked. Not sure how they can change their minds two days later and try to charge me. Charge was disputed as I can't get a hold of anyone helpful.
