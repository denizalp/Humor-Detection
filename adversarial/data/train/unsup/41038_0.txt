My bf and I get lunch here from time to time and love the #34 Lomito Completo - Fillet Mignon cooked to your taste with provolone cheese, ham, fried eggs, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. This is definitely a great sandwich and can be shared by two people and be fully satisfied. It comes with fries and this green dressing that taste awesome with the sandwich. This I give 5*'s. \n\nToday, we also ordered their potato salad. I thought this would be a great addition to the sandwich. First bite in to it there really isn't any taste until after swallowing. The fishy after taste creeps in immediately. I thought it was probably because I am recovering from a flu but after a few more bites, I couldn't handle it anymore. It almost tasted like it was made with old gross fish. Even my bf made a comment about it. I will definitely not get it again. This I give no stars. \n\nHence the total of 4*'s.
