I've been on a search for the best wings in Scarborough and this place takes it, hands down!  This past New Years Eve we decided to order wings and I found that this place was open until 10pm.  We found their site and menu online and I called to place my order.  The woman who took my order was very friendly and helped me understand their variety of sauces.  We decided on messy honey, terodactyl, and mesquite.  Our favourite was the messy honey (honey garlic with garlic parm sauce on top) but the other two were tasty as well.  For those wonderding, mesquite is a smokey bbq sauce and terodactyl is bbq with teriyaki sauce on top.  The wings were big, juicy and crispy on the outside.  They will let you split your sauces for a small additional fee and I say go for it to try all their different flavours.  Will definitely order from them again!
