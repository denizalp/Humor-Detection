The lines are gone it seems and after several months of abstinence, I was finally able to get my fix. I can totally understand the novelty of this stuff and it's appeal but I think it's fair to give them about 3 stars.\n\nWhile this stuff is pretty rare over here in the Great White North, it's almost a dime a dozen out East. During my trip to Japan, I had the opportunity to eat this stuff till my heart's content but I really could not find it in me to rate it over the top. I am a traditionalist you see and my heart has been set on that NY cheesecake. That dense and super cheesy stuff is far superior in my mind and my mouth. However, to most Asians that do not have an appreciation for cheese (I know you're out there!) this stuff is great! You can say you love cheese but without really eating it.\n\nAnyhow with all the rambling aside. This stuff is great for enjoying with your cup of green tea. Try it once and be done with the hype.
