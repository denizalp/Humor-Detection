No soup for you!\n\n My friends and I enjoy going to lunch at Zupas  Cafe.  Zupas resembles a cafeteria style with fresh salads, soups, and sandwiches. Once you enter Zupas you are greeted at the door as an employee pass out menus to view while waiting in line.\n\n I usually choose to create my own salad, well make that a  half salad and  it is always delicious. My salad creation consist of iceberg lettuce, chicken, apples, cranberries, strawberries, topped with cinnamon almonds and strawberry vingerette dressing.  Oh did I mention Zupas give a piece of bread and a chocolate cover cherry with every order.  \n\nZupas offers great value deals. The choose 2 deal is  any sandwich, soup, or salad at a great price. I think the sandwiches are fair but that is only because they are trumped by the delicious varieties of soup.  Zupas will let you sample all their wonderful soups before you decide.  You have to try the vegetable chowder it is amazing.\n\nSo if you want a great bowl of soup give Zupas a try.
