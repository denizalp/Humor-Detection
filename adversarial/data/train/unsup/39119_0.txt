And where else do you go for $5.00 and have a kick - ass time.I could come by every day,  there is something for everyone,  8 to 80. New machines, vintage games, stuff I played in high school, it's all here. Open 7 days 11 until 11, you can make it work. They even have tournaments so if you see yourself the pinball wizard, have a go..
