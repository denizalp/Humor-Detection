I enjoy this restaurant almost three times a week. I really like spicy foods and the foods are delicious. Also, the servers are so nice. My recommendation are Jumbo shrimp with salted egg paste, fragrance lamb chops, Dan Dan noodle, Extremely spicy Feng teng fish. All in all, this one is the best Chinese restaurant I've ever experienced.
