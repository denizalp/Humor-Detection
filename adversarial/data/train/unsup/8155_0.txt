Okay, so the only reason I am giving this hotel 3 stars is because I got to see a room in the remodeled tower; other than that?  Definitely should be a one or two stars.   \n\nSo, a little weekend trip was in order with the hubby and two of my cousins and their husbands.  We were also there for the fight, but mostly to hang out.  \n\nHubby and I booked rooms in the first tower (they have two) and the room was so janky! (you know, disgusting, broke down, etc)  Our tv was sooo small, it reminded me of the tv I used to have in my bedroom at my parent's house, the bed was not that comfortable, the bathroom wallpaper was yellow-y, the fixtures were old, etc.  \n\nThe furniture in the room was just old and outdated as well.  \n\nBUT....it did serve it's purpose of giving us a place to shower,  sleep, ETC,  and while in Vegas, that's pretty much all you need a room for right?  :)  \n\nMy cousins actually got to stay in one of the newly renovated rooms with the flat screen tv's and those rooms were really nice!  Newly updated carpets, nice decor with the chocolate brown and blue drapes and bedding. Huge flat screen mounted on the wall.  Marble bathroom counters, new furniture, etc.  We got to hang out in their room for a bit, and I wishing the whole time we were in one of those rooms, it was way nicer!  \n\nWe were also there for the De La Hoya vs Pacquiao fight and the hotel actually had a closed circuit viewing of the fight in the Thunder from Down Under Showroom (for those of you who may not know, it's the all male revue show!)  for $40.00 per person-definitely worth it to see that fight!  \n\n\nWould I go back?  Probably, I just wouldn't make it my first choice, but if I do go back, it's definitely going to be in the newer, remodeled rooms for sure!
