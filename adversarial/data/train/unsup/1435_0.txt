Holy crap do I love places like this! When the bartender is not sure how many beers you drank and says, lets just call it 10, I am in love. \n\nIt is smoky and the crowd is mostly professional drinkers. I did not use the ladies room, have to admit, was a bit scared. But other than that anyplace that has catfish balls on the menu is a ok with me!
