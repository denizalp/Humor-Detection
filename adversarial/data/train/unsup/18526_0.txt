I'll start by saying this review doesn't even take service into account. I am from Serbia, so I know how terrible my people are at customer service; so let's leave the terrible service aside. Just this visit alone the server screwed up 3 things with our order. \n\nThe food: \nI've been coming here for years, my family has been going to the original Royal Meats butcher for over 5 years at this point. Recently (last year or 2) this location has undergone ridiculously large renovations to try and make it something that authentic Serbian food does not need to be, at all; pretentious and fancy. \n\nThese people are bastardizing authentic Serbian food and killing it. No pride\n\n\"House sauce\" - I don't understand why you would have to change the traditional name of Ajvar, and add feta cheese (wtf) just to help Canadians and others feel more comfortable. \n\n\"Royal Burger\" - its called a pljeskavitca. And it shouldn't be given a stupid American version name just to satisfy the status quo. \n\n\"Royal cannon\" - really?! Have some pride in the country and the food where you come from and try to make money on. Call the dishes by their REAL name, Karađorđeva schnitzel.  \n\nAlso, the pricing; absolutely LUDACRIS! 6 cevapi for $15? What kind of drugs are you on?!?! \n\nThe owners of Royal Meats need to take a deep hard look at themselves and go back to what they were; a favorite place for Serbs and other Eastern Europeans where they brought friends to show them a piece of our culture and heritage. NOT a homogenized, bastardized version of Serbian food meant to cater to North Americans. \n\nGET BACK TO YOURS ROOTS!
