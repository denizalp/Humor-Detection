We were hungry after leaving a concert at 11pm, and we happened to find this little gem on our way home for a late night bite.  Main Ingredient looks like a converted house, so it's very small on the inside, but there is a large patio out front with fairy lights and tons of ambiance to accommodate larger groups.  They only have about 10 craft beers on tap, but all of them were from different brewers and there was a wide range of styles.  I ordered an Odell Amber that was amazing and my hubby got a Ballast Point IPA.  We ordered the Cochinita tacos which comes with two tacos and a cup of beans, and the cheesesteak with salad.  The meat in the tacos was super juicy and had just the right touch of spice.  They didn't skimp on the amount of meat in the tacos either.  The cheesesteak was chock full o' peppers and meat and my hubby would not stop raving about it.  The entire menu looked drool-worthy so we are planning to go back for lunch to try something else.
