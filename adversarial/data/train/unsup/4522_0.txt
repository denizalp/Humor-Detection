I really want to love Alex. The dishes are beautiful. I can't ask for better service. And the decor exude traditional elegance. \n\nUnfortunately, all dishes are either too salty, mediocre, or just bad. I didn't finish most of the dishes ; which rarely ever happen in restaurants at this level.\n\nAmbiance: 4.5 stars \nService: 5 stars (love the little couch for the purse.) \nPrice: overpriced ($125 for prefix, $185 for tasting menu) \nfood: 1 stars for the taste, 4.5 stars for aesthetic presentation.  \n\nWe had:\n-quail+ foie gras (worst seared foie gras I ever had. quail meat was dry)\n-Shrimp appetizer (too salty but otherwise, meat is not bad)\n-pork belly (too salty and too fatty. There's a fine line betweeen just perfect amount of fat and too much. The one we had were too much)\n-waygu beef (the saddest dish of them all. The $4 NY Steak I cook the night before tasted better)\n-chocolate valencia (YUCK!)\n-something with Hazelnut  (so so)
