We're on a quest for the best self-serve frozen yogurt within reasonable driving distance. Here's how Mojo Yogurt stacked up against our criteria:\n\nYogurt: The froyo was sweet, creamy and didn't melt instantly like some other places. It wasn't the densest, but it was pretty decent.  The flavors were pretty run-of-the-mill, though the vanilla was particularly flavorless. \n\nFlavor Variety: It's a small place. There aren't many flavor options, and what they had wasn't particularly creative. \n\nToppings: Toppings were standard.\n\nAmbiance: There was essentially no seating within the store and a couple of tables\/chairs outside, which made it slightly awkward to eat there.\n\nOverall, I don't think we'll be back, but it would be an okay stop if you were nearby and needed a sweet fix.
