Good food but very busy, so I usually don't go if I'm in a rush. \nI usually get their chicken shawarma plate or their Big Joe's Burger. \nPortion wise, it is very generous. I usually buy 2 shawarma plates to go and share it with my whole family (4 people) and we still have leftovers to eat the next day for lunch.\n\nJust note that if you go too late, they may run out of the chicken shawarma. \n\nJoe runs a tight ship, I remember one time I was there and he started berating one of his staff because they were cooking the bacon and burger   together and he said that if a muslim customer saw that they'd never come back to eat here again so it looks like he makes effort to cater to people who eat halal.
