I was staying at the Clarendon and decided to give this place a try based on the reviews.  I am glad we ate here.  The guac was really good.  My favorite dish was the corn and cheese.  The tacos were really good also.  I agree with some of the other reviews about the shrimp tacos not having a whole lot of flavor to them but there are so many other dishes that were really tasty.  Also, the drinks were tasty too...especially with so many places downtown serving crappy margaritas.  The service was excellent.  I had the flan and I was a fan.  I generally like slightly denser flans and this one was the way I like it.  I also tried the shrimp ceviche on another night and was a fan.  Good happy hour deals.  The kicker for me was that we were expecting jacked up prices for being attached to a hotel, but these were some of the most reasonable prices we encountered in Phoenix, especially after having eaten at a few places downtown.
