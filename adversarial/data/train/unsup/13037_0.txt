Stopped here for a byte to eat with about 8 people.  They would not let us in because our children are under 6.   Honestly, I have never heard of such a policy.   I believe they have the right to refuse service to people, heck Ill take my $100 to someone that wants it, but this seemed kind of silly and mostly rude.\n\nI could see not allowing children under 21, maybe 18... but what is so magical about six and under?
