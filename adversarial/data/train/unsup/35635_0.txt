Went here for my bday last year. We called to make reservations because from what people said we thought it was going to be a busy place and we planned on doing the hibachi grill so we were sure we needed them. When we arrived....there was not a single person in the place, and they had already been open for a couple of hours. Not a good sign. We decided against the hibachi and just went for the all you can eat sushi, which didn't turn out to be any cheaper than just getting a couple rolls of sushi. The food wasn't that great. The service was ok. I wasn't impressed at all...probably won't be back.
