While the drive-thru line was pretty long (6-7 cars). It moved fairly quickly. I ordered my usual Venti Vanilla Latte. I swear I have to fight to not buy one of those lemon pound cakes. \n\nPros - Great location, consistent drink\nCons - Long lines (sometimes you are out in the parking lot and might be in the way of passing cars).
