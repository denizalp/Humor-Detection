On a mission to try the macarons, we stopped by in the morning.  These were the choices:\nRaspberry, Lemon, Vanilla, Espresso, and Chocolate Mint (which just sounds wrong, and not really French).  I was hoping they had a Salt Caramel one like at Laduree in Paris, but sadly, they did not.\n\nHad the Vanilla and Espresso; both were good but the Vanilla really owned!  Also had a cup of coffee, which was quite bold and flavorful.  For the two macarons and a small coffee, it was like 13 bucks==excessive!\n\nIt was tasty though...
