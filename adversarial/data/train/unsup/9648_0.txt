What we liked:\n- The hotel location on the Las Vegas strip.\n- The hotel exterior architecture.\n- Kids friendly, and many family style restaurants.\n- The upgrade to a remodeled room was the way to go (big difference vs. a standard room).\n- We asked for a quiet room and we got it (fortunately we asked for this, since many hallways parties were going on in other areas of this hotel!)\n\nWhat was less than average:\n- The hotel hallways and regular rooms are so old ... and sometimes \"smelly\".\n- No fridge in room.\n- SLOW room service.\n- Anything in the room is very \"noisy\": The heater, the bathroom fan, etc.
