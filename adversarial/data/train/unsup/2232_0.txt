I really love The Dillinger. It embodies everything I love about Boulder City, a chill place with good service and excellent food. There is outside seating, great for people watching when the weather is nice. \n\nAnytime I am in the mood for a big, juicy burger I head here. The burgers are 1\/2 pound monstrosities, made of high quality beef and cooked to my liking (medium). I get whatever the daily burger special is fairly often, but have also had the Bugsy (cheddar, bacon and fried onions) and even the Portabella burger was impressive (add avocado like the menu suggests!). \n\nThe owner is on site often, bringing out orders and checking in on guests... and while the place does get busy, service has always been really good on my visits. Sometimes patrons get a little drunk and rowdy, but never out of control and I appreciate that the inside isn't smokey like some bars. There are daily drink specials, a nice selection of locally brewed beers, and on Sundays The Dillinger has a DIY Bloody Mary Bar that I look forward to trying soon. \n\nFor anyone wondering where the beef is, it's in Boulder City at The Dillinger!
