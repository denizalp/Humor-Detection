I'm always excited to see new shows and I'm a big fan of all our Vegas entertainment options. This show was empty in the balcony and we were asked by the ushers if we wanted to move to the main floor! The only reason we didn't take them up on this amazing offer was because the show was already starting. \nThe vocals are great, the costumes are beautiful and the props are big. The song selections are pretty bad with lots of slower choices that I've never even heard. I would suggest to pick better music. The theater is very nice and the seating is a little tight but overall the show was good. When I visit the Wynn resort my expectations are always high because he pays attention to details. I'm not sure if I would go back but I do like the property itself.
