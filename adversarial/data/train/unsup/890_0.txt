Oh Fuzzy's where to begin with you? Are any of you familiar with the Toby Keith song \"I love this bar\"? Because he made that song for bars like Fuzzy's.\n\nThis bar is right down the road from my house. It looks awful from the outside, and more than likely if I were alone, I would not go in. However, I have wonderful friends that like to accompany me here. \n\nThe bartender Jen is absolutely great; she is fun, fast, down to earth, and just the perfect person for Fuzzy's. Cheap beers and shots, fun times with townies...what more could you ask for? OH WAIT, DARTS! \n\nhaha what is better than drinking beer, drinking beer then throwing sharp objects...\n\nAlso, there is pool, which is not as fun as darts...\n\nSo there you have it, I really like Fuzzy's and I am now a regular. So if you happen to stalk me sometime, I'm more than likely the girl that looks like she doesn't belong in a bar like this LOL
