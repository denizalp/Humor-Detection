HUGE sandwiches! This place is pretty busy on a weekday for lunch. It sits in between Melt and Panera as a middle-of-the-road option when you're not looking to pig out (ahem, Melt) and Panera seems too boring. The meat seemed fresh and the sandwiches were perfectly fine, but I didn't think it was anything amazing. I did try both their white chocolate macadamia nut cookie as well as the chocolate chip cookie, and was pretty impressed with both.
