Never thought Bloomfield would have a destination-worthy sushi joint but here we are.  This sounds (and is!!) truly terrible but I get nervous anytime I see a non-Japanese chef at a sushi counter. My fears were unfounded. Start to finish we seriously didn't have one bite that was anything less than stellar. I loved their nigiri, thought the rice was phenomenal and enjoyed their willingness to have fun and explore untraditional tastes.\n\nI will note that the pacing was terrible and it wasn't even crowded. Can't imagine what it must be like on a busy night. Maybe it should just be a counter for 8 people or something. But I'm willing to forgive when what they do put down in front of you is just that good.
