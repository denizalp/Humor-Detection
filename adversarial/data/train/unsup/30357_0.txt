Moved from the old spot on top of Steubenville Pike. Pizza is still just as damn good. They put the toppings on after the crust and sauce have been baked which may seem different, but very delicious. Prices seem to have slightly increased though. One of my 3 favorite pizza joints. Highly recommended.
