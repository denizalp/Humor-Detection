Needed to find a quick lunch on the way back to The Strip from Aliante and simply chose the Chyenne exit randomly.\n\nFinding this place was just what I needed after a long, hot early part of the day on the golf course.\n\nBoth employees behind the counter were attentive, friendly and helpful.\n\nThe menu has a wide selection of specialty sandwiches or you can simply build your own very easily with most of your ideal deli ingredients.\n\nMy specialty sandwich was delicious and customized to my liking with no mistakes at all. (Since it had BBQ sauce, I don't know what they would offer mayo on it as well. Honestly, that mixture sounds terrible.)\n\nUnfortunately, I had no idea what Dutch Crunch was until reading Nate M's review as I wrote mine, so I think I had marble rye toasted instead.\n\nThe roast beef on my specialty sandwich was particularly good and they were happy to tell me and show me in advance of ordering that it was not very rare, which is often the case at delis like this and not of interest to me. Other basic toppings tasted fresh and there was plenty of them on there.
