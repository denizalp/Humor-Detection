Both sales and service here are top notch.  Bought our first ever travel trailer here in 2013. The salesman was super informative and helpful, and really seemed to care more about our needs and comfort than in closing a sale. Lots of advice on matching the trailer to my tow vehicle (2011 Xterra), and went with me on a test tow after installing the load distributing hitch to make sure I was comfortable with the towing before we actually bought the trailer. \nI did also shop at some other dealers before the final purchase, and the interactions with the sales guys there help close the deal with Johnnie Walker for me. There was just no comparison in the level of knowledge and care.\nHad a couple of minor warranty issues with the trailer, and the service department was as good as sales, fixing the items promptly and with no fuss. \nI'm ready to upgrade now, but I live in Oregon.  After reading the reviews of the local places, I'm seriously considering driving back to Las Vegas for the trade!
