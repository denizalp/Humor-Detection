After a fun evening of looking at art, my friends and I decided to go have a quick drink.  We just happened to part right next to Mabel's on Main.  I loved it as soon as I walked in.  It was one of those classic dark bars, playing somber 60's heartbreak song.  You know, drink all night long songs.  I loved it!  If only it had lasted all night.  Towards the end of the evening, the music had changed to more lively music.  \n\nI loved that all the wood was so dark, as well as the leather seats.  We sat against the wall in the raised area.  Service, I will say, was a bit slow.  We probably would have ordered more drinks if they had come quicker.  One good thing was that there was a yelp check-in offer.  I think it was buy 1 cocktail get one free.  \n\nWe also ordered food.  We had the filet mignon tips....we had to send them back the first time, but when they came back, they were good.\n\nI will be back!
