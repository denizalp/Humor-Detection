I'm probably 15 years old. I can't see a sex shop (or, in this case, \"love boutique\") and don't get inside. It's sooooooooo funny!!! This one is the best I've been to! Three levels of fun! \n\nYou can find whatever you can imagine in this place, from kinky sexy toys to halloween costumes (yeah right). There's EVERYTHING. I almost bought that crazy penguin \"massager\" - a must have for every linux girl, right? - as seen on Sue Johanson's, but 30 bucks for a joke is too much for me. \n\nYou see, you have to be careful with your money if you have a teenager soul. Staff is wonderful and helpful and will show you how every item works, and will invite you to try the weird shoes you're looking at. I could work in a place like this because it must be TOTALLY AWESOME. \n\nI wanna host a party there. Seriously.
