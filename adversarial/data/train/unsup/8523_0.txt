God help you if you need to do a return.  Over a week and just got a response that they received the merchandise back.  Then they charged me $7.99 for handling and still no word of when I'm getting my replacement merchandise.\n\nWhat clothing retailer charges for returns in this day & age?  This one.\n\nWhat retailer takes over a week to return something into stock?  This one.\n\nCannot report on the quality of the merchandise yet since I had to return the pants after receiving them for a sizing issue.
