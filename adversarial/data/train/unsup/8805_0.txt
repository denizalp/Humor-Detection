I eat a lot of burgers. This is because I love them, and Southern California continues to crank out one boutique burger joint after the other. That last part is relevant because if you live in an area with a high concentration of good burger options, chances are you won't be overly impressed with Ramsay's Burgr. That isn't to say this is bad, or even mediocre, but it isn't providing something I haven't had already. \n\nFor one thing, the lengthy line out front is barely justified. I had to wait over 30 minutes just to get a seat for a burger. I know it's all because of whose burger it is, still sucked. \n\nI started off with the truffle fries, which come with a garlic aioli and a fancy house ketchup. They were delicious, especially with the aioli. I wasn't too hot on the ketchup. To me, ketchup is one of those condiments that shouldn't be messed with too much. I don't use it often, but when I do I expect the flavor to be consistent. \n\nThe blue burger seemed to be their standard offering, so I went with that. It's very simple, which allows for the meat to do most of the talking. It told me that it's tender and succulent and juicy, so I devoured it. The toppings only consisted of a little arugula and some blue cheese. The bun was excellent, some kind of seed-y, doughy bread. Could've done with a bit of a toasting on the inside, but that's only a minor complaint. \n\nPricing was in line with what you'd expect at a \"luxury\" burger spot.  It's certainly worth stopping in if you're in town, but maybe not for repeat visits. Not with that line, at least.
