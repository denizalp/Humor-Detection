The service is fast, the price is relatively normal and the options are numerous. As an additional plus, they package the broth and the noodles separately which is perfect for lunch on the go. My challenge in rating this place is that the noodles taste very much like boxed ramen, everything from consistency to overall flavor. However, the meat is one of the best things I have tasted in a soup ever and the portion size is relatively good. I started at three stars but if you're a boxed ramen fan then this really is a four star flavor, if you expect more from your noodles or want a little more direction in the purchasing experience (service is not particularly friendly one way or the other) then you might want a more amicable, mom's kitchen feel type spot but for those of you running through Oakland who want a quick bowl of soup that won't slosh around and spill on you on your way back to the office then there is certainly no harm in checking this place out
