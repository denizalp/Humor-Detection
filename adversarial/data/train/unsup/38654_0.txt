Horrible prices are ridiculous. One gel polish is $15 there is another place on spring mtn that sells a gel\/mani set for 10. Same brand.  The employees 2 of them were ok but 2 others pissed me off  real quick. There is a white blond lady there she is ether the owner or the manager super rude, to customers and coworkers. Better to drive all the way to china town then go here.
