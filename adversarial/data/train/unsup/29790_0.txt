The Cubano Sliders and the Fuego nachos were both very tasty. The slider was layered with ham and their signature pernil asado, a seasoned shredded pork. The shredded pork was very flavorful. The nachos also had a layer of the shredded pork.  The key lime pie was close to a cheesecake consistency but beautifully presented with whipped cream and toasted coconut. The menu is small on choices but if everything is as good as the three items we tried then we are sure to return and to tell our friends.
