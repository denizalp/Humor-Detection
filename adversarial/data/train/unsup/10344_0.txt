I've always had a good time at this place. The food is decent and a cut above regular pub fare, and I have no compunction about getting totally sloshed here. The layout is a bit schizophrenic: restaurant to the right, expansive bar to the left, but they pull it off well. I was wary of their ability to showcase live music when I was there Saturday night but it was a success.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: More like: prohi-BITCHIN'!\n\nMenu Readability: They changed it from a broadsheet to a book, but it's still all right.  Even though it's not a franchise, everything has a polished corporate look about it.  \n\nNeed to mention: Music was excruciatingly loud in the back room where we sat.  Management did not let up until the problem was fixed. Kudos!\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I'm secretly in love with downtown's East End.
