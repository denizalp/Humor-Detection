After a traumatic experience of my car breaking down in the middle of Camelback Rd and having a stranger \"bump\" me into a parking lot because my battery terminal was so corroded it fell off, I called my insurance for road side assistance and Big D came to my rescue from Central Towing. I was going to have him tow me home, but he recommended Mike's shop because he has his trucks worked on here.\nMike offered two solutions to my problem, one costing around $100 for testing, cleaning, and replacing terminals. The other would cost about 10 times as much for complete replacements. Of course, I opted for the less expensive fix because, well why wouldn't you try that first? He promised me he has done this type of repair to worst-off corrosion and customers are still rolling around 1.5-2 years later. \n40min later, my car started for the first time since 10:00a.m and I purred away! He was so nice and not shmucky like previous mechanics I have dealt with before that always try to over-sell me (because let's face it, my car is very worn in and maintenance has not always been my specialty)\nNow that I know there is a good guy to trust around these parts of town, I will definitely be back..... Hopefully next time it's BEFORE I have to be towed in.
