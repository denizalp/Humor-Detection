I watched Daddy Long Legs about two weeks ago.   The story was so heartwarming, beautiful, and romantic, as if you are watching a Jane Austen's novel coming to live.  \n\nThe two actors were magnificent.  I hope they will return back to ATC. \nThere is not a bad in seat in the house at The Herberger Theater.  A major plus is that you get in\/out of ladies room during intermissions before the performance starts again.   Thank you all for a fantastic evening!
