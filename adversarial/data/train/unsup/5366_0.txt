Actually, I don't really know what to rate what they've done to my childhood ghetto mall.  I have such twisted and complicated memories that straddle feelings of sentiment and a simple wonder at how much it's changed.  I had my very first ever birthday party in Canada at the McDonald's located in the adjacent parking lot which was my parents' heartfelt but vain attempt to get me assimilated with my new classmates.  I remember rushing here on the streetcar after school only to be crushed to find out that after saving for months to buy my own Cabbage Patch Kid, Zeller's told me that they were sold out.   (Yeah, I'm still torn up about it.)  It was totally depressing even back then when malls were new and I think it's because of the crappy memories I have attached to it that I sort of don't mind the renos.  There really isn't anything worth buying at this mall...unless you're really into Dollar store items and The Home Depot.  I come here to get my vacuum serviced and to peek into the Winners but otherwise, the place gives me the heebie jeebies.
