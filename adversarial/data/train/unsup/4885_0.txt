This place is like soccer heaven.  How awesome!  Went to go watch the Galaxy play the Wizards and it made a great venue.  Right up next to the players.  No walls or fences to separate them.  Awesome!  They have a ton of fields and everywhere you look you see kids playing footie.  It's a great sight.  Hopefully some day facilities like this will pay off and the USA will bring home the Cup.
