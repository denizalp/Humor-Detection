One of the best American brunch places I have been to. We were in town for two days. We decided to come to this place after seeing the wonderful reviews on yelp and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We ordered a simple vegetarian Benedict but the taste was mind blowing. The hollandaise sauce they used was a delight to my taste buds. And also the homemade fries.\nThe wait time isn't that bad, even though it was a Sunday. The waiters were friendly and even though the place was packed, everything was delivered on time. There's isn't even one thing that I wasn't happy about in this place. A must try diner if you're in town!!
