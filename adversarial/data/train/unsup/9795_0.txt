We decided to eat here before the winter beerfest due to its proximity to the convention center. We've drank here multiple times but never thought to try their food. We arrived before the rest of our party so we had a drink at the bar. The initial person who asked what we wanted wasn't that friendly and didn't offer us a drink menu. After getting up and trying to figure out what beers were in the coolers, another bartender offered us menus. We were also served popcorn with a ranch seasoning while we waited at the bar. It was really good. Not greasy with a nice flavor. \n\nOnce the rest of our group arrived, we moved to a table in the bar area (the upstairs was booked). The menu isn't extensive but everything we had was delicious. The consensus was that the buns for the sandwiches had to have been made at a local bakery- they were very fresh. Two people in our party had turkey burgers and they loved them. The side of the day was broccoli with a sweet chili sauce, which was a nice way to spice up broccoli. One couple shared fish tacos and raved about the seasoning on the fish. \n\nAll in all, I won't rule tonic out in the future when looking for a place to eat. The service isn't five stars but not so bad I wouldn't go back.
