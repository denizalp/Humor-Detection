Every time we visit this World Market location the employees are very courteous and helpful.  They will hold things up front while you continue to shop so you don't have to carry items.  You will want to do this because something else will catch your eye during your visit.\n\nA definite must is to sign up for the World Market Explorer rewards program.  You can earn a 10% off reward just by signing up!  \n\nDon't forget to check out the wine selection, candy, furniture, art, and everything else that World Market offers.  You won't be disappointed!
