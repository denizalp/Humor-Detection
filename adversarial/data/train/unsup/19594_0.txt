As if 2011 hasn't sucked enough, I find that my favorite Korean restaurant has closed. No more Kojan Bistro! So freaking devastating. Where will I go for my Korean fix? Why are there so few Korean restaurants in Charlotte? And why are they all in Matthews?\nSure I've tried Chowan Gardens, and they're ok, but what I call Asian for white people.\n\nSo I've ventured into PePeRo, and am much happier person now. They must have had a recent renovation, because the infamous counter with the sideways menu is gone. Or maybe I just couldn't find it.  There is now a nice looking dining area, with about 12-14 tables. Also a television or two, and table side service, which was more than adequate. I would have preferred an actual glass of water, as opposed to the coffee mug with minuscule amount of ice.  \n\nThe food was just fabulous. The banchan is my favorite part of the Korean meal, and these did not disappoint. The garlicky cabbage and daikon kimchi, bean sprout salad, fish cakes, and radish salad were all delicious. Would have loved to had another variety in the lineup, but ask and they will replenish whatever banchan you would like. The short rib soup and bibimbap were yummy, and prices were very reasonable.\n\n5 stars for Charlotte, maybe 4 stars for LA; but I can't afford to fly out to LA for my Korean fix all the time. This is all Charlotte has and I'm grateful for it.
