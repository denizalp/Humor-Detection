Great Atmosphere here!\n\nIf you like fine dinning with your Mexican food, you'll love this place!\n\nYou'll be greeted by a host or hostess once you walk in. This place has a really nice theme and great style of culture.\n\nYou get chips and salsa once you are seated which is really cool. There is three different kinds of salsa with the chips. I really like the green colored one! \n\nI ordered an ultimate margarita on the rock without salt... The Margaritas here are really good! After about three of the ultimate one, I started to feel really good! Have to love the liquid courage! HAHA\n\nOff the menu you I ordered the mini chimis, the beef ones. The meet was very delicious, and the sides were very nicely arranged. \n\nMy overall experience here was really good! Next time I return here, I think I'll try the beergartita, and the enchiladas.
