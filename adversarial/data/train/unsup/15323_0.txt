BUYER BEWARE,\n\nWhere to begin. \nSales Agents very nice to your face but that's where it ends. Waited all day for delivery.  \n12\/26\/2013\nCalled at 4pm. Rude Woman (Carol) said your delivery time is between 11-7pm and you would get a phone call 1 hour prior to delivery.Needed to pick kids up from practice. Called at 545pm. Again Rude Woman (Carol) said we will call you one hour prior to delivery.  735pm  No delivery, No Phone call. Called My New BFF CAROL, she was very pissed that I was calling about my delivery again.  She put me hold for 5 min, then said she would call me back.  I got a call back after 8pm, Carol said that the delivery truck broke down and that she would just reschedule my delivery for tomorrow between 11-7pm. I told that I have to work, she kept giving me delivery days that I work. Carol was very pissed that I was making life hard for her. I told to just cancel my order. Carol made it very clear that I would that I would have to come in for refund.\n12\/27\/2013\nWent back to store, Sales agents said it would take a couple of days for refund to show up back in your account\n12\/29\/2013\nNo refund. Called store. They said cause it Sunday, it wont post back to your account.\n12\/30\/2013\nNo refund. Called store. They said all refunds take 30 to process and to stop calling.\n\nI'll let you know how this story ends. It may be a Happy ending, I may need a good lawyer.
