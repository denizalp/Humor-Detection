Live close and walk here and haven't had a problem until today. New guy was chewing tobacco while making my sandwich and it was all over his mouth. Super grossed out. Management and owner should be aware of this. Very unsanitary and just gross in general. Who chews tobacco anymore? And WHILE WORKING? Like I can't even. They lost my business
