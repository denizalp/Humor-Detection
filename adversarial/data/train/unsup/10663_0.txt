I love the Tiki Room.  I've been coming here since I had my first fake ID (long long ago).  The drink menu is amazing, very wild, very tropical and lots of booze.  Total dive bar so don't come expecting fancy.  If you show up during the day, be prepared to be blind when you walk in.  \n\nBottom line.  You need to come here, you need to drink too much, you need to thank me after.
