Oooh fancy fancy! I'm not going to pretend I didn't eat a ton of the .25 cent packages of Top Ramen back in the day.. but now that I am older, I am all about this fancy ramen and JINYA is my favorite place to slurp up some curly noodles.\n\nMy first visit to JINYA was with some of my favorite Yelpers, Jessica M. and Dyanna L., both who had made multiple visits to JINYA and were able to guide me through ordering. I have since returned with my husband and every experience has been excellent. Never too long a wait to be seated, friendly and efficient service and the ambiance is quite nice as well.\n\nThe chicken ramen is my go-to order, the broth is so flavorful. I always get some additions to customize my order: I love adding butter, mushrooms, corn and LOTS of freshly pressed garlic.  JINYA has more than ramen, the tempura brussel sprouts are a must get, they are amazing. \n\nFor your late night, party animal types: JINYA is open until 3 am, and has Happy Hour from 3-5pm AND 10pm-12am! \n\nPro tip: Do not leave without checking out the restroom.
