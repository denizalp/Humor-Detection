03\/19\/10\n\nKitschy, fun country-life decor.  There was about a 15-minute waiting time.  Lots of older citizens waiting, which made for interesting chit-chat amongst the women.  It's refreshing when a restaurant's setting allows people to feel comfortable enough to interact among strangers-- Mom and I encounter so many \"closed\" individuals on a daily basis at work, so this is a nice change of pace for us.  Staff here seem friendly and busy, but efficient.  At least, ours was.  One complaint: it's a bit cramped in here.  It would be nice to have a little privacy from other neighboring tables, especially when I spied a room in the back that had maybe four 4-tops, and only one was occupied.\n\nCan't recall what Mom ordered, but I wasn't surprised that she didn't enjoy it-- the menu description definitely did not appeal to me.  Website does not list a menu, and all I can recall is that it was an omelet w\/ a couple of fibrous veggies (snow peas and something else; it was a strange combo, of that I'm sure of.  Chestnuts, maybe?).  I went w\/ a Belgian waffle, two eggs, and bacon.  Coffee was weak, but our server offered to brew a stronger pot.  Nice!  While we waited for our selections, she brought out some mini-muffins to enjoy, and that we did!  We both really liked the bran.  I also enjoyed the zucchini-- Mom thought she detected cinnamon (not a fave of hers), but I think it's the nutmeg she was referring to.  Then again, I may be mistaken...\n\nWaffle was, well, a waffle.  No accompanying fruit compotes or coulis to liven things up.  I always bring my own 100% organic maple syrup, because while most restaurants say they offer maple syrup, it isn't 100% pure, but a blend of maple and corn syrups.  (If it smells like Mrs. Butterworth's, it isn't 100% maple.  Just sayin'.)  Eggs were cooked to over-medium, just that way I like 'em.  Bacon was very nice.\n\nCute saucer and dinner plates, lovely mini-muffins (we bought extra to-go!), good bacon, and efficient service make for a solid two stars.  I wouldn't mind giving KTC another try, if we're in the area.  Next time we'll try the pancakes and crepes!
