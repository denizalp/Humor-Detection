Asian lady didn't want to do her job and took a break as i was walking up to her station ... leaving me baffled ,..... good thing southwest had a good customer service specialist when they hired Adrienne Sims ... she seen what had happened and immediately caught my attention so that she could assist me... i appreciate her goin above and beyond and she deserves a big KUDOS. now if their prices were more competitive I'd use them more
