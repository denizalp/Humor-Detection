I purchased a dining room table and chair set here - beautiful, love it, fits my space perfectly. I worked with Joe, who was a great salesman and helped me find what I needed without being pushy. \nAs great as he was, though, this store really need to step up their customer communication. My table had to be ordered, which was fine, but they never called me to tell me it was in or set up delivery. I had to call them to see if it was in, again to see when it would be delivered, again to set up the time, and again when the delivery didn't arrive on time (and this all happened after the estimated delivery date). \nSo, while I'm really happy with the table, I don't feel like the burden of tracking it down and setting everything up should have been on me alone.
