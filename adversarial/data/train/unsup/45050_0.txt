While staying at the Bellagio we decided to try the Sunday Buffet. While the price was relatively reasonable the size seemed pretty small for a large hotel buffet. The food was underwhelming at best. The prime rib was overcooked and dry. The omelet station was the standout. Save your money and walk across the street to Bon Ami Gabi and thank me later.
