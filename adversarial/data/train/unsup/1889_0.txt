BACKGROUND\n\nIt's been a while since I originally reviewed You've Got Maids. \n\nSince my last review, there is new ownership, which hasn't changed the business at all, in fact if anything, made the business better. The new owner, Doug, is extremely friendly and helpful.\n\nAs I divulged in my original review, keeping up on my house cleaning is not my forte. In fact, I come from a long line of hoarders on both my mother and father's side, so getting rid of stuff has always been hard for me. \n\nMARIE KONDO THE LIFE CHANGING MAGIC OF TIDDYING UP\n\nI recently read a book by a Japanese woman, Marie Kondo, about the life changing effects of organizing your stuff. Although, this is not an entirely new concept, as Feng Shui as been around forever, Ms. Kondo's approach is fun and delightful. In fact, she has some fantastic YouTube videos demonstrating her technique.\n\nLong story short, in attempts to realize the life changing effects of organizing my stuff, I hired You've Got Maids, and removed absolutely everything from my closets and cabinets and threw away all of the junk and had them thoroughly cleaned. (see pics)\n\nThe last time, I added my upstairs too! \n\nSERVICE EXPERIENCE\n\nJeremy and Kelly busted their butts for about 5 hours cleaning my house and it looks amazing and most importantly, it FEELS amazing!\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI have to say, having a well organized and CLEAN home, really does put you in a good mood!\n\n5\/5 Highly recommend You've Got Maids!
