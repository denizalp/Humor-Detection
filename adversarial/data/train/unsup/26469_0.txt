I was very interested in visiting CYD (Cajun Yard Dog) simply because Madison's was gone and they're new. Which is great for this area! I ordered the deviled crab cake and Okrachokie minus the okra... (I am an okra snob and frozen just doesn't cut the cake, but that's just me). What was left was artichokes and calamari. I also LOVE red beans and rice. This version contained andouille sausage. \n\nHow was it? The calamari was fried with the artichokes and that's where it goes wrong. Calamari cook extremely fast, so fast in fact that the breading is often under cooked while the calamari over cook. They come out a bit rubbery and the artichokes were soggy. The breading was a bit bland. Which was a bit of a shock.\n\nWhen I was looking the menu over I was rather intimated by all the Cajun and jalape√±o ingredients, but I shouldn't have been. The heat is warm and builds, but stays rather mellow. Sauce is king here, delish! \n\nNext up is the red beans and rice. I got here at 7:45-8pm and they close at 9. I am saying this because it is rather late to be ordering food. The rice was perfect. The seasoning was spot-on! Really good flavor here. However, the sausage tasted like it had been cooking for about 24 hrs, way over cooked and a bit grainy textured. The beans were good, maybe a bit dry, but again, the flavor was as really great! \n\nLastly, the crab cake. I saved this for last because it was my favorite! I am a Floridian originally and this deviled crab cake took me back to my home state. They are thick (possibly a bit too thick) but taste just like the thinly battered deviled crab I grew up with. Don't expect it to be a Maryland crab cake... this is purely the Southern deviled crab cake. \n\nI'll will be returning to tray actual dinners and at a better time. I have not doubt it will be tasty.
