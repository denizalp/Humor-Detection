This place is absolutely awesome and so much better than all the other tanning salon places I have ever been to.  The place is always clean and there are so many things to chose from relaxation. The owner:  the  perfect lady and so professional and courteous.  Laura at the front desk is without a doubt the most  knowledgable and she always provides really great customer service skills.  I highly recommend this place.
