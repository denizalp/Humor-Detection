LOVED THIS PLACE.\n\n\nLOVED. IT.\n\nI read the reviews, and I was a bit skeptical because I rarely ever go to straight people clubs anymore.\n\nBut I went here because Anastasiya recommended it.\n\nWHAT A NIGHT.\n\nThis place is upstairs from Lees Palace, which is a big thing apparently (never heard of it before, but Im not a hipster, so)\n\nThe music was great, a lot of early 2000 and late 90's flash backs, which was awesome! The music of my prime :)\n\nThe drinks were sooooooooooo cheap from what I remember!\n\n\nTHe people were fun and friendly, and I got to see a few characters as mentioned below (the pajama man!)\n\nOnly thing though, everyone looked like they were 19 or younger, so ..\n\nI'm just old.
