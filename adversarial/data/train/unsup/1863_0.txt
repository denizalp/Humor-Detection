***This Walgreens has enough variety to probably get you that personal, travel or grocery item you might have forgotten, but it, like many pharmacies in Las Vegas, is quite pricey.  You definitely pay for the convenience of not having to venture to a Target or bigger store off The Strip***\n\nSince this Walgreens is located a little bit away from the main action on The Strip, they do offer a free parking lot (lots of open parking spaces here).
