It seems, I ECHO what most claim about this Restaurant (Sadly):\n\n1. VERY SLOW service\n2. NO hospitality\n3. Service is NOT attentive\n4. LONG wait times between refills ( just walk over and do it yourself at the bar )\n5. WAVING down your waitress while she chats with the other staff members, Ignoring you\n\nA big eating  MAN  I am looking for me food !  and sadly I was not overly impressed with the food \/ service \/ dark ambient here at  Island Mix Restaurant.\n\nIn Durham I loved: __  Sunset Gardens Restaurant & Bar ___ HWY#2 and Ajax -  my feelings would be the food  is \"sweet na fcuk\" or as they say delicious and well seasoned.
