You know the feeling you got the first time you saw Michael Jackson moonwalk, or the first time you saw Michael Jordan dunk from the free throw line, or the first time you heard the Beatles? This is what I felt when I took the first bite of the absolutely perfect 55 day dry-aged Porterhouse steak (cooked medium) at N9NE. \n\nI can tell you the service was good, the restaurant was cool, blah blah blah... None of that matters. \n\nAll that matters is that you save up some $$ (because it's pricey as hell) and head on over to N9NE and order yourself a porterhouse with a side of jumbo shrimp scampi (AMAZING) and ruin your life forever, because you will never want steak from anywhere else ever again. \n\nN9NE, you complete me.
