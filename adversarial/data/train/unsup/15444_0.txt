We came here the other day to celebrate both my birthday and another friend of mine. One of our friends gifted the Groupon. It was pretty hot, but if you come early enough it isn't too bad and you can get quite a few rounds in before you feel like you're about to pass out. This is a good thing to do to help you realize just how out of shape you really are, but it was fun.
