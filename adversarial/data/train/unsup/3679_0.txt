YUM! YUM! YUM!\n\nJust know, from all the reviews, that it's stunning in here.  I'll leave the other reviews for aesthetics; this is about the drinks, bitches!\n\nIt was quite the endeavor for Jim G. and I to get to Chandelier 1.5 (the middle section of this stunning bar) but it was so worth it!  I tried two of their \"molecular mixology\" drinks, and was very pleased:\n-Fire Breathing Dragon: This drink had Bacardi Dragonberry, Raspberry Puree, Lemongrass, Thai Chili Syrup, and Black and Red Peppercorn along the rim.  There were also nitrogen-fused (or something like that) raspberries that, when tasted, emitted a lovely smoke (hence the name of the drink).  This was sweet, spicy, and yummy!!!\n-Campfire Delight: I saw this drink and really wanted it, but didn't want anything so sweet; not when the night of drinking was still beginning.  The waitress talked me into it and I'm so glad she did.  This drink has Van Gogh Dutch Chocolate Vodka (get their double espresso vodka in your freezer now, for shots, by the way), RumChata Mozart Dark Chocolate (who knows what this is??), Cream, Toasted Marshmallow Syrup, and actual toasted marshmallows on the top. Heavenly.  Strong, a little sweet, and strong. =)\n\nGood people watching too.  Can't wait to come back!
