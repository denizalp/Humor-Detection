This is my go to place after working out at the studio next door. Service is always great, but tends to be a bit slower on weekends. Understandable, since it gets quite packed. I definitely recommend one of the smoothies. My favorite is the watermelon smoothie. Pretty much everything on their menu is a hit, but my personal favorite dish is the Delice Avocado. You get fruit, avocado on bread, eggs and fruit. For a little extra, ask for the house potatoes. I go for breakfast at least once a week here and I have never been disappointed.
