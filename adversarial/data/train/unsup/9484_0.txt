This has to be the NICEST group of people I've ever dealt with at Chase. Mind you, this location is inside a Fry's grocery store, but they still provide all the services a normal Chase has... without the wait, long lines and ditzy tellers filing their nails. \n\nI always come here no matter what. It's convenient because it's in the area, and I love that I can get groceries\/bath products all in one trip. If you're in this neighborhood, check this branch out.
