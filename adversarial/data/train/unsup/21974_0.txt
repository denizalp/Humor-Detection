Update 10\/8\/16 - spoke to Justin, the owner and learned that chef Wang cooks each pot of soup for their hot pot individually and that he is picky about who cooks his dish, which is no one but him. \n\nNth trip back. We love this place and recently discovered the Chef Wang's Special Menu. More szechuan dishes to choose from. Try the pea tips in broth - it is loaded with ham and other protein and the soup \/ broth tasted wonderful. Most recently we tried the crispy chicken and it was flavorful! Not a single regret. \n\n2nd trip back. This time, we are here to try their dinner selections. Ordered mah Lah beef brisket Claypot, Hong shau tofu (braised tofu), roast duck and west lake beef soup. \n\nFirst - it was quite at 8pm. Food was delicious and exceeded my expectations.  Starting with the old favorites, the duck continues to taste good. Skin wasn't as crispy as the first time but taste is consistent. West lake beef soup was very good. Best I've had within the last year. The beef brisket Claypot ---- my oh my. Wonderful taste. I was afraid that it will be too spicy for me but not do. It was spicy in a flavorful way. Definitely give it a try. \n\nThe braised tofu is ok. Nothing to brag about. I prefer the Cantonese style with square tofu with a smoother texture. This is not the right type of tofu to use. We called this tau kwa. Very firm. Also the vegetables used were too westernized for me, carrots and peppers. Ideally this would be made with more mushrooms, baby back Choy and maybe some small bits of carrots for colors. \n\nOverall a good experience and will return to try other dishes.
