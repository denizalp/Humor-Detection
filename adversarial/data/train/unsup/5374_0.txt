We had dinner at Comme Ça during this trip in Las Vegas. We hadn't dined there in over two years. I was looking forward to some of the dishes that I had really enjoyed having at Comme Ça in the past including their bone-in steaks and amazing desserts. \nI was disappointed to find that the menu had changed since the last time we dined there. I was not concerned about my favorite dishes being on the menu however I was concerned about the limited menu from what it once was. Some of the larger steak dishes were gone. This is fine for most occasions however I was looking forward to the delicious Comme Ça steak that I was accustomed to. The dessert menu has also changed however limited. \nThe overall experience felt \"watered down\" as if the establishment had made a decision to tone things down a little and remove some frills and concentrate on the core items. Just didn't work out well for me.
