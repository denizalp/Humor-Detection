Some positives, some negatives.  Newly renovated, newly renamed Alice Fazooli's in the parking lot across from Square One.\n\nPlace was really busy, 20 minute wait at 1PM on a Thursday for a table so we just sat in the bar area instead.\n\nService was pretty good, lots of people checking up on us and refilling the sodas as needed.  Servers and waitress both friendly although a little over the top in trying to sell some of the dishes, and overhyping them.\n\nPositives:  \n\nCaesar Salad nice and garlicky, real bacon, and nice crunchy large homemade croutons\n\nGenerous with the grana padano cheese, freshly grating as much of it as you could possibly want on any item.\n\nCalamari Fritti nicely fried and the breading was good and crispy\n\nStuffed Meatball was definitely tasty, although dining companion said there wasn't enough cheese inside\n\nComplimentary tableside large bottle of water (tap) automatically dropped off to table without asking\n\nNegatives:\n\nThe big screw up was that the breaded chicken parmesan cutlet tasted FISHY.  They've obviously been using the same fryer oil to do the calamari or other fried seafood items.  This was a big blunder.  Told the waitress and she was pretty indifferent about it, didn't offer any discount or even to have it remade.  Took a star for this alone.\n\nPeppers added to the chicken sandwich were very raw and had the skins on; you'd take a bite out of the sandwich and have to pick out the crunchy raw pepper from your teeth and remove it. \n\nNo fresh mozzerella cheese, their big boastful selling point, except in the hours of 5pm-9pm.  Stupid.\n\nCalamari, while a positive in the sense that it tasted good, wasn't really big enough to share\n\nGarlic\/Rosemary French Fries were very very saturated in oil, and served in a metal \"cup\" that doesn't absorb anything so there's a very unappealing pile of oil at the bottom.\n\nThe $16 order of spaghetti and meatball was a single solitary meatball served on a rather small portion of pasta.  I don't expect monster portions but I mean come on, it's pasta, one of the cheapest things in the world to make.. \n\nNo complimentary bread of any sorts is outrageous and just plain chincy especially for Italian food, where it's meant to dip into sauces and so on.  Took another star specifically for this.\n\nI guess they are going for the upscale experience but that doesn't have to mean miniaturizing the portions just to keep things looking \"neat\" and \"compact\"\n\nOverall; the food had its positives and negatives, and I would have given it at least a 3\/5 but there were quite a few things they should have addressed, even after I mentioned it to the staff.\n\nWill try it once more at a later date, during the hours they actually have fresh cheese.  Will post any updates then.
