This place is a step above a dump. I check in, the staff is very friendly and accomodating. On my walk to my room, I'm not impressed with the hotel. It's like an oldish hotel, in between a Red Roof Inn and La Quinta. I just need a good bed and shower, so what the hell. I go to the bathroom, lift the seat, to see a nasty surprise. I immediately call the front desk to tell them what I saw. They came up right away and scrubbed down the entire bathroom, which obviously wasn't cleaned before my arrival. They took off the $5.00 room fee or tax. If I wasn't so tired, I would have left and gone to a nearby hotel. Ugh, never again...
