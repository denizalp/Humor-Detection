Tried for the first time yesterday and all I can say is no need to go back. had the Mushroom Swiss Burger with Smash Fries. Burger was okay, but I've had better (actually much better) for less. Smash Fries  were good, but not enough to equal what I paid for them. One of the other reviewers used the word trendy and that is same term my circle of friends uses in a derogatory sense. Smash Burger wants to be the Starbucks of hamburger joints (you know cool hangout where you pay too much for what you get because you are cool). Loud music, Check, Overpriced food and drink. Check People on laptops\/cell phones by themselves acting cool. Check Save your money and your eardrums, go somewhere else.
