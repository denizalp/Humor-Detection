There are 2 loves in my life and they are Chinese food and Mexican food. To think they fused both into one delicious delight makes me believe they built this place in honor of me.\n\nIt's a great little fast food place with pretty good portions. The menu itself is a little confusing. There is too many acronyms and too much writing involved. I just wanna eat! Their signature dish is the jade chicken which is kinda like a Mexican style orange chicken. Pretty good i would have to say. The Jerk Chicken packs a punch with its kick of spiciness. The rice served with it is a little dry and it's no bueno to eat dry food and spicy food together, but still delicious overall.\n\nIf they had one of these in LA i would go all the time. Great food, great prices, great portions. Fast food at its best.
