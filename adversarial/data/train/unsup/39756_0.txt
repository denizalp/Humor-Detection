This is my go-to place for amazing pastries and bread in North York Centre. It's a cozy yet modern bakery with seating on the side. They also serve Chatime drinks as well. There are many favourites here but the all time favourite is the earl grey flute. Soft, fluffy, and the earl grey icing in the middle. Overall a must visit when you are in the area.
