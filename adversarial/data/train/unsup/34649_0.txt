Very bad pharmacy service, not one time but several times. The worst \n\nThey have lost prescriptions. Failed to fill them properly, even shorted the pill count. Prescriptions filed away somewhere and not processed until the third call to them. \n\n\nPitiful service, give you an attitude as if they did not screw up to begin with.
