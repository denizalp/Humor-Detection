Not sure about the other reviews but this place is outstanding.  Having visited six times since it opened, I have found the food and service to always be great.  Each item has always been cooked to the perfect temperature and the prices are incredible for the quality.  The service is excellent, I am unsure why every restaurant does not take the time to train the staff like Chada obviously has.  Add in riedel stemware, a convenient location, nice buildout and a great playlist.....go.
