Late Sunday morning shopping for the week. The store was well kept and not too busy with a great selection and reasonable prices. This time of the day, I had no concerns with security. The store is clean and tidy, the staff was efficient, opening another register when a third person was waiting.\n\nShelves are stocked and ready. A reasonable amount of produce, the meat bunkers were fresh and inexpensive.\n\nThis store is A-OK.
