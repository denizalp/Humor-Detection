Dont you just love the bookmark feature?\n\nIt's lunch time so I check my bookmarks and what do you know? Fat Boy is right down the street. So off I go!\n\nAs I come in I hear Mexican music playing in the background. While looking at the menu on the wall, the lady behind the counter greets me in Spanish. I dont blame her cuz I kind of look like im Mexican. For a second there I almost ordered Al Pastor tacos. LOL.\n\nSo I ask the nice lady what was good since it was my first time. She said to go with the combo of the single Boyger, Chencho Fries and Small Drink. CHEN WHAT? She smiles at me and says, \"Chencho Fries: Your choice of fat or skinny fries topped with cheese, chicken bits, and a green sauce.\" Ok! Combo it is!\n\nI take a bite of the Boyger. I had to do a double take. Am I at Fatburger or Fat Boy? It tastes just like theirs but I paid 6 bucks and some change instead of 10 bucks or more. Now that I can get with. \n\nAs for their Chencho fries, its basically an enchilada but with potato sticks instead. What I found out was that you should eat it right away because it tends to get soggy over time and it doesnt matter if you get it with fat or skinny fries. So if you are into green sauce, this will sure hit the spot!\n\nBesides burgers, these guys have wings, chicken fingers and pizza. Not to mention sandwiches, boyrritos, and combination plates. Their pizzas must be good because when I was eating my food, this lady comes in and picks up 5 pizzas to go.\n \nThe minus 1 star is for their location. They are situated in one of many suites of one big building. The part of town they are in is kind of suspect. I can only assume what characters may come out at night. \n\nSome random info: They take cards and from what I noticed, there is no minimum. They have a decent soda fountain so you should be able to get your refills' worth. They got I would say about 6 small tables so if its packed, dont let it discourage you. You can always take it to go. There is a bathroom but you have to ask and then walk through the kitchen towards the back. Kind of awkward if you ask me but if you gotta go, you gotta go!\n\nSo whenever I have a Fatburger craving, im yelling out \"Fat Boy!\" because nobody  wants to eat at \"Skinny Boy\".
