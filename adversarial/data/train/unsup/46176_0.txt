I came here several times because the portion was big and charge at reasonable pricr. I usually habe the egg benedict and it comes with big heap of potato. My other friend got the grand slam. It is as big as sizeable Family meal. If you want to go food coma, then this place is great. Quality is B+, service it ranges base on hours but last time i had a grumpy lady who charge $1.50 for an extra plate just because we order two.( That definitely pisses me off and i think if they do that it drives business away i hope the manager that reads take some action as it is illegal business conduct to charge for an empty extra plate) That was a bit ridiculous and insulting as the other table had great service. The design and layout was old and out dated but friendly atmosphere.
