Service was mediocre and the food was \"meh\" at best which is a bummer since I had been here before and the food was pretty good the last time. I got the Brussel Sprout nachos and the Brussel Sprouts weren't even cooked. It tasted as if they just threw them on the chips and that was that. Bleh. The server seemed more annoyed with us than anything and he was slow at just about everything from getting our drinks to even showing up at our table. I really was hoping for a great experience but when you bring six other people and everything is just ok, it's pretty disappointing. Their steak bowl was alright so I'd suggest to get that, if anything!
