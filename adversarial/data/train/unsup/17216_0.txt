It's Monday or Tuesday and you're craving a sweet, what do you do? Well, if you're like me, you head over to Baskin Robbins for a 99 cent kid's size daiquiri ice. \n\nThe place gets extremely crowded and although there wasn't much of a line when we got there, it was extremely busy as we sat there enjoying our ice cream. The employees are really nice and helpful, but I did notice that the ice cream seemed a little meltier than I'm used to. Still good, just wish it was a little more solid.
