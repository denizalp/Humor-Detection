Every time I go to a place like Bomberos I tend to guess what it's reminiscent of.  Is it South Beach? New York? LA?  And I caught myself doing the same thing sitting on Bomberos patio when I decided it belongs to Phoenix, pure and simply.  The architecture of the building, the patio, hot & sweaty nights, latin music playing in the background, all reminiscent of our great city. \n\nWe sat on the beautiful patio, with twinkling candles, mesquite trees acting as a makeshift umbrella, with comfy patio furniture.  There are several nice features on the patio - a fountain, fire pit, lots of candles and a beautiful piece of candle wall art.  Even though there were only two occupied tables on the patio that night, they still came out and lit all 50+ candles. \n\nI ordered a fabulous glass of wine, I wish I could remember the name to recommend - I do remember it was white and from Argentina. For food we ordered the salad of the day, bruschetta, the salami pesto Panini and the chocolate espresso torte.  All were good, but the dessert was delectable.  \n\nI wanted to give this place 5 stars because I really dug it, but had to deduct a star for the following:\n\n1. Bringing out our salad with our entrees when we clearly ordered it as an app. \n2. A panini that was painful to bite into, it seriously scratched the roof of your mouth.\n3. A beautiful fire pit, but is it really necessary in the 100+ heat? \n4. Good bruschetta, but not as good as Postino. \n\nOur waiter told us that they open at 7am and to come in for a glass of morning wine.  A glass of wine before work?  Now there's a novel idea.
