First, the location on the map is completely wrong. It is on Gilbert and Warner right by life time fitness.\n\nI had to switch doctors because my old doctor didn't accept my new insurance carrier. I found this place and they verified all my information when booking the appointment for me.  I came in 30 minutes early to fill out my paperwork since I'm a new patient. After the nurse calling me in, taking my vitals, and seating me for the doctor to come in, they decide to call me back to the reception to let me know that they don't accept my insurance. First of all, why would you even book the appointment and schedule me in then? Second of all, why isn't your staff 100&% sure before even scheduling these appointments. I wasted an hour of my morning, was late for work and now have to do research to find another doctor. \n\nNote to staff, be 100% sure before even booking appointments and wasting our time.
