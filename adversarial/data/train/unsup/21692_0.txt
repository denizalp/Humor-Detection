I decided to give AZ Hair Co.a try primarily because of their hours. Open 9am-8pm on the weekdays, it was a perfect opportunity for me to take my 6 year old for a haircut after I got off work. \n\nSo, after reading Sarah G.'s review of a VERY long wait time, I decided to make an appt. The receptionist was friendly on the phone and was happy to schedule me in at 6:15 pm. \n\nUpon arrival, I first noticed the traffic- AZ Hair Co. is next to Verizon Wireless in Tempe Marketplace. On the same side at the movie theater, and boy is parking horrible. Good luck finding a spot close to the salon. But, I didnt mind the walk. \n\nWhen we walked in the door we were right on time 6:13 according to their clock, but the receptionist was out and there were 3 people waiting. \n\nSo, after standing at the desk for a few minutes, one of the stylist finished up with his client and asked if he could help me. When I told him I had an apt at 6:15 he bit his lip and said \"well, we are running a bit behind today and I have 3 people ahead of you.... I have no idea how long the wait will be.\" \n\nWTF: Really! No idea huh! What is the point of scheduling an apt then?- That's what I wanted to say, but I am passive aggressive, so I just politely smiled and said we would do some shopping and be back in 45 minutes. \n\n45 minutes we arrived back at the salon- all previous customers had left and 5 new people had taken their spots in the chairs and in the waiting room. The receptionist was back and we were allowed to cut in front of the line after another 15 minute wait. \n\nThis is definitely not the place I would go to for a fashionable style. It is more like a Cost Cutters for college clientele- especially men. But, my 6 year old loved her haircut and it only cost me $10+$5 tip. Adult cuts run about $16.
