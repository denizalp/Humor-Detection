Mon Ami Gabi has over 4000 reviews and boasts an average of 4 Stars. On a perfect day, this restaurant can score 5 stars every hour. It wasn't quite a perfect day, this morning , for Mon Ami Gabi & me. No, it wasn't a bad morning either. \nThis restaurant is part of the Paris Hotel & Casino complex. It presents patio seating as well as inside seating. This restaurant shows off a very nice French decor and thus giving a European look and feel to its patrons. \nWe ordered the Smoked Salmon Platter and the Croissant Sandwich with Turkey, Tomato & Avocado. The food was served with minimal waiting on a busy Saturday morning. The Salmon was fresh and the Sandwich was delicious. The portions were about average however matched well with the pricing. An average dish costs about $14.00 .\nI am rating this restaurant at the average category not based on its quality of food or type of decor, which are excellent, but rating it on a service laden with a few errors. I had ordered some eggs to go with the Smoked a Salmon and the server had them on the ticket but the staff had forgotten about them. It was corrected later. We were served coffee however no spoons to stir it with. This was not corrected. We used our butter knives to stir and mix the coffee. \nThe food at this establishment is absolutely delicious. The price point is perfect. The service category may have just had a less than stellar morning today. \nI will dine here again and also recommend others to do so.
