I went to this show with very low expectations and turned out I was correct. The show starts off slow and boring, then proceeds with the usual magic tricks. Only a couple of tricks seem to be new (rather not usual). I have seen better and FREE magic shows. This show is NOT WORTH THE MONEY.\n\nCriss does not show his face so seems like a body double is used for some tricks and he just talks about his success MOST OF THE TIME. People come to watch him because they know he is famous, he need not brag and waste our time! The show has fake claps, fame laughter, fame hooting and even fake audience. After a couple of cheaply done tricks, people stand up and clap which seems to be totally fake.\n\nThe staff at Luxor adds to the bad experience. The box office staff is rude and slow and obviously takes the least effort to make you feel welcome if you buy discount tickets (by giving you the worst seats even if the rest are taken, they want to make us feel that the show is full!)
