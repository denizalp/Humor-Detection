ROOMS - Stayed in the Forum Tower...comped room (heck yeah!!) ...not much to complain about here - the bed was super comfy; everything looked newly updated; huge waterfall shower;  just a really solid room.&\n\nPOOL - if you're looking for an over the top party scene this isn't the place.  The pool area is enormous, with lots of different pools w\/ different vibes...but the primary vibe is chill, relaxed, luxurious, and adult - - - i didn't see a single kid, but i think there's a kid area somewhere.  The \"Venus\" pool area is topless, although the ladies going topless are a mix of \"damn!\" & \"please put your top back on\", so your eyes never know what they might accidentally land on....  Had a blast both days w\/o feeling like I was at a frat party : )\n\nNIGHTLIFE - \"Pure\" nightclub is a joke.  Period.  Maybe the club is beautiful  but the people they had in that line were NOT.  We were on a list to get in free & were about to walk in when I took a good look around and realized I'd be spending Sat night w\/ some seriously \"not ready for prime time\" individuals.  Hmmmm....that sounded mean... but when you're in Vegas you kinda want to be surrounded by hotness ; )\n\nSHOPPING - a bunch of the same shops that you can find everywhere else - BUT, the little boutique (Carina?) had an awesome sale & I got out like a bandit!!  ....also made out w\/ 75% off at the swim shop outside the pool area....end of summer sale - WOO!\n\nRESTAURANTS - Eat at \"Joe's\" & be happy.\n\nGAMBLING - the \"pussycat dolls\" section of tables was full of some smoking hot dealers...but I tend to like a slightly less distracting vibe when I'm losing all my money - - - I had a great night (turned $100 into $750) & a junk night (lost $300 in about 30 minutes).
