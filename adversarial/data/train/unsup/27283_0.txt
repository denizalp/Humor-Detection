The food was pretty good. Nothing fantastic or innovative. Service was good, they had recently just opened so I could tell some kinks had to be worked out in terms of service. 4 waitresses bringing different dishes, asking us how things were, if we wanted to order more, more, more. It was a bit bothersome but understandeable. Overall a decent place to try, but a bit pricey for calling themselves a Tapas place. 2 of us racked up a bill of over 100 bucks. I'll give em a month or so and try them again.
