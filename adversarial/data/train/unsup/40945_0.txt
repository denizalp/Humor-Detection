Second bouquet I have purchased from here - just as amazing as the first.  I bought the first one on a whim for a friend's birthday.  My friend said it was the best she has ever gotten and still talks about it a year later.  Helpful, friendly, and very talented!  Have gotten flowers from many other much more expensive and 'trendier' locations and none have lived up to what I have gotten from Studio Floral.
