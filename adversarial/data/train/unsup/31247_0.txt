I have been here multiple times and enjoyed every visit.  Food has been consistently good and service is always outstanding.\n\nMy S\/O ordered the stuffed talapia, flavors were right and he enjoyed his dish.  He did mention that his greens were under seasoned, but overall enjoyed everything.\n\nI ordered the lamb chops, they were juicy, tender and not cooked to hard.  The sauce is absolutely amazing.\n\nWe also got a desert, the funnel cake.  It had maple syrup, bacon pieces and buttered popcorn icecream.  Very different...almost tasted like breakfast - yet it was good.\n\nWe were going to go to the lounge, but was told that it is only open Thurs to Saturday.
