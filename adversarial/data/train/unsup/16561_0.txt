Bought a Dell Studio 15 a couple months ago.  Works fine, fast enough for me (not a power user), nice monitor, could use another USB port.  Wish I could get a docking station for it.  The reason for the two star rating is for their atrocious customer service - its hard for me to give one star when the computer works fine (up to now, anyways).\n\nI have my fingers crossed that I never have a problem with the actual hardware because then I will have to deal with them.  I would probably go for an Apple next time, the issue with Apple though is price more than anything.\n\nBelow is a copy of an email I sent to Ellen Roseman at the Toronto Star.  Ultimately I got my laptop, no thanks to Dell, and they DID try to deliver at my old address (this will make sense once you read the below, if you can get through it, haha).\n\nI have an issue with Dell, that I'm hoping you'll be able to help with.  I placed an order for a Dell Studio 15 Laptop on\/about April 7.  A couple of days later, after seeing the projected shipping date and realizing that I was going to be living in another location, called Dell to change the shipping date.  Apparently, Dell can (will) not change the shipping date after or just after an order is placed.  After talking to three different CSRs, the best they seem to be able to do for me is the following:\n\nHave ME remind them (they can't seem to make a note for themselves) once the computer has been given to the shipping company,  to re-route the shipment to the delivery company's depot so that I can pick it up  AFTER an attempt is made to the old address where presumably someone else will be living\n\n\"Too bad\" was effectively the response when I suggested they could be giving a computer I paid for to somebody else.\n \nThe result I want is for them to simply change the shipping address to my current location, where I will be able to receive it.\n \nCan you suggest something I can do or someone I might be able to contact?
