Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that, and I...  Never hesitate to put a paper clown on his back!!!!\n\nI shot up a paper zombie clown with an uzi, and loved every second of it! \n\nHere's a few tips for your visit, should you decide to bite the bullet and head over to The Gun Store... \n\nFirst off, get there early if you can. This is very touristy, and it gets crazzzzzzy busy. When we got there, there were a ton of people in line already, I asked about how long, they said it was about an hour wait, it turned out to be just about that. By the time we left there was double the line. \n\nIt's expensive! However, if you live in state with gun laws that prevent you from getting your hands on fully automatic weapons like I do, then I'd say its totally worth it! Plan to spend $50 to shoot one automatic, and $99-160 for a package of 3-4 different guns (comes with a souvenir t-shirt). \n\nThey have a ladies package that came with 3 guns, one of them was a pink AR-15, and you couldn't put a price on the look of that girls face when she was shooting that bad boy! She was smiling for a good hour afterwards!\n\nMy other friends opted for the WW2, and Zombie packages, all the guns were awesome! If I had a ton of money, I would get the shoot the wall package, which was $399 and came with 11 machine guns... OOOOH YEAH! The loudest thing we heard fired in the range was the M249 SAW, next time I'm shootin that bad boy! \n\nOn a side note, I had read some of the reviews of the gun store, and was fully expecting to be treated like dirt by a bunch of cocky employees, but everyone we encountered was super friendly. They are all strapped though, so don't get out line in here! ;)\n\n****Disclaimer: \nPrices mentioned above are subject to change without notice. As mentioned by Shawn A, do not arrive drunk, you will be asked to leave. \n\nThe opinions expressed above are the views of the writer (thats me yo!) and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of other Yelper's, employees of the gun store, Nevada state gun board (does that even esist?), or any Las Vegas casino's including but not limited to the O'Sheas Casino, which completely funded my experience at The Gun Store. \n\nAlthough we experienced no issues, I do not recommend going to the gun store directly before you head back to the airport to catch your flight home, as you will be dusted in gunpowder during your experience inside the shooting range. \n\nSpecial thanks go out to the roulette dealer at O'Sheas Casino, and the employees of The Gun Store. Thank you, and you stay classy Las Vegas!
