Fox, you surprised me!\n\nAfter going to four different Fox Concept restaurants and leaving unimpressed every time, we tried the Arrogant Butcher.  Maybe we've just had bad luck at the other restaurants in the portfolio, maybe Arrogant Butcher is the star of the show.  Anyways, enough about that.\n\nWe came eArly on a Friday evening, managed to catch the very end of happy hour.  Had the pretzels, they were very good...I'd ask for a half size portion next time, they're so good you can't leave one behind.  \n\nSince it was Friday I had the king crab cioppino, it was excellent.  The crab was not a few flakes thrown in just for the name, big sweet pieces right on top.  The supporting cast of fruits de mer were just as good.  They did a great job on this dish.  \n\nOh, totally need to mention the service the waiter was great.  The lady even mentioned how good the quality of customer service was here.  As we were paying he asked if we had parked at city centre....validated parking.  Not a big deal, but a really good touch.\n\nWe will be back.  Maybe we will even try another Fox....
