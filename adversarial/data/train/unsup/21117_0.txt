Not gonna lie as a black man I thought my girlfriend lost her damn mind bringing me to some cult sacrifice a the virgin type place but I quickly realize it was a restaurant were you in the dark. This was so much better than when you can't pay your light bill and have to eat in the dark. Seriously though this was really enjoyable I would have never eaten some of the thing I ate if I would have know what it was. They are a bit pricey but definitely worth the experience.
