I went in here to get a quick bite to eat. The owner was at the cash register rubbing mouth, face with his hands, and I believe he stretched his head. That was so disgusting! I asked the other employees could you make sure that you all fix my food and not the owner, they both said yes, and I explained to them why. The food was good, I had a chicken salad croissant, tasty!!!!
