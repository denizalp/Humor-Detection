I alway have problems here. I came in the store today with my 20 year old PREGNANT wife. We were just finding some lemon poppyseed muffins for her and we passed the liquor aisle and I wanted some beer. I go up to the register and the cashier asks for my id (understandable but hey, i'm 21.) He scans the beer and then turns to my wife and asks for her id and I'm like, she's not drinking because she is pregnant and not 21. He says he has to refuse the sale. I have gone to many stores and this has never been a problem. I say that she is pregnant many times which obviously means she will not drink it but this jerk still says no. Never again will I come here again.
