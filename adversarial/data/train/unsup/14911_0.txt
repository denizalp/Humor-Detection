This is my new gym and i absolutely love it already. I've been going here for a little over a week now. The equipment is great quality and always clean. Best of all i love the whole vibe of the gym.. the owner is always welcoming and everyone there isn't just hanging around on their phones sitting on the equipment unlike other gyms. I know this gym will give me my results quick because i actually like going there.
