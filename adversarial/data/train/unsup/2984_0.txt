Made time this year to attend the \"Christmas at Central\" 'experience' after seeing some cool posts on IG.  Since they had several dates and times, I was happy to see I could go.\n\nThey made it fun a gathering for families and our community with a makeshift park in front of the church complete with food trucks, food booths, petting zoo, and entertainment also. \n\nThe experience itself was a perfect balance of production, Christ and scripture, and lighthearted comedy(dance battle!) from special guest host, Sam Collier of North Point Ministries. \n\nChristmas at Central began with a spectacular intro with Cirque performers. I was in awe! (see my vid clips on the gram)\n\n...::Love the message Pastor Jud gave about grateful hearts:::... \nthey took time out for donations during his message.. this one was #MerryandBright campaign to help children. ..I know for some it can be a turn off when right in the middle of service asking for $$, because I think\/thought that way, but it occured to me that without that special person who donated at the last minute that one church service years ago, my then middle school-age daughter would not have been able to attend Central Christian's Winter Camp back in '03. Our daughter's spiritual path grew even more after that experience, which led her to later to become Central's HSM worship leader and involved with youth ministry.Forever grateful to you who donate and make a difference in someone's life.\n::\"\"::\n..:::driving in traffic and finding a parking spot.....\nIm one of those people that gets lost easily in a parking lot or cant find my car...but volunteers stationed everywhere from entering to exiting to even someone driving around in a golf cart made it stress free! \n\nThe service was went by pretty quick, loved it, and so grateful to be surrounded by genuinely good people and grateful hearts. \nHave a blessed 2018!
