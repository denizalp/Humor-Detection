This place was comfortable and had lots of seating. Their menu actually has a good variety of items such as sushi, dim sum, fried rice and pad thais etc. I found their dim sum surprisingly quite tasty, the sushi rice was a ya harder and they skimped out on the unagi but the sashimi was tasty. \nOnly thing was, it was quite busy when we went so the waiters and waitresses were not as attentive to giving us stuff like wasabi and tea. There were lots of Christmas parties on the Friday that we went though. \nThe lunch was around $17.99 Which was not bad for the price at lunch. We were able to bring my toddler and baby along as well and my toddler was free.
