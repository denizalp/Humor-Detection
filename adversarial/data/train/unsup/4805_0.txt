We spent a few hour's hanging around this casino and having lunch. I have been coming to this casino for a long time over the year's. They really need to renovate it and keep up with all the other newer hotels. \n\nWe did some gambling and I must say this is one of the places we had the most fun. Hubby played craps for a long time and enjoyed losing every dollar. ha ha I sat at a slot machine with my brother in law, of course I lost very quickly, got up and he sat and put some money in. Yep, this is how it works, he put in a $20 bill and hit $250 in five minutes. ha jerk. Good thing he won, my sister had just purchased a $300 purse. So really did he win? \n\nWe enjoyed our lunch at Catina Diablo and walking around the Monte Carlo, many food options to choose from. Just a fun cool place that is always a blast.
