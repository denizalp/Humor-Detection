It might be Jana's BAKERY but I was here for the stuff in the deli case and I wasn't disappointed.\n\nAlexandra's Pierogies. Jana's has them and you don't have to go to Chicago to get them. If all you know about pierogies is Mrs. T's then you should try some of Alexandra's meat or mushroom ready to make at home pierogies. So damn good. I'll tell you how to make them at home if you need to know. It involves lots of bacon and onions and a cast iron skillet.\n\nMany, many types of good cold cuts (gypsy bacon is my favorite) and I was lucky enough to get a loaf of bread on the house to try with my Polish ham- courtesy of the nice woman who rang me up.\n\nIf you are in need of oplatki to celebrate Christmas with, I'll bet they could find you some.
