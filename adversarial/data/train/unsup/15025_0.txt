Decided to give this place a shot since it opened up not too long ago near our place. AND because we wanted to eat AND drink a little alcohol :) \n\nOur first impression of NBG was that the decor was definitely inviting. The wooden walls and table set-up gave it a large yet cozy feel. It was a Monday evening, so the place didn't have many patrons, so we had no problem being seated (a large booth in the back). There were TVs showing the Raptors game, and a full bar featuring a few specialty cocktail items. The menu also had somewhat of a sinful \"church\" theme, which makes sense since I'm guessing \"NBG\" was derived from \"NDG (Notre Dame de Grace)\" which is about as churchy as one can get. The servers were nice and helpful, though they weren't as quick to taking our order as I would have liked. They also forgot to provide basic things like our utensils and napkins and some water. \n\nAnyways, the food. I'm not a gimmicky burger kind of guys so I ordered the \"Disciple\" (double cheeseburger with basic fixins and aoli sauce), and my partner ordered the cheese melt (which had a little bacon and i think mushrooms in it). We also ordered drinks: I had a boring red wine and my partner had the \"Tequila Resurrection\" which was kind of like a Mojito except with tequila and honey as the sweetener. \n\nMy burger was okay but a little disappointing. I didn't taste much aoli at all and overall it felt kind of dry. The patties weren't seasoned and I had to add a little ketchup just for some flavor. The cheese melt my partner ordered, however, was pretty damn good, which was funny cause you'd expect the opposite of a place that specializes in burgers. \n\nAll that said, I wouldn't say it was terrible. I'm glad there's a cozy place where I can grab a drink and a bite and watch a little sports. But I'd probably stay away from the burgers.
