Oh to be in college again. \n\nThis was the place we would go when I was in college, primarily my freshman year when we needed a good laugh. Porn makes teenagers giggle for some reason.\n\nAs I've gotten older I've stopped by here for various, \"adult\" needs (hey, I've got a pulse, don't I) and enjoy the kind of seediness this location offers.\n\nFirst- the entrance is on Smithfield St. not the boulevard of the allies. You've got to walk up these creaky, dirty steps and go through another door to enter the shop.\n\nThe main shop is about as big as most living rooms- not that big, but in the store you'll find various movies, magazines, toys and paraphernalia. You need it? It's probably here. If you don't see it, just ask. The people who work here are friendly and I'm sure they've heard it all.\n\nThey have video booths if you're into that.\n\nWhat's best about this place is the people who come in an out. That's the real prize of this place. You see it all when you're there. \n\nIf I dropped something on the floor here I would probably leave it- that's how grimy it is, but that's what you want when you're buying porn, right? At least I do.
