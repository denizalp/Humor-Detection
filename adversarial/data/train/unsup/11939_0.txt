Horrible Service, ZERO Customer Service skills. The PUNK kid taking my order had a total attitude from the beginning. A buddy with me agreed that he was very rude and unprofessional. Slammed my drink cup down top down on visibly filthy counter and all. That was all I could take from this PUNK! Then I asked for the \"Manager\" which I could tell he wasn't and he was just as rude because he believed the kid working the register that he didn't do anything. Asked for the Corporate number and the \"Manager\" said \"it's right there\" on a sign they had posted. I said I need a bus. card he said \"I don't have one.\nAVOID this Firehouse Subs!!! There's better service and actual CLEAN Restaurants out there!!!
