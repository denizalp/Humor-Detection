Location matters in Vegas. If you plan on partying at XS, Lavo, Tao, Pure, etc, there is no better location for the money in Vegas. Assuming you're not paying Palazzo, Wynn or Caesars prices, this place is a killer value ! \n\nRooms: The decor was AWFUL. The hallways are a serene black, red, and beige palette. You walk into the room and you're accosted with hot pink and purple. EVERYWHERE. The art, the drapes, the bed, the chair.. all neon pink and purple. Honestly I think it's a sad attempt at making sure people don't stay in their rooms and instead gamble.. Who knows. Either way the designers should be shot. The bathroom sucked. It was built in '89 so I can't really fault them for missing the huge bathroom trend, but wow.. it was tiny. Single sink, no robes, itty bitty bathtub. Definitely not a bathroom 2 people can comfortably get ready in at once! Beds are quite important to me and I actually loved the bed. I slept really well and was super comfy. It is the *cushy* bed type, so if you crave a hard bed, look elsewhere. \n\nThe pool was actually really nice. I could almost ignore the strip in the background pretend I was in Hawaii. As a tip - buy the beers at the gift shop right by the pool for $4 and tote them in (or hell, go to Walgreens if you're feeling uber frugal). Make sure to get the Bud bottles that are aluminum, *not* the glass bottles.. you'll stick out! The same bottles go for $7 at the pool. \n\nOverall it's a 3.5 star, but I'm rounding up ! These guys were the first mega-resort in Vegas and I have to give the Mirage props for that. Anytime you can get this place at a significant discount to the luxury properties nearby, it's worth it! This is not a luxury property (imo), but it's great for people looking to spend most nights club hopping and days sitting by the pool. This isn't the kind of place you'd want to lounge around in your room!
