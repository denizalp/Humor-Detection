We're avid thai food consumers (Golden Thai, Mengrai Thai, Bangkok Garden, Real Thailand, + all the thai in the beach). Just tried Thai Grill for the first time and it was great! We ordered the thai cold rolls, malaysian beef curry and the red curry coconut shrimp. Thai cold rolls were mediocre but the two main dishes were amazing. Will definitely be back.
