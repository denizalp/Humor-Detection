Hey folks. I'd like to rate food at this place at five stars but unfortunately service is at most three stars. The reason is when I got my bill for tip options there was 25,20,18% and other $ amount. It's not that fancy place where you can leave such big tips, don't forget this is all you can eat sushi place. Other than that good if very good, fish seems to be fresh, this place is similar to 168 sushi and I assume could be the same owner. Enjoy!
