I recently had extensions put in here. I wanted a drastic change as I had not gotten my hair done in  5 months. It was growing out from a short pixie cut and taking forever to get to my desired length. I scheduled a consultation with Michè. She was very pleasant, listened to what I envisioned, & made her professional suggestions. I came back for my apt. She colored, cut, installed the extensions, AND styled my hair for me! I left feeling gorgeous!!!! I highly recommend Michè, she is not only very talented but very personable. I watched others get their hair done while sitting in the chair, they all left looking amazing!
