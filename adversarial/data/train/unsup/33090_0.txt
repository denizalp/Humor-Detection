Absolutely the worst value for your money.  The menu does NOT reflect what you are actually getting. Ordered a fattoush salad with a beef skewer which the menu shows as two (2) skewers and got the salad (rather small portion) and one (1) skewer.  All this for about $20 for a take out lunch.  Stay away and avoid a bad experience.  If it helps, me va me a better choice (fair distance away) or any other nearby place at the village. Understand new location but not worth it.
