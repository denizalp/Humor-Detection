Reasons why I removed the stars:\n\n1) no water is available ANYWHERE; if you want water it's $4 at the vending machine or $3.75 at various markets that, while inside the hotel, are still 10 mins walk away.\n\n2) no amenities. Forgot your toothbrush toothpaste or anything? Forget about it! They don't even offer water what makes you think you'll get anything else? Go buy that shit elsewhere overpriced.\n\n3) nobody picks up the phone. Each time I dial the front desk it's either a 20+ min wait with the terrible unprofessional pre recording, or I call like 10+ times at various time intervals until I luck our and someone passes by the phone downstairs and cares enough to pick it up.\n\n4) hotel rooms are dirty. The desks are sticky in random spots. \n\n5) beds are extremely uncomfortable. It's so soft that you sink in, sometimes more so on one side. The pillows may as well as be nothing. No support whatsoever.\n\n6) while the bathroom has plenty of counter space, it's old and dingy in the corners. Shower barely has enough pressure to be acceptable. Water tastes a bit weird - some may be super sensitive to that. No fan. WHY IS THERE NO FAN?\n\n7) gym is a joke. And it takes 20 mins+ to find because no signs. Good luck. But I recommend you not even bother. It's not worth the effort.\n\n8) AC sounds like an RV struggling to start every 5 mins. It needs to be replaced. \n\n9) smoking is allowed around the hotel and it's not well ventilated. \n\nFor the love of god stay somewhere else if you can.
