Beautiful restaurant (but you sort of expect that in Vegas) and a pretty decent view of the Bellagio water show from the main room, though partially obstructed by a walkway overpass. Other than the setting and service, I can't say I was very impressed. If it weren't for her name being all over the place I don't think this restaurant would be as successful.\n\nFor apps we went with the charred octopus which was quite tender, some wonderful burrata with balsamic salt, and a salumi plate.\n\nPasta dishes being what Giada is famous for, we decided to order a few of her classics and forgo the entrees as they didn't seem very interesting or appetizing. As she is also known for her dramatic pronunciation of pastas, it was funny to see the pronunciations spelled out on the menu. \n\nAfter much deliberation, we ordered the \"spah-geh-tee,\" the \"ree-ZOHT-oh,\" and the \"tohr-teh-LEE-nee.\" The risotto was hopelessly undercooked and underseasoned with the crab and scallops very sparse. The spaghetti was okay, but this was supposed to be \"the\" dish. The massive prawns that accompanied the pasta weren't very warm but were clearly overcooked. I enjoyed the tortellini with kabocha squash and crispy prosciutto most--maybe because it was drenched in brown butter.\n\nMy wife is a fan of Giada and has a couple of her cookbooks (we even attended a book signing), but from now on we'll stick to making the dishes ourselves. They turn out better that way and are a hell of a lot cheaper.
