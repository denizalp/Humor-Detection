Where to start.....\n\nWell it was my first time here and decided to come during lunch time.  Walked in and it was pretty much empty except for a party of about 8 people towards the back.  We are told to sit anywhere and as we look over the menu we are enlightened by what appears to be promising.  They have pretty decent happy hour drink prices but no lunch specials.  \n\nAny way we order and then the waiting begins......maybe it was an off day but we waited 45 minutes for our food when the place was pretty much empty.   If I only had to rate the service it would DEFINITELY BE ONE star!!! \n\nOnce the food came out things were much better.   Some may say portions are small for prices but I didn't mind as it was just right before over eating.   I ordered the Ginger Chicken Stir Fry and it was delicious.  Perhaps a touch to much ginger, but overall vegetables were excellent and Jasmine rice was perfect.   \n\nI figured I'll give this place one more chance with the service as we all have off days.  On food only I would recommend and going back!
