I have had Presto Calzone Bakery on my Bookmarked Restaurants to try for awhile now. I was excited to find it was only a mile away from my house! It's tucked away and would not have found it otherwise (Thanks Yelp!!), a hidden gem! Upon entering my family and I were greeted very warmly. We were asked if we had ever eaten there before and had everything explained to us. They have 30 flavors of Italian sodas to pick from, homemade desserts and by far the BEST calzones I've ever had! Everything is made from natural ingredients. Time for some individual reviews!\n\nCustomer service 5\/5 They are the very attentive and wanted to make sure we enjoyed our meal. Even waited while we tasted our Italian sodas to make sure we liked them! Top Notch!\n\nCleanliness 5\/5 This place is eat off the table clean. I like the spacious feeling when I walk in. No clutter. Everything is spread out. love it!\n\nItalian Sodas 5\/5 My husband had the Cherry flavor and I had Kiwi. DELICIOUS!!!\n\nCalzones 5\/5 I had a custom calzone made. Provolone\/Mozz\/red sauce\/chicken\/artichoke hearts\/spinach. It was the bomb-diggity!! Soft, non-greasy bread (bread is hand-made in restaurant), all the ingredients were fresh!! My husband and daughter loved theirs as well. Husband had the Pesto chicken and Daughter had the Pepperoni. \n\nChocolate Des Leches- OMG, we ate this before our calzones came (backwards day) and it was perfect!!!! They give you little wooden sporks to eat it with, very nice touch!\n\nTips!!!! \n**We received our Chocolate Des Leches for FREE by checking in on Yelp! \n\n**Also, they give you a cute little stamp card. Every 5 calzones you purchase, you get the 6th free!! \n\n**You can call your order in ahead and pick it up!
