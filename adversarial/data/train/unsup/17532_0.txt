I've somehow transitioned from going to Trader Joes every week to Sprouts... How???? I love TJ! Well lets see...\nSprouts has an abundance of fruits and vegetables. I love having more than two little stands to pick from. I also like their bagged salads, they come in different mixes with dressing and all.\nI like the variety of snacks here too. I can pick from different brands of icecream (many Tolentini gelato flavors), yogurts, loose nuts, chips, and tons more.\nI also like the meat selection, cheaper than TJ and more variety. I also get my fish here, they tend to run weekly specials and you can get a pretty large piece of swordfish for about $6.\nThey have a sandwich stand which is awesome! Delicious sandwiches and paninis. \nOh, there's a salad bar too!\nWell, I think the variety and prices on meat and fruits\/vegetables is what has me skipping my beloved TJ and brings me here.
