My mom and I just walked into this store because we were just curious what they sell. It looked like a cute boutique. We walked in and there was no one in the store and the sales girl walked to the register and did not acknowledge us at all. She did look at me and that is it. So we just walked out and then again not even a good bye. I will never come by this store again, so unwelcoming.
