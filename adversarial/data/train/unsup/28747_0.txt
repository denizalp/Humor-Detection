I've eaten here several times and it was just okay - but when I returned this week with friends, I was really impressed.  The Crab Rangoons, Stirred Tenderloin of Beef w\/ Mushrooms, Shrimp & Scallops w\/ Lemon Butter and Seafood Fried Rice were all outstanding!  The BIG disappointment was the absolutely ridiculous prices on the wine list (extremely limited choices - which is fine).  They wanted $54 for a bottle of wine that tastes lousy and can be purchased at Wal-Mart for $13!   Heck, even on the strip, the standard markup is 100% on bottled wine - but the markup at FU is 400%.  A bottle of Veuve (champagne) that sells for $43 was listed for $150.  Again, ridiculous!  I settled for a mixed  drink that costed $13; it was served in a glass that was so tall and narrow, that after they filled it with ice, I'm guessing I actually got about 3oz of liquid.  Eat here, but just drink water - save your imbibing for the casino (Hard Rock).
