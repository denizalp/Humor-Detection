Living in Southern California, sometimes and somehow and for whatever reason I see television ads for Ruby Tuesday.  The commercials make it look like a high end burger joint and make the food look mmmmmm so good.  But the thing is.....I don't know of a Ruby Tuesday in Southern California!!!!!  arghhhhhh\n\nSo when I ended up in Arizona for my Ironman, we of course walked up and down the strip (Mills Rd) where all the college kids hang out.  We were there for a few days and so we wanted to check some places out...and lo and behold we see a Ruby Tuesday!  Because of the Ironman event the whole town was packed with tourists, families and athletes.  Ruby was not to be outdone and it too was packed.    \n\nOnce inside I realized it's more along the lines of a Chili's, TGIF type of place....ummm yeah....but since it was our first time it was cool.  Ordered a pasta dish which was good...I mean we scarfed our food down.  The strawberry lemonade was good here too.  \n\nI did come here a 2nd time before we left, so I could try their steak.  Ummm yeah it's not a great steak joint haha...I mean its edible and I did eat all of my steak...but its not some fancy place they make it out to be on TV.  :P\n\nService was average....If I was in town...i'd perhaps come in one more time just because we don't have it in California
