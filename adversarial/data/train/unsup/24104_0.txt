This is a Toronto based restaurant... for poutine... with a location in Montreal. I'm trying hard to be polite here. I didn't know this fact until I started this review but it explains a lot and didn't change my view at all. \n\nFirst of all there's just something odd about the taste, the gravy, ehhhh... Secondly and most importantly the fries sucked. I think it's the type of potato they use, not sure. At first I thought the cardboard box was cute, but the novelty soon wore off. Looks like someone took a tight dump in a small box!\n\nI wish them good luck in Red Dear, Regina, and Moncton, but I just don't see a long future for them in Mtl. That rent can't be cheap.  \n\nOther things I don't want from Toronto in a Montreal restaurant:\n-Smoke meat\n-Bagels\n-Steamed hotdogs\n-Subs
