All About Serving just served my evasive ex husband who'd already dodged a different process server I'd served at least 3 times.  Their server was resourceful and clever in catching him and getting the papers served.\n\nNot only did they get the job done for me in less than 24 hours, but they picked up the papers from me within an hour of my inital call, took online payments which speeds up the process (my last process server didn't and the delay sucked, a lot), they were courteous, professional and kept me informed of what was going on with my papers.  \n\nI'm VERY pleased.  I highly recommend them.  :)
