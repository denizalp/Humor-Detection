Noble Tree Service has been pruning our big trees for years.  Their prices are competitive; they arrive on time; they leave the yard cleaner than before they got there; and they are polite and friendly.  With almost no notice they took down a  very large wind damaged Palo Verde on April 15th.  I called them at 9am and the tree was gone by noon!  We wouldn't call anyone else.
