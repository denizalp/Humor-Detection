My boys love laser tagging at this place. Not your normal laser tag experience where you're in a dark room shooting lasers at each other. If you are a Call of Duty fan, and don't mind the lights on in an actual course where you are visible to others, this is the place to go! Get out there and use your tactical real life skills here if you are a true gamer. \n\nThey have paintball and airsoft (that we never tried), but the laser experience is so worth it. Forget Laser Quest and all them other places with the dark lights, get your a** here! \n\nStaff was awesome! My boys had so much fun, they gave my boys the best Friday laser experience ever! Better to be out there than on a console sitting on a couch; and I want to give kudos to the 2 employees that were there.... Sean & Xavier. Game on, GAME ON! You guys rock!!!
