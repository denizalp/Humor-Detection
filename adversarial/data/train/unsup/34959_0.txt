This is a small restaurant but the owner was nice enough to accommodate 19 people. There are no reservations. I felt that the koobideh did not have as much flavor as I had hoped. Their rice was perfect. I expected more from the yogurt drink because it was quite watery. They offer generous portion sizes and give extra tzatiziki sauce for free. Note that you can't substitute rice with fries. Also the restaurant smelled like cigarette smoke so be wary of that.
