Everyone needs a second chance and I'm glad I did it!!!   \nAfter having a terrible experience the first time I decided to see if things have changed and maybe it was a one off.   \nToronto Flower Company aka TFC #wethenorthofflowers!! Great service,  great communication\/notifications for delivery and AMAZING arrangement.   Top notch flowers!!!  IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A FLOWER SHOP THIS IT!!!!   Will definitely continue to business with them.
