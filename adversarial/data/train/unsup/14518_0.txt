I came in with very little time before work this morning I had less than five minutes of a wait. Julius was absolutely incredible and helping me find the best price for my packages. He suggested a flat rate box for one of my packages and already had one folded and ready. He did not hassle me to purchase any tape. He was kind enough to tape and label all of my packages for me. He also stamp them with fragile stamps.  He was very quick in assisting me as well as the person after me at the same time. I got out of there in less than 15 minutes including the time that it took me to repackage my items and write down all of the addresses. He has great time management skills and is very kind to his customers.  Julius gets a well deserved five stars thank you so much!!!  And I'm still on time for work!
