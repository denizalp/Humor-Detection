So I came here last night for a first date and was pleasantly surprised.  We hit up the bar so I could check out all the local art under the glass.  It was a cute touch, I love when restaurants play up the neighborhood's culture.  We got their in time for happy hour, and the Scott informed us it was a dollar off beers.  I know that doesn't seem like much, but any deal works for me.  I forgot the name of the sandwich we got but I know it had turkey, red peppers, and fontina in it.  Really good!  We also got the soup and salad...and I'm going to have to say that the tomato soup is better at the Roosevelt.  Still good, but I don't think you can best the Roosevelt at the classic grilled cheese and tomato soup combo.\nWe eventually came back at the end of our psuedo hipster night and got the Nutella croissant.  I'm pretty sure I was incredibly drunk because I don't like to eat dessert on the first date.  Want the boys to think I eat normally, instead of like the fat chick that resides inside of me.  The one who believes that desserts are for everyone and then one communal dessert (which goes to me).  But hey, drinking makes you lose your inhibitions, so I was game.  I'm happy I did, the croissant was light and flaky.  And who doesn't love Nutella?  I don't eat it plain with a spoon like some people, so I guess I don't have as much love.\nCool place, I'll definitely be back.  Probably just so I can listen to the music.  I swear they were playing my iPod, with all the acoustic Metric, The Bravery, and The Thermals.  I love you for that alone!
