What better place for a wolf pack of five guys than to eat steak where the Rat Pack dined?!?\n\nSure, it wasn't on the strip nor it didn't have any flashy decor; rather, it was dark, walls plastered with pics of famous actors and actresses from the heydays of LV, oozing with rich history. If only the walls could talk ...\n\nAs for the food, the quality of meat they prided themselves on wasn't just fluff; the 22oz Ribeye with bone in was very juicy and flavorful. The medium rare steak cut with ease, and the amount of plump fat was just right.\n\nLike other $$$ steak houses, my heavenly creamed spinach was a la carte. Ate it all up.\n\nI'll have to come back again to see how consistent they are. Until then, fly me to the moon ...
