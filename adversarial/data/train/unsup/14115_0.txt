I would give this place ZERO stars if it allowed me to. I went to Duffy's back in January. My friend and I planned a dinner party for a friend and I wanted to add the extra touch of center pieces to the table. I wanted to make these center pieces myself - I was there for supplies. This very nice woman was helping me pick out the flowers, greens, and correct glassware to use. I wanted squares opposed to vases. I wanted light pink roses with some sort of small muted flower and greens. Nothing too outlandish and she was trying to get it all in order for me she let me know she was not into floral arranging so she would ask the \"master\". Or whatever. Sure. \n\nThis so called \"master\" was AWFUL. She came over completely discredited her co-worker who was doing a fine job helping me. Put my squares back, told me my flowers would not look good. She told me I did not have proper training to assemble anything that would look remotely good and suggested I buy something she had already put together from their case. She offered me some wild flower looking things in baskets. I told her that's not what I wanted. She then told me I should get orange-ish pink-ish color tulips I again told her that is not what I wanted. If she would have listened to me or her co-worker she would have known that. After she continued on her condescending tirade - I interrupted her to tell her she was \"very rude and condescending.\" and informed her I would be taking my business elsewhere. I will NEVER go back. \n\nI went to Heinen's in Bainbridge bought 70 dollars worth of flowers and made GORGEOUS center pieces despite my \"lack of training\" in flower assembly.
