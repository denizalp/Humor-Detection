This is a new restaurant in a modest looking strip mall, sharing a common with a Chinese restaurant that has been here forever.\n\nThat's where the similarities end. \n\nSura has a clean decor with big white wooden planks adorning most walls and a big chalkboard along one wall. A green, faux grass carpet in front of the counter is really the only significant splash of colour. It's trendy in an \"I watch HGTV religiously\" sort of way. \n\nThe food is good, but it's the little touches that distinguish Sura. From the complimentary Korean-style congee served in small little cups to the Yakult-style dessert drink as you pay your bill. Even the usual Korean appetizers were presented slightly nicer than usual. Missing: the ice. They ran out that day. Opening week, so let's give them a mulligan on that. \n\nThe staff is very attentive. Though, in fairness, the space is so small that you have to work really hard to ignore someone. That said, dozens of Chinese restaurants along Hwy 7 manage to do so on a regular basis, so it's nice to have someone offering to refill your tea several times in a meal. \n\nThe small floor space also means that the restaurant fills up quickly. We came at 5:30 on a Saturday and Sura was empty. By 6 they had filled up. \n\nThe food is good and the prices are comparable to other Korean restaurants. Portion sizes seem smaller. \"Non-spicy\" should be understood to mean \"a little spicy\". Odd menu quirk - pricing is the same regardless of the protein. So the pan fried udon costs the same whether you go with chicken, vegetables or seafood.
