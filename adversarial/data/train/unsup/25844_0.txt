A few weeks ago, I dined at Chica with my best friend and her coworker. We went based on the great reviews on Yelp. The service was good. It was unpretentious and our waitress was very nice. Maybe we ordered the wrong things? We weren't starving and trying to eat a bit more healthy before going out that night so we got guacamole to share (which was good with the different types of chips they served with it) and salads as our main. My best friend and I got the chicken Caesar salad as it's really hard to mess that up and we just wanted something quick. My best friend's coworker got the kale salad with steak. We also got octopus per the server's suggestion. The octopus and guacamole were pretty good. The octopus was a very small portion to share for 3 people. It was perfectly charred and the flavors were good, though a bit salty. The guacamole was fresh and like I mentioned above, the variety of chips was a nice touch. The salads however, were TERRIBLE. My chicken was so dry and so was my best friends' chicken. Her coworkers' steak was so tough and the salad itself was disgusting (I hate to use this word but it was really not good at all). Maybe we shouldn't have gotten salads, but honestly, it's hard to mess up a salad but they somehow found a way to. They noticed we didn't finish the salads and asked if they wanted us to \"remake it\" but why would we want you to remake something that is clearly not good, 30 minutes into us receiving the food? They didn't offer any discounts on our food and drinks (we did order cocktails as well). We weren't looking for a discount anyways, but the offer to re-do our food was nice but too late. It was pricey for what it was, and i'm one to spend on food and not look at the price too much as long as it tastes delicious. Definitely won't be back as Vegas has plenty of great options and is a culinary paradise. The food was just meh and the two words come to mind when I think of my meal at Chica: SALTY and TOUGH.
