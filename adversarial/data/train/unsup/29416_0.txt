I stopped going here about two years ago\nbecause of the incompetent pharmacy and their staff. \nI came back because they advertised typhoid immunizations online. I requested it online and made an appointment.\nI got here and they said they don't do typhoid immunizations here. She said I should\ngo somewhere else...so I did. She was nice enough, but this was extremely inconvenient. They should have at least gave a free candy bar or something!
