I was very satisfied with A1 and their tech, Ryan.  I was very impressed by the professionalism, respect and courtesy that was shown by Ryan on behalf of A1 Garage Door Repair.  I received a courtesy call to advise when he'd arrive, reviewed and explained quite a bit about our garage door and also some potential issues.  We didn't realize our door was custom and an odd size and when comparing the suggested repairs to a collapsed custom door, well we went ahead and had the recommended items replaced.  I felt the price was fair and he worked smoothly and efficiently and afterwards, was able to show us the differences and how it will extend the life of our garage.  The parts are backed by a 10 year warranty and 30 days on labor.  I would 100% recommend this company and Ryan!  Bonnie A.
