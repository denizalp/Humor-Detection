Pancake Fail\nI have been here a few times and have always looked forward to eating here. I have recommended Ncounter to out of towners and friends. However, based on my most recent experience I will have to recommend a new place in Phoenix & Tempe.\nI placed an order to go for 3 separate breakfast\/lunch items. 2 of the orders were quite disappointing. \nThe egg omelette request was for egg whites well that was ignored. I understand that mix-up.\nNow the pancake order was a JOKE. All 3 pancakes were ridiculously burned and were promptly thrown out. I have included a picture of the pancakes. Honestly the person who allowed this order should probably be looking for a new job. I am not sure if QUALITY is a top concern any longer. \nI left a message for the manager and I hope to get a call soon.
