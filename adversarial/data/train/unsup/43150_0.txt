The best meal I ever had! It was worth every penny (the tasting menu starts at 50 bucs a person). The quality of fish paired with the different flavors was amazing. I also loved the ceramic grill that you can cook your own meat on. Truly a unique experience. I recommend anyone who wants a high quality dining experience
