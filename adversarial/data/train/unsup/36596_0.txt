Good place to play volleyball in the morning while the sun is up but when the night comes in  the lights are really dim and they dont have much lights that will lit the court. The basketball court also have dim lights. Theres also houses nearby. At first it was funny qhen all you hear are karaokes blazing in then it geta a bit annoying. \n\nTherea alot of shades around but the lights are just nowhere to be found. \n\nMore lights and would be good.
