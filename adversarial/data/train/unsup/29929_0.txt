I felt this was some of the best pizza I ever had. I'm not an authority on pizza but I would highly recommend east side pizza. The groupon helped.. 14 for a large pepperoni and 2 beers. Had plenty to eat for lunch the next day. Wife tried tried the spaghetti and neither of us would recommend that. Still delivering 5 stars because it's not east side spag, it's east side pizza.
