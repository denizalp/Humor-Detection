Wonderful surprise.  This reminds me of the Chinese restaurants in the Bay Area that served authentic Chinese food. \nFlavors were wonderful and each dish had unique flavors, so good it tempted you to keep eating.\n\nOne of the best places in the Phoenix area for authentic Chinese food IMO.\n\nDefinitely coming back again.\n\nSubmitting 3 pictures but also had the beef pies (beat flavor!) and won ton soup that had a great broth.
