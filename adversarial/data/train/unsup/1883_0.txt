I love this shop. Everyone is helpful, the teas are delicious, and the yarns are gorgeous (if expensive.) They have a great assortment of circular and double pointed needles, but not much in straight needles. They also offer classes, or you can book a one on one appointment if you're just stuck on a project. I'm a beginner, and Elise taught me to purl!
