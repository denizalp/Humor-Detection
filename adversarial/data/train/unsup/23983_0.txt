I came in and picked up a large pan pizza with pepperoni. The cookie dough tempted me so I added on some of that and some thick cheesy bread. The girl at the register also made my pizza and she made it fresh in front of me and asked me if it looked alright which I did. My wife baked the pizza, cheesy bread, and chocolate chip cookies and it all came out good. The pan pizza was nice and thick but the bottom got a little black from the oil or butter under the pizza. If you bake the pan pizza make sure and check it after 10  minutes. The thicker cheesy bread they now have is something my wife said she could just eat as a meal by themselves. The cheesy bead was a big hit.
