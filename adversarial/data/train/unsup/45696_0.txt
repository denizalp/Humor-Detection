Atmosphere: 4\/5\nService: 3\/5\nOverall experience: 3\/5\n\n(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)\n\nBALLING! My first visit to Rush was for after dinner cocktails and dessert. After walking two blocks down Stephen Ave and coming back around, I decided to give Rush a try after hearing rave reviews. Most of all, the decor attracted me. It was a quiet Tuesday evening so my friend and I just walked in and grabbed seats at the bar. Rush is very swank and oozed sophistication with big chandeliers, suede-like seats, a beautiful round bar, and a wine cellar that had me at awe. I wasn't too fond of the colour scheme of dark hardwood floors\/walls with giant teal U-shaped couches in the dining area.\n\nIf you are a Scotch lover, they have a fine list of Scotches - at least a page worth; and some interesting cocktails. However, at about $12 a cocktail (2oz) I don't think it was worth it. Forgive me for getting the names wrong and ingredients but my friend had a Mystique cocktail (frangelico, baileys, grand marnier, espresso vodka), which tasted like watered down coffee. I had the last cocktail on the menu.... I think it was called the Pomtini (prosecco, some kind of pomegranate liquor, cucumbers, and honey). Sounds like an odd combo with the cucumber, but it was refreshing and a fantastic drink if you plan on having a heavy meal. The flavors were well balanced and the taste of the cucumbers paired perfectly with the pomegranate.\n\nDesserts are $10, which is pretty steep compared to some other places. I didn't find anything too unique (cheese, creme brulee, chocolate mousse, and an apple pie dessert). I tried their Smores dessert, which is a deconstruction of the childhood treat. Verdict...It  tasted nothing like an actual smore. It came with the tiniest portion of hazelnut icecream imaginable (like a tiny melon scoop) with a light dusting of candied-like graham crackers. The dessert itself is no more than the size of a deck of cards (which is a decent single portion). There was a thin layer of flourless chocolate cake on the bottom; a heaping square of marshmallow (made up 90% of the dessert) that was toasted perfectly to give a campfire taste; and a thin wafer of crunchy caramel-like topping with hazelnut chocolate. The dessert wasn't overly sweet, but the flavors were imbalanced and was messy\/hard to eat. Just not worth $10. \n\nThe service wasn't terrible but wasn't fantastic either. The bartender just took our order and ignored us the rest of the time. A little engagement doesn't hurt!\n\nI can't say much about the rest of the restaurant\/menu, but in terms of going for drinks it's really expensive. But heck... I guess you are going for the ambiance. I may come back if I decide to splurge (at least $30+ for a dinner main); saw a few items that teased my taste buds. However, if you're looking to go on a budget I say skip this place!
