What is done well is very good indeed. Any of the breads are excellent The little French rolls are so good I eat one dry with a cup of coffee passing over a croissant or sweet roll. All of the cookies are habit forming. \n\nSo why the meager three stars? First, the scones and croissants are sugar coated ruining texture and taste. Second, the eating area looks like it was designed for the Poor Clare Franciscan Sisters. Third, the outdoors eating area consists of a couple of picnic tables placed in a sparse cement parking lot making it an even more punishing setting than the inside.
