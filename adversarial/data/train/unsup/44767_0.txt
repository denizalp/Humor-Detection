Horrible service. I am an avid runner (50+ miles a week) and went to get a pair of shoes they said they had when I called.  When I got to the store they \"must've sold them before you got here\". They convinced me to buy a different pair because \"if you run in them and don't like them you can bring them back for a refund for 45 days.  I specifically asked \"I can get my money back? Not store credit right\" I was assured there would be no issues.  The shoes didn't work out.  Tried to return them with 4 treadmill miles on them and guess what, I couldn't return them because they had been worn..... The associate that sold me the shoes admitted to the manager that yes, he told me I could get a cash refund! The manager was less than helpful, put them back in the bag and said if I didn't want store credit to just keep the shoes and have a nice day.  Shame on you finish line.  I buy a new pair every 8 weeks.  You sold me this pair, but will never sell me another one.
