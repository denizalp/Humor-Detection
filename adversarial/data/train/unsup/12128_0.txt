I finally made it to the Tory Burch store here at the LV premium outlet - North.  \n\nA lot of stores in Las Vegas tends to greet you once you enter their store.  I was not greeted and no one offered if I needed any help.  The store was small and there were like 5 people working there.  I was looking at their shoe collection and it took me 15 minutes to find someone to help me get my size.  Seriously, 15 minutes inside a small store. Every single time I go to a person they would always say, \"Be right with you, hold on, or I'll tell someone to help you.\" After that they didnt even bother to tell me if they had the size or not, they just put the shoe away.  I had to look for the person and asked them if they had the size or not and all they said, \"What type of shoe were you looking at again?\" \n\nOMG, I just gave up there. I was like NVM and left the store.  No customer service at all such as disappointment. \n\nBut other than that, they have handbags, shoes, sunglasses, tops, belts, flip-flops, coats, and accessories that you can find in the store.
