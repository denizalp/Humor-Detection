The male scans over the females on the dancefloor looking for his perfect mate.\r\n\r\nHis eyes lock onto his target.  He approaches his potential mate cautiously.  Casually, he walks toward her general area and begins his mating dance.  He dangles his lanky arms and legs, writhing to a rhythm found not in the top 40 hits being played, but only in his head....and in his heart.  He draws nearer but makes no move to communicate verbally to his love.  He is certain that she (as his true love) can SENSE and FEEL the MUTUAL connection they have.\r\n\r\nThe window of opportunity is open and the male jumps through it!  He grabs the female around the waist, pulling her closer to him.  He wants to show her how \"manly\" he truly is.  But wait! What's this?!  She pulls away from him, gives him a nasty look and stomps away to the protection of the other females.  Dejected, the male slinks away into the dark shadows from which he came.\r\n\r\nThe male scans over the females on the dancefloor, looking for his *next* perfect mate.\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nYeah, I got to see that scene replayed god knows how many times at RumJungle.  Seriously, it's like those nature documentaries that I like to watch with my pops on the Discovery Channel.\r\n\r\n2 stars for providing me with amusement.
