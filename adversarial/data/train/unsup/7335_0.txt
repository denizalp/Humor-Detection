I went here with my friend who so happens to work here. She knew the menu and knew what was good and since we were there for happy hour, she knew exactly what to order. I've never been so full in my entire life. Everything here is amazing, I think the place is a little pricey (she hooked it up so I can't complain) but its sooooo good.  We had amazing sliders, sweet corn tempura, and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember because I'm pretty sure I went into a food coma. We literally ordered everything off the Happy Hour menu so everything is a hit on there. The place is fancy and the servers are trained to treat you like royalty. I definitely recommend.
