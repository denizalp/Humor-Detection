I was in here over 10 years ago to see the Lance Burton show (super cool beans magic show by the way), and haven't been back until this past Saturday.  A good friend of mine's was having his wedding there so off we went.  We arrived a few hours early and after getting some grub at the Cafe we did a bit of damage in the casino.  Actually, my mom-in-law did the damage.  As for me, the casino damaged me.  Doh!  The rooms were decent enough.  We all ended up in one of them to take a few shots a down zillions of Chicken McNuggets after the wedding.  Oh, and the Mickey D's there had McRibs!  Scarfed me down a couple of those bad boys too.  =)
