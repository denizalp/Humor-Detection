I really wanted to love this new taco bar since there aren't too many kick-ass Mexican\/Taco places in the city, imo, especially in the east end.  Sadly, this definitely does not hit the mark.  \n\nI'd give the food 3.5 stars, but the service was truly atrocious.  I can't give it more than 1 star, which leaves us at a 2 star average.  \n\nWe had the chicken taco and veggie taco and the jicama salad.  All seemed fresh and tasty, especially the veggie tacos.  Portions left us wanting more, meaning the food was tasty, but the portions small. \n\nSadly, the service was literally the most awkward experience I've had in a long time.  For starters, the server\/nobody greeted us when we came into the restaurant.  Apparently it's seat-yourself, but there is no sign to tell you.  We thought we were the only ones confused, but then observed everyone coming in waiting to be seated only to have the server ignore each new patron for an odd period of time.  She was super patronizing in her responses to our question and made us feel dumb, which was extremely infuriating.  \n\nI think Toucan Taco needs to replace\/train their service staff, get a sign saying seat yourself (being casual does not imply seat yourself), and expand portion sizes.  Without these fixes, this resto does nothing for our neighbourhood.  \n\nEric
