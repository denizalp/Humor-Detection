\"Sirens of T.I.\" worked in that I heard music and was led to my death.\n\nIt's quite literally the dumbest thing I've ever seen. This is typical, tacky Las Vegas humor and performance. Some guy in the audience was actually laughing at all the \"jokes.\" Sad... Whoever received payment for writing those songs is laughing his ass off on a beach somewhere. The best part of the show was when a palm tree caught fire and their hose was too short to put it out. Now, I'd stand in a crowd to watch that... \n\nDidn't stay in the hotel, but have been around the place a lot. They should capitalize on the Pirates of the Caribbean craze and up the ante. The ambience is lacking. I heard the buffet is good and wouldn't mind trying it.\n\nI gave 3 stars because the hotel is still pretty cool. Sirens gets negative quintillion points for being lamer than rubber poop.
