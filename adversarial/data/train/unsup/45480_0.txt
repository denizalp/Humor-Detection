I've eaten at this location since 1997\/98, so I know what I'm talking about. First, the place is under new management and the renovations are awesome. My first visit for lunch since the changes was great. Unfortunately, I thought dinner would be the same and it was borderline terrible. My falafel was cold and one side was a cheaper substitute for the tabouleh that I'm accustomed to having. Other patrons complained that their food was cold as well (which had to be reheated). My appetizer came near the end of dinner, the baklava was ridiculously small and the pitas I purchased were completely molded 3 days later. I've been a loyal customer for more than 10 years. It will be a long, long time before I ever go back and I won't recommend my friends eating here until I see improvement.
