The hotel has a good location not too far from the airport and with many restaurants and retail shopping a very short drive. You're not walking to those, but the hotel does have a shuttle service that can be convinced to take you to other than the airport.\n\nI did have an upgraded room on a high floor but the room left me thinking that it might not have gotten a complete renovation. It's the little things that let them down. Nothing big. The shower did not have a handrail. There was a small gap in the wall where the faucet cover didn't completely fit. One of the electrical sockets wasn't set completely right. I wasn't able to get the heater to blow any warm air at all.\n\nThe few people that I interacted with was the usual high quality Marriott employee. Front desk check-in was great and the room was very tidy and clean. Comfortable bed and plenty of pillows. Plenty of power outlets and the wifi worked well. Bathroom was very nice, other than the above shower concerns.
