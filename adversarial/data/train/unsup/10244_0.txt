My kid loves coming here and I see why. She gets to meet new people, do all sorts of activities like coloring, playing on tablets, basketball, they have a dress up area, they get served food and drinks. I like it for the ladies who work here. They are very friendly and loving on my kid which I like to see and at $10\/hr, that is very reasonable for a single mom like myself so I can have a bit of free time.  This facility is very clean. If you ever need some \"me\" time and don't have babysitters on hand, this is a great option to have in your back pocket.
