What a find! A friend of ours who works in an upscale restaurant in TO told us about Diana's. While more expensive than our favourite fish monger, Bill's Lobster http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/bills-lobster-fish-market-toronto#hrid:vEmrcX8SQEvF-hkenb-5Dw, Diana's real attraction is the oysters. Besides having an extensive selection, they also have what I lovingly refer to as the \"scratch and dent\" oysters, which are not pretty enough to serve in a restaurant, But just fine to shuck at home. They come in at the ridiculously affordable $13 or so for over 2 dozen. (look for them in a box in the refrigerator)  \n\nMinus a star for the wide variety of UN-sustainable seafood, and the fact that they do not have regions labelled. I am always having to ask where a product is from, and I have heard other people doing so as well. I won't buy Tilapia from China, ok? Save some hassle and say if it is farmed, and where on the tag. \n\nPlenty of Japanese, Turkish products, many dips, marinades, sauces, even saffron. Fresh crab meat in a tub - not in a tin for anyone making crab cakes. (anyone see that episode of Come Dine with me Canada?)\n\nLove that you can buy a whole fish and have them clean and filet it for you.
