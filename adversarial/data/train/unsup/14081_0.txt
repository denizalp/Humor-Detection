Member here for 10 years total--  I love clean! I love being able to walk away from noisy kids and go into another pool since i am a swimmer I like choices. Cool people -- members keep to themselves dont try to interfere with your workout with chit chat  I LOVE THIS !! We are busy working out no talking needed ! Great classes!  Great equipment and you can use other clubs too with their membership win win \nBut umm yeah don't join K? It is hard enough to find parking as it is !\n\nI went astray for a bit I will admit tried the Princeton Club to see what I was missing out on all the hoopla. What I found was old band aides that did not seem to move for days left around the pool and inches of standing water where you are supposed to wring out your suit NASTY !!\n\nI found my way back and like the Prodigal son who returns home after making mistakes I am back and I am happy!!
