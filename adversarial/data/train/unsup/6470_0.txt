This bakery also has a Tast D-lite yogurt in it and they both function together. I was craving a couple cookies so I tried a traditional chocolate chip cookie and a PB sandwich cookie. \n\nRight away I was disappointed by the unfriendly service I experienced there. They weren't helpful and seemed like they wanted to get us out of there. \n\nThe chocolate chip cookie wasn't good, it was more fluffy than anything, so I was more hopeful for the PB sandwich cookie. It was two PB cookies with PB creme sandwiched in between. I am a huge PB fan and I thought that the creme on the inside, was waxy and too sweet for my liking. \n\nI didn't finish any of these cookies, I didn't think it was worth the cheat!
