If you neglected to read the Yelp reviews BEFORE you bought tickets, and are sitting in your seats reading this before the show starts, STOP. This is what I did, so learn from my mistake.  If you read all the negative (and in my opinion, accurate) reviews, it will taint your view of the show. I wish I'd watched it not knowing it was going to be bad. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more.\n\nBut sadly, most of these reviews are pretty spot-on. \n- There is nothing \"Cirque du Soleil\" about this show. Maybe the costumes are from Cirque? who knows. It is misleading in a BIG way. This is absolutely nothing like any of the other Cirque shows I've seen, and I've seen most of them, and the touring shows. \n- Criss thinks pretty highly of himself. Did not like the overt ask for donations to some charity that he donates to. \n- Very very little \"magic\". He disappears and reappears, and my son pointed out all the trapdoors in the stage floor. That's pretty much all the magic there is, save for making some doves appear out of his cloak once.\n- Lots of toilet humor. Not that I'm above that, but that was the only kind of jokes told and it got old fast.\n- What's with picking on the autistic teenager from the audience? I kept trying to figure out if it was a plant or not. If not, he was just mean to the boy. If it was a plant, then it's not really that funny to ridicule those with disabilities. \n\nIf you haven't already bought your tickets, then save your money and see something else. If you already have tickets, well, try to forget this review and the others, and maybe you'll find something enjoyable.
