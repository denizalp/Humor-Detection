Super disappointed by this place. \n\nThis neighborhood needs a few good new restaurants... I was hoping that this place would be our ray of light. And the we tried it...... ray of light... blown out with the quickness. \n\nService was bad, bad, bad. \n\nFood was not very good. Got 12 chargrilled oysters and they were so small. Yes I get it.. you are thinking \"why the hell would this guy order oysters at such an interesting place like this?\".. good freaking question. I also got a po-boy... hahaha such a bummer. \n\nStiff drinks though.. when we finally got them.  Only reason I gave it 2 stars. \n\n'And another one bites the dust'
