I just can't get as excited about Cold Stone as some of my friends.  When it first came out, everyone was all atwitter and so I felt I should be too.  I mean, it's ice cream and you get to pick all the stuff you want in it!  In essence, you're making it, so if it sucks, you have no one to blame but yourself.  But I don't blame myself, I blame sucky toppings.  I know for a fact that vanilla ice cream with brownies, pecans, caramel and fudge can be the most delicious thing ever; so when they're put together here (or at any Cold Stone location) and they suck, I don't blame the combo, I blame the quality.\nAlso, please help me understand this if you could: on the menu it says \"signature creations\" and lists prices for all sizes, including kids.  Yet when I tried to order a kids size, I was told the smallest they could make it was \"like it.\"  First of all, no, I don't like it, second, why is it listed on the menu if it's impossible?  Am I too old to order the kids size?  If so, what the hell?  I should've said thanks but no thanks, but instead (because I could smell the waffle cones while I was eating my good for me salad across the way at 1130), I forged ahead with the \"like it\" size, took five bites and threw it away.  That's a dollar a bite for mediocre ice cream.  And don't even get me started on the empty calories I blew through.\nNever again Cold Stone.
