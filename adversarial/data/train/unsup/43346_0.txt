Have been going to Noodles ranch for years - essentially since they opened. I do take out a majority of the time. Andre (the owner) is extremely friendly and always remembers me\/us when we return, even if it has been months. This is truly my favorite Pho Tai have have eaten. Have tried many many places. Mostly in the San Diego area. Their garlic pork vermicelli is also a favorite of mine. Service is excellent but sometimes they get slammed with all tables full. They really do their best with just a couple servers. Don't miss their pho!
