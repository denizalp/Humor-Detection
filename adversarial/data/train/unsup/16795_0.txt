I had never heard of \"The Habit\"...until I noticed one of their outlets on Cactus Road...So much for  them being in existence for 40 years...I had no clue of their very existence...\n\nAnd then another habit popped up, this one closer to my house - so I gave them a chance - funny enough they moved in on the same turf than In & Out at The Promenade where Baja Fresh used to be, right next to Flo's...\n\nThe former Baja Fresh space went under quite some transformation to resemble somewhat of a chic burger joint with lots of wood, comfy side booths etc...to give it a homey feeling...\n\nCutting down to the chase...the food, the staff, the concept: The menu offers everything from their specialty charburgers to salads, sandwiches and shakes and malts...The staff was very friendly and helpful...After realizing that I had misordered my burger as I wanted mine wrapped in lettuce, I was told \"No problem, where are you sitting ? and we'll bring it to you..\"...Wowzers...!...it was scrumptious...\n\nAnd as much as  I enjoy In and Out, I must say that Habit's take on my lettuce burger is just downright wonderful...the meat patties and the lettuce cups are bigger and everything just seems even fresher...
