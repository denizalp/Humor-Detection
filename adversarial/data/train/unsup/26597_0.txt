I've heard a lot about the Village Seafood Buffet and finally got the try it for the first time this past weekend.\n\nI was not disappointed.  For all those seafood lovers out there, this is THE buffet to put on your list to try.  The price per person is $38.  They have all kinds of seafood at their \"raw\" section: salmon and tuna sashimi, sushi, king crab legs, raw oysters, raw clams.  They were all very fresh and being from SF, I know what fresh seafood tastes like and this place was close enough because it had to be frozen shipped from other places.  It is hard to find this large of a selection of seafood at other buffets on the strip.\n\nSo why was this buffet not 5 stars??  Other than the seafood, the other selection was not as good. The meats and other stuff were mediocre and the dessert station had a lot of variety (such as the cool spinning gelato selector) but lacked something.\n\nIf you are seafood lover, give the Village Seafood Buffet a try.
