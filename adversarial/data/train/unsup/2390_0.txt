I knew I shouldn't get sushi in the desert but I was really craving it and my friend told me there was good sushi in Scottsdale.\n\nWell this isn't it.\n\nI spent $40 on takeout sushi that would cost me $15 in (Washington) DC in a high end grocery. Maybe $25 in a restaurant.  Just to be clear - DC is not a cheap place, and sushi is not cheap food in DC. \n\nDelux sushi tasted like grocery store sushi too.  Like crappy grocery store sushi. The crab meat was tasteless imitation crabmeat, the avocado was hard and unripe, the rice was stale, a lot of the fish was rubbery.. the spicy tuna was tasteless and not spicy.. etc. I could go on and on.\n\nFinally the rolls were small.\nSorry guys, but small rolls + crappy fish + stale rice + $$$$ is not a great formula for sushi.\n\nI could understand either:\n - big rolls + crappy food + $$$$ \nor\n- small rolls + decent food + $$$$\n\nbut not small rolls + crap + $$$$\n\n(FWIW I ordered the rainbow roll and the tiger roll, as well as seaweed salad.)
