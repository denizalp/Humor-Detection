Wow this place is so so good and the ambience is just beautiful.  I tried the mixed grill and I was so glad I did.  The lamb chop was perfect. The chicken moist and juicy.  The steak was perfection.  Our waiter gave the best service ever.  We were there for a bachelorette party so we were having a lot of fun talking to him and he was a good sport about it too!  The owner came by and brought us some baklava on the house which was super sweet of them!  Highly recommend this delicious place.
