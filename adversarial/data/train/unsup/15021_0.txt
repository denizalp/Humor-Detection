I love all Brixx locations however this one is ESPECIALLY cool because it was recently remodeled and now has a gorgeous partial patio cover.  The best thing about this location is sitting on the patio watching all of the drivers try to drive the wrong way down one-way Scott Ave.  Sigh.....half price bottles of wine and much giggling later, it is a great way to spend a Sunday evening.\n\nThe service at this location has always been attentive and extra sweet.  This is the first Brixx I ever came to in Charlotte and fell IN LOVE with the Mexican pizza.  No Amstel or Heineken here but I love you anyways Brixx!
