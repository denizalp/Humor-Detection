I agree with those who have mentioned the huge costs associated with this \"program\". It's a $1,500 hit...up front...plus the cost of food and assorted vitamins that they insist you buy. $400-$500 per month. Their commercials never mention the cost so consider yourself warned. Will not argue that the program works, but once you leave and try to \"rejoin,\" you're suddenly a brand new customer and must pony up another $1,500 new member fee.
