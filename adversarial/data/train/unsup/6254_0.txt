I've been dancing all morning long...my feet hurt.  I have the AIDS Walk the next day and I'm thinking a nice foot massage might do the trick.  \n\nThe BF and I are in search of a place that offers foot massages without the hidden extra perks of such establishments that have neon signs and are open 24 hours.\n\nFrom the street, I see a sign advertising \"Foot Massage and Reflexology.\"    We drive up to the establishment and I am concerned with the tinted windows.  (Is there a doorbell we have to ring to get buzzed in?  No.)  As we enter the doors, we see the prices for foot massage and reflexology treatments.  \n\nBasic Foot Spa and Massage: $35 for 30 minutes\nFoot spa, massage and reflexology: $50 for 60 minutes\nArms, ears, neck, shoulders, foot spa, massage, and reflexology: $70 for 90 minutes\n\nThey also offer memberships which ultimately means purchasing your massages in bulk.  \n\nWe both opt for the 30 minute massage and foot bath.  We're brought into the first room that has about four reclining seats.  Within the dimly lit room, there's a TV in the corner.  Mini bottles of water are handed to us as we take a seat and remove our shoes and socks.  Two ladies come in with a foot tub filled with our herbal foot bath.  Our feet soak in this hot bath for a few minutes.  They are then dried and the massage begins.  We're both tired and could easily fall asleep as our calves and feet are pressed and massaged with 'a special herbal balm'.  After the massage ends, our feet and calves are wiped down with a hot towel and our socks and shoes are put back on.  The half an hour ended too quickly.  \n\nOverall, May Sky does exactly what it advertises...foot massages.  I don't think we really got any 'reflexology' work done since we didn't get the longer treatment.  Nothing fancy about this place, but it serves its purpose.\n \nOpen daily from 11 am to 2 am.\n\nSide note: They offer a $5 off 1 hour visits with the brochure coupon you can pick up in the store.  You can even arrange to have them come to your hotel and pick up your group!
