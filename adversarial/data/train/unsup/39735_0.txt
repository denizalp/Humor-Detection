Quality food and excellent selection, but unfortunately every order comes with a free dose of attitude. Arrghh! Who likes attitude when you're paying premium prices for everything you buy. There's a culture of arrogance that's not pleasant, and it extends to everyone I've dealt with at this place, every time I've been there. Usually that starts at the top. It's a shame because they are close by and their offering is unique and tasty. But they are off my shopping list until I read of a significant improvement in the way they treat their customers.
