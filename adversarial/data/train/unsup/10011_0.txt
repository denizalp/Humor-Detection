My husband recently had a colonoscopy here (lucky guy!) and everyone was super nice, that procedure was on time and went as planned. \n\nIn terms of visual aesthetics, St. Joseph's is a pretty blech hospital. Everything feels dated and a bit dirty. I'm sure it's technically sterile, but it's just not great. I was spoiled last year giving birth at Mt. Sinai, so I think my hospital expectations are just sky high now. \n\nBonus points for the gift shop has flowers, balloons and stuffed toys for embarrassing loved ones.
