The other day my coworkers and I decided to go to Canyon Cafe.  Also this restaurant used to be called Sam's Cafe.    They changed names back in February.  \n\nSo, we got our drinks and we order the Queso dip to start our meal off and then we ordered our food.   Then the Queso dip came out.  It was really good, but it was also a little runny.  \n\nNow for our food, when they were handing us the food.  The lady was passing the fajitas across me to my coworker and the juice from the fajitas spilled all over me and my meal.  Luckily I had my napkin in my lap, but it still got on my jeans.  You would think that a manager would come over and apologize for what happen or at least comp my food.  Instead they told me that they would pay for my dry cleaning bill, if I wanted to get my jeans dry cleaned.    \n\nOther than the spill the meal was great. I ordered the basin Meatloaf. I totally recommend the meatloaf.  It was one the best meatloaf I have had in a long time.  Last but not least our waiter was really nice and did a great job taking care of us.
