This is my second time at this location, its located off of Arville on Blue Diamond, not far from the I15 Blue Diamond exit. It is inside a shopping center tucked into a corner, fairly easy to find. You walk right in and there is colorful wallpaper everywhere, and after you wind through people eating you find the line queue. \n\nIt was semi-busy, it took about 5 minutes to get someone to take my order which I thought was fairly fast considering how many people were online. Very fast assembly line system. I ordered the salad, pinto beans, with shredded chicken, I was through in about 2 minutes and paying for my meal.\n\nMy only negative is that while i was waiting for my meal to be made I asked the server a question and she looked like me like I had a thousand heads, she turned to her colleagues and they had the same reaction, finally someone came by and answered my question. I then realized they didn't speak english. All I asked was which was the spiciest sauce they had and no one can tell until someone save the day.\n\nGreat so I got my food and was told the Cholula and Tapatio were by the drink fountain. Awesome!!! What a wide array of hot sauce all at your disposal!! I filled my cup of water and grabbed me a bottle of Tapatio. I doused my salad with the hot sauce like putting out a fire with water hoping for the opposite effect. And I got exactly what I had hoped for. \n\nOnce you dig through the top of the salad you hit pay dirt, the shredded chicken and it tasted fresh and very savory, had a good flavor. The whole salad sits on a large soft tortilla which you find yourself picking apart at the end, at least I did. Next time I come back I will have to try one of their burritos as they looked really good. Will the burrito match up to Chipotle's or be better? Someone let me know!
