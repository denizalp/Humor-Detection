Fun enough for a nerd bar. Downtown is being revitalized and I do enjoy hanging out at Vanguard on occasion. I'll only come to Insert Coins if some sort of birthday party is going on and I \"have to\" go. The machines here tend to eat quarters, it's very crowded and the air conditioning sucks.\n\nFriends have purchased tables on a couple occasions and every person has left with a bill at least 200% over what they were quoted. So BEWARE of the bottle girls... If you're going to buy bottles, be careful or just spend your $1,000 at the club! At least you'll be surrounded by semi-well dressed men and women and decent music.\n\nDrinks are affordable and they have a decent variety of beer. Be prepared to wait in line. I've heard waits can be as long as 45 minutes to an hour on First Fridays.  \n\nAnd to my underage readers, don't come here on a busy night. They'll find any reason in the book to turn your under 21 butt away and snatch your fake from you. This place is more difficult to get into than XS.
