Counter guy was very nice and helpful with washing machine motor purchase.  Ended up not needing the motor since it turned out to be a different issue with the machine and when I went to return it they told me they couldn't accept it because had been installed.  I kinda understand their reason but they need to find a way to check the motor's integrity whether it has been installed or not.  Perhaps the resistance of the windings?  A burned up motor has a very distinctive smell as well.  If there was something wrong with the motor when I got it, I would only find out once it was installed and didn't work.  With their current return policy in place I would be stuck with a bad motor that I bought from them.  I have used this place several times over the years with very positive results.  I will no longer be a customer as they stuck me with a $167 motor that works and is not needed.  Very disappointed.
