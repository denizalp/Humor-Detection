I think this is one of the most over rated bars in town.\n\nIt smells and looks straight out of the 1970's. I do not find that endearing; just lazy. When I was there a couple of weeks ago we ordered 3 draughts and there was only enough for one of us. The bartender offered to \"mix\" what was left with a different substance to make some sort of drink. I think that should have at least warranted a free beer, but the mix she created actually cost more than the draught alone. My friend's next 2 choices were also out. I just don't get why people pee their pants over this place. Yeah, it is located on a \"fun\" street but it is no fun. I am sort of mad it blocks a better bar from taking the location. Yep. I said it. \n\nTheir stools are off balance; I kept sliding right off the stool. My friend did too.
