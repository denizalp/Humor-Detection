This is a fairly good convention center. It is relatively new looking. It is located right in the middle of downtown near hotels and food options. The food court is large. That being said it is inconvenient if you are on the main floor two levels up. There are some decent options for quick food, but it would be nice if there were at least a couple options near the show floor area.\n\nThere were some food options inside the show area. These bring down the overall score. The line was tragically long and the options were severely limited. The long lines are likely a reflection of the food court being so far away.
