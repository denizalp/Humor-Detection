Great ambiance !!decor at lucky foo's is quite original to any neighborhood restaurant\/bar you'd see off strip. We ordered the charred edamame and Brussels sprouts .. WOW!! That's all I can say.  The sushi came out quick and fresh and the staff was very courteous. To top it all off we had the Funkler for dessert .... ***warning*** if you have anything to do after you eat you probably want to postpone it till the next day because you will want to sleep \n\nOverall everything was great!
