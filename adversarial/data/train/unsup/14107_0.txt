Garbage management company!  They work behind closed doors with the \"declarant\"(developer) to make new rules and budgets. Now that its time to turn over control to the owners, this shady little company is sending out amendments to the CC&Rs so the period of declarant control is basically never-ending. In my opinion, they're probably well aware of how much the owners despise them and are doing whatever they can to not get fired when the board is in our hands.
