The food we ordered was alright, but the service was atrocious. There was a larger party seated after us and from that point on, our server seemed to forget any of us even existed (another couple across from us couldn't get his attention either). Ended up having to track down a manager just to get our check and some carryout containers.\n\nIn addition to that, it's incredibly dark in there, so much so that even reading the menu was hard to pull off without pressing it to your face.\n\nAlso, why are all the female servers seemingly required to wear either backless chaps with their panties completely visible or way too short shorts? Not sure who at corporate made that call, but here's a tip: Let the food be your reason to be there, not some pointless lowbrow nonsense like that.\n\nHonestly, if this was a standalone place outside of a casino, it wouldn't last long with all these issues.
