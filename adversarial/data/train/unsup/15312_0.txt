It's within walking distance for me. It's 20 bucks a month. It's open more hours than the YMCA. There's a lot to like about it right there.\n\nWhat's not to like about it? Typical gym complaints: Too many people for the most popular machines, high-pressure sales tactics for personal training, people acting like inconsiderate douchebags, people walking into you while trying not to make eye contact because you have a BMI beyond what they consider \"human\", hot girls get hit on by guys in sleeveless shirts, girls who think they are hot treating everyone like johns who can't afford them, the locker room smells and there are guys who flaunt their nudity who really, really shouldn't, there aren't enough stations with cleaning fluid and paper towels to keep the machines clean, and the childcare people seem pretty indifferent.\n\nBut you know, it's 20 bucks a month and it's within walking distance and it's closer and open more hours than the YMCA.
