I went there for dinner today for the first time. The food is VERY tasty and just very good. As an appetizer I had \"Anticucho\",grilled beef heart skewers. I did not finish them, because my entree came and it was huge. I had Saltado de Camarones, Shrimp saut√©. It came before my appetizer. As dessert, I had flan. I did not finish my appetizer nor entree. It was simply too much. I know, that I will go back, for sure.
