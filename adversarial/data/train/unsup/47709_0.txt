AMAZING!!  Best show on the strip!!  I didn't realize how many Beatles songs I actually liked until the show.  It was one incredible acrobatic feat after another which is no surprise for Cirque but add the music and the story of Beatles it all came together as the most impressive Cirque show I have ever seen. (\"O\",Mystere,LaNouba,KA) this is a MUST see on the strip.  Make reservations at FIN for pre show dinner- it's pretty good and right outside of the theatre.
