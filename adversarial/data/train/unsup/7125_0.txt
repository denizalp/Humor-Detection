Charming little pubs in charming little character homes is apparently a \"Calgary thing\". No joke - I saw about five while I was there, happily visited two and had the same reaction every single time: An inherent \"Awww!\", followed by a sharp pain of homesickness (and generally, a pint or two).\n\nVancouver just doesn't seem to have the good ol' neighbourhood pub around the corner and this former Newfoundlander had her heart strings tugged a few times on Alberta soil.\n\nMy gosh, I love me a pub.\n\nThis place is pretty dang cute. It's got a pool table upstairs; a good craft beer selection and makes a great pizza. Really... what more do you want? Whimsicality + beer & pizza... it's the perfect combination. Bonus whimsy points for keeping the kitchen door open so you can see that yup, there's an ancient 60's oven in there. It's not being used as an oven... or at least, I would assume not, but it definitely reminds you that, \"Oh hey, you're in a wee house. Continue to be charmed.\"\n\nService is a little lassez faire, which is French for: It's a pub... go up to the damn counter to order. The BBQ chicken pizza is extra delicious with banana peppers added. And if they start carrying a better irish whiskey selection, I would consider moving in. \n\nJust kidding Vancouver, I still love you. Psst, Calgary: *wink wink*
