I licked it so it's mine...Take your clothes off and show me your moves! \n\nNo I'm not being dirty! I'm at The Magic Mike show! What you need to know...\n\nDrinks: There are plenty of drinks available! There is the Pleasure Bar right in front of the theater and a bar inside. Be prepared to spend $25 for drinks inside. My friend bought two drinks for $50. I'm just glad it was my birthday so I didn't have to pay! These drinks were huge so they were worth the price.\n\nTickets: Don't worry about your seats when buying your ticket. It's pretty hard to pick a bad seat. You can see from all the seats because it's a small theater. I believe section 100-400 are all on the floor. Even if you purchase tickets in section 500 you will be able to see, you just will be on the upper level. These tickets sell out fast, so buy them in advance so you don't overpay! \n\nTipping-These are not strippers they are professional dancers. You don't need to tip. They will give you fake money to throw if you want.  The guys do get semi naked, but you're not going to see any goodies. Sorry girls! There's a lot of dancing, grinding, and audience participation. It's definitely entertaining! My friend and I had a blast!\n \nAudience: This show is perfect for bachelorette parties, birthdays or women who need some spice in their life! If you want to be pulled on stage I suggest wearing a birthday hat or something showing you're a bride! No time to be shy in here! \n\nThe show is about an hour and a half long so you still have lots of time to go out afterwards! The goal is not to get too drunk so you can hopefully remember the show!
