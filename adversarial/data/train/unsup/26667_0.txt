I used to be all about Edge fitness. But have learned at this point that their accounting team does NOT know what they're doing. I had a membership with them for 3 years+. And have always had problems with my account. Unable to find my name ( and being hassled that I don't have an account), no contact info (which is required to sign up), autopayments not coming out when they should (leading up to a similar situation to below). \n\nAt this point it's worth the move across the street to Snap Fitness. \n\nTwo months ago my credit card was stolen. On the arrival of my new card, I made the mistake of forgetting to update my gym... Fair enough. That's my responsibility. But I never received ONE phone call or update that my account had not been paid for the first or even second month. No biggie. At some point I would expect a call or at least a letter of non payment. Instead, I get a phone call from a collections agency! I had to pay $115 because of TWO months of no payment?! Even doctors offices aren't that ruthless. A simple mistake on my end. My responsibility, I get that. But collections THAT quick? That's just bad customer service. And it was sent directly to collections with no effort of making the client (me) aware of nonpayment. My membership is $19.99 a month. I only owed $40. A simple phone call, email, or letter for awareness would have handled the situation, saved my $70 unnecessarily spent dollars, and kept a long term customer. \n\nWay to take care of your customers Edge.
