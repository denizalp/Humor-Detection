After a fantastic experience at the Yonge & Eglinton location for dinner, we came to this location for the Groupon Brunch special which included two buffets and mimosas.  I am not a huge brunch person, so the idea of a pizza and charcuterie and cheese was SUPER appealing and the selection did not disappoint. I found a few of the items to be lacking in salt (the caesar & alfredo sauce come to mind) but there was no salt on the table. I probably could have asked but there were so many other delicious things to be eaten, so no biggy. The set up is a little strange, in that there is food on three separate levels of the restaurant, but it wasn't too big of a bother and probably stopped me from getting that last extra plate that I did not need.
