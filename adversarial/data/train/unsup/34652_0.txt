This cute little place ticks all of the boxes for me. I had a tea and a diamond bar because I couldn't control myself. I was left wanting more when I was done even though I was stuffed. I definitely recommend getting the diamond bar dipped in chocolate and adding a topping or two. The bars are delicious and creamy, but the extras really ramp them up and I wouldn't just get a plain one. It is quite busy here but if you come at the right time, you gotta do a photo shoot with the \"today was a good day wall\"!
