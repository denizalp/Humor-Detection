BnB Bistro was the oddly sad hotel bar\/restaurant at the Toronto Sheraton, where I spent a few nights for a mystery writers' conference last month. As conference bars go, it was neither the worst nor the best, but I was glad to have other options for food and drink within a short walk of the hotel.\n\nStill, I ended up drinking here every night of the conference, as this is where we all congregated. There was a lot to like. Quick, friendly service, a well stocked bar, and plenty of seating. I tried two of the IPAs on tap--the Great Lakes Karma Citra, and I think the other one might've been called the Boneyard IPA--and both were good. I also witnessed the pouring and consumption of an enormous glass of Hoegaarden. When I wasn't up for large volumes of beer, I drank Old Fashioneds and whiskey gingers, perfectly serviceable drinks.\n\nFor some reason, though, we kept hanging out in the brightly lit Sheraton lobby instead of the actual bar. (One of the nights, someone working at the bar said I wasn't allowed to leave with my drink, but this must not have been a hard policy.) I'm not even sure what it was, but the vibe in BnB was not especially fun. I can't pinpoint it, unless it's just that hotel bars swarmed with people wearing name badges are low key depressing. Anyway, I still had a good time at BnB Bistro four nights in a row. I'd recommend it if everyone you want to talk to is already there.
