IKEA is definitely an experience.  And it's a place to go to furnish your first apartment or are recently divorced and have no furniture.\n\nPlant pots?  Yes, for sure.  \nBusy?  Way.  \nCheap?  Uh-huh.\n\nWell staffed?  Definitely.  You can find groups of 3-4 employees engaged in private conversations throughout.  Don't bother asking them anything - they put up the pointer-finger \"pause\" to their group conversation and then use the same pointer to wave in the direction that they want you to go.  Self service at it's finest.
