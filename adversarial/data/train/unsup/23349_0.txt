This place keeps it mutha f**king classy without making those of us with less than $40  in our pocket feel uncomfortable. \n\nThe furniture and decor is lovely, feel free to live out your MADMEN fantasy here. I felt like I was meeting with a sexy client to discuss business but I was just talking with friends about \"House Party\" and \"House Party 2\" :) \n\nDo yourself a favor and go. It looks awesome and drinks are not expensive. I mean averagely 7 dollars. \n\nGood date place also.
