Prior to ever knowing about Wicked Spoon, I've always associated the word \"Wicked\" with witches, musicals and a slang word. But, O.M.G! Call me a \"Gold-digger\" of buffets. I'll milk what ever I can from this place!\n\nI vowed to myself that when I came back to Vegas, Wicked Spoon will have to be part of my itinerary. And so I did include a mandatory visit. I came here on a Sunday evening after watching some SNF. It was a miracle that this place was not busy at all when I arrived. The seating was quick and complimented friendly service.\n\nEntering this buffet made me feel like Homer J. Simpson. I felt like I was in the episode of his AYCE candy binge dream. My highlight food items were:\n\n- Wicked fried chicken\n- Potato wedges\n- Short rib kabli (Korean BBQ)\n- BBQ ribs\n- Prime rib\n- Gelatos (Nutella, coconut, green tea, tiramisu)\n- Chocolate covered strawberries\n- Macaroons\n- Cream puffs\n- Chocolate peanut butter rice crispy treats\n\nAll these items were just too hard to pass up. Cooked to perfection and enjoyable through every single bite.\n \nI kept my word for getting my monies worth! Most definitely one of my top choices of buffet. PERIOD!
