Haven't been for decades so wasn't sure what to expect...I give it 4 stars but it's a lot for what it offers rather than how it offers it. The parking is a nightmare, figuring out how to go where to see what is not easy...the guide pamphlet is all over the place...and the unorganized approach to going into the iMax theatre was frustrating...darn good thing it was mostly Canadians...I'd like to suggest that a benefactor pay for a couple of OSC employees to go to Disney and just spend a few days observing their organization, communication and pamphlets...they're the pros. As for substance though, OSC is a 9 out of 5, they are invaluable, thank you and your employees are awesome!
