Took the two mutts for grooming, super friendly and accommodating . Groomer is fantastic, she genuinely loves your pets. In the bigger outfits, I feel the groomers are going through the motions but here feels different, good different. Lots of baked treats and accessories to pamper the privileged Summerlin pooch. I highly recommend and will use exclusively.
