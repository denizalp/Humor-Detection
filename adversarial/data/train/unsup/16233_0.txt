A casual relaxed dine in or take out, Salumeria Italian Deli. Street 7 & T-Bird.\n\nStopped in for the first time today. I have been craving real Italian for a couple months now. Aiellos is a small place and I am seeing plenty of excellent Italian culinary tradition.\n\nThe menu is quite extensive. All I am going to try today is the special. A stellar large roast beef, hero sandwich, featuring a golden toasted baguette and served with a fresh side salad of mixed greens placed on top of the meat, that includes tomatoes, red onions, and shaved Parmesan. $6. This sandwich was damn good. The beef was pink and lean. The bread was fresh and crusty. The pasta salad had noteworthy Italian cuts of meat. Everything was choice.\n\nI also just realized this place will deliver. Now that's an Italian restaurant. \n\nNext door Joe and Myrah Aiello serve their pizza at Isa's Pizza. If your lucky, you get to chat with one or both of the husband and wife team and Joe will have slices of white pizza ready to go. Two slices and a coke $5.\n\nhttp:\/\/aiellositaliandeli.com\/menu.html
