I recall when Luxy first opened. The Interchange plaza was booming with activity, heck even AMC had line ups on the opening nights of big hollywood blockbusters. Since then Luxy, Ivy, Berlin, and Dub Lynn Gate Irish Pub have taken over as the main drivers of this plaza for nightlife.\n\nIn terms of clubs, while Ivy has definitely always been more my speed, Luxy offers that classic \"nightclub\" experience that appeals to the 19-23\/24 year old crowd. You know the ones that get black out drunk, pass out in bathroom stalls, pick fights and throw drinks.... the Jersey shore? ha ha, Yep! However, not that there is anything wrong with this... we were all there at one point, but we all (as the current crowd will) realize that places like Luxy have an expiration date.\n\nFrom my times at Luxy the interior decor is fantastic, the lights, the sound system, the differing theme rooms and the exquisite outdoor patio. Down sides include the crowd, the door staff, prices and the wait times (which can rival those in the city).\n\nA younger version of myself would have awarded this place 4 solid fist pumps but as I'm older now I'd say it falls at about 2.5 fatigued fist pumps with a red bull chase to get me through the night.
