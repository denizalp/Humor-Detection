I'll certainly check them out again, as their location off of Shea in Scottsdale has always been good, but I was a bit disappointed by my last meal there.  A small serving for a big price for takeout, and with a bunch of bones to pick out of the fish... not worth the price.  (Other meal of chicken and vegetable fried rice was fine.)  However, like their Shea location, the staff is always very nice, the style and quality of the restaurant very nice, and they normally give generous portions with great plastic take-out boxes that are far better than the paper ones which can get soggy.  I'll be back, and hopefully it will allow me to better my review.
