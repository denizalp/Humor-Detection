Yes, it's priced on the higher side - although not as pricey as the crap hold called Ruan Thai - but definitely worth it.\nAgain, it;s hard going to a retaurant that serves food for 150 times what you pay in Thailand itself, but whatever. I don't think I'd make most of these items at home.\nWe ordered out, and ordered too much food for the 3 of us.\nWe started with the Som Tum, a papaya salad with prawns, not bad, but needed more fish sauce. Then we had the Coconut soup which was amazing, and spicy enough to cause my eyes to water after the first bite (I was fine after the first 2 minutes). \nThen the pad thai, again, mediocre, which I find in most Thai places, yet it's one of the most common and seemingly easiest dishes to make. The noodles stuck together and didn't have enough peanuts or other ingredients to make it really great.\nThen there was the Crying Tiger marinated beef. It was less spicy thatn I had anticipated, but as good as well.\nThe highlight of the meal, the Panang Duck Curry. Oh my god! Oh my! Amazing. Duck is fatty, and therefore tasty, and the eggplant was so amazing, I would've eaten it alone. It was so spicy, yet didn't take away from the flavor of the food. You know when it's so spicy you can't taste anything anymore, and you end up just shoveling it down quickly to get it over with, with a glass of milk to help.\nIf you eat here, I absolutely recommend this dish. Next time I go, I'm ordering two, and not sharing.
