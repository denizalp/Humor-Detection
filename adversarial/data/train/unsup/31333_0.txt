Yeah, so the decor in this Moroccan themed spa is a bit \"Disneyland\" but the experience is authentic.\nThe facility has everything you need for a deeply relaxing experience. Dimly lit rest area with comfy couches are great but a whisper area with curtained twin beds are just incredible. The spa pool-on the roof top-overlooks Camelback mountain. It's small and intimate with great food and drinks. Granted we were there on a Monday so it was pretty quiet ( highly recommended!) \nThe spa area-the whirlpool, cool deluge ( LOVE IT) and the wet and dry saunas are top rate.  \nThe best part of my experience was the massage. Colleen was magical. I love the spiritual-mind-body connection with massage but usually don't expect it at a resort spa. Colleen was tuned in but also extremely competent with the physical aspects of massage. Next time I'm booking with her and it will be the 1.5 hours!\nI floated through the rest of the day. I would recommend a massage early and then use the early day to relax by the pool and eat. Then do your spa rituals and don't forget the cold water plunge-it is soo worth the initial fear.\nThen....take a nap!\nThe only negative was the front desk staff( both on the phone and in person) need to step it up in the customer service arena-you expect really over the top interpersonal skills at a high end spa. \nWe went on the spa week special-79.00-such a deal!
