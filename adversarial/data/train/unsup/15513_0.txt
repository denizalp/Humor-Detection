My first first-to-review, yay!\n\nIt was horrifying :(\n\nThis review goes out as a warning to boba lovers everywhere:\nBoba Deli makes the worst boba I have ever had, period.\n\nI asked for a mango boba.\n\nI got mango water mixed with finely crushed ice. You couldn't call it a smoothie and you couldn't even act like it was some new iced mango drink. How hard is it to blend the powder, water, syrup flavoring, and ice into a smoothie? \n\nIf you want to make the junk that they called a mango boba, here's a suggested recipe:\n\nMix mango powder with one glass water\nAdd three cubes ice\nZap blend - 1 second blend\nAdd hard, stale boba
