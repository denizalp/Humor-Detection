One of the must do things in Vegas is to walk the strip and see most things Vegas has to offer. \n\nYou can catch anything from crazy people on the streets, random  people  performing,  drunk people, casino shows, Restaurants,  shopping, and more just by taking a few steps. \n\nTip from me is to enjoy a nice cold beer while doing it.
