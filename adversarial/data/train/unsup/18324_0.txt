Melting Pot Madness-Part 2!\n\nCourse Three: Fondue Fusion Fantasia continues...\n\nFiguring out what went best with what became a marvelous game of culinary match-up, but the sour cream sauce was a dark horse that worked with pretty much everything. Or would that make it a Joker? Why...so...serious?\n\nThe sirloin was our Alpha. Each chunk was dropped into the oil\/broth, and we waited impatiently for each to finish cooking. Once the first morsel came out, I found the creamy curry sauce to be the best coating for it. Then it was the chicken, which also worked brilliantly with the curry. The pork followed, bathing nicely in the sweet\/sour sauce after its spell in the roiling stew. The two ravioli went in next, and once they bubbled to the surface, we found that the curious Gorgonzola port had its number.\n\nKay and I saved the best three for last. The filet mignon was dunked into the garlic butter, the shrimp into the fiery cocktail sauce, and our Omega, the lobster tail, also baptized in garlic butter. Pure seafood euphoria captured in four chunks, our lobster was cooked ideally; soft, plump, saturated. My eyes rolled back. Kay sighed. Kayleigh came to our table just as we ate the final bites of lobster, acting as if she had caught us doing...the devil's business, and we were left wanting more.\n\nThe Devil. Satan. The Adversary. Call Him what you will, His accursedness created the final course.\n\nCourse Four: Dark and Dulce Chocolate Fondue\n\nSuch was the name of dessert, and a carnal cauldron it was, a vat of villany, a stein of sin to which we were hopelessly drawn. \n\nA baneful bittersweet chocolate united with a demonic dulce de leche to snatch our souls from our bodies, using marshmallows, poundcake, brownies, strawberries, and because it was Kay's birthday, a whole cut of cheesecake (complete with a lone candle lanced through it) as emissaries. A shaker of sea salt stood by to make each treat sing its sinister siren songs even louder, hissing like Galder, wailing like King Diamond. The Cheesecake was particularly divine, made infernal by that succulent, deadly, decadent black crud. \n\nAs we were about to fully succumb to the lava, our love in grave danger of being stolen by Mephisto, Kayleigh broke the spell by bringing us each a glass of champagne. Our souls were now cleansed, our romantic bond renewed, our roundtrip into Heaven, Hell, and Earth finished.\n\nP.S. I really can't say enough positive things about the service. Kayleigh is The Patron Saint Of All Waitresses. In addition to the balloons and chocolate bar, she also gave Kay a bottle of TMP's own Garlic Wine seasoning since she liked it so much on her salad. \n\nP.P.S. Metaphysical hyperbole aside, I feel it must be noted that The Melting Pot is a staunch supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a worthy charity...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.meltingpot.com\/the-experience\/community.aspx
