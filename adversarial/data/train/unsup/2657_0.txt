If you're looking for something delicious, this place is not it.\nIgnore all these dumb reviews about how good the food is.  \nThe food is just so-so, it's just ok.  No tastier than a plain hotdog or bag of chips.  This place is so ethnic, they don't even know what yelp is.\n\nThe place is really simple,  5 dollar plates. You pick a rice, a protein, and a starchy side.  The meats are chicken pork or beef.  The sides are Yuca or fried Yuca.  Sweet platano, or fried plantains.  I don't recommend anything but the plain white rice.  The rice and beans are over done and dry.  The white is made just right.\n\nThe meat: Its dry, fairly seasoned.  I don't think food deserves bonus stars just for being cheap.  I agree the portions are huge, but the food is super unhealthy as there is no veg whatsoever.\n\nI do recommend this place when you're broke and wanna get a lot of food for cheap.  Or you're the boss of something and you're treating the staff.  It's literally 2 lbs of food for 5 bux.\n\n\nCome here if you're just looking to get stuffed for cheap.\nyou've been warned.
