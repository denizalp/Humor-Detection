I've been coming to this location (right on the subway line) on and off for the past 6-ish years ever since I first discovered Hatha Yoga. Bikram's take on Yoga is quite different and quite honestly, brutal. \n\nIf you survive your first class and try a second, however, you'll notice how much easier it gets, especially if you return the next day. The room is extremely warm at  39C, and you'll be tempted to run out during class, but don't be silly, not only will you get a verbal slap on the wrist, but you'll be sorry if you did. Staying in builds determination, a stronger body and an undefinable sense of satisfaction. After all, 26 hardcore positions with an encore in 90 minutes in sweltering heat is no small feat.\n\nYou'll want to be very prepared to sweat, so don't forget 2 towels, a large bottle of water, and a change of clothes (maybe even a fruit\/energy bar after class).\n\nThis location is small, but has everything you need from showers, a clean change-room and the boot camp studio. \n\nFree parking!
