I came to the practice with fatigue, multiple pregnancy losses, and weight gain. I saw Doctor Lee who sent me for an ultrasound and discovered a polyp. Even though a polyp is not harmful, 1% of the time it can cause a pregnancy loss. We did surgery to remove it. However, this did not help with my other symptoms. He ran a thyroid T3 and T4. No TSH. Got an abnormal result but the retest was fine. 4 months later I moved to VA. Upon a very preliminary physical by my New OB, she found a goiter. A goiter with 6 nodules, one as big as a golfball. Now I wait the result of my FNA. \n\nSomething like that doesn't grow overnight.\n\nIf Dr Lee really cared about his patients, he would have taken a little more time to investigate and treat the root cause.
