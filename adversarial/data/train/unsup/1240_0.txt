Definitely wasn't what I was expecting. A friend told me to go check this place out and I thought it was just going to be a nice Japanese sit down restaurant. Boyyyy was I wrong.\nAbout thirty drunk people yelled at me as I walked in but the atmosphere was electric and contagious. The food was good as little tasty morsels but not for dinner.\n\nI got the macha cocktail and it was amazing :]]] I'm not a big drinker but I loved this drink because it was pretty much green tea latte with malibu so a slight coconut taste.\n\nI mainly love this place because of all the rowdy loud people who were all friendly (although probably because they were drunk). Even though it was a complete 180 from what I thought I'd be in for, I still had an amazing time :]
