Personally I didn't like any of the times I went to Brunswick house. The place itself is really cool and laid out well but the music is a bit lame and I find the crowd that gathers there aren't really my type. If you walk by around midnight you'll regularly see people running out and puking on the sidewalk , making it almost impossible to walk by and there's regularly arguments and yelling and it just doesn't prove for a good night (although this could be said for most bars and pubs, there's just something not right about the Brunny).\n\nThe only good thing they do have is their reverse cover Saturdays (or is it Fridays?) where they pay you $5 to come in. However there are a ton of better places you could spend your nights at so I'd pass on the Brunny and check the numerous other bars and pubs in the Annex area.
