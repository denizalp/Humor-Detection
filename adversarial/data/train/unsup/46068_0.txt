The chicken banh mi was great. It has the sauce. Better than Mr. Le's in Charlotte! If you are willing to pay for great banh mi, this place will not let you down. It's more expensive but it is bigger and longer. \n\nThe pho is good too. Great broth. The only down part is that it's a bit small for 10 bucks. Great food but a bit on the pricy side. I guess it's better than driving all the way to Charlotte.
