Soup Nutsy is at the food court at the bottom of my office building so I tried it for lunch one day. It's crazy busy at lunchtime!! They have a really good system going though, lots of people working behind the bar, and the line goes efficiently. \nMain negative for me is that their soups are salty, but I find a lot of things overly salty.  They have a pretty huge selection to choose from.
