Are you a douche bag?  Do you have more money than sense?  Does it make you all warm and fuzzy to way overpay for a mediocre drink?  If so, Majerle's is the place for you!  \n\nPersonally, I never cared for the \"owner\" when he was with the Suns, and this establishment has done nothing to change that opinion.  The food is bland at best, but for the prices it should have a little flavor.  I'm not sure what criteria the staff uses when deciding who to grace with their presence, but the female servers sure weren't responding to me (a woman) even when I held out a $20.00 - my 6'3\" friend had much better luck, he was the one that had to order my drink.  \n\nI'm disappointed, this is such an easy place to hit on a light rail pub crawl or before or after a game or concert, but I just don't think I can bring myself to go back willingly.
