Honestly I had high hopes went in all happy and excited the line was short and went by fast . Everyone was nice. The place had modern class to it. I saw the prices brought my gf and one of our friends we had just ate wanted to get some dessert. But honestly wasn't worth the wait after the first course came a just \"one big  plate\" with \"a very small sorbet \" my happiness vanished and immediately so did everyone in my party. I saw the good and bad reviews and honestly I'm adding another bad one on the list . This basically like another reviewer had said it's just for the picture nothing more . Not the best dessert either had the ringo small portion . For you pay and the 20% tip for each of your party I DON'T RECOMMEND ANYONE COMING HERE ! We left no tip because after the server asked how was the food I honestly couldn't look to tell her like \" what the heck?\" \"Seriously is that it?\" I'm never coming here again . Waste of money .
