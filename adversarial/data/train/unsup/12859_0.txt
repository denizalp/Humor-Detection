This bar reminded us of the \" Mos Eisley Cantina \" .. you know... the bar featured in the Star Wars movie... where Han Solo is found. \n\nStrange place... large, very much a renovation in progress.. and has been for quite sometime. I think they are attempting to duplicate the interior of \"1313 Mockingbird Lane\"... I've been told that this bar was owned by the same people who own Amsterdam.. which I find hard to believe since its SUCH a departure from Amsterdam. \n\nI was told by a friend to check this place out ( again ) ... that it got allot better... hmmm not sure what he meant by that. I was hoping that Stacy would be working, since I heard he was working there... but much to our dismay he was not. The drinks were decent, although unsure why they have 2 or 3 different styles of \"rocks\" glasses, we kept getting our drinks mixed up. \n\nI'm gonna try this bar again.. maybe during the week for happy hour.. Maybe I just went on an off night and update the review...
