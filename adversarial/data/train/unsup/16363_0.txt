I chose Paragon to start my son off in Kindergarten last year and only managed to keep him there for the first month, primarily because I had already paid for the full month's before\/after school care costs.\n\nMeet the Teacher Night: The lists posted outside had the wrong room number information on them, the line was out the door for uniforms and I asked several employees for information that no one seemed to be able to assist with.\n\nDay 01 of School: I arrived at 7:15, before school care starts at 7 and the doors were locked. Another mother knocked and someone opened the door up to inform us school didn't start until 8 at which point we replied that our children were enrolled in the before school care program. Apparently, they didn't have anyone staffed to manage before school care or after school care. For the first few days they had our children sitting on the floor in the front office until I emailed the principal outlining the number of reasons their before \"school care\" was unacceptable.\n\nI chose to leave my son enrolled and to give them the benefit of the doubt. The principal explained they had recently lost that employee although, to me, it didn't excuse them not finding a temporary alternative or failing to inform the parents that paid for that service.\n\nOn another instance the school phoned me after a half day and asked if I usually pick up my child after school, evidently they weren't aware that my son attended after school care every day that they provided themselves at the school.\n\nIt was a mess and a nasty experience for my son's first year in school. I ended up transferring him to Athlos Legacy Traditional Academy which I couldn't be happier with (see my review on Athlos).
