Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.  They are a little slow getting the food out at opening time, but everything was fresh and tasty and a good variety.\n\nThe already dressed salad had a great sweet dressing, pineapple something or other and it was a great start to the meal.  One of the things I like best about this buffet is the variety of foods they offer - chicken, veggie, pork, beef as well as rice and noodle dishes.  I'd prefer more of the items to have a little heat; the only spicy thing I tried was the panang chicken.  \n\nThe food is good, they serve real iced tea with the buffet as well.  Service was good and the company was better!  I'm sure I'll be back.
