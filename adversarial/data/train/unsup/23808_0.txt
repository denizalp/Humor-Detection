Dic Ann's is a Quebec classic and this is one of the very best in my opinion. I think it was actually opened by the franchise owners in the 90's but the vibe is perfect, homey 60's small town diner. A tribute to the original couple, Dick and Ann, who fell in love and dreamed of opening a hamburger spot and moved to Montreal's east end in the 50s and made their dream come true. I love the gold and orange glass lamps over every table, and I love the burnt orange diner seats, the faux stone counter top, and the fact that the place always seems completely full of locals hanging out, and digging into the classic flat burgers and crispy fries and gooey poutines. Cover everything in the homemade hot sauce, and everything is ok.
