This dog park has alot to offer. It's large and spacious with 2 gated sections -one for  \"active\" dogs, where I see larger pooches,  and one for passive dogs where I see smaller dogs, but some larger ones too.  it's clean, well kept, and inviting. Also a really great place to meet fellow loving dog owners. Even if you just want to walk your dog, there's a nice walking path and desert garden area. I never have an issue with parking either. Just a very pleasant way to spend some quality time with your furry friends.\n\nTip- make sure to clean up after your pet, or you might get mauled by a group of angry pet parents!
