I've come here on two different occasions, I have not been disappointed.\nI like the service (although a bit slow, especially during line ups) not a lot of seating available...and their food. I really enjoyed all aspects of the food (from the fries to their coleslaw...) I love that they are able to accommodate different diets (grilled fish instead of fried).\n\nI've had their lobster roll, soft shell crab sandwich, and their fob poboy.\nThe soft shell sandwich is messy, their lobster roll is the best I've had here in Toronto, and their poboy was all around yummy.\n\nPortions are great to share, prices are a bit high but worth coming to when you don't want to be disappointed.
