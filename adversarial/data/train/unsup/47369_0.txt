This venue is small in size, intimate and adequate. The productions I've witnessed so far, all three have been funny, charming & entertaining. \nI will continue to support this theater because  \nNo matter the size of the room, the performances are grand and actors engaging. \nTheir staff is friendly and helpful. A perk each show is a frozen chocolate covered mint they pass around, then come collect the wrappers.\nIt's easy to park right outside the entrance and off the 101. \nLook on Goldstar for tickets and go enjoy.
