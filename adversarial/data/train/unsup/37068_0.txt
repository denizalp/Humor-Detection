Okay I guess I'm stupid. I keep coming back here even though each time I do I have to beg the bartenders to give me a drink. I tip really well yet whenever I come here and I can't figure it out. Even when the bar is empty, which is usually when I come, bartenders do everything possible to keep from serving drinks. When I finally get someone's attention they say okay then I watch them go and restock the bar while I twiddle my thumbs and throw more money away on the slots at the bar. It's really borderline insulting no I take it back it is insulting when you're a good customer.. And apparently it's not just me. When I talk to people there they share the same frustration. I don't know if it's like this at the other wildfires. I sure hope not. One of these days I'll wise up and find another place to throw money away. Aside from the bad service, I love the place.. good food and all that. too bad I'll have to find someplace else to love.
