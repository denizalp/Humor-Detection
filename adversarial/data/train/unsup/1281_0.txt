Woo! 150th review of Guu! (Yeah, that rhymes!) \n\n(disclaimer: someone stole the 150th the moment I posted this. YAY 151!!!)\n\nI went to Guu for my birthday on a Monday night at around 8pm, and didn't have to wait for a table at all (though some people who came in right behind us did!). Even if we had waited, it would have been worth it. I love the environment, and how every time the staff have to yell welcome or goodbye, they do it with real enthusiasm! \n\nNot only that, but the food was beyond amazing. Favorite was definitely scallop sashimi, but I didn't have anytihng that I wouldn't have again! \n\nAND if you buy a birthday dessert (or barter with your waiter), they will sing you the most epic restaurant birthday song of all time. At the time, I was embarassed, but looking back it was awesome! \n\nIn conclusion, DEFINITELY GO HERE.
