I have had burgers from all over the world and On The Bun has the best Burgers I have ever had.  I am from New Jersey and whenever I have crossed the border since the summer of 2014 I have a found a way to make it to On the Bun.  The AK47 and the masala burger are my personal favorites.  From the super tasty patty to the perfect bun to go along with the right amount toppings is what one can expect at On the Bun.  The owner is also a really nice guy who always takes great care of his customers and makes sure you have a great experience at On the Bun.  If you haven't tried it out, its a must try so find a way to make it to the best burger spot around.
