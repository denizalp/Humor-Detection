Stopped in here for happy hour one night after a business conference. Didn't get to take a peek at the main dining room but the lounge area at the front is pretty sweet! Super vibe with some nice, chill house music playing (loud enough to enjoy but not so loud one can't have a conversation). There's also a \"peek-a-boo\" effect between the lounge and the outside mall that's quite interesting.\n\nI also noticed separate from the main bar, a tea bar which is quite interesting. The happy hour deals were fairly reasonable (beer, wine, saki, and a few food items), and I'm not sure if they do it all the time but when I visited there was a special list of custom dishes created for those customers checking in on Foursquare.\n\nI highly recommend.
