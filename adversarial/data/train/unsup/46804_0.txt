This place is really good overall.  The all you can eat is pricey but generally speaking its sushi is fresh and the service is good.  The layout of the restaurant is tight and if you go when its busy the seating can get a little uncomfortable for families with kids.  Some days we order ala carte and if you aren't gonna eat a lot its a good idea, I would say its one of the top in the area and the location is nice.
