A lot of the haters didn't think I'd review Cap'n Taco, but here I am. If you're looking for modern Mexican cuisine, hit up chipotle. If you're looking to take your taste buds on a rollercoaster ride of authentic Mexican food, this is the place for you. \n\nThe taco shells are crisp and fresh and the sauce will take you on a one way trip to flavortown. Forget Taco Bell, this is the late night booty call you're looking for. \n\nSad that my friend Dominic (picture attached) refused to sample what the Cap'n was offering.
