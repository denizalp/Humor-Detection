We were walking around downtown LV after dinner. I'm the type that drinks beer and wine on the same night. I was pre-gaming before dinner, had beer at dinner then Riesling from Insert Coins. I haven't used a joystick\/controller in forever since the Wii came out. Therefore, my hand-eye coordination was impaired.\n\nKacey and I played Marvel vs Capcom on Xbox at the bar. The sausage brothers played Gran Turismo. I've never played M vs C before and I've never owned an Xbox since I'm a Tekken\/ Street Fighter PlayStation type of gal. I don't know any combos for that game so I used my ninja skills and won all games, yay! I'm very competitive and a big sore loser so it's a good thing I won, otherwise, I would've walked out. After finishing our drinks, some of us played The Simpsons, I played Galaga (classic!!!) and Tekken Tag (I love Hwoarang because he's my video game crush...and Eddie Gordo\/Tiger because of their cool moves - they're weak compared to Jin, Law, Xiaoyu, Julia, Nina and Heihachi). Since I was getting too relaxed, I picked Hwoarang and friggin PANDA!!! I lost after 3 rounds...what a waste of 50 cents!\n\nMy wrists and fingers were hurting but I had fun. Too bad I didn't get the chance to tiger uppercut, hadduken, sonic boom, facebite and helicopter kick anyone. Bring lots of quarters. They have nice couches where you can also play video games.  They have an area for a big group. Now, I want to play video games at home again...baaad...
