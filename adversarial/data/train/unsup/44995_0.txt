Love it here!! \nI've stayed here before and I'll always choose to stay here when I want to be away from the strip. \nI highly recommend booking your actual reservation with the hotel and not through a third party website because your room preferences will not be guaranteed and your reservation may not even show up. I say this because it has happened to me. Long story short, I got my reservation fixed and Platinum hooked it up! \nGreat staff from the front desk, the hotel manager Sky, the bell boys, and Jeff the valet guy. They greet you every time you enter the hotel and bid you a genuine farewell when you leave. \nLOVE the full kitchen, the balcony, large bathroom with jacuzzi hot tub, and very spacious\noh and heads up, no self parking. Only valet.
