This burger joint used to be Prime Burger, they retired and sold out to Big Jacks which has been open for a few weeks now.  Prime was a traditional burger joint and hadn't changed in many years.  Big Jacks is jumping on the new age burger philosophy of adding signature burgers that add a unique flare of unconventional ingredients.\n\nAt the suggestion of the friendly staff I went with the Red Neck burger.  This is a burger with added peameal bacon which is beer battered and deep fried.  They explained the batter is home made from chips.  Unique idea, I've eaten a lot of weird burgers, but this is a first.  It was really good, but be prepared for a huge burger that the average person won't get their mouth around.  My only comment was the deep fried peameal was very oily.  They should adjust the fryer temperature to avoid this.\n\nI got the onion rings which were fresh made and it shows, the inside onion was moist and the batter crispy.\n\nThe menu is well presented, my one suggestion is to list the condiments on the menu.  The staff was asking \"what do you want on it\" and with some customers having to list them all out.  Take a cue from five guys, they list it all and then have a suggested list of \"the works\" ingredients.\n\nI'll try the regular cheeseburger next to see if my four stars holds up.\n\nOh ya and they serve pop in a bottle which is far better than watered down fountain pop.
