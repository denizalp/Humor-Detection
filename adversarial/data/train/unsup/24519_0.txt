I rented a room for a week at Budget Suites and the first night I found bedbugs.  The next day, I went to the office and told them and they sent a manager to the room to inspect it.  I showed him what i had found and he told me that they look full grown.  He was insinuating that I brought them with me and I know they didn't come from me.  I didn'thave them before I went there and they're not in the place I'm at now.  But they refused to put me in another room and refused to pay for me to stay somewhere else and they refusted to refund my $250.  They gave me $18 to wash my clothes, which wasn't enough, and he told me it should be enough to do one persons laundry.  On top of all that, they wanted to charge me for my friends dog.  My friend had come to help me move and do laundry becaouse I have a bad back and she brought her dog and as soon as the dog stepped foot in the room, they tried charging me $125.  Upon leaving the room, we looked up and found a bed bug hanging from the door frame.  When I pointed that out to the manager, he said \"hmmm.....I wonder where that came from.\"  So, i'm still fighting this, but so far they have taken my $250, costed me $200 that I had to pay for another room elsewhere, and inconvenienced me GREATLY.  I will NEVER stay there again, nor will I recommend them to anyone I like.
