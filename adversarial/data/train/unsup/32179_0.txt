Oh, what this place could have been!  Think of this place as the Vegas version of the little corner joint on Wilshire Blvd.  This place SO reminds me of calypso music:  the kind you listen to on an ultimate Sunday afternoon, lounging around with a glass of pina colada in your hand, getting slowly and happily drunk.  So ultimately my disappointment with the food will certainly get a chance to redeem itself the next time I go back.\n\nLocated in another \"oh, what it could have been\" place, Boca Park, you find yourself in a bright, surfing USA type setting with lots of bright color accents on white base.  The place has active but laid-back energy that fits the setting as well.  Upon walking in, there is an order counter in front, tables to the left and behind the counter, and a large bar to the right.  There are TVs everywhere including all around the large square bar, a perfect place to watch the games and drink to your delight.  You literally feel like you're at some divey surfer bar, sans the grime and sand.  \n\nThe staff is pleasant and acceptably prompt, and orders are efficiently filled although I wouldn't say it's lightening fast.  We tried carne asada, pescado, and carnitas tacos, and all were acceptable without being outstanding.  It looks delicious, but is somewhat underwhelming and that 3-star food results in the loss of a big star from the 5-star setting.  However it is certainly more than adequate for Saturday and Sunday afternoons watching football, avoiding the typical dark, cave-like settings most bars seem to think everybody wants.  So it almost is the perfect sports bar - now only if they had better food and some calypso music!\n\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  I could see myself sitting at the bar for hours by myself...
