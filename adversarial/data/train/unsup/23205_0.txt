What. The. F*ck...\nAm I losing my mind or has the whole world gone mad? We make stupid people famous. E.g kim kardashian, Miley cyrus or whoever the flavor of the week is. Stop making stupid people famous!  And stop over hyping bullsh*t food! This is the furthest thing from good pizza. If this good pizza then I'm the Pope who's having a really and day.\n\nIm going to admit that I am stupid. I keep falling for the hype and I'm constantly getting punished with bad food.\n\nI've given up on trying to find good pizza in CA. Many of my friends said that Grimaldi's the shiz but it's in vegas. You know that saying about whatever happens in vegas? This pizza should never leave vegas. Grimaldi's, stay put because your pizza is fraudulent. You do not serve \"NYC style pizza\", you serve a sub par version of the same thing I can get at a pieology franchise and it's waaaaaaay less expensive. Pieology also labels their pizza properly. Grimaldi's, you serve neopolitan style and you do it poorly.\n\nOnce the pizza arrived at our table, just looking at it, I was already disappointed. It was burnt, not browned. The sauce looked like it just came straight out of a BPA lined can. \n\nWhen i took my first bite, I noticed that it was under seasoned and that blaring red sauce was way too acidic. Have these cooks ever heard of using sugar to cut down on the acid? WTF, this is amateur sh*t people! This is pizza sauce 101. I made a better pizza with a boboli crust when I was a kid and I didn't even know what the f*ck I was doing back then.\n\nAlso, I have never had a pizza turn my hands black. Yes, my hands were black. (See napkin picture)\n\nThis place is a bust. Over priced. Over hyped. The odds will be against you. The \"pizza\" only lives up to the first part of its namesake, \"Grim\".
