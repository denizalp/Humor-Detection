MSG CITY.... We were super excited about this place and were very disappointed when they told us that they use MSG in virtually all of their dishes. The one thing that didn't have it was their green onion pancake which they get shipped in frozen. It was really gross when I tried it. My partner ended up feeling sick the next day.  Go to mother dumplings on spadina. Their stuff is fresh and they don't use any msg in anything.... And their food tastes way better.
