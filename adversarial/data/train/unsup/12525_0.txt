The worst!  It was bad when it was Ballys now it's worse as Blast.  I cannot make this up.. today there was no toilet paper or paper towels. I was told that \"it was on order but has not arrived yet\". OMG!  Anyone hear of Walmart?  This place is a mess, lots of equipment either not working or needs fixed, vacuuming at all times of the day, horsing around employees, just a horrible place!  Don't waste your money here, even though it's cheap you get what you pay for and less!
