If you've never been to a Mongolian grill, definitely check this place out!  The service process is really cool.  You fill a bowl of your own toppings, meats, veggies, and such, and it gets stir fried up and mixed with your rice or noodles.\n\nThey also have some cool drinks, lemonades and such that you can add a shot of liqour to for just $2, ends up being a sweet deal!\n\nFun night and good for reasonable prices.
