This place has a really nice look inside. The lighting is interesting. The decor was lavish with everything colored a sultry red. This is a pretty small place compared to the other ultra clubs in vegas. However, the big let down was the crowd. The people that were there on a saturday night were a bit old for my liking. Seemed like a lot of middle aged people trying to seem young again. It's kinda creepy when you see a 70+ year old man dancing on the dance floor. Overall i did end up having an awesome experience with lots of good drinks and great music. The main draw to this place is if you want a nice place to be with friends without being packed like sardines in a place like pure or tao. Also since we had a bunch of guys, this was much easier and cheaper to get into. So for ease of entry, great music and great drinks, 4 stars. minus 1 for the old people.
