I recently purchased my wedding dress at this location and received exceptional customer service. I'd highly recommend any bride visit Kathy in the bridal suite to see the selection of gowns. I also recommend working with Maria in alterations, as she made my dress fit like a glove! I truly could not be more happy with my experience.
