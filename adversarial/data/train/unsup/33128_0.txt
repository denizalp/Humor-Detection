Just saw Kinky Boots, while it was a good show, I wouldn't want to see it a second time which I did and second time it is quite boring. I was invited for a third time and I declined. It is really just a glorified drag show and Toronto has no shortage of Drag shows.  Parts of this show reminded me of the former group The Great Imposters, now that was a touring group to be seen. Maybe I have seen to many drag shows and I am spoiled. As for the theater itself, I love this place as I do most old theaters. This place is not about comfort because it is not comfortable, it is not about modern d√©cor because it is not, it is about history. Any time I sit in a place this old I imagine all the people that have come through those doors over the years. Kinky  Boots didn't do it for me but reviews on live shows is very subjective, I say go if you haven't seen it and decide for yourself.
