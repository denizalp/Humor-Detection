I only came because my parents wanted to take our relatives from the UK to experience an abundance of American style food.  We first tried a Sunday night around 6:30pm and there was about 1 hour wait and decided to come back on Thursday night at 6:30pm and there was a 30 minute wait.  \n\nFor a little less than $12 for dinner, (no drink) it's okay.  Yes its one notch better than Home Town, but they're not that hard to beat.  It is busy so you have to be careful with bumping into kids especially.  Some parents allow their kids to run full speed through the restaurant.  \n\nWhen we got in, they did a quick wipe down of our table but they needed to use better table wipes cause it reeked a bit.  With the heat and amount of people in our section, ventilation was also not that great, which had a little bit of that smell you get when you're waiting in a DMV.  \n\nAs for the food, they don't know how to cook steaks.  My med-rare was med-well.  They just cut slices off the grill not letting steaks rest... which loses all their juices.  It's a sirloin so probably doesn't matter anyways.  \nPork ribs are a huge hit or miss.  Don't get the end pieces because its pork jerky, very overcooked.  Only the center bones are descent.  \nFried fish, onion rings, and chicken noodle soup were way over salted.\nI liked their fried chicken...then again I just like fried chicken almost anywhere.\nI did enjoy the salad and fruit area, which probably isn't anyone's purpose to coming to this place.  Watermelon was sweet and freshly cut.\nHand scooped ice cream was a bit on the sweeter side for me.  \nHand spun cotton candy was nice.  I can't remember the last time I've ever had that.  \nChocolate fountain had kid's hands going in too far and dipping more than just their food so that wasn't very appetizing.  \n\nStaff is nice and friendly and were attentive to us.
