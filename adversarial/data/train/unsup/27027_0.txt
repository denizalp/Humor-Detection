Are they rushed?  Everything we got was undercooked.  Pizza, cactus cuts, French fries!\n\nDough on the pizza was thick as all hell, and the sauce looks like it was flung at the pizza from across the room.\n\nPretty terrible guys.  I know it's a common chain, but this can't be the definition of consistency, far from it.\n\nBrutal.  Won't be coming back.\n\nPs - I was a BP restaurant manager for 2 years when I was 20.  Quality control would be outraged.
