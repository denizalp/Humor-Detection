I was introduced to this charming lunch spot by my niece who attends Cleveland State University, since it's located just a few blocks off campus. I no longer live in Ohio, but when I'm in town this is our traditional spot to meet, talk & enjoy some warm & tasty Pho. \nWe usually start with egg rolls-she gets the fried.  I enjoy the fresh shrimp & pork & the yummy dipping sauce that accompanied them. Then, being creatures of habit, we both usually order the traditional rare beef pho & it is consistently delicious. The service is kind of hit & miss - not an uncommon tendency in ethnic restaurants, but nothing that bad that I'd not return...quite the contrary we've been back time & time again & will be in the future!
