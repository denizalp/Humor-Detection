Meh is an understatement. While I don't think it's a horrible place that deserves one star, we were not impressed with this place. The check in process is pretty painless if you use the self check in stations, otherwise there are VERY long lines. The offered a sort of coupon\/card for declining maid service during our stay, but we never got that either. They also tacked on a $40\/day \"resort fee\" to our bill, which we were never told about either. I understand, all the Vegas hotels are ripping people off with these \"resort fees\", but what does it really include? Can I not use the elevator? Do I get charged extra for washing my face at night? We didn't use the pool, or the gym, or room service, or maid service. We did use the elevator though.\n\nThe room itself was okay. Nothing special. The headboard in the room was pretty messed up and had tears and slashes in it. The mattress was okay, but the pillows were awful. I couldn't even sleep on them they were so uncomfortable.\n\nWe walked around the lobby which is fun and has a nice ambiance. We tried to get a drink at the first bar after the check in which had these cool chairs that looked like a corset on the back. We sat at the bar and we were ready to kick off the evening. Right away someone came to us and said someone else would be there to help us instead. Um ok? The bar only had 3 other people at it and there were several people working behind the bar. After waiting a little over five minutes with nobody else coming by or even looking at us, we decided to leave.\n\nWe were very disappointed with Paris. Everything was very overpriced, service was awful, if it even existed, and we just felt ripped off at the end. I don't know how they have positive ratings. Maybe they're really old?\n\nIf I have to say one good thing about the place, they are centrally located on the strip. So it's easy to get the heck out of there and enjoy yourself somewhere nearby.
