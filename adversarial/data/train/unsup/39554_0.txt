This place is incredible! I was referred here after spending Memorial weekend broken down in Fountain Hills with no transmission shops open. I called on Monday (the holiday) and left a message. Phil returned my call about 7am Tuesday and said they were swamped with vehicles that had been left in his parking lot over the weekend but, after hearing my story he said, \"Come on down. I will keep a bay open for you!\"  I immediately called AAA and they were at my hotel in 30 minutes. We pulled into Ken's Transmissions in northeast Phoenix about 9:30 and Phil was waiting, true to his word with a vacant bay waiting. While they were putting my truck on the lift I got on my phone and booked a nearby Scottsdale hotel figuring I would be waiting until the following day for my truck....two hours later I was on my way with a rebuilt transmission installed perfectly and several hundred dollars less than any of the other estimates I received!!  \n\nIf you ever have transmission problems and you are anywhere near Phoenix this is, hands-down, the best, most honest, most efficient, and genuinely friendly repair shop I have ever dealt with....no need to look any further!  Call and talk to Phil (602-867-3354)....he will fix you up.\n\nThat reminds me, I need to thank Fred for this referral! :))
