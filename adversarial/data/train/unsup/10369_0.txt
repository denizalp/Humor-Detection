Been to Walnut Grill 4 or 5 times and owe it a review.  One of the best food and drink Happy Hours in the Wexford and North Hills area for sure, especially when the weather allows patrons to enjoy the spacious patio.  Happy Hour here, at least in the summertime, is a popular spot, but we've actually never had an issue being seated on the patio--and thank goodness for the huge parking lot.\n\nLove that there are $3 glasses of wine during Happy Hour.  A $3 decent chilled Riesling on the patio in the summer...I'm game.  My guy is a fan of the wine deals too and also likes the great bang-for-buck Happy Hour beer specials.  There are cocktail specials as well, though I haven't dabbled in those.\n\nHappy hour food is just as good.  Our go-to appetizers\/small plates are the black tip shark bites (love 'em so much I make my husband order his own so that I don't have to share) and the really chunky and substantial spinach and artichoke dip (comes with loads of tortilla chips and seasoned crackers).\n\nSummer days are fading fast.  I recommend heading to Walnut Grill for Happy Hour on the patio before it's too late.
