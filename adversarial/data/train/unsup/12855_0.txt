I'm giving this poor rating based on the take out order I received today. I placed an order for pork bone soup for takeout (not the first time I've ordered this either in store or take home). \n\nI expected a fresh meal, straight from the kitchen but what I got was a not so fresh meal, straight from the freezer. \n\nThey gave me an order of pre made instant pork bone soup - something you can purchase from the grocery store. On the lid, it clearly says \"keep frozen until ready to eat\" then gives the instruction of microwaving it for 5 minutes for a quick and easy meal. A photo of it has been uploaded.\n\nI cannot believe I was charged full price for something they sell at the supermarket in the frozen aisle. This exact product has been spotted in the supermarket on sale for $3!!!!\n\nVery disappointed. Now wondering if they even cook their own food for their in restaurant patrons or if they just microwave these instant meals.
