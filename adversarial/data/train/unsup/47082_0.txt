LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!! It's was my second time here everything has been delicious. My friends and I sat at the bar to have dinner and the bartender, Yvonne, was a complete pleasure! She gave great food recommendations. The grilled octopus, braised lamb bolognese, and cod entree. Only downfall...the weather. I've been waiting to come here and enjoy the beautiful outdoor patio. Oh well, I'll just have to come back again!!
