I came here to meet a friend for coffee and catch up, the geeky decorations dragged me in and I loved the place. \nOrdered a Serenity blended (duh firefly is the best) and was blown away what a great drink. \nMy only complaint, I need a location closer to home and if you are looking for staff I would be more than happy to apply.
