This club does not even deserve a one star. If I had a choice they would get negative stars. We paid for bottle service and was kicked out as soon as we're done with our liquor. Sorry that we know how to kick it and can handle our liquor. Worst place ever. Do not go here. Security is rude and unprofessional, leaving a bad taste for the state of Arizona. It totally killed our buzz and ruin our friend's bachelorette.
