My gosh I love this place.\n\nHonestly, one of my favorite places to go with a group of friends or a date night with my husband. Always fantastic food and service. Host\/Hostess is super friendly. Beer, well, yeah, the beer is outstanding and the selection is unreal. Great patio for starry nights. Loud, fun vibe!\n\nOnly con is the bathroom situation...waiting sucks. \n\nGo eat, drink and be very merry!
