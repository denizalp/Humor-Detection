7\/30\/2018 Food was good cat fish was very good shrimps to small, steak was good salad was okay desert very good over all food was a 6 out of 10 the help was wonderful. The price was WAYYY to expensive 3 adults $56.76. Won't be back at that price when I can go to sunset station buffet for the same amount of adults for $46.00. I spoke to a few people that live around the Corner like we do and they all said the same thing, way to expensive for basic food...one stars only because after eating I had the ruNNSS...
