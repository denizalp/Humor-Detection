Martinis were great but great martinis alone aren't good enough.  A restaurant at this caliber should have bartenders that make eye contact and engage in good conversation..  Service was absolutely terrible.   The bartender never made eye contact.  Dropped off the menu and never came back.  Unfortunately we are very social people.  Our friends and colleagues respect and ask for our opinions.  We can not in good conscious recommend this place.  D- at best
