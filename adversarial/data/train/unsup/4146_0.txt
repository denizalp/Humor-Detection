Five Stars to the MAX!\n\nHonestly, I don't understand how someone could have a bad food experience here... really.\n\nMy wife and I have been awaiting the opening of this great American food pub for a couple months now since we saw the sign come up. After seeing they had their hours on the front door this morning I couldn't wait to try the new local haunt. Harvey American Public House for lunch. Let's go!\n\nAt first entry, it looks a little to barren for stuff hanging on the walls and struggles I think to to identify itself, I mean, who the heck is Harvey and how do I identify what the restaurant food style is unless I read between the lines... American and Public or \"Pub\" we're all I could go by.\n\nAmbiance, not so good. It's adorned with the oddest type of comical art and fixtures that say \"I want to be a TGIF\" but I'm still growing up. I would make it a \"Cafe Bike\" type theme but hey, that's what I \"saw\" not at all what I \"experienced\" so let's get to it...\n\nI ordered the Port Roast Beef Sandwich and my wife had the Chicken Strips. They were both awesome an the portion size was very large. \nMy sandwich bun was soft and fresh and toasted perfectly.The roast beef was perfectly sliced thin enough and layered so that it would just come apart in your mouth. No gristly fat at ALL!!! I can't tell you how many roast beef sandwiches I have bitten into that I couldn't bite off because of all the marbling in the beef. The fries were beautifully seasoned, fresh cut and perfectly fried.\n\nMy wife's chicken was freshly beer battered and not just some kind of out of the freezer serve it up style chicken, this was fresh chicken breast with the batter laid on at the pub. They were awesome, no funky chewy tendons like typical chicken strips have .Like somebody actually cared enough to insure those things were absent.\n\nI would highly recommend this place and stick with it as it evolves into something really extraordinary. I intend to visit here as a regular because the food is great and they have a nice looking beer selection and I love beer :0)\n\nLastly, one last thing they really should focus on... the wait staff. Our server was so sweet and eager to please but she vanished at the tail end because she was pulled away from serving to tend to some internal duties. Here's a word of advice. If you serve food, serve food. If you want to work the kitchen, work the kitchen, but don't do both. It's a disservice to your restaurant and eventually your customer.\n\nIn spite of those short comings, I still give it a 5 star because it has the potential to be a \"great\" restaurant and the food is stellar.\n\nGo try it folks and support your local business owners.\n\n~Stew~
