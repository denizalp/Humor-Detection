Magically Delicious Appetizers\n\nI'm sure most will assume I'm delusional but in my under-experienced noodle connoisseur opinion I am not impressed with my soup at Magic Noodle. I ordered a spicy vegetarian soup due to my dietary restrictions and the flavor was under-whelming. No spice, no flavor, a few overcooked pieces of bok choy and an excessive amount of mushrooms. #HashtagBoring\n\nHouse Special Pancakes (Vege) $7.50 deliciousness. \nSweet and Sour Black Fungus (Mushroom) Salad $4.95 texture was pretty interesting but the salad is yummy! \nSweet & Sour Cucumber $4.95 generous portion. I love pickled veggies and these really hit the spot!!\n\nProbably wont be back but if you believe in Magic give this noodle joint a try!!!
