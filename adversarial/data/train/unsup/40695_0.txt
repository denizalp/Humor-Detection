Best pizza in the Old Port and in addition to that they are totally inexpensive. Bonus! Being a pizza connoseur and freshly back from a trip to Italy, I'm convinced that the price to quality ratio of these pizzas are the best in the city- that's definitely rare in this fancy area of town.\n\nThe sauce is spot on San Marzano, the mozzarella is definitely fresh, the crust could be a bit more bubbly but I'm not complaining. They are close to the real deal which is hard to find here. \n\nThe decor is new and modern and I can't help but think this place would be ideal for a nice family dinner or date. Definitely my go to take out place from now on.
