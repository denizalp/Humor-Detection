Party like a rock star at Hard Rock, on the budget of a mere groupie!\n\nAlexis Park is a short jaywalk across the street from Hard Rock.  The smallest room at AP (2 twin beds) is actually HUGE, and includes a couch, kitchenette (small fridge\/freezer\/microwave), and a makeshift bar.  Some of the larger suites (all rooms are \"suites\" at Alexis Park) are two stories, and include the aforementioned amenities, as well as a jacuzzi tub.  Either (or any for that matter) room style is a steal for the price, and unbelievably spacious and condo-like.\n\nKeep in mind:\n\n-  There is no casino attached to AP.\n-  AP is a mile or two off the strip.\n-  Although not in poor shape, AP could definitely use some touch ups\/remodeling here and there.  I would not say it's luxurious by any measure, but certainly acceptable.\n-  You'll be signing an actual \"no party\" agreement upon check in.  :P\n\nAll in all, Alexis Park surprised me.  Pleasantly.  These might be the cheapest suites in Vegas!  If Hard Rock is sold out, or maybe out of your budget, I'd definitely recommend AP!\n\nTip: Don't forget to check for their \"free breakfast\" promo on their website.  I didn't wake up early (or stay up late) enough to make it on time to try it, but it doesn't hurt to at least get the vouchers just in case.
