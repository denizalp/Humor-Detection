My son and I enjoy going out monthly for our preferred meal of the day and have tried all the breakfast restaurants around town and this is our favourite! We always ask for Sue and of all the breakfast waitresses we have met she is like sunshine in the morning beginning with remembering us, some of the things we usually order and her general sunny disposition as there's nothing she won't accommodate from the HP sauce to extra napkins and sour cream and ordering my sons eggs based sunny side up and their little chubbies! This place has the Best potato pancakes I have ever had! I love that they leave the pot of coffee on the table and there isn't a waitress walking around the restaurant topping up your coffee. Prices are good, place is reasonably clean, people are friendly and parking is good. See you next month Sue!
