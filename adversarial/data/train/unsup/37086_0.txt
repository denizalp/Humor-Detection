I got my nails done here by Debbie. I rarely get my nails done at a salon because I usually do my own and  I hate paying someone to do a worse job than I can do for free. But when I heard of Shellac, I decided to give it a try since I'm very hard on a manicure. They usually don't last a day. Just in shaping and prepping my nails, I was impressed. Then she did a wonderful job of the color application. I didn't feel awkward to chat either. She's very personable. The job was so nice and was stronger than my unpolished regular nails. Worth every penny. Bring cash though, apparently she is contracted. She made a believer out of a non-believer!
