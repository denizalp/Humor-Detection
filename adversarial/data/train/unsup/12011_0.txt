I came to Istanbul Grill with high expectations because of the near perfect ratings on Yelp.  I love turkish food, and really enjoy trying new restaurants so it has been on my list of places to try for a while now. \n\nI tried the Iskender with yogurt entree and my dining companion had Chef's special chicken. We were not at all impressed with the chicken dish. It was very rich and creamy but it lacked flavor. I did enjoy iskender, and thought that the gyro meat was flavorful and of better quality than most gyro meat. The meat was plentiful and both dishes were of decent portions. We also enjoyed the fresh baked bread that was served to us before the entrees came out. \n\nI would like to come back and try another dish, but I probably won't because of the high prices. Most meat dishes were in the $15-$20 range which is a bit much especially at lunch. They do have a lunch menu but it is not offered on weekends, so our lunch was around $40 for two of us and we didn't have drinks or appetizers. Downtown, maybe, but Avon? It just is placed in an odd location for such prices. \n\nThe service was quick and friendly. Parking was not as issue as this place is in a strip shopping center with plenty of space.
