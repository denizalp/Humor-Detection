The prices here were maybe 20% above what seemed reasonable to me.\n\nAs I perused the menu I noted that the steak sandwich, at $17 was a full ten bucks less than the filet.  \nTrying to exercise some small modicum of restraint, that's what I ordered.\nI was asked how I'd like it done, (medium rare) and they were happy to swap a salad for the fries. \nI rode the bike, so no booze for me,,,iced tea. \nPerhaps the best one I've had in recollection,  Honest to G#d full-brewed tea, not the caramel colored water served most places.  Kudos on that one Mr Inn!\n\nThe lady got a filet, (she apparently didn't share my fiscal inclinations), with mashed potatoes and salad, lady junior got a delmonico and baked potato and salad.\nThe salads were nice. \nIce cold fresh mixed greens cukes tomatoes onion  croutons and while they had no light dressings they did have oil and vinegar, so that worked for me.\n\nThe meal portions were immense!\n\nThe mashed potatoes were served in a huge ramekin on the side and there were easily enough for two and maybe three people.\n \nThe filet was fine, ( I got a taste!)  \n\nA somewhat overcooked medium-rare, but the filet is a very forgiving cut, so it was somewhat of a non-issue,  \nI didn't try the mashed, but the lady seemed to enjoy them.  \n\nLady junior's delmonico was avidly received and her baked potato was the size of my forearm!  \nLarge enough that had I been served the same spud, I would have required at least three and probably four of the comparatively diminutive sour cream cups  that accompanied the potato.  \nBut lady junior seemed satisfied, (it might have been the dirty martinis plying her compatibility!)\n  \nThat just leaves my steak sandwich.\n\nIt was open-faced, served on Texas toast, smothered in sauteed onions and peppers, ....so far terrific.\nI chose to knife and fork this bad boy, and it was definitely the right choice. \n\nIt was a sirloin, yeah a cheaper cut, bound to be a bit chewy, but there are ways to tenderize this cut, just get one at a national chain, (e.g. Outback or Longhorn).\n\nHappily it was served with Crocodile Dundee's personal knife.\n\nYet the knife was inadequate to the task. \n\nDespite the size, blade-sharpness and serrations I must have spent a full five minutes just trying to cut the first bite!\n\nThere were times when trying to trim the gristle\/fat rimming the cut that I just had to take a break to gather myself to continue the assault.\nA number of bites had to be deftly returned to the fork and flung into the bushes around the patio as they just did not succumb to continued chewing regardless the length of time invested.\n\nThe Clearview Inn gets a lifetime achievement award here for absolutely the  toughest, chewiest, most inedible cut of meat I have EVER been served  in ANY restaurant in ANY country or State!\nAnd I've eaten my own cooking!!!!\nIt was shift change at the Clearview, so no inquiry was made by either waitress as to the suitability of our entrees.  \nWhether this was done of knowing the likely reply, or just that inquiry falling through the cracks, who knows?\nTo add to the evening, there is, apparently a resident drunk who invites himself to whatever table his wobbly feet ferret him, where he insinuates himself into conversation, and one's evening etc whether welcomed or not.\nIt was fairly obvious from the reactions of the waitresses that he engages in these behaviors regularly.\nWhy he isn't taken aside by management and his behavior corralled is beyond my understanding.\nLucky us,,, he chose our table.\nThe price I pay for having two attractive ladies at the table!\nThere were some amusing moments, like the time he rose and polished off his Makers Mark with a backwards tilt of his head and momentarily lost equilibrium!\nTeetering for what seemed like 30 seconds between upright and floored.\nUnfortunately he found his balance and recovered.\nThe lady's entrees were OK, mine bordered on totally inedible, service was great, portions were enormous, and the unwanted company was obnoxious.
