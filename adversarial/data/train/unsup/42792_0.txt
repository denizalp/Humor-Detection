This store is very trendy and the layout is nice.  I was in the mall shopping and decided to stop here. They have a wide range of styles to choose from. The downfall is I feel this store is a tad overpriced. The same bodysuit I purchased In another store for 10.00 they had for 30.00. There dresses are expensive also for just overall basic dresses. I just bought a really cute choker here which was reasonably priced. I Cant say for sure if I'll be back to this store.
