There are some many restaurants in the area, I let my friend choose.  The good of the experience.  The soup and salad meal was tasty and the right price.  They came with chips and salsa, my preggo friend adored.  The not so good: our waiter was very slow.  It took him time to come up to me and get my drink order.  It took longer to get our food.  He completely disappeared and I practically had to chase after him to get the check.  \n\nI haven't been to Chili's since they closed the one on Green Valley near Sunset (my 'hood), and now I remember why we go elsewhere.
