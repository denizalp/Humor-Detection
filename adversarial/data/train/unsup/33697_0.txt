Bash Pepper just completed our roof--tear-off and shingles for a 2900 square foot house in Urbana.  The job was completed in two days, and they did a fantastic job on both the roof and the clean-up.  We're very impressed with both.  We see no damage to gutters or siding, and I've only picked up two nails and a few stray pieces of cellophone.  This is the second time they have done our roof, and I know from experience that they stand behind their work.  I highly recommend them.
