July 22, 2017\n\nFellow animal lovers! Please help AZ Animal Welfare League's Healing Paws expand by donating funds to procure the following \"Medical Equipment vital for our expansion and life saving efforts:\n\n$9940 - Wet Dental Table - Dental issues can lead to life threatening cases. Our $700 cap on dental services provides an affordable option for the public and those on fixed income to keep their animal healthy and save thousands of dollars.\n$3431 - Surgery Table - Another table will allow AAWL to expand our ability to perform vital surgeries to the shelter and public by almost 33%.\n$2140 - Pulse Oximeters (4): Necessary for monitoring our animals during the 4,000+ surgeries we perform each year.\n$560 - Surgical Packs (20): The number of surgeries we perform each day is set by the number of surgery packs available.\n$520 - Water Blanket Pumps (4): As staff and volunteers care for our animals after surgery, water blanket pumps circulate warm water ensuring the safest and most comfortable recovery.\n$150 - Anesthesia Machine kits (6): The safety of our animals is paramount, and these kits ensure their safety at their most vulnerable time.\n$50 - Stethoscopes (8): Every cough, limp, and wimper is investigated fully by our trained staff, working in the kennels and clinic with their equipment to provide the best treatment option.\"\n\nI took the above list off of the recent e-newsletter I opened today.\n\nI visited the shelter yesterday to drop off a large box and plastic bag full of flannel bedding, other bedsheets, blankets, and used clothing not fit to donate to UMOM (women's shelter for battered women and their children), and then I checked out a few of the kittens and young cats. I plan to visit more often to donate more items AND spend time with the felines.
