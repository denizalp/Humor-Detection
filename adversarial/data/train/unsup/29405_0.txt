I called in and scheduled an appointment on the same day. I spoke with Lindsey and her customer service was fantastic! She was helpful in explaining the process and products but was not at all pushy with purchasing. It was my first time being waxed, \noverall it wasn't as painful as I expected. Lindsey made it more comfortable by being very talkative and engaging.  Honestly, it was not nearly as awkward as I thought it would be. I got my under arms and Brazilian done and am loving the results! I did purchase the roll on exfoliant just to help prevent any ingrown hairs from coming up. So far my skin has responded well to it. Looking forward to my next appointment :)
