From the moment I first walked into this library, I've been completely in love. Huge ceiling arches, bright sunlight streaming through floor to ceiling windows in the new section, and many many places to curl up with a book or some homework. Sold.\n\nThis library is so magical (I'm almost convinced that faeries are involved) that the computers know which books you're checking out without the involvement of a single human. (i know about rif technology, but prefer to maintain my faerie hypothesis).
