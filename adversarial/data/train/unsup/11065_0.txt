I just love it here. It's consistently delicious with friendly service. That's really what makes 5 stars for me. I come here at least on a monthly basis, if not more. It's just such a great environment, I can't help myself!\n\nIt's all vegan... And while I'm not vegan myself, it doesn't matter! You don't need meat or dairy to have excellent food in my opinion. Everything I've had has been fantastic. I especially love 5 different \"mezze\" dishes you can pick 1, 3 or all 6 of for a deal. You can go with either hummus, fried cauliflower, baba ghanouj, fried tomatoes, falafel or labneh. I always get the cauli (it comes with this insanely good dipping sauce), baba and fried tomatoes. It also comes with fresh pita bread to dip or just eat plain. Great for sharing or if you want to try a variety of items. \n\nI also love the Falafel salad. While the falafel is good, I also can't get enough of the pickled turnips, which they actually sell sometimes as a grab and go item. You also can't go wrong with any of their homemade sodas or coffee bar drinks. Every time I come I can't just get a plain water. I have to get the featured drink. \n\nI still haven't trued their brunch, which I'm excited to check out sometime. I have NO doubt it will be sometime soon. Speaking of which, you should also get there soon...
