I will admit to always enjoying the thrill of finding my way into a hidden bar, of knowing the trick or figuring it out, of that moment of transition from one room to an inner sanctum where (in the fiction of contemporary Speakeasys that reference darker times) the rules outside do not apply. This particular Speakeasy, though named a little literally, is a treat on McGill. The staff and owners are so enthusiastic and nice and happy to be doing what they are doing. Walking through the sandwich shop to open the fridge door is appropriately sneaky, and the bar behind is dim and beautifully designed. \n\nMy whiskey sour was excellent, strong and tasty and served with love and thoughtfulness about what I was craving that day. I shared a great big plate with various cheeses and things - I don't remember what all was on it but it was delicious. In general, a lovely addition to the area.
