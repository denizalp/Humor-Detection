We got takeout from Federick yesterday night. \nI had the Chicken Pakora, Kan Shue Green Beans, and the Shrimp Fried Rice.\n\nDespite some of the reviews that attracted me to the restaurant, I wasn't blow away by the pakora, which seemed to be one of the more popular items. Don't get me wrong though, it was all quite tasty and I enjoyed it thoroughly, but I'm not itching to take anyone there.\n\nThe portions and the price are great! The chicken fried rice for $6.50 is enough for a meal by itself, and the quality of the food seemed pretty high. Other prices: Chicken Pakora ($8.50), Kan Shue Green Beans ($7.5)\n\n\"A-OK\" captures it perfectly.
