Ugh, lunch today was no bueno.\n\nFWIW, I've been for breakfast twice and those were decent, I got the eggs Benedict and something else that I don't remember. The point is, they were good enough and certainly not  terrible, which is why the sad, soggy, oily mess of a not-a-single tomato, lettuce, onion  or garnish cafe hamburger with salty, cold fries  that I had for lunch today prompted this review.  Far be it from me to turn my nose up at french fries but it had to be done.
