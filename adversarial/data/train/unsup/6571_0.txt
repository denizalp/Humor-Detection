Hands down best tacos in the city!\n\nFresh homemade tortillas blanketing your choice of beef, chicken, pork, shrimp or tongue at $3 a piece!  I will take 6 thank you!  The shrimp was my favorite but the other options are no slouches either.\n\nTake style place and home to the most authentic tasting tacos I have had in a while!\n\nLoves it!
