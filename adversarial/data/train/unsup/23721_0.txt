I like this place. I fought myself over this one, but overall good experience.\n\nI was the only person eating there other than a couple that seemed to be in distress. You're eating overstuffed burritos and valentine's day is coming up. Get with the program and stop being selfish.  \n\nI had a barbacoa burrito. I like the even distribution of burrito content. This is not a Boolean equation however, many places fail miserably to achieve. Not Ohio City burrito. The burrito is rolled well with the foil. nicely contoured to burrito dimensions, I want to learn more about how they practice and compete amongst staff. This seems like quality control disguised as fun. I was tempted to try one of those exotic flavored sodas I have been hearing so much about. Next time.
