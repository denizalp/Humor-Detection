I would have given RM Seafood 5 stars if it wasn't for the poor service by the wait staff.  Plus our food took too long to arrive.  \n\nHowever, once it did, I was very impressed.  I tend to steer away from rolls but I went with my gut and had probably the yummiest sushi roll ever!  Though now I can't remember the name of it.  Something with \"kick\" in the dish name and it did pack some punch.  We also had the fish sandwich with some of the best steak fries I've ever had.\n\nWe finished the meal with a wonton filled with bacon, banana and chocolate with honey to dip into.  Heavy but delicious.  I never thought I'd see bacon on the dessert menu but it worked! \n\nI'd definitely go again and highly recommend it for the food.  Just wish the waiter was on top of his game.
