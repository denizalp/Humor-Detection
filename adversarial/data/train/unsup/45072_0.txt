Great service.  Our server was awesome.  Very friend and attentive.\n\nFood:  It was pretty good.  The collards were really good; the meatloaf didn't have a really great flavor, but it wasn't bad.  The country fried steak is good.  Mashed potatoes were a bit dry.  Overall it was a good meal and I'd return.
