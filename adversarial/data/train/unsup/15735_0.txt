Will not come to this location at night by myself. Not because I am scared but because I am smart and know better. \n\nIt's just in a parking lot by it self surround by a bunch of vacant buildings and a night it can be a bit dark. There can sometimes be sketchy characters just hanging out in front, so just be aware of your surroundings.\n\nOnce inside, the store is always clean and bright. The employees are okay and will help if requested but will not go out of their way to help or assist you.\n\nThe pharmacy is mostly right on and you don't have to wait long except for those occasions when you have a script for a bottle that is pre-filled and they just have to make your label.
