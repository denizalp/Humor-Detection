Torn between three and four stars: I wanted to be a fan, and I like the extensive menu of healthy options, but the actual execution and service are just A-OK. Come here to get specialized meals to meet your macros, whether you're going protein-heavy, low-carb, packing in the veggies, or all of the above, all in a modern, lounge-style setting. \n\nThe SHRDD Salad (lots of quinoa, chicken, eggs, and veggies) and Skinny Bitch Bowl (with salmon, quinoa, veggies, and a cilantro sauce, a little basic) are some go-to items for me, often purchased in advance for weekday lunches and very filling. One of these days I'll try their protein pancakes.\n\nI do appreciate that they have a ton of condiments (hot sauces, liquid aminos, etc) to dial up the spice or flavor in your dish.
