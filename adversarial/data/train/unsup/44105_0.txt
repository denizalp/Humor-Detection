A must-visit if you are a visitor and enjoy...well you know. Staff was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable (and the people helping me were trainees!). Selection was insane. Quality was better than other locations I had visited in the area. Perfedct spot for gifts, for you or a loved one, and I was able to walk away with a few new tidbits or 420-hacks. I will definitely visit again as Toronto is an amazing city and this is an amazing shop.
