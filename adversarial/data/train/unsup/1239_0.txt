When it comes to delivery, NYPD is one of the first places I think of. Their marinara sauce is delicious and I always get it with an app of crispy zucchini. This location cuts them thick the way I likes 'em. Every bite gives a juicy bit of zucchini as opposed to other places where you're insulted with a slice of wilted vegetable inside a thick coating of greasy breading.\n\nOnce, I ventured to try a different app - the garlic knots. The bread was way too soft and doughy for my tastes. I did not likey and couldn't even swallow the first bite. I hope they've changed since then. \n\nMy fave: the eggplant. They are generous with it. I can get it on a hero, with pasta, or as a pizza topping. How cool is that? Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of the pizza dough because it can never handle all the sauce and toppings I request, but I will eat it once in a while - except as leftovers. Nah, uh uh bruh. \n\nSometimes the salads are disappointing, because you may get unfresh greens but I usually pick those out and continue eating.\n\nDesserts cakes are good, but the lemon cake is a bit small for $4.99 and it's not much cake in comparison to the frosting. The only other dessert I've tried was the cookie - once, will never ask for it on a delivery order again because I couldn't send it back. I will only try it again if I'm dining in.
