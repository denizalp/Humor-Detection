A couple of weeks after my excellent experience with Coulter Nissan, they called me back to say they'd found a better finance deal for me.  I went back to the dealership yesterday, Jennifer in the finance department was so personable and nice.  My interest rate went from 9% to 7.9%, and they took a year off, so my car will be paid off in 5 years now.  Everyone at this dealership is incredibly nice, they took such good care of me.
