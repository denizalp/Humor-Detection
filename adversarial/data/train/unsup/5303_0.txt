No, no, no. NO.\n\nI went to see Superman recently. The showing was at 10:45 or something late like that. Anyways, I had THE WORST movie experience EVER. Let me tell you about it.\n\nI brought about 10 people with me and we were REALLY excited about the movie. There was a girl sitting two seats away from me with a 3 or 4 year old little girl. (at 10:45pm? Come on) The little girl was running around the theater, going up to everyone and talking, dropping things, spilling drinks, etc... So the mom gives her an iPad and turns the volume up really loud... It's crazy bright and loud and SUPER distracting. It kept yelling out \"STRAWBERRY\" \"GOOD JOB!\" \"DINOSAUR!\" Guys, this went on the ENTIRE MOVIE! But this wasn't my main problem... Kids are kids and you really can't blame Westgate for bad parents and rowdy kids.\n\nI got up to go tell someone that something needed to be done, I couldn't take anymore.  I WALKED AROUND FOR 30 MINUTES AND DIDN'T FIND ONE PERSON TO TALK TO! I was banging on doors that said \"employees only\", I was yelling asking if anyone was around... No one was anywhere!\nAfter 30 minutes a security guard comes around (I felt SO safe... not) and was able to track someone down.\n\nWhen I told the manager that there were incredibly distracting people in the theater and asked for my money back, she got really annoyed and gave me a free pass.\n\nThat was my problem... There was no one around for way too long and then they got mad at ME... They had an opportunity to fix a bad experience and only made it worse.\n\nI will never come back here again. Screw Westgate. NEVER AGAIN!\n\nOh and $6 for a kids popcorn? Are you kidding me?!
