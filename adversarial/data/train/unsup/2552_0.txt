The closest option for things like screws, fuses, and filters I simply cannot deal with the layout of Home Depot - everything where it seems like it should be, but nothing easy to find on first glance...and rarely a clerk in site.  Far be it for me to assume knowledge of the hardware world, but it just seems odd to me that it takes 3 dudes to mix a can of paint, cut a key, or anything short of lifting a giant appliance or piece of lumber but it seems as though these folks operate on the buddy system at all times.
