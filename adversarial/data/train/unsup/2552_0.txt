I'm moved to write a limerick instead of a haiku...this time:)\n   \n     We stopped at the Jungle at lunchtime,\n\n     The Hummus and Schwarma were both fine,\n\n     The food is all scrumptious,\n\n     The service is bumptious,\n\n     All in all, though, we had a good time:)\n\nI just noticed that I wrote an entire limerick without a single reference to Nantucket...a first for me:)\n\nA solid 4 stars:)
