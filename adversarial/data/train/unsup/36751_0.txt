Solid lunch spot! Met up with some fellow yelpers for lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  There were so many things on the menu that I wanted to try that I had a hard time narrowing it down to the grilled cheese sandwich.  But it was delicious, topped with avocado... yum!  This is a small place so get there a little early for lunch, it was packed by noon.   Once the weather cools down there is a lot more space on the patio so that should help.  I'll definitely be back, thanks Amy H and Jon H for telling me about it!
