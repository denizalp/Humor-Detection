I'm embarrassingly late to this review... But here it is!\n\nThis was such a fun event. I was thrilled to be able to get some last minute guest invites. Jess D, Sammy J, Andy F and I arrived right on time and were greeted with a drink voucher and menu by the always lovely Nikki and Cedric (Tupelo Honey's fantastic manager). I was really excited about the mimosa, and asked the bartender to surprise me with the ingredients - I was not disappointed. Andy got the Bloody Mary that made for a meal - everything from peppers to shrimp went into that thing! \n\nI kept an eye on the food table as we mingled and finally waited for the food to be brought out. Yelpers don't mess around, and neither does Tupelo. I managed to grab a piece of the French toast, and it was well worth the wait.\n\nEverything from the food to drinks was a great sampling of the \"Moonrise brunch\", I love the idea - and I'll definitely be back for more. I loved being able to see everyone and catch up a bit! I can't wait to go back and get a full order of that French toast, and a mimosa or three.
