Beyond all the locally made clothing, art and jewelry, Dupp&swat hosts some banging party series like \"I'm an Artist, Dammit\" where you get exposed to some (surprise) talented emerging musicians. Then there's the owner, herself a nationally in-demand stylist who can casually guide you toward looking like the superhero you are on the inside. This is one of the best boutiques (and best-kept secrets) in Charlotte for a reason.
