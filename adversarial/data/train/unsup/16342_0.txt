I've been going to Vegas buffets since I've been five years old and I haven't seen anything quite like Wicked Spoon.  It's a special buffet with inspired entrees and I hope that they will be able to maintain their creativity as time passes.\n\nWhat I love about this place is that they had entrees like skirt steak w\/ apple fennel salad and chimichurri sauce.  They had Bone Marrow, Pork Loin, and Korean short ribs.  They had a mac and cheese bar.  They offered Louisiana grits with shrimp and braised short ribs.  I loved that they put out entrees that you'd find on the menus of legit restaurants.  I love that they plate those dishes on individual sized plates.  I love that I was able to get these dishes seconds after they were on the grill.  I thought that the entrees were really good and enjoyed them a lot.\n\nUnfortunately, seafood wasn't on the same level as the meats and their desserts are a little overrated.  The desserts were lacking a little in the flavor department.  They did have chocolate covered strawberries and gelato and chocolate covered marshmallows, but I was a little underwhelmed with them.\n\nAlso...if you're the type of person that likes to load up on crab legs and shrimp when you go to buffets, then this place isn't for you either.  These items are plated on individually sized portions, so that's how they handle portion control.  \n\nI definitely would come back because I loved the entrees I had.  I really enjoyed this buffet and I think it's worth trying, especially since it's $10 cheaper than Bellagio and Wynn on the weekends.
