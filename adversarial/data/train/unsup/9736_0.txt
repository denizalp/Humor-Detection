I got 2 free tickets to go and ride the cramped elevator up the Eiffel Tower at the Paris.  It was completely worth it since I didn't have to pay a dime.  If I had to pay the $10 dollars, I don't think it would have been so great.  So, definitely look for the coupons!  \n\nOn nights that it is busy, I can only imagine the wait being really long since they can only fit a few people in the elevators at a time.  Once you get up there, depending on the season, it can be freaken hot!  We were up there around 7:15pm and it was still dry heat.  After a quick look of the strip and the lights, I was ready to go back down.  Then, it was another wait in an unorganized line to ride the same small elevator down.  This is just one of those things that you do once, and never need to do it again.  Oh, and I saw a few people that didn't realize they had a fear of heights until they got up there.  Pretty entertaining to watch them freak out.
