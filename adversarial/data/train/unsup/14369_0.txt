I love Olympic Plaza. Mostly because it reminds me that the Olympics took place here at one point, which then warmly reminds me of one of my favorite \"I need some cheering up\" movies:\n\nCool Runnings!\n\nEvents happen here throughout the year, but Olympic Plaza is great during the summer for cooling off hot feet, or ice skating with homies when Calgary turns in to Winterfell. There's also a hot dog truck that's here, rain or shine that serves generous amounts of delicious food (with a veggie option!) for a mere $5 or less. \n\nFeel the rhythm! Feel the rhyme! Get on up...
