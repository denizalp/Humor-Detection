Vicky! And Bob the Garden guy. We love them. We have been coming here for years at least 1-2 times weekly and consistently get amazing service every single time!  I have no idea why the bad reviews. We love Bob the garden guy his super knowledge of everything plants trees, shrubs, and bushes is superior!! I swear he needs to have his own show. And then there is Vicky she is so fun and as well very knowledgeable about everything. We  enjoy coming here where we are greeted by her on many occasions. Home Depot you have two gems here and I consider you very lucky to have them as employees. We also get amazing service from every other staff member we have encountered. Your really rocking it
