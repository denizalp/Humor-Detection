It's hard to start a restaurant.   You require a wide range of specialized kitchen machinery, top line ingredients and well-educated culinary artists.\n\nOr you just buy a deep fryer and toss everything in it.\n\nCzehoski falls into the second category.\n\nAt first, you're seduced by the well-written menu complete with hipster typefaces and broadsheet paper.    But then you realize that the whole \"never judge a book by it's cover\" adage falls true.   \n\nFood here is absolutely terrible.    It's a deep fried mess served on enriched white bread with little thought given to presentation or substance.   \n\nThe crab cakes sounded wonderful.  An eloquently written blurb about the sourcing of these blue crab morsels of deliciousness suckered me in.  I felt ready to explore the sea, harpoon in hand.   Oh, how I long for the smell of saltwater and the rush of the ocean.  Call me Ishmael!   At ten dollars a pop, this was completely embarrassing.   I have to admit that I was looking on the plate for remnants of the filet-o-fish wrapper that they clearly repackaged as crab cakes.   \n\nMy beautiful dining companion chose to go for the \"Smoked Bean Dip\" which definitely had the smoked flavor that they described in the menu.  In fact, it was like eating beans out of an ashtray.  Equally horrid.\n\nThe word Quinoa seems to be the buzzword of our times.    I'm used to it meaning a type of whole-grain.  Clearly there's another interpretation of the word that refers to deep fried grizzle slop.    The Quinoa-based veggie burger was just that.  1500 calories of batter, breading and bastardization.    At one point, I turned to my dining companion and just made disgusted muppet faces.\n\nSure, the drinks were good.  Sure, the piano player was a nice touch.  Sure, there was eye-candy and hipster types.\n\nBut the service was horribly slow, the water constantly awaited refilling, and the food was absolutely atrociously horrible.
