When I stepped inside Spoon & Fork, I would never have know that it serves a Japanese+Thai AYCE menu. \n\nThe cushioned armchair, the table with wine glass setting and cloth napkins, the white table cloth., the dimmed lighting with candles on each table.. all scream for more high end AL la carte experience.. and I will be romanced... \n\nHowever, nothing really romantic about going out to have AYCE on a date!! The sole purpose of AYCE for some are to eat and eat and eat and get your money worth.. and try to eat everything on the menu. So the concentration will be on the food.... not on how gorgeous I look!\n\nDinner AYCE ($24.99) is great value, We ended up trying:\n\n- Thai Curry Pumpkin Soup\/ Miso Soup\n- California Salad\/Smoked Duck Sala\/Wakame Salad\/Thai Mango Salad\n- Thai Mussels\/Chicken & Beef Satay\/Takoyaki\/Tempura\/Thai Dumplings\n- Sashimi: Butter Fish\/Salmon\/White Tuna\/Unagi\/Octopus\/Surf Clam\n- Maki\/Rolls: Spicy Tuna Roll\/Unagi Roll\n- Bangkok Street Style Pad Thai\/Thai Spicy Noodle\n- Red Curry Fish and Shrimp\n- Taminard Shrimp\n- Mixed Vegetables\n\nMost of the items we ordered were all surprisingly good.... especially the Thai Mussels in Tom Yum.. fresh big mussels and the Tom Yum was flavoured without being spicy (My friends does not do spicy!) We ended up having 3 orders of that!! Skip Chicken and Beef Satay, those were pre made and have been siting under a heat lamp for a long time.. dry and chewy...\n\nSurprisingly as Spoon and Forks has its roots originally from being a Thai and Viet restaurant, their Thai dishes are not as good..at least for the ones I ordered. Pad Thai for sure was a disappointment as it is just overly saucy and sour. \n\nServices is not bad! We got the food we ordered quickly..though we have to ask a few times to have our water glasses to be filled.\n\nThough the deco scream chic and classy, but nothing really classy about all these people ordering from AYCE. Servers were all running around delivering plates and plates of food and busy cleaning up the tables... More like a scene from Diner Dash... and it is not a easy job to keep all of us hungry diners happy!!\n\nI still think Japanese and Thai food doesn't mix even in an AYCE context. I tried really hard to eat all those mild and delicate tasting Japanese offerings first; Sashimi.... then move on slowly to the more intense taste: Thai offering... \n\nSpoon & Fork is One of the best AYCE restaurant I have been. I highly recommend coming here if you are into AYCE as you will leave happy and full. But if you want high quality Japanese or Thai Cuisine.. you might need to go elsewhere and pay a lot more for that!\n\nI am too eyeing their Lunch Specials ($15.99)!\n\n*Since no dessert is included in the AYCE menu, S&P does have a separate dessert menu.. or you can take your date to somewhere nice and romantic for dessert and night cap and leave this chaotic AYCE scene behind.. and redeem yourself!
