Horrible restaurant service. Tofu is very bland and silken. The server rushed throughout our visit and never said hi. After I asked him to change the dish twice (because the tofu was not enjoyable) I ordered vegetable fried rice that was also bland. I needed to put both hot sauce and soy sauce in to give it flavor. My friend ordered mushroom soup and she also had a bad experience.\n\nNot very affordable. The cost is not worth the food or service.
