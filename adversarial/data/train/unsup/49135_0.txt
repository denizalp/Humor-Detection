VERY Authentic Chinese food without the cost of going to China. Good food and the server was great. I'm still on the side of 'Americanized' Chinese food so I don't try everything they would have but what I did have was excellent. If you are in to authentic Americanized Chinese food I would absolutely go there. Even if you wanted to experiment a little they know how to recommend their food to us non-chinese folks. Great taste.
