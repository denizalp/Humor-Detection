Great customer service at this location. Cliff in the cafe is so great and super friendly. We shop here all the time and he knows what we are going  to order as soon as he sees us. He just goes above and beyond for the guests. Also, had several issues with online ordering and the staff at customer service has always been so helpful in resolving these issues.
