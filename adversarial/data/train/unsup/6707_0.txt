People who may pop in here probably don't check the reviews unfortunately.  \n\nMy experience, pay the $20 for two drinks with no cover, that's fine.  Not sure how much a drink is after that but had no desire to stay after two drinks.  Walking in, the dance floor is just one long strip, you have to crank your neck up to see what's going on.  After I sat down, I was instantly pulled by my arm by one of the strippers who grabbed one of my beers and I grabbed the other.  She was pulling on me good didn't say one thing to me, my other friends were near the sofas they do the lap dances, at a table.  I asked one of them if they bought me a dance and he just smiled so I assumed he did.  She got on top of me and asked her if someone paid for this because she wasn't my first choice and I wasn't ready for a dance with just sitting down not even having a sip of a drink.  She said it's only $25, I said no I didn't agree to this nor did I want it, she got up by shoving me and having some choice words for me.  I couldn't believe the treatment.  So my story rings true to the other's on here.  I continually to walk past her if I went to the bathroom or saw my other friends near the stage, she mouthed off to me and gave me dirty looks, it was bizarre.  I did end up getting a dance towards the end because one of the women did show some initiative in to getting to know the guy.  With 30 to 45 seconds left in my dance she wouldn't shut up about up selling me to VIP and telling me how wet she is and what she could do.  Once again, I can't express how low class this place is and how they operate, they should be investigated.  One of the worst ran businesses I've ever been to.
