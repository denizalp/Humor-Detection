I hate to give less than excellent reviews and the Super Farm Market deserves 5 stars for their fresh produce at fair prices.  Love it!\n\nOn the flip side, some of the vendors are most definitely price gouging.  Especially the honey vendor.  Tonight a woman brought $20 for what she usually buys from him and learned tonight that he raised his prices.  His price for a jar of Peach Butter is $8.50 and tonight apparently some of his $8.50 products went up to $10.   I offered to pay the difference for her as he obviously wasn't going to back down for her even though she was a loyal customer.\n\nI don't know if the prices are a reflection of being located in Gilbert where it is assumed people are well off or not but I can't go back to any farmers market in Gilbert until the price gouging ends.  Can I afford it?  Maybe - but I won't pay someone for their lack of integrity.
