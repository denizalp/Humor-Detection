I enjoy my monthly gel mani time. It really helps me relax and my nails look pretty.\n\nI was overdue for my mani and trying to schedule all week and finally was able to get away from my office yesterday. It truly helped me breeze from hectic week.\n\nI called from my office to see if they have any opening available, happened to have one available right away, came here during lunch hour. They are located next to the Vietnamese restaurant near the Herkins theater. Plenty of parking including one hour parking right in front of the store.\n\nMy tech was super friendly and knowledgeable, she was able to tell brand and color of my previous polish by looking at them. She explained to me which brand polish is made to last longer and I should always request that.\n\nThey just received new fall colors selection, I picked a few I liked and she picked what looks the best for my skin color. \n\nLove the design she did for my ring fingers too. I just said something pretty and the follower is what she did for me.\n\nHand massage was so thorough, really enjoyed relaxing time here. Five mins from my office, great price here, can't wait to come back for pedi soon.
