Came at 7pm on a Sunday, and was surprised because there was plenty of seating! \n.\nThe food is super tasty as usual.  New items we got that was worth trying again was : \n - pan fried pork intestine\n - kimchi udon\n - deep fried squid cartilage \n - hama neck (fish neck, and a perfect substantial filler to compliment the meal)\n\nThere were some things that were much different that warranted my 3 star review.  The service was LONG. I sat there waiting for my friend to show for at least 15 mins and no one came to ask me about drinks or anything. Perhaps they were waiting for the other party.  \n\nWe also didn't the hot towels like others. And not only did our waitress forget our water a few times, but took forever to come back and get our order.  Our food also too forever to arrive. We were sitting for a good 20 mins after ordering before something came. (They told me I could only sit for 2 hrs, and we didn't leave until about 9pm!)\n\nThe sake tiramirsu was still really yummy, but a much smaller piece than the first time (about half the size of the picture). \n\n$30 for per person this time. \n\nOkay, this is an aside, but I really have to comment on the one family beside us, that instead of asking us what we were eating, would point very obviously and started making speculations, as if we weren't there. I found it rude, and found it funny when they came to the conclusion it was the Salmon Sashimi when it was the beef sashimi. \nIt was the same woman that would use her chopsticks and her hands while eating, and take the ginger with her hand and put it on the fish and then use her chopsticks to eat it. Her son liked using the chopsticks on the table like it was a drum.  \n\nAlso wanted to mention that i also heard one group which some girl loudly said \"THIS IS A CHINESE RESTAURANT\"... philistines.\n\nupdate: came back recently just for dessert. found the service much faster sitting at the communal tables and being able to flag them down
