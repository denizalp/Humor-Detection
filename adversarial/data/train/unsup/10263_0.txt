We went in at approx. 12:48am on New Year's Eve.  We were hungry and not much was open, so we went to our neighborhood IHOP.  We were thrilled to see that there were only 4 other tables of customers in the entire restaurant when we arrived.  I went in planning to tip $10 minimum cause I feel sorry for people that have to work on new year's eve, but the horrible service we got from Tekeyah drastically reduced that amount by the end of our meal  :-(  \nDespite there being few customers, she kept disappearing into the kitchen and not coming out.  We ordered cheese sticks and wanted some ranch dressing, but she never came back, so we eventually ate them without dipping sauce just so they wouldn't get cold and be ruined.  Then she brought our food, which was fine, but she wouldn't refill our drinks.  When we point blank asked her towards the end of our meal, she handed us our check and actually said \"when you're finished you can take this to the register...\"  her tone and demeanor said clearly that she had no intention of bringing us a refill, and though we waited as she brought drinks for another table beside us, she acted as if we were invisible... solidifying her actions and attitude that we'd eaten and she was finished with us and we were invited to leave.  We did leave, and she got a whopping 10% tip on our $34.24 bill  ($3.40)  Someone needs to inform Miss. Tekeyah that service = tips, even on a holiday.  Perhaps she should rethink her chosen profession as she's clearly not good at it and her failures and shortcomings reflect quite poorly on IHOP as a result.\n\n***UPDATE:***    I emailed IHOP.com the same review that I posted here at yelp.com and I got a response that said I'd hear from a representative within \"3-5 business days\".  When that time passed, I replied to the email asking for someone to contact me.  I got an email from a Robbie Turner (Area Supervisor) that thanked me for my time.  Again- no dialog about my complaint, no apology.  I replied to Robbie's email asking who to contact to actually have a discussion...  it's been 3 business days...  again, no response.  \nI'm going to take that as my answer that IHOP doesn't give a dam# about their customers or what they have to say.  I won't be back and I'll be telling everyone that will listen!!\n\n***UPDATE:***   I spoke to Robbie Turner today and the first topic out of his mouth was that he'd checked the video of our visit.  Again- no apology.  He started the conversation off in a defensive manner.  When I explained to him that the fuel that has kept me so irritated was that his canned responses were inadequate for the situation, he finally offered an apology...  an empty apology, but at least it was one.  I asked him if he'd spoken with the server and he said that he did, but didn't elaborate on the outcome of that conversation which I'd have liked to hear.  The conversation reached an impass resulting in him asking me what he could do to make me happy...  at that moment I realized that there was nothing he could do to salvage my business as this whole experience has completely eradicated my desire to eat at IHOP again.  \nWell done Tekeyah and well done Mr. Turner; you've successfully run off people that are overweight, eat out every meal and have disposable income...  all the marketing in the world can't turn that around.
