I thought I found the perfect chinese spot when I noticed they had a drive thru as I walked in. I ordered the general tso's tofu crispy with brown rice. They gave me a kids size meal for about $9 bucks and called it a large, if that wasn't bad enough I tasted pork, chicken and crab in a vegetarian meal. I'm a vegetarian but I wasn't always one. I've only been one for the past 11 years, before that I ate meat all the time. I know what meat tastes like and I don't appreciate getting it mixed in with my tofu vegeterian dish. I hope I don't get sick now since my body isn't used to breaking down meat anymore. I found myself trying to finish my dish but fighting with it since my girl got it for me and I didn't want to make her feel like she wasted her money. She only treated me cause I dont like trying out new chinese restaurants cause they usually are pretty bad in Arizona just like this one. So far the only good one I've found is Dragon Express over on Alma School. I must have spit out my food like 5 times while I was eating, basically everytime I tasted some type of meat. To top it all off I noticed a nice sized dead spider just hanging out next to the push here for water button on the soda machine and of course I was getting water. Horrible experience, never coming here again. I'm sticking to Dragon Express. Oh yeah my girl wasn't upset at me not liking my dish cause she didn't like hers either. She had the General Tso's chicken and said the sauce tasted like pure syrup. Worst general tso's ever. Avoid this place at all costs.
