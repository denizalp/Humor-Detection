Dr. Lori and her staff we amazing with my 6yr old twins. They both had fillings and crowns and were a little restless and nervous. I didn't want them sedated and Dr. Lori and her staff we great in taking care of my twins and working quickly and efficiently to get the work done. I was nervous in going due to the reviews but was highly recommended by my neighbor. I do believe Dr. Lori should communicate with the parents a little more and not so much the staff ( even though staff is great in communicating ). She does do good work and I made sure they did the work needed. I would recommend Dr Lori and her staff.
