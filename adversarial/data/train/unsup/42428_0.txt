I have eaten here several times, and the food has always been excellent!  Tonight we had the wonton soup and spring rolls, followed by a chicken and green bean dinner.  Everything was great except the chicken and green beans, which was a bit too salty.  It seemed that some new staff was being trained, and there were a few minor goofs, including a water spill across the table, but the poor waitress couldn't apologize enough and cleaned everything up.\n\nOverall, a good experience, but not as good as past visits.
