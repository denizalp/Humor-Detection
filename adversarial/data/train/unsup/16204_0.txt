Nobu rocks. This is a Michelin starred restaurant serving Japanese cuisine in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. Located in the Nobu Hotel section of the Caesars Palace Resort, this restaurant is high class and haute cuisine worthy of a full rating.\n\nPlease do not expect this to be a sushi bar. This is an insult to the chefs who include sushi as part of an amazing experience. This is advanced food with impressive and unique interpretations of Japanese cuisine. The wonderful staff will enjoy working with you to design a great night.\n\nI had the signature omakase paired with the Nobu Sake flight. Nobu has their own sake breweries. My meal was a sensual experience in the classic sense with a combination of visual and taste experiences beyond description.\n\nMy meal included the classics. Hand roll. Sashimi Salad. Yellowtail with jalape√±o. Miso glazed Cod. Sizzling Beef tenderloin. But the sum is so much more than the parts. Paired with the top notch Sake, the various courses created a wonderful dinner experience worthy of the steep yet reasonable price.\n\nThe only drawbacks are minor. Some casino noise can overpower the occasional tourist group wanting gourmet spicy tuna rolls with their merlot. It takes a long time for dinner too, so plan at least two hours for a relaxed experience.\n\nI am so glad I experienced Nobu in Las Vegas. It was simply amazing to experience the many dishes offered and the overall feel and help of the staff. They actually were happy that I was happy making it a great night. Highly recommended and worth it!
