Yes Yes Yes....i know, this room is super nice,....but my friend's boyfriend paid $1600 per night on a Wednesday and Thursday.  I seriously can't imagine spending that amount of money for a room though, you know what i mean?? You could definitely find an extremely nice room at another hotel for about $300 per night on a weekday, right? My girlfriend just met this guy...maybe he's trying to impress her but i surely didn't approve of her encouraging him in getting this room. These rooms are good if you like gadgets, TV's, and staying in your room all day.  To tell you the truth, I'd rather spend my money on good food, entertainment, and good alcohol.  Nonetheless, I did have a good time here.  The only complaint I have is that there is too much walking involved at this hotel.  To get anywhere in this hotel takes at least 10-15 minutes....
