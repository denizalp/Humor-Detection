After some post-work shopping, I felt the need to do some stretching.  I looked online for some late evening yoga classes and I came across a level 1 Hatha class starting at 8:50 pm.\n\nWith my trusty Passport To Prana pass in my pocket, I headed to their College street location.\n\nIt's a large and very pretty space.  High ceilings and big windows, it reminded a bit of the ballroom in Disney's Beauty and the Beast (I have no idea why).\n\nRosie was the instructor and she was awesome.\nVery friendly and she took the time to talk to each one of her students before class.  If there were newbies (such as myself), she took her time explaining the flows.  It was good to stand close to her because it's a big space and she had a quiet voice.\n\nOnce the class started, it was all yogi business.  Fast movements and challenging holds.  A lot of work on balance.\n\nThe only downside about the studio was the overwhelming smell of W Burger Bar next door.  I love burgers.  Just not when I need to inhale deeply.\nHow are you supposed to clear your head? I just kept picturing burgers, beer, and fries.\n\nBurger....Mmmm.... er...\nI mean Yoga.
