I really recommend the services of Brad. I think he is an excellent agent with a lot of knowledge. There was never a question that he didn't know the answer to. When we were starting the process, he took the time to meet with me and listen to my wants before he started to send me listings. He took the time to give me the pros and cons of the properties that I liked and educated me on a good purchase. Once our offer was accepted, we had a lot of difficulties on the lender side. Brad worked as my advocate and used his connections to give me options. He smothed things over with the sellers and the other agent to make sure this process happend. You will not be dissatisfied with the services of Brad.
