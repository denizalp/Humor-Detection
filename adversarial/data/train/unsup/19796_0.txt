Just moved to Laveen from Moon Valley and needed to find a nail salon.  Came here and was pleasantly surprised- the interior of the salon is immaculate and the workers were friendly.  Unfortunately though, I received a HORRIBLE gel manicure from one of the female techs and won't be returning.  I asked to have my nails cut- they weren't.  The tech roughly buffed my nails and then with my own nail \"dust\" all over my hands and nails whips out the polish like she wants to start painting my nails.  I asked her, \"shouldn't I wash my hands first?\" She told me no.  I replied to her, \" I'm going to get up and wash my hands\" and I did.  At the sink I inspected my nails and they were jagged and crooked.  Upon my return to the tech's chair I politely asked her to continue buffing my nails and to fix all of the uneven tips\/edges.  Surprisingly, she was totally cool with it and did as I asked.  I didn't get to wash my hands again though, so on went the nail polish with all of my nail dust all over my hands.  The tech did an awful job painting my nails.  Three days later and I still have gel polish on my cuticles and the sides of my nail beds.  What really made me upset though was that after I was done drying under the UV light, the tech started filing my nails again!  Um, shouldn't you have done that BEFORE you painted them?!?  Ugh. Two stars for the cleanliness and kindness of the techs...one star for the service provided.  My search for a decent nail salon in Laveen continues.
