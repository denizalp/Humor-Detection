Defalco's is heaven. It's debatable whether I was more sad to move away from Scottsdale because of leaving my friends, or Defalco's.  \n\nI could honestly eat here every day of my life.  Their sub sandwiches are like a meat party in your mouth.  Their noodles are creamy and delicious.  All of their salads and antipasti are unreal. \n\nAlways a long line and it's kind of overwhelming inside but it is so so so worth the wait!
