My favorite go to spot whenever I am craving Hawaiian food or mool nyeung myun! Service is ALWAYS fast and friendly. Unlike other Hawaiian restaurants, they owners are always providing fresh, homemade banchaan (usually kim chee) that is always delicious!\n\nI get the cold Korean buckwheat noodles whenever I come here during the summer. Nothing beats the savory, tart, spicey cold broth while slurping down chewy noodles! Definitely the best version I have found in \nVegas.
