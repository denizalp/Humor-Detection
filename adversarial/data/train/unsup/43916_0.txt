Before we went into our movie, I reported to security that I observed two people wondering around aimlessly (literally upstairs and downstairs) w\/ backpacks. One quickly left when he saw me reporting him. Evidently, it's AMC policy that they don't search backpacks. WTH???  #SeeSomethingSaySomething
