This is a very cool and offbeat coffee house. There is a large roaster inside and several different kinds of green coffee beans - I can only imagine how amazing it would be to be there when they are roasting. For the very fact that they roast in-house, you should definitely check them out.\n\nI tried their iced coffee, which they told me was cold brewed, but it just wasn't great. Hoping that maybe it was just an off day.
