The very best I can say about this place is that if you're looking for a deep fried heart attack you're sure to find it here.\n\nOver-salted, deep fried and virtually tasteless. I'm offended that they charged me for this food. It's bland, oily and the shells are deep fried for so long that if you're not careful you'll cut your mouth wide open. Ouch.\n\nTo add insult to injury it's way overpriced for the quality of food that you get. A real tacqueria wouldn't charge almost $4 for a measly carne asada taco. They just wouldn't. Theirs consists of chewy meat and some flimsy corn tortillas. Not worth it.\n\nThe people here are abrupt. Not rude, per se, but just not friendly. I'm sure there's a language barrier, just don't go here looking for friends is all I'm saying.\n\nI'd definitely try a different taco place unless you're so raging drunk that the only thing that will absorb the alcohol so you don't end up on the bathroom floor is greasy mexican food, then still don't go here. No, seriously, just lay on the cold tiles and it will be fine tomorrow. \n\nAvoid.
