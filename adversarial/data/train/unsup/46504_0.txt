Went to several mattress stores prior to deciding to check out Ashley Furniture in search of a mattress that would work for both me and my wife. When we walked into Ashley, Jett was waiting near the front and I thought,  great..another used car salesman. But I was wrong..Jett welcomed us, discussed what we were looking for and then left us alone after showing us to the mattresses and bringing us some pillows so that we could get the \"full experience\". He checked in on us periodically to offer tips and answer questions but was not pushy at all. I think that is the main reason we chose to purchase not only a mattress but an adjustable bed frame from Ashley. Jett was knowledgeable and friendly and urged us to be sure to pick something that we would be happy with in the long run..and to take time to think it through. I have already been recommending him to friends because a non-pushy,  knowledgeable sales person is hard to come by! Aside from that,  we love our new bed and are happy that Jett helped steer us toward a mattress that was a great price and awesome quality.
