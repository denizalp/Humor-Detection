The girth of these rolls are something to be admired. I had to meet the man behind the monstrous rice log. The man the myth, the legend, Jay is the owner and chef. But don't try to fit his roll in your mouth all at once. It took me a couple of attempts before I got it all. \n\nI first thought I could handle two. I was SO wrong. Luckily the owner\/server, May, talked me out of one of them. I'm so glad she did. I wouldn't have a place to put it.\n\nMay gave me so much attention and was so tender. With her husband Jay the two of them satisfied my every need.\n\nI didn't know what to expect but this experience with May and Jay ignited a passion deep inside me. \n\nI'll be back for more and I'll be bringing friends.
