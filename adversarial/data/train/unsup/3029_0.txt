Husband and I stopped in around 4:00 on a Sunday to try a beer or two while visiting Phoenix. Two employees were inside, one of whom was talking\/flirting with a patron at the only occupied table inside (one other table was occupied outside). Neither employee in any way acknowledged either of us. We reviewed the beer leaf for a minute or two, still with no acknowledgement from any of the staff, no hello, no invitation to find a seat etc. felt extremely pretentious, and not our scene. We left and were much happier and better-accommodated at Four Peaks.
