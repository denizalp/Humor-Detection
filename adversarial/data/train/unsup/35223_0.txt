If you get a seat on the patio the view of the lake is beautiful!! But when my crab cake burger and my friend's beef burger are $21, we expect the quality of bun not be a cheap quality Dempster bun you get at No Frills. It should be a home made bun or at least from a bakery if you're paying that kind of $$. You can get a better burger for way cheaper at other burger joints.
