After researching USAA Preferred Providers on Yelp, I chose New Look Collision and am so happy I did!  From the very beginning I had a feeling of confidence that I had made the right choice. Vince, my Estimator, was amazing at listening to my concerns, as well as, communicating the progress of the work being done.  His tone was always welcoming and cheerful if I would need to speak to him directly.  The whole process was positive and my car now looks as good as new!  Thank you Vince and New Look!
