So excited that this place finally opened. It has been saying coming soon for quite some time now. Then I noticed the doors where finally open so over for lunch I came. My coworker who was with me chickened out and went next door to the corporate Chinese place. I am glad I decided to come here. It was really good.\nThe menu is pretty simple. Not that much on it and the prices are fairly reasonable. They have fish tacos, of course, and shrimp tacos. I decided to go with the Full Taco per the recommendation of the cashier. The Full Taco has fish and shrimp on a corn tortilla with a stuffed yellow pepper. The cheese in the pepper proceeds to melt all over the inside of the taco and makes it that much better.\nBefore you take you food to go or sit down to eat make sure you hit up the toppings bar. With all kinds of salsa and other goodies to jazz up your taco a little.\nI also got fries and a drink. I did get two tacos which with the fries turned out to be more than enough. The total was $11 but with just one taco, fries and a drink I think it would be more in line with any other fast food place.\nThe fries are really good. They fry them in the batter and wow. It makes them so much better than your regular fries.\nThe restaurant is very clean and modern with TV screens of menu boards. The minor complaint is that the soda fountain is behind the counter. So they have to serve you your soda which slows things down just a little. But it is just a minor thing and not a big deal at all.\nSince this place is so close to work and so good I will definitely be back. Probably regularly.
