First, I want to express my admiration for all of the performers. They clearly have talent and put alot of effort into their work. However, it wasn't good enough to give Zarkana a passing grade. I have only seen one other Cirque show live (The Beatles Love) so i may not be an expert but I still know what I like. While on cruises, they have cirque-like shows and you're not really paying for the show so you dont expect perfection. Zarkana was definitely not free and definitely not perfect. The juggler was juggling up a flight of stairs and stopped a few steps from the top. Two of the trapeze acrobats fell into the net and had to climb back up to continue. One of the circle apparatus walkers nearly tripped while jump rope skipping at the top of the arc. Now, I may seem like I am nitpicking but, its their job. They are to be the cream of the crop, no? \n\nThe Beatles Love show had something resembling a storyline. In some ways this was good, tying together acts thru music. Zarkana was much more fragmented and the only constant was the inevitable cirque clowns. Every single show has to have them roaming thru the crowd in the beginning? Am I the only one who thinks they can do without them? Cirque du Soleil was initially french (I'll assume this from the name) But are all of the performers still french\/European? Do we need the characters jabbering nonsense?\n\nAnother aspect that I can do without is the, for lack of a better phrase, the Opera singer. The Beatles Love had, wait for it, Beatles Music! In English! Zarkana has a poor woman who has to sing the entire time while no one is paying attention to her. Imagine, \n\"Where do you work?\" \n\"Oh I am in a las vegas cirque show!\"\n\"Oh really? What do you do? Juggle? Trapeze? Do you fly around the stage?\"\n\"No I sing during the performances!\"\n\"Oh! Oooohhh... \"\n\nSo ya, the clowns come out in between setting up the next apparatus. They are obnoxious and somehow some audience members were laughing. Most likely inebriated. There was one act where a very limber man in a loose white shirt contorted on a glass floor and the whole time i was thinking, Whens he going to DO something but no he just did alot of yoga stretches...\n\nBut there were some Pros. They did actually allow cameras as long as there was no flash. This was pretty cool. My camera was crappy at taking low light pictures but its about time they stop being pretentious about people wanting a visual souvenir when we pay 100$+ a ticket.\n\nThis last bit is a call for Vegas to maybe slow down with the Cirque craze. Aria is a brand new-ish casino and I was expecting something spectacular. I feel like with all the cirque shows in Vegas, the talent is far too spread out. There are at least 8 shows that I know of. 'O' At the bellagio has been around for 17 years! Vegas isnt it time to look elsewhere?
