What a comfortably pleasing experience.  This Chinese cuisine restaurant has a classy elegant feel with a bright and cheery decor.  Floor to ceiling windows makes the center lakefront-view more breathtaking.  Allowing us to have front row seating to the magnificent fountains, which was truly a sight to see.   \n\nBeing greeted and seated immediately, already started the evening off right.  Once seated, Paul our waiter for the evening, came over just as the napkins were drawn.  The whole night he was professional, informative, accommodating, attentive, with a nice touch of humor.  Thanks Paul.\n\nOn to the food. \n\n*Appetizers:\n- Lobster Two Ways (the Oriental Salad was excellent, Wok-Fried with Egg Whites was just ok, lobster was almost non-existent.)\n- Crispy Eggplant with seaweed pork floss (giggity).  Couldn't stop at one.  Had to dust the bowl. \n\n*Main course:\n- Braised Kobe Ribs(good but not great. Meat was a little on the dry side. Loved the WU XI sauce though) \n- Chilean Sea Bass (perfect) \n\n*Dessert:\n- Red Bean and Green Tea Ice Cream Mochi along w\/ tea cakes.  Can't go wrong with this dish. Especially if you're craving Mochi. \n- Lastly, recommended by Paul, Mango Bamboo. Check out the pic.  It is as good as it looks.  \n\nLooking forward to the next visit. \n\n*Recommended
