First off - I love the programs this school offers. The teachers are absolutely fantastic. The office staff? Not so much. If you like advisors switching once a week, not telling you the full truth and waiting until the last minute to tell you that you have to take more classes (thus pushing back your graduation date), then this is the school for you. I have never experienced such disorganization, inadequacy, flakiness, unreliability, and irritation in my entire life. I'm glad I took the programs I liked the most, because I refuse to go there for anything else again.
