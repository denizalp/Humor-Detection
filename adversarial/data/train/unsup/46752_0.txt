My eggs were nicely poached. Breaking the yolk was a pure pleasure to watch the yellow goodness slowly spill over. The flavors were ordinary. Looks like what it tastes. The waitress was a bit slow due to this place being super busy during lunch time but regardless, she was very friendly and attentive. My smoothie was fresh, thick, and balanced.\n\nIf you're living around the area of Saint-Laurent, you should give this place a try.
