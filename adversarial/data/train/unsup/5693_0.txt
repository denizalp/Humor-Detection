As a web developer I must say that my favorite part about this place might be their online presence - they have an impressively functional and well-designed website.\n\nThe service was okay.  I have a tendency to get the same foods over and over, so I tried to break that by getting a pork schnitzel sandwich (afterall, this is a SCHNITZEL house, and if anything, it's really fun to say).  It was HUGE!  The food was satisfactory - I think I'd like to come back in the summer sometime because they have something of an indoor patio that was lit up with string lighting.  It looked like an area to have a relaxing time with some drinks and good friends!
