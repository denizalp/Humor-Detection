MacAlpine's Soda Fountain is all right be me....\n\nIt's a cool place to meet up with some friends for an ice cream treat, soda or float.  The food is OK, not great but not bad either.  The service can be a hit and miss depending on who you get as a server and when you go.  The ice cream and soda treats are fantastic!  The ambiance ~ the soda bar is cool and there are two side rooms full of antiques that are for sale everywhere.  \n\nI've had their Reuben which was A-OK and on my last trip I sampled their burger and chips with chocolate shank which was shank-a-licious!!   My burger was cooked well, but nothing fancy.  I also had a small salad which was nice but not memorable.  My shake was really good and left an indelible impression on my taste buds. \n\nSide note: \"Give the dude out front holding the sign \"We are open for Lunch\" a break and let him come inside where it's a little cooler.  Use a curbside sign instead.\n\nIf you're a germ-o-phobe, like me that doesn't like dirty old things hanging everywhere especially where you are eating, you need to get past that and give MacAlpine's Soda Fountain a try.
