A new Gelato joint in town!   I find it conveniently located in  Town Square so once shopping is done or for an in between treat this makes for a perfect stop.\n\nFirst I am a huge fan of Amarena Cherries, so having this as one of their many flavors was exciting news for me.   \n\nThe flavors are very enjoyable and the consistency is probably some of the smoothest I have tried.   And what a way to food travel by enjoying their delicious waffle cones straight from Paris.   \n\nIf you order a cone, you will get to see them try to build a rose, which looks incredibly difficult but definitely eye pleasing. Plus you mix match flavors regardless of size.\n\nI will say the only issue I find with this design is that it makes for inconsistency with the portion size of your cone, but selecting a cone is still the way to go. \n\nThey also offer waffles, macarons, specialty coffees, and twenty something flavors of hot chocolate. \n\nThe pricing I will say is a little up there but I can say for the quality it is definitely worth it.\n\nService has also been very pleasant so far. I will definitely keep coming back to try all of their delicious offerings.
