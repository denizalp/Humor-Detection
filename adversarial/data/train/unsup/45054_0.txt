We hosted a group of 20 family and friends to a wonderful dinner at Milos. Everyone we take here loves the experience of tasty Greek cuisine and selecting something special from the fish market. We had some terrific Greek and Italian wines to compliment the meal. \nAs always the service was perfect....another great Milos experience. Thank you!!
