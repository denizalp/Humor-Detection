Mark was absolutely incredible. He gave me a fast estimate on Yelp and I booked him to come out to lay porcelain tile in a laundry room, some baseboard and a custom tile backsplash. Mark was on time every day on the job and went above and beyond to ensure that my wife and I loved the end product. Although there was more work than initially anticipated, Mark did not raise his quoted estimate. Mark kept our home in an impeccably clean condition throughout the job. Mark also quickly scheduled an additional couple of days to come back at our convenience to finish the job perfectly. Mark was a true professional with his workmanship, reliability and trustworthiness. He told me he is usually booked out a couple of weeks, but it was well worth the wait for us, and we look forward to having him back again as the need arises. Thanks Mark!
