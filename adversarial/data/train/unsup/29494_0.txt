4 1\/2 stars!\n\nWhat a little gem! You will not be dissapointed with luch here!\n\nMe, Dad, and Hubs stopped in for lunch after a recomendation from a coworker.  It is a silly little place.  It's really more of a shop\/deli counter but there are about 10-12 tables to dine at too.  I don't know a whoel lot about Argentinian food, but I do know they do empanadas and beef!\n\nWe started with two empanadas, 1 beef, and 1 spinach.  Flaky, flavorful and tasty.  Beef was the winner.  They serve crusty bread with a nice dish of chimmichurri.  Excellent. The bread is crunchy so you can really soak up at that oily garlicky herby goodness.  We all chose a hot sandwich served with french fries.  I had a delectable sandwich (can't remember the name) but denoted with a star as a favorite.  It was steak, ham, provolone, fried egg, lettuce and tomatoes on a baguette.  It was awesome.  Dad had the choripan.  It was an argentinian sausage sliced on a baguette with chimmichurri.  Very good, and a bargain at only $6.50 for a 9' sandwich with a pile of fries.  My husband had the sweetbread sandwich.  He was in heaven.  Swears they were the best sweetbreads he has ever had.  He raved....5 stars!!!  He also tried the local brew - Quilmes - he wasn;t a fan but understood how they must go down easy on a hot day.  We took home some sandwich halves and extra fries.  Bill was $44 for 2 sodas, 2 beers, 2 empanadas, and 3 sandwiches with leftovers for later.\n\nDelicious!! Server was super cute, nice, helpful, and friendly too! We will definitely go back for a killer lunch.
