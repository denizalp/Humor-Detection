I just went here for lunch with Chris C. (who reviewed it earlier), and had the same Le Parisien burger he mentioned in his review. Every bit of it was mouthwateringly fantastic, and the even the fries were perfect. It's a good thing I have solid willpower or I would have come out of there with some serious pastries as well, because they looked delicious.\n\nIt's obvious these guys put a *lot* of work and passion into their food, and the prices are surprisingly low. Don't let their understated location fool you -- there's some world-class eating happening here.
