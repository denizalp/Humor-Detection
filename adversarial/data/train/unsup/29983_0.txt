Do not let appearances fool you. Yes, it is a divey looking bar, but they have delicious food and for a decent price!!! I ordered the chicken strips which came with fries. The chicken had a really nice crunchy outside and the inside was super juicy. My bf ordered the garlic parmesan patty melt. The patty's are all made with a little bit of red wine. I wasn't sure if I could taste the wine or not but it was delicious either way. The patty melt had a garlic parmesan sauce on it with bacon, onions, and grilled mushrooms. The mushrooms were strange. They had really good flavor but we're a little rubbery in texture. I wasn't really sure what that was about. However, eating the patty melt as a complete sandwich with everything in a bite was great! I felt like it tasted like it should sit really heavy in my stomach but it didn't and that was a nice surprise. They have food specials Monday through Friday and happy hour 3-6.
