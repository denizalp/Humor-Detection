This was my rebound dinner after a horrible first experience at Whataburger.\nWhat-a-difference.\n\nThe carne asada and pollo were delicious but the barbacoa was kinda eh.\n\nAnd what was the story with the salsas? They're set out on the three shelves of a rolling cart, some low enough that you have to crouch down to serve yourself. I realize that you guys were near closing but that's just too close to the floor for my taste.\n\nThe salsa thing puts 'em at risk for loosing a star but after such horrible food at Whataburger this place tasted like food from Heaven.\n\n2013 #3 \/ 365
