Really cool place to catch an acoustic set and grab a coffee. The menu is small but is vegan friendly. The prices aren't bad at all. If I had one complaint it would be the fact that they no longer sell beer. I know it couldn't have been a great seller but it was one of the few quiet spots in Lakewood to grab a brew and use wifi.
