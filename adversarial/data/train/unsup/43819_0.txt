Dirty restaurant, food okay. We went on a Monday evening so you'd assume they didn't have too busy a day, if there's any excuse. Trash and food pieces all over the floors, tables not cleared and bathrooms had paper towels on the floors. The food was okay (beer was flat) but unfortunately the food quality was overshadowed by the dirtiness of the restaurant. There are better local Mexican food places that are cleaner, probably cheaper and better service.
