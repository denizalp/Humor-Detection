Have rented an open trailer here on occasion to move things within town.  It's fine but such a hassle for a $19 rental.  It ends up costing me around 40 minutes.  They ask so many questions for the rental and it's just a cheap trailer.  I can rent a $20,000 new car with much less hassle.  \n\nRecently a friend of mine reserved a truck from this location and when she showed up for pickup, she was told she had to go get it from a location several miles away.  When she argued that she had a reservation their response was \"yes, we keep the reservation here, but not the vehicle - you have to go somewhere else to get the truck\".  Seriously???  So now our time is wasted and we have to pay for the extra mileage to go to a more distant location. \n\nThe only reason I gave them 2 starts is because there really isn't a better trailer option that I'm aware of.
