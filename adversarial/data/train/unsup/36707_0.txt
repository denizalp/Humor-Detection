This is one of my favorite coffee shop stops in the Madison area. It's the best Barriques, in my opinion. Spacious and a large wine selection. Love the Wall of 100 and that I can pick up some fun gifty stuff and Chemex filters. Beer selection, though not huge, is decent. Staff are also pretty consistently knowledgeable and efficient here. \n\nTheir coffee has improved throughout the years, and I think they've hit their stride. It might not be my favorite Madison roaster, but they do it well. I used to love their scones, but in the last year or so, they seem softer and sometimes underbaked. Not sure what's changed. I love their inexpensive little breakfast sandwich because that bun is so yeasty flavored. I've also enjoyed their mediterranean salad and soups. \n\nThe tables are good for plunking down with your laptop. You aren't jammed in too close to other tables, and there are sufficient outlets. Also, a nice fireplace and couches for a lazy read. However, it does get loud in here. Lots of groups of people meeting\/socializing and there isn't much sound absorption for those espresso machines. So, bring your headphones or a high tolerance for noise.
