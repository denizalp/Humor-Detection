This is my first review on Yelp. I've been a major consumer of the reviews and restaurant suggestions from Yelp so figured it was time to start contributing.\n\nI just walked into this place off the street - I was hungry! I ordered the steak burrito bowl (don't remember the name on the menu) to stay.\n\nI was disappointed! They were stingy with the meat, a few tiny pieces of dry steak. I'm assuming this is because I walked in post lunch rush hour, but still not an excuse. The plate was \"buffed\" up with abnormal amounts of whipped bean paste of som sorts, rice and lettuce.\n\nI wouldn't come here. again, can't speak for the lunch service, most restaurants fast food places not named McDonalds tend to ration the food so as to not have waste.
