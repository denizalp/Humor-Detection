Have been to this Moe's a few times.  It is the usual friendly Welcome to Moe's reception.  The line usually moves relatively fast.  Food is the standard Moe's.  Pretty good Queso, chips, burritos.  Have learned that I am not a big fan of Moe's carnitas, the seasoning seems to be a little off to me, so I order one of the other options.  There is usually one person cleaning tables and helping out in the seating area, which is good so it is kept relatively clean.
