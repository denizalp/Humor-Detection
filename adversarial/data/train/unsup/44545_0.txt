Could not find egg roll or Philippine lumpia wrappers.  We asked store clerk who pointed us to Aisle 2 (he seemed unhappy).  Still no wrappers.  Why would an Asian store like this be without egg roll or lumpia wrapper?  It's like a Latino market without tortillas.  This market has unfriendly staff who did not care.  Meckong took care of us.  Will not shop here anymore.
