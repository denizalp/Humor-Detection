Let me say first of all that I have not personally stayed at this resort; however, this is where I used to make a reservation for the owners of the company that I previously worked for, so I did get to see the hotel's rooms, the common areas, and the restaurant. \n\nMy guests LOVED this place! \n\nThe food is good. The hotel is clean. The service is impeccable. \n\nNo, it isn't inexpensive.\n\nI highly recommend this resort for out of town visitors who demand a really NICE place for the night.
