With the lusty reputation of being a man's paradise where you get served your heart's desire of meat on a stick, cut with swords I couldn't help but try it once in my lifetime.\n\nDECOR :\n\nYou can't help but notice huge fake palm trees outside of the place. I was baffled. I didn't know Brazil was known for its palm trees. Welp! You learn something new every day.\n\nThis is a huge restaurant with no booths and large tables everywhere. The ambiance is warm and inviting with an impressive modern bar.\n\nLastly, I assume I can consider the belly dancers decor as I have no where else to put them in this review. It was scandalous! You try to enjoy a meal then some saucy ladies show up in silks and shake their valuables in your face as you try to focus on eating your meat.\n\nThe nerve.\n\n\nFOOD :\n\nI took \"The Turnstile\" experience which consists of 10 kinds of meats grilled on charcoal the Brazilian way. The selection is \"at heart's content\". The meats are pork sausages, chicken legs, turkey breast with bacon, roast pork, top sirloin, strip sirloin, flat sirloin, contre-filet, rib of beef, rib steak, filet mignon, lamb, etc. served with salad, sweet potatoes, rice and saut√©ed mushrooms. \n\nObviously, when I ordered this my eyes were popping out of my head. Will this be an experience like none other?\n\nSadly, everyone likes their meat a bit different and if you like your meat being burnt on the outside and raw-ish on the inside, you'll find a lot of cuts \"meating your desire\". If this is the Brazilian way, I'm afraid of visiting another Brazilian restaurant.\n\nFurthermore, what's up with the salt cooks? Hey cooks! A little salt. Don't marinate the meat in it!\n\n\"I can't even taste the meat at this point!\" I exclaimed angrily as I chew some overly salty burnt on the outside filet mignon while not being bothered by the gooey pinkness of the inside. I paid $30 for this meal and I will EAT IT.\n\nNone of the meats stood out being excellent. They ranged from bad to good with most leaning on the mediocre side of the scale.\n\nThe mushrooms and grilled pineapple were very good however.\n\n\nSERVICE :\n\nThe service was very disappointing. \n\nAt no point or time did our table of 10 know who was our primary waiter. Some of us ordered drinks only to have another waiter ask if we wanted drinks 20 minutes after we ordered the first round and still haven't received our first wave of drinks.\n\nThe gentlemen who passed around with the meat and swords were always frowning and looked unhappy at what they did. Why? It's such an awesome responsibility. Why be sad?\n\nAt first it was off-putting, then after I made the joke about not messing around with unhappy service who carry swords. The joke lingered until the end of our stay.\n\nWhen we sat down, they served our side orders right away and we waited for the meat to show up. 5 minutes go by, then 10... 15....  20 minutes... while our side-orders went cold with no one telling us when to expect the \"Feast of Meat\".\n\nEventually it came, we asked for fresh side-orders which came right away and we moved on with our evening.\n\nFurthermore, kindly note that they WILL try to stuff you with their cheapest meat while the good stuff \"somehow shows up late.\" You can have pork sausages and pork roast anytime you want.\n\n\nPRICE :\n\nA 30$ buffet style place is pretty standard with most extras being what they are, overpriced. Nothing more you'd find it anywhere else.\n\n\nMY HEART :\n\nBroken. My meat desires were crushed. Why? Why?!??!?\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE :\n\nI give The Milsa 2 stars. I'd give it 1 but I cannot... the mushrooms saved them from earning that note form me.\n\nSaved by mushrooms. Really? Yes, they were very good.\n\nSpecialized in meat? Avoid 1 star rating by internet food critic because of mushroom.\n\nBrilliant.\n\nAnyways, the food was lackluster, even heart crushing. How can you suck so much at serving MEAT? I'm a man, I'd meat anything meaty. I didn't get my meat quota out of this place.\n\nThe service was lackluster as well. Slow delivery of meal, unhappy and unclear service.\n\nWill I go back? Absolutely not.\n\nI already visited this place 3 times.\n\nThe first time, the last time and one time too many!
