First time here and the staff was super friendly and welcoming! I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, as soon as I got into my car I wanted to inhale it!!  The pizza was AMAZING! ! NO RANCH NEEDED!! I ordered the chicken wings and fingers combo for the bf. He's a pizza snob and was very surprised he liked and ate two slices!! He liked the chicken wings and fingers a lot too. Definitely a place to check out!! I will definitely be going back to try other stuff on their menu! Thank you for the great food!!
