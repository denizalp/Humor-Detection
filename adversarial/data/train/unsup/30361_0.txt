Olive My Heart is one of favorite local shops.  Great selection of flavors of olive oils and balsamic vinegars, seasonings, and more.  Great ideas for gifts.  But if you are looking for a unique idea for wedding favors, look here.  We had sets of olive oil and vinegar made up for our daughter's wedding.  The owners personally were involved in the whole process - helping select the flavors, designing and printing the labels, wrapping the bottles, etc.  Everything was meticulously done, they kept in touch as we went along to be sure we were happy with it all, bottles were carefully packed so the bows weren't crushed.  It was perfect... and saved us so much time not having to put together favors ourselves.  Guests loved them.  Pay them a visit and see all they have to offer - they can help you come up with something to fit your budget.
