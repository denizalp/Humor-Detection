My 4 year old had a blast here. It's a nice clean place and the laser room is just the right size. The amount of time they alloted for play is good and they also have a small arcade. The prizes are nothing special and there is a very small selection but reasonable. Prices are good and though they were understaffed I would absolutely go back.
