Not much in the area. Java u always have a good selection. Sad witches are great and have a good selection of gluten free products. I enjoy the Shanghai Asian chicken sandwich and there salads. \nNot too much place to sit for a coffee place so expect to order to go.\nThey also sell wine which was surprising.\nFriendly service but a little slow.
