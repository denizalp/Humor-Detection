This place was AMAZING! I stumbled upon this place because it's near the Cold Stone by my house  thought we'd try it for dinner tonight. It's my new fave Thai food place in Vegas. The food was so good and the service was great. The price was right too. 2 meals and 2 apps for 39$ (and they were shrimp meals) definitely gonna go again.
