For my 50th birthday, I wanted something my large group would remember (besides me being a tipsy goofball). We got it.\nI went to Firefly on Paradise for my 25th wedding anniversary three years ago, and my friends have talked about how great it was. So could Firefly in the Plaza be as good, especially with the menu omissions (there are a few dishes you can only get at the Paradise location)? Yes, yes, yes.\nWe started out with pitchers upon pitchers of the best Sangria outside of Spain....at Happy Hour they were around 13$ each! \nOur group were allowed to relax and unwind before being seated in the most central tables to observe the Freemont Street Hoopla. Our waitress and waiter combo brought a bottle that absent friends sent which started me crying, that started the waitress crying, and well, the whole table got misty....but then there was food!\nThe table trusted me to order for us all...and it was a feast that Babette would have given her approval to....The empanadas, the almond-stuffed bacon wrapped dates, the artichoke and pepper crustini, the serrano ham with manchego cheese, the coquettas, the chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms, it just went on and on...\nand the wine flowed....\nThe evening was everything a birthday dinner should be....\nMy only wish is that I could go to Las Vegas for every special occasion and have at least one dinner at Firefly.....I wonder what I am doing for my cat's birthday next month?.......
