Saw the World Series of Poker here. A little boring to watch, but exciting to see players throwing down 2 million dollar bets.\n\nI played my first black jack table here. Which was amazing! Our dealer, Mabel, was very helpful and patient. She took into consideration that 2 out the 3 players were newbies. \n\nI can see myself staying here on the next excursion to Vegas.
