Very well may be the best shrimp tacos I've ever had, slightly crispy. Really good guac, can do the make at the table variety but I opted just for a side. The house made salsa was real good and the table side Mex hot sauce had kick! They have the \"healthy\" tortilla options which is nice as well. The Paco Taco was bomb and be sure to get the Charro beans - so good! $2 pint of Shiner doesn't hurt their case either.\n\nTrue Tex-Mex taco shop with all the random Texas decor on the walls. \n\nIf you are in Southpark area - this is a must try!
