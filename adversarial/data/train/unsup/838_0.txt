$7.00 Breakfast- Don't waste your time. How do you mess up eggs and toast? Well these guys\/girls have that down pat. The middle aged girl who waited on me was a cruel hiring joke by Management. At 7am she seats me and hands me the burger menu? I asked do you server burgers now? A casual \"No\" is what I got. Then why am I looking at the burger menu I'm thinking? Ordered the $7 breakfast and got the 2 ends of the bread loaf (See photo), including the butt. I said \"are you really going to serve this\"? Her response was we serve everything and nobody's complained before\". Really? I wasn't complaining, just pointing out that that the cook must be a beginner.  Breakfast potatoes are those cubed frozen kind that really are the cheapest you can buy from a vendor. \nBurgers- Had a Groupon and came back for dinner. The oink, squeal and moo was very good. Just remember. This is a burger joint. Trying to pull off breakfast to pick up a few extra dollars on your establishment, does more harm than good to your reputation.
