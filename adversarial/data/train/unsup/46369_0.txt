Visited Diego Pops for the first time yesterday for dinner. The weather is getting nicer after the sun goes down and we thoroughly enjoyed sitting on the patio getting to enjoy it...and our margaritas.\n\nOur server Taylor was fun and really helped us navigate our way through the menu. She recommended items and they did not disappoint. My husband is pretty picky about what he likes and everything he ordered was brought to him just as he specified. The pitcher of margaritas our server convinced us to get may have helped his mood though! Delicious! Lol\n\nWe will be back for sure - relaxed, casual, great service and delicious food!
