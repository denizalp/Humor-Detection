Anything having to do with pickles and I'm in. Pause for dirty thoughts.\n\nSo when I was perusing Yelp for a quick bite to eat around our hotel I was happy to see the Cleveland Pickle come up. I'm pretty hard on sandwiches, so to impress me, you have to be a solid slice of heaven. This, my friends, sure was! \n\nMe and the hubs split a West-Sider (smoked turkey, pancetta, chihuahua cheese, pickle in the middle, roasted tomato, garlic spread AND a pickle). We only wanted a small bite, but it was crazy that this was an individual sized hoagie split down the middle. It was massive! But seriously, if I was hungry, I would have housed that entire thing myself!\n\nEvery ingredient blended together perfectly in the toasted bread. And the pickles! They give you a side of them in a small cup. The special that day was garlic. It had a hint of it, but not too much that you would be scared to be next to me. I actually liked it so much I just HAD to order another order of pickles!\n\nThe pickle reins supreme here! Well, the pickle and the sandwiches, a killer combo!
