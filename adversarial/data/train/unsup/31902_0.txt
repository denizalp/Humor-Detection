We got in to Vegas after traveling all day and I was browsing Yelp. This place popped up as a new and exciting restaurant. The first pic I saw saw Walnut Shrimp and I was sold! I love Walnut Shrimp and theirs did not disappoint! Nice restaurant with a live seafood tank. For being a newer place, it was already packed. There looked to be some awesome stuff on the menu. I wouldn't hesitate to go back and give it another try.
