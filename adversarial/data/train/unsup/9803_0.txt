This was my second experience at a Korean BBQ place and I gotta say, this was so much better than the last kbbq I was at. You know those servers who're just there to take your order and you don't see them til it's time to pay? Well, our server actually came back from time to time and actually conversed with us. Alodia definitely made a memorable visit. She kept it fun yet professional when needed to be. Definitely going back because of a well service. It's a plus that what we ordered came out right away. It was great. And I was very fascinated by how high tech everything is.
