Stayed here the other night and the experience was mediocre at best.\n\nThis property is off the Strip, which saves on the walk from the Self-Parking to the Casino, saves on the resort fee, and includes WiFi, and Cooked to Order Breakfast.\n\nUpon check-in, the agent nor the room did not contain my salty snack and water per my Hilton Gold VIP profile...had to request it manually from the front desk at departure.\n\nThe room was decrepit:\n- Light in bedroom was missing bulb\n- Light in seating area was non-functional, despite a bulb in place\n- Radio from Clock Radio was non-functional.\n- Bathtub was clogged during shower\n- Hot water was sporadic...\n- The dining room table only had 3 chairs?!?\n- The desk in the room was missing an office chair?!?\n- The dining room table had a very loose leg?!?\n\nThe bed was the older, connected Bonnel springs, which means that if one moves, the entire mattress moves, perfect for 1 individual. The sheet and comforter were comfortable.\n\nThe breakfast was also mediocre. The potatoes and bacon from the hot buffet were disgusting. The omelette was the only redeeming part... The OJ was also watered down...eek!
