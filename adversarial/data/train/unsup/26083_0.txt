Love this place!! Great food at a reasonable price and fast friendly service. I had a chicken pistachio salad which is pretty big and had lots of chicken. I hate when I go to a place and they are skimpy on chicken and you have to pay extra for more meat. Anyway my husband loves Salmon and had the pasta salmon bowl and loved it as well. Neither one of us drink soda so we had water which made our bill only $20. Not bad! Well definitely come back.
