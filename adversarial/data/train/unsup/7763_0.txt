My husband and I were invited by friends back in November 2012. At first we really enjoyed it, then started noticing unprofessional attitude by the owner, such as alcohol on the breath, and shouting at the staff in front of patrons. \n\nThe owner's claims that former patrons just \"hung out\" without purchasing anything is erroneous and inflammatory; furthermore, these patrons are personally responsible for bringing in many new customers.\n\nI fully expect to have the owner remove this negative review; that is his prerogative. However, just know this...word gets around Marco.
