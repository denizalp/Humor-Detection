There should be the sound of singing angels everytime someone enters... just saying.\n\nBeen checking out the Summerhill area for a while, but never ventured into the LCBO... Boy was I missing out!  This place is spacious and beautiful - from the architecture, interior layout and pristine displays.  Everything seems to have a tint of gold and sparkle, like walking into the Louvre of everything Liquor - they even have signs and arrows for each section so you don't get lost.\n\nI was on the hunt for the elusive Sommersby Blackberry Cider - it's always out of stock at the LCBO near my place. Since I was in the area, I made sure to check ot this LCBO.  JACKPOT!  Got my few cans and there were so many check out counters, paying was a breeze.\n\nI'm not big on alcohol (Obvs!! since I was going for a wussy cider), but this place looks like Heaven - I'm pretty sure you'll find whatever your boozey heart desires.
