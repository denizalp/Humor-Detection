It's really a pretty convenient place, with a lot of space for car maneuvering and always available parking lots. You don't need a high-end car driving skills to maneuver from the gas station to the store. In some other similar places, those are so close to each other that a collision is frequent events. But here, I just like the huge open space.\nOk, it's not a place for decent food. If starving, one might be happy with what they are offering in the Hotpoint. The quality of the food served here is below average. I tried several times to luck here with a sandwich or hot dog. Well, the taste and the quality was disappointing or actually expected. I mean it's not a food place. \nBut if about the gas station - weel, bulls-eye. Cheap gas and very quick service.
