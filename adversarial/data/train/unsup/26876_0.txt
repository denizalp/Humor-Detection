I adore Zenith. I've since explained this place to non-Pittsburghers as the hipster Cracker Barrel, though that description does not do Zenith enough justice. I chose the pumpkin pancake as my main entr√©e at my last visit, but I have to admit, the star of the show is the buffet table. There wasn't a single item I tried from the buffet that was anything less than stellar, from creamy peanut butter Asian noodles to the fresh, crisp salad (because then I can pretend that I'm eating healthy, right?) to the myriad cakes they have lying in tantalizing wait for you at the buffet finish line... ahhhh. Lovely. My only regret is that I was too full to try more of those delectable bundt cakes. After our feast, we had a blast browsing through all of the antiques at the front of the store. Will be back soon!
