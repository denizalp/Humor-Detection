Ohhhhhhhhhhh, piggie, piggie! Why must you be so darned good?! \n\nI've been to this restaurant twice so far (it's pretty new to the area) & I ordered the same thing both times ..... it was so good I just wanted to eat the same thing again :D \nMy now FAVORITE is the pulled pork sandwich. I just eat the meat & save my bread allotment for the moist & sweet corn bread. The pulled pork itself is never dry, cooked to perfection and, while good on it's own, is elevated to heaven status when doused with some hot BBQ sauce (which isn't hot at all, just tasty). \n\nAt some point I will try other items on their menu. A friend got the pulled chicken sandwich and my pulled pork sandwich was better... nani-nani-boo-boo! \n\nAs an added plus I like sitting in the wooden picnic tables (they're inside away from the heat!) on which you get to write :D \nLook for my masterpiece! It's a piggie that looks like it was crossed with a cat..... kind of like spider pig, but instead it's cat pig, lol. \n\nP.S. This restaurant is cash only, but not to worry, they have an ATM :)
