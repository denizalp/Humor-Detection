I was home for the holidays and grabbed a white chocolate mocha for my sister to make the family Christmas go smoother for everyone.  We were in the drive-thru for TWENTY MINUTES.  I understand that it's Gastonia, and I should have low expectations.  But... twenty minutes??  That's just ridiculous and unacceptable.\n\nAlso, they were out of chocolate cake pops. :(\n\nI won't be back.
