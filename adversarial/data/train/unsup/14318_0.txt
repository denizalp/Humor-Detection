YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(353\/365) \"Style, Luxury, and Service\"\n\nFinally got to take a look around the Sahara \"with a body kit\" when we had guests in town...It'll always be the Sahara in my eyes. Neat little changes here and there, but the casino inside is still dark, and that \"old casino scent is still evident...(told you it's the Sahara with a body kit!?) very small, and tight casino with hip, modern splashes...great effort in reviving what once was an abandoned landmark. \n\nA Bell man broke it down as \"Style, Luxury, and Service\" when our out of town guests inquired about the name...you got your usual restaurant\/casino layout with a few retail spots primarily run by Fred Segal, a cafe, little pool area, nightclub, a lounge, and a little gallery up the escalators which was pretty cool to get a glimpse of.\n\nAgain, great restoration effort, and who knows, maybe we'll return to check out one of the restaurants for a bite. Best of luck to you SLS!  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  3
