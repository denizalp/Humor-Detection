I can't say enough about this place. The food, service, ambiance and fellowship provided was nothing short of outstanding. As a frequent business traveler, I get to eat out a ton. Like way too often and this place aced any and all expectation. The cassoulet was quite possibly the best I've ever had and fried chicken skin? What? Thanks to the crew for everything! Will be back and will say not going, is a foul!
