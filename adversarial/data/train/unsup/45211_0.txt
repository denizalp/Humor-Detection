Love this place! Great drinks, good food, and awesome brunch. I had my 3rd visit last night and our server Chris was absolutely amazing. He chose my wine and my meal and both were wonderful. He put up with our \"slightly\" intoxicated behavior and was so much fun. Service is #1 and Chris took home the gold:).
