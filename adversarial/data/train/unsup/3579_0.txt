I heard about Jet Luxury through a travelzoo deal and for the first time, I have to say they dun me wrong!\n\nJet Luxury is not at all \"luxurious.\" I should have seen all the warning signs before I booked with them. First, it's really hard to get in touch with both their reservation staff line and their other line meant for guests. I actually was hung up on and when I finally was able to talk to a representative, their service was lackluster. In fact, the cashier at my local McDonald's probably is more eloquent. \n\nTrue, booking through them would have saved me about $20\/day, but I have to safely say, \"you get what you pay for.\"\n\nSecond, read that fine print. At the Vdara, they will only clean OnCe during your entire stay. That's fine if you are only staying two nights, but I was planning on staying close to a week and that I found gross and totally unacceptable!\n\nThe there's the fact that technically, since they rent Vdara condos that are privately owned, it's in no way linked to the hotel.  It's fine if they have folks on staff to help you, but apparently, they are only there for a few hours a day, so tough. \n\nYolanda, the representative who helped me cancel my reservation was the one who saved them from a one star rating.  They never charged me, since I didn't stay, but if I were you, you can find a comparable deal through smartervegas.
