Hmmm..it's hard trying to write this review. I mean, it's Roberto's, come on. This particular location looks better, appearance wise. It's open 24 hours and I've always had good experiences at other Roberto's. My son normally eats Roberto's too but on this particular night, he refused to eat here. Was it a sign? \n\nI ordered a shredded beef burrito and it was completely soggy and leaking when I received it. It resembled a stew burrito. I wasn't even halfway done with it when it started coming completely apart. That's a first. I got fed up and just took the rest home. I went to bed and my husband ate what was left of the burrito.\n\nThe next morning we both woke up and we were sick. I'm pretty sure it was the food since my son was the only one who refused to eat here and he was fine and dandy. I'll probably give them another try but my first experience here was very unpleasant.
