I love me some Fogo. Pro tip: go during lunch - all the same food for a cheaper amount. And, of course, another pro tip: be sure to go hungry! The staff are typically friendly and attentive (albeit less so on my most recent visit). The cocktails are yum. The wine list is fairly extensive. The salad bar is decent. The sides are alright. The meats, duh, are the star of the show. So much yummy meat goodness! Tip: be sure to ask for the sauces - mint jelly, chimichurri, and horseradish.
