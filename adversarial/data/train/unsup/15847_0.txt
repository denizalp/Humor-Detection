I miss Japanese food.  I grew up in Southern California, with Japanese-American family and I'm jonesing here in the midwest for a good chicken katsu, or a decent Udon.  Kame's the closest I've come here to being satisfied.  I like it a bit better than Kamakura, and the servers are both friendly and on point.\n\nThe miso's pretty good, the udon is a trifle underwhelming, but the katsu's quite lovely.  Although---you can get cheese on it?  WHAT THE HELL?  Is that a terrifyingly midwest thing?  Cuz I've never heard of this.  ICK.\n\nThat aside, i'm bummed that they only have chicken katsu curry (one of my favourite things in life ever) one day a week.  I want it now ;)
