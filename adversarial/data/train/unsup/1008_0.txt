There's no Mexican-Asian fusion going on in this restaurant, except that the 2 menus and decor are intertwined. It's almost like someone could not decide if they wanted to open a Mexican restaurant or Chinese restaurant, so they decide to open both in the same space, with separate kitchens. I love both Mexican food and Chinese food, but this is neither here nor there. Two cuisines that are normally best in a hole-in-the wall spot, and inexpensive - this is just the opposite: overpriced and mediocre.\n\nWe ordered everything family style and tried to get a good mix of both Mexican & Chinese food:\n\nBlood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita ($15) - I liked this margarita a lot. I don't care for the taste of tequila, and the blood orange seemed to mask this well. It had a spicy kick to it, but not so spicy that it was undrinkable.\n\nGuacamole & Chips ($15) - Handmade, and delicious, but the price is about double what I would expect to pay for fresh guacamole. Chips were light, crispy and fresh.\n\nTacos (about $5 each) - I'm used to dollar tacos (maybe $2) at a taco truck. I got the Tinga Poblana and it was good, but unless I'm expensing my meal to work, I would pass on this - much too expensive for tacos.\n\nLamb Potstickers Stuck on You ($12.88) - 6 pieces - This was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. The lamb inside was tasty and I liked the crispy lace (sweet onions) design on the dish. Would recommend this.\n\nSui Mai ($13.88) - 6 pieces - The only cool thing about this were the gold flakes on top. The rest was just okay, and tasted heavy on the ginger. At a normal dim sum restaurant, you can get 4 sui mai's for $4 that taste better.\n\nDan Dan Mian ($12) - Wheat noodles and spicy pork sauce - This was definitely spicy, nothing that blew me away though. At least the price was reasonable for the portion-size.\n\nCol de Bruselas ($12) - These are on the acidic side - tasted really limey. I wouldn't get this again.\n\nShrimp Mojo ($18) - 8 pieces of shrimp = $2.25 per piece of shrimp. Sauce was good, not too spicy, this was one of the better dishes we had.\n\nBistec con Mole Amarillo y Hongos ($20) - Grilled hanger steak with mole - there were about 6 sliced pieces of steak - again, with the small portions. It was one of the better tasting dishes we had, but expensive.\n\nAll in all, it's an interesting concept and I was there for work so I was able to expense my meal. With tip and tax, it was $60 per person - quite honestly, I would rather eat at a Mexican food truck or a hole-in-the-wall Chinese place for 1\/4 of the price and more authentic food. With so many other options in Vegas, I'll be going elsewhere.
