I decided to check out Rise Up after seeing an article in the paper. I specifically wanted to try their spelt bread since my gluten sensitive husband can tolerate that grain.\n\nDuring my first visit, spelt wasn't available, but I figured it was because I stopped by in the evening. I got a loaf of nine grain for myself. I was a little put off by the service because the person in front of me was offered multiple samples, but I was offered none. The bread was ok, but I was really unhappy with the hole in the middle of the loaf. I had to throw several slices away since they weren't fit for sandwiches.\n\nPrior to my next visit on a Saturday, I called the bakery at 7:30 to make sure spelt would be available. I was told it would be ready in two hours. My husband and I stopped in at 10am, and the owner said the spelt had just come out of the oven. So we could either buy a frozen loaf (um, no!) or he could slice the hot loaf but it would probably tear (hell no!). I came back later in the afternoon to get the spelt, but it had the same problem with the holey slices. It tasted fine just like my first loaf. Nothing special. Still no samples offered on these visits. My husband mentioned how surprised he was that the bakery didn't have all their stock available in the late morning, and I agree. Perhaps they need to start baking earlier?\n\nNormally, I wouldn't give a place a third chance, but I like the idea of a local bakery where I can get wholesome sandwich bread. I stopped by a third time and purchased a loaf of five seed bread. This was by far my favorite! Lots of flavor. And no holes! No samples offered on this visit though. Maybe I look like I don't want to try free goodies? Wrong.  I really, really do.
