Located in south point casino - really nice place with better prices than other Japanese restaurants. Server Rory was great & when he was busy with other tables the rest of the staff made sure to check on me and bring out food. Drinks are good, I recommend the Caribbean Cosmo! The portion size for entrees are big and filling and their creme brûlée was the best! If you come with more than 2 people I would call and make a reservation first. \n\nCheck in for 10% off. The total for 2 drinks, meal, & dessert was $45.
