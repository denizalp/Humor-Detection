So my body has the same aversion to the lactose in ice cream as it has to people who use the word 'kewl'.   But Churn is worth the physical punishment.  This has to be the cutest ice cream shop I have ever been to.  The ice cream is made all in house and the chocolate chip cookie I had mine with tasted like my grand mammy made it.  It competes for the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever had.  That's how serious this is people.  \n\nIt's a small shop but there is seating out back and they get you in and out really quick so don't let a line detour you.  It's also in the same spot as a bunch of awesome hip restaurants.  So let this be your last stop after Il Postino, Windsor or Federal Pizza.  Look at me planning your next date for you. You're welcome.
