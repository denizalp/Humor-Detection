My mother used to eat here all of the time until her medical emergency. This place is pretty much a below average Chinese buffet. I wasn't too impressed with the selection and the quality was definitely sub-par,\n\nThe facts:\n\nPros:\n\n1.  Easy to find off of 24th Street in Phoenix. It obviously used to be some sort of fast food place.\n\n2.  Plenty of parking in general.\n\n3.  The dinner buffet was $8.75 which is cheap considering what other buffets might charge.\n\n4.  The selection is pretty decent but very heavy on chicken oriented dishes.\n\nCons:\n\n1.  A little too salty on most of it's food. As I stated, they are very heavy on chicken oriented dishes.\n\n2.  I just don't think jello belongs in a buffet. It's a cheap option to maximize profit. Not very impressed by red and green jello.\n\n3.  The egg rolls were pretty bad. Yes they were crunchy on the outside but felt undercooked on the inside. That means soggy, which isn't a good thing.\n\nThis would be a good choice after a drunken stupor evening when it doesn't matter what you put in your stomach. As for a choice, I would most likely avoid this place.
