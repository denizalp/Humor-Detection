Beautiful atmosphere and attentive staff. Overall, I think the food was just okay. The pesto risotto was really good and definitely left me wanting more, but my entree of cheesy rice and chicken was too rich for my taste. I tried some of my friend's entrees too and nothing really impressed me. In general, it's a bit expensive for the portion sizes, but I'd recommend it if you are looking for a nice place to get a drink and a snack.
