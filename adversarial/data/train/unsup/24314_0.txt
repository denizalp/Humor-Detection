My second time eating here I decided to try the all you can eat!  $25 and I ate more then I should have!  They say you can order as much as you want you just hate to eat it all!!!! Boy did I!  I am allergic to shellfish but wanted some of the rolls that had crab in it....they kindly took it out for me!  All you can eat came with appetizers, rolls and dessert!  The Mochi was so good!  Green Tea, chocolate, vanilla and coffee. They also had fried ice cream!  TO DIE FOR!  One of my favorite desserts!  The service was great, prompt and kind and explained everything to a T when we asked questions!  For the price I would go back any day!
