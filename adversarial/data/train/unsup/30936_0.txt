When it comes to gas stations Sheetz has NO equal.  Best gas prices in Robinson (unless you're a Sams Club member of have Fuel Perks coming out of your ears) combine with on-the-go food and a ridiculously large selection of non-alcoholic drinks.  The Sheetz MTO should be its own Food Group ... batting a .950 average for my palate I have yet to meet an MTO I didn't like.\n\nRecently they've redone the Coffee Bar (at this location) and added a decent amount of healthier eating options.  Their newer Sheetz Card program tracks your buying habits (sorta) and give you free food everytime you hit 10-bought on 6 different categories.  It also when scanned lowers your gas price 3-cents per gallon.\n\nThis particular Sheetz can get packed ... and on those ocassions it might be a 10 to 20 minutes long trip to get in, order, and get out.  But the food is tasty enough and the employees nice enough (there's a couple exceptions here and there) that even on those crazy busy days you can still leave a happy customer.
