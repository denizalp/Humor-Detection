Not bad by any means, but absolutely WAY overrated.  Had brisket and ribs.  Both were somewhat lacking in flavor. The meat should stand on its own without drowning it in sauce.  I do a lot of BBQ at home and this would not be an acceptable meal coming from my smoker.  That being said, it is better than many of the chains and lower end BBQ joints like Joe's BBQ.  Price point is what would be expected.  Small seating area that was kept clean and well maintained.  Friendly staff.  Overall though... just average.
