ChiropracTed is the man!\n\nI would highly recommend scheduling an appointment: (702) 277-1371 with him today. His Office Manager Vincent will find a time that works for you and you will be so happy that you did. If you have spinal pain, and want to feel better, call Ted immediately (702) 277-1371. I promise you will feel much much better.\n\nTed offers a holistic wellness practice with a philosophy of seeing you healed. I greatly appreciate that Ted integrates many synergistic disciplines such as physical therapy, kinesiology, nutrition and essential oils into his practice and also teaches Zumba at several gyms.\n\nWhen I see Ted for a session, I feel taller, stronger, more metally\/emotionally positive!\n\nI will be scheduling a session today and if you want to feel better, you will too.
