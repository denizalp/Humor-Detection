Yeah! after a few phone call with Synchrony Bank and Living Spaces's store manager visiting, our interest free promotion issue on the furniture purchased was a happy ending! Thank you for listen to our voices. Anyhow, we are very happy with all our new furniture which was purchased from Living Spaces.\nHowever, corporate office's staff is still need some customer service and knowledge of promotion guideline training!
