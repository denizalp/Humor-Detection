An update on the re-ducting work. Now that its hot and the sun is intense, so far so good. The room is staying comfortable. During the mid afternoon, when the sun has shined all day on that room, it's slightly warmer. But, that's not the fault of the reducting. The airflow is more substantial, and with the ac running more, due to the hot temps, the circulation is good and the room remains comfortable. I'm happy with the results.
