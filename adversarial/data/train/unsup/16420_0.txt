Based on reading the latest news coverage I was incredibly excited to try this. Utter and complete fail.\n\nWent today (10\/7\/15) with a buddy, ordered 2 burgers and fries. His came correct, mine came plain (absolutely naked). Went back up front and they kindly remade it. When I finally bite in it was... blah. Poorly dressed (almost no sauce). Fries were unremarkable freezer type crinkle cut. Based on that it would get 2 stars. \n\nBut about 3 hours later I got chills and nausea. Called my buddy and he said ... dude I think I'm sick, I feel warm and sick to my stomach. \n\nAll we ate today was the burger so that's it. Nausea passed in about 5 hours but still queasy as I type this.  No chance I would give these people a second chance. \n\nAvoid, like the plauge... or you may get the plauge. :(
