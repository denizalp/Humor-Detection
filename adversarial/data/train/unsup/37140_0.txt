Went here for my mom for Mother's Day.  Very few people in there on that day.  \n\nThe salad bar is very limited and no where near as spectacular as some of the other Brazilian steak houses.  However this place is half the price so I can live with that.\n\nThe most important part of a Brazilian steakhouse the meat.  We were the first group in and unfortunately we got started with some way over done sirloin and chicken thighs.  The sausage tasted like it was made in house and goes very well with their grilled pineapple.  They give you a garlic bread which was different and very good as well.  Next came a bacon wrapped piece of pork this wasn't over done cooked a bit much for me but I eat raw meat, perhaps I'm not a good judge.  Now we may have caught the tail end of another diner to this point because ribs came out cooked very well still juicy and flavors that really brought the pork flavor out 3rd best meat of the night.  Next came a new round of some of the previous meats which made me go try their flan and fried banana.  Flan was curdled but the flavor was great and the caramel was perfect not a bit of bitter taste in it at all.  The fried banana not greasy at all crispy outside nice texture through to the center, very well done.  Finally the lamb and filet came out.  Their marinades, sauces, rub, or whatever is put on is great\nWhen it is fresh much better than Texas de Brazil and rivals viva Brazil.  The filet is good but give me the lamb chops and roast of lamb best meats of the night.
