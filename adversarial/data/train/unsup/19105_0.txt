First experience: Super Bowl Sunday 2015  we were overcharged by 200$ without any compensation and our server knee. The place is very clean All of the bartenders and servers are very friendly and attentive. Their food options are incredible and very unique (not your traditional bar food.) beer is very affordable\n\nSecond experience: we sat at the table for  20 minutes with no one attending to us. I walked up to the bar and the bartender literally snapped at me saying uh someone will be with you and pointed to my booth. Our server was really nice but all he had said is \"sorry hope you weren't here too long\" and didn't check on us after at all except once to ask if we wanted more drinks. The place wasn't even empty. I just wanted a beer.... Then when the check came we waited for 10 minutes and I had to go up to the bar ....
