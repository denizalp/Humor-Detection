This place would be awesome if the girls working the register would hurry up during checkout instead of wasting everybody's time.\nI love Victoria's Secret but I'm rating based on service only. \nOther than the girls who are great helping find your size...\nThe lines are ridiculously long and time consuming. \nExpect to wait more than 15 mins when checking out and will chit chat. They like to take their sweet time and obviously don't care about customers' convenience.
