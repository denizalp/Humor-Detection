Came here one evening with friends to pick up some burgers and fries and head back to Khoury's for beer and board games (I lurve Khoury's like Celine Dion lurves saying lurve).\n\nThe burger itself lacked any real bang (cheddar, bacon, and Chipotle mayo, but they forgot the mayo) and was a bit bland. On the positive side, the fries were quite good and the staff was friendly.\n\nMy three friends that joined me enjoyed their meals, however, so maybe I'm just a big ol' Ms. Prissy Pants when burgering!\n\nHonestly, can't take me anywhere.
