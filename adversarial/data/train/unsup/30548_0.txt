Love the food here.  \nRecently discovered their hamburgers - awesome! And those fries are as addicting as crack - my 2 year old couldn't even keep his hands off my plate!  \nConsistently good service in a cozy cottage atmosphere.  Try the patio when the weather gets nicer!  Good wine selection.  Lovely place for brunch, lunch, or dinner.
