Happy for this Harris Teeter at Uptown. It has everything one can ask for, and it's like a mini Harris Teeter for it small space.\n\nHave to look at circulars for the sale items which are right by the entrance when you walk in the automated doors. \n\nRight in front are the wine. Great to grab and go with all the house parties and celebrations that I have been recently invited to.\n\nThey have good selection of prepared meals and boy do they go fast. \n\nThe aisles are clean and well maintained. Like the samples they have out for you to try out.\n\nFinding parking can be a bit tough. Sometimes driving in circles to find a spot. There are spots near the park or across the street.
