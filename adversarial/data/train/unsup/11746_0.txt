There's nothing like a delicious all-American BBQ to make your heart happy and your tummy satisfied. If you're looking for some BBQ lovin' Pot Liquor is where it's at!! i've been on a BBQ kick this summer and have tried several different spots with two weeks of each other and all the rest pale in comparison to this place! The ambience is clean and welcome with unique chandeliers and an awesome tattered looking painted wall....its kinda got a country chic feel to it. Even the hand drawn Sharpie art work in the restroom is memorable!  \n\nNow to the good stuff, I mean GREAT stuff, the food! We started off with Deviled Eggs, (score!) they were uber creamy with a slight zest. The cracklin' on top adds nice crunch. For my main course I order the Burnt Ends (from the appetizer menu) and paired it with a side of Mac n' Cheese (don't judge me, ot was our cheat day!)  Their burnt ends were out of this world!! The meat had very little fat, but was still bursting with flavor. They seriously melted in my mouth; they were prepared with a beautiful, tasty char without tasting burnt...absolute perfection!! They Mac n' Cheese was also tasty, but the burnt ends stole the show. I highly recommend you try them!\n\nOur dining experience would not have been the same without out Bartender Brandon! He'a pretty much the man!! He offered us his recommendations, gave thorough descriptions of the food and drinks, and served us with respect, a great personality, and a fun smile!!
