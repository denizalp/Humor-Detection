Decided to get dinner here before our evening flight. I got the pulled pork sandwich with mac & cheese. The sandwich was pretty good and I liked the sauce. The mac was alright, nothing special. Also tried the sides my boyfriend ordered. The cheesy potatoes were spicy because there was some jalapeno in it. The BBQ pit beans were good and had a lot of meat in them. The food really needed to be hotter, it was basically room temperature. If they could fix that, they may be able to earn 4 stars.
