Why am I reviewing two waste removal companies in a row? I just bought a house, lots of stuff to replace or upgrade!\n\nHad an old toilet that I wanted to get rid of; builders-grade, low and inefficient. Looked up prices in the Charlotte area for a one-time haul and 1-800 Got Junk was about the same as everyone else, however the rep was able to contact the local office who was willing to remove my toilet from the curb (in a box, wrapped in plastic. Easy job.) for $50. The other companies wouldn't budge on a minimum of about $95.\n\nI really wish they were able to answer my question about recycling. I would typically take a toilet like this one (in really good shape, just upgrading to a 'fancier' model) to the Habitat for Humanity ReStore, however it had a crack near the base. Toilets can still be recycled and nearly 100% is reusable in either reclaimed porcelain or in road construction. The rep was unable to answer specifically for the toilet but said the company makes an effort to responsibly dispose of as many materials as possible. Lets just hope my prior throne doesn't end up in the landfill!\n\nFor the price, very happy for my one-time removal. They were there exactly when they said they'd be and had many time available in 2 hour windows. I told the rep on the phone that I wouldn't be home for the pickup and they took my payment over the phone after verifying the load.\n\nFast service and good value. What more can you ask for?
