I feel like I've just returned from Spring Break after my 2 night stay at the Hotel Valley Ho.  Not the swankiest of the hotels I've stayed at, but I like the vibe here: huge rooms filled with modern furniture, an inviting pool, and a fun bar (cafe zuzu). And while all that would have been enough to put a smile on my face there was more- the complimentary gym had all the equipment a guest could want, i loved the red flower soaps\/lotions in the rooms, and the location seemed to be convenient as well.\n\nI wasn't such a fan of staying all the way in wing 5 because I felt like I was the only person in the building. May have been nice for a romantic getaway at the Ho, but when you're by yourself it's a bit creepy.  So there will be more spring breaks for me at the Ho...but next time I'll be sure to request a room in the main building.\n\nSpring Break in October- nothing wrong with that!
