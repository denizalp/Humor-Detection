If you've ever met Rick Moonen, or even just read an interview with him, you know how passionate he is about sustainable seafood. His restaurant, RM Seafood, really highlights these efforts in dishes that are classic, fresh, and delicious.\n\nBethany E and I visited during HH, trying and sharing a variety of dishes. There's a small selection of basic sushi rolls (spicy tuna, spicy salmon maki rolls, etc.), as well as kama. We tried the Fried Rice Krisipies, which is their take on the spicy tuna-crispy rice dish found elsewhere. This version has black caviar, which I love. Their kitchen menu does a great lobster roll order (small but well executed!) as well as a flavorful steak frite plate that could easily make a meal. \n\nWhile I haven't tried much of the menu, I look forward to returning. The bar area has a cool industrial feel to it with dimmed lighting for a more upscale feel, despite the location right off the casino floor. Note that they currently offer a $28 3-course business lunch special that looks like one of the best deals on the Strip!
