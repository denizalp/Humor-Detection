After ordering, we were first served a small dish of Tampons and then she poured some warm water which then the Tampons reconstituted to some Wetnaps.  Unfortunately those Wetnaps were not edible as we waited quite a while without any Banchan and we were first ones to visit and barely any other customer arrived. (-0.5 Star)\n\nWhen the Banchans came there were a good selection and shortly after we were served our meals which then took over all the table for 4s real estate.  It's pretty awesome when you get a feeling that you're having a banquet size dinner with just having a simple family dinner.  We were close to finishing our Tea by now and we never got a replenishment. (-0.5 Star)\n\nCold Korean Noodle Combo(Noodle + Galbi) is a split decision and the method was unexpected.  Usually loving any Korean Beef dish, I have to dislike the Galbi which was fatty and simply not up to standard while the Cold Noodle had a good soup that had balance of flavours and with slice of Watermelon for Dessert on top(Just Kidding). (-0.5 Star)\n\nGinseng Chicken Soup was fine the way it was, with the Chicken stuffed with a Chestnut, Ginseng, Garlic, and Sticky Rice.  The Chicken soup was a bit light on flavour though.  A-OK\n\nSpicy Squid & Pork Vege Wrap had some regular Squid & Pork where some Pork slices had some soft bones, but no big deal.  The VEGE was the highlight for me as normally the Chinese version for Peking Duck was simply Lettuce but here was Perilla, Cabbage, Lettuce, Frisee, and a whole Jalapeno Pepper.  Purple Rice was served which is always a plus.  A-OK\n\n2.5 *Star*
