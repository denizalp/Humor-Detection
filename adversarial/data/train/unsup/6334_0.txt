Would it be an overstatement to say this is the best food I have had in the Valley?... No.\n\nCaffe Boa is nestled in a historic building off Mill and 4th Ave. Don't be thrown off by the college town location though; this place is definitely a hidden gem.  The food selection here includes Mediterranean, Slavic, and Italian influences, emphasizing the Adriatic region.\n\nWith a menu that boasts local produce, dairy, bread, meat, and even olive oil from nearby Queen Creek, high-quality ingredients are abound.  Oh, and did I forget to mention that their wine list is unparalleled, with over 500 selections from around the world?  Boa has dubbed this season the \"Summer of Acid\", amending their wine menu to selections with higher acidity.  These wines tend to cut through food and complement hot Phoenix days oh-so-perfectly.\n\nWHITE SELECTION: Try the Colle Stefano Verdicchio for a light, crisp taste with notes of apple and a little kick at the end. \n\nRED SELECTION: Go with the N2 Pinot Noir from Napa Valley if you're not afraid to try wine on-tap.  (No seriously, these wines come out of steel barrels, leading the way in wine innovation and reducing environmental impact!!)\n\nI haven't even dusted off the cuisine... Charcuterie is a must.  Choose 5 and go with the: \n\n*Pate (Meat spread made from rabbit and pork meat)\n*Pancetta (similar to bacon)\n*Burrata (rich, soft cow mozzarella with a creamy center)\n*Taleggio (semi-soft, washed rind cheese from northern Italy with a   mild flavor and fruity finish)\n*Bresaola  (air-dried, salted beef fillet which is aged 3 months then thinly sliced... comparable to Prosciutto) \n\nFIRSTS: classics include the Shrimp Adriatico and Bruschetta.  For a  simmering Tempe night though, I say go with the Street Corn or Prosciutto and Peaches.\n\nMAINS: the Halibut and Butler Steak are staples for the \"meat and potato\" type, but don't overlook the Vongole e Patate for unforgettable clams with a sweet and spicy zing.\n\nPASTA: the Braised Kid Stracci outdoes itself with quality ingredients like Fossil Creek Goat Cheese and Maya's Purslane (local, small-leafed green with a somewhat bitter taste and tons of Omega-3).  Summer Squash Ravioli is great for just that: Summer; and Voodoo Penne is a classic dish with a mild Cajun Cream sauce.\n\nWhat else can I say?  The menu is seasonal, so don't bet on my picks, but definitely test out the occasional frog leg.  Make sure you leave room for Dessert (varies as well) for a great homemade tiramisu, sorbet, or pannacotta.\n\nWhether it's a first date, 6 month anniversary, grad celebration, or family dinner, Caffe Boa will never fail you!!
