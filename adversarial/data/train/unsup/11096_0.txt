Amazing patios and service... Meh food\n\nVisited for the holiday and was stoked about eating at El Chorro. After hearing of its long history, quality food, and sticky buns, my expectations were very high. \n\nFirst, the restaurant has an amazing design-- tons of patio spaces with fireplaces, a semi-private grass yard, old-style rooms with all modern amenities, and all while preserving the historic nature and charm. The western theme prevails through the renovated touches. \n\nSecond, the service was top-notch at every turn. We arrived early and they were able to seat us nonetheless. Vicki quickly visited us, took orders, and started to check on us frequently and with an earnest joy. Supporting cast and the waiter from the next table were just as gracious.\n\nAh, but the food... Our party covered the menu: Lobster Bisque, Arugula Salad, Shrimp Cocktail, Scottish Salmon, Beef Tenderloin, Organic Turkey, Peach Cobbler, and Cheesecake. To the person, all said things were flat on taste. Aside from the sticky buns, nothing stood out. The Bisque was bitter from the sherry used. Salad was par. Shrimp cocktail were well-sized, but standard fare and sauce. The salmon had quality and a great cook's touch on its side, yet left two in our party perplexed by the off pairing with a corn succotash. Two others thought the tenderloin was a great cut undermined by being too raw and being paired with a forgettable gratin potato and completely bland creamed spinach that tasted little like their ingredients. Last, the cheesecake and cobbler were so dull that not a single person of six finished their dessert. And our family craves desserts like Frosty the Snowman likes magic hats!\n\nI'd love to score El Chorro higher. All the pieces are there, except the food. And since it's a restaurant, that's too important to disregard.
