I used to be a regular of this coffee shop until today. If you offer free wifi, you should provide it at all times. I've come here multiple times and wifi wasn't working. Lots of people come here to work on their computers or cellphones and they leave disappointed. After asking different servers about it, I got a rude answer \"our wifi is run by Rogers and if lots of people are using it, you can't connect. Just keep trying\" Really? I spent 1 full hour trying to connect already and that's your response? Agh.. This is how you lose a client. You have this big coffee shop with tables for people to use their computers and you can't pay for good wifi for your business? If you don't care about wifi, then don't say you provide that service so people don't lose their time.
