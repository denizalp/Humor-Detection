This is an updated review based on our annual trips to Toronto, Ontario, Canada to visit family. One of our favorite restaurants is the Montreal Deli & Greek Grill in Richmond Hill, Greater Toronto Area. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=iR-RK6EIx5OuOk3Z0jbUNQ \n\nMontreal Deli specializes in Montreal-style smoked meat, corned beef, and roast beef, as well as Reuben sandwiches.  Smoked meat originated in Montreal in the early 1900's and is similar to New York-style pastrami, but has differences in the brisket cut, ingredients used in the spice rub, and the curing-cooking process. Generally, the iconic Montreal-style cooked meat is marinated, smoked longer, and is milder, sweeter, less spicy, and more peppery than pastrami. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=XmqyZ7iXt6LRMzsiUZcW9A \n\nWe enjoy this restaurant for its delicious smoked meat sandwiches, with the meat slices piled about 2\" high on light rye bread. The smoked meat is fresh, warm, flavorful with the right amount of spices, and sliced to order. Montreal Deli also serves other sandwiches (chicken, fish, BLT, peameal bacon, homemade burgers, and others); and breakfast (eggs, toast, smoked meat, peameal bacon, and others). Greek items such as soulvaki and wraps are also offered, as its owner\/cook, Nick Trakosas, shares his family's cooking from his Greek heritage. Servings are generous, and prices are reasonable. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=XXNRCfMJ1rvseZLVv9PlvQ \n\nNot only is the food delicious, as we also love the hospitality of its friendly and personable owner\/cook, Nick, who has more than 25 years of experience. He and staff enjoy talking to customers who either dine-in or take-out in this clean and comfortable 44-seat restaurant. While we were there, it was a happy atmosphere with regular customers chatting with restaurant staff re the happenings of the day or how the family was doing.  It felt like we were a part of Nick's family. As such, customer service was first-rate and hospitable. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=dBOlanf9rVCII7liomoY_w \n\nWe brought two of our grandchildren (ages 12 and 11) for lunch, and they enjoyed both the food and the personable conversation by Nick and staff. They even told Nick that they liked his food and couldn't wait to take their parents (our son and his wife) to his restaurant. (I think Nick turned his charm onto them!) http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=3vPQOXWxftkpbo808PlOQQ \n\nMontreal Deli also participates in the annual 18-day Canada National Exhibition (fair with pavilions, exhibits, shows, concerts, working farm, horse show, casino and carnival midway) which is attended by 1.3 million people. They have two booths in the food building where there are long lines for their sandwiches, which are the same as offered in the restaurant. As he does each year, Nick will close his restaurant early to tend to the crowds at the CNE. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=ecmeKLaUGDTA6YE_QFj0oA http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=czMNsT-dOvXZpXRG3zN7yw http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/montreal-deli-richmond-hill?select=EbdR-AHWQDi_w9Don4QZ7w \n\nNick continues to provide catering as an option, and also takes part in many fund-raising for worthy causes.\n\nMontreal Deli also has a second location in Mississauga that is owned and operated by Nick's cousin and has a different menu (we have not been to that location).\n\nWith outstanding sandwiches, especially the Montreal-style smoked meat, and the warm hospitality offered by Nick, our family will certainly make it a point to dine there again on our next visit!
