We were trying to find somewhere to eat in downtown Phoenix when I remembered having bookmarked Desoto Market a while ago. We arrived and walked to the restaurant area where there was a yummy Asian food smell in the air! This is how we ended up in front of Adobo Dragon. Now, months ago, one of my friends had mentioned this restaurant to me, so when I saw this is where it was located, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get something.\n\nIt's a very tiny place but as I mentioned, the food they were making smelled so good! Their menu offerings included a few different types of noodles, bao (steamed buns), as well as bento boxes. I was told that the most popular menu items are the Curried Noodles, Chicken Bao, & Chicken Bento Box. I decided to get the Curried Noodles & my fiancé got the Chicken Bao plate.\n\nFirstly, the Curried Noodles were served with 4 grilled shrimp and a small side salad. The noodles had flavorful curry taste and the side salad had a vinaigrette to bring a lightness to the dish. I think the only mistake I made was not mixing up the noodles before eating because there was a bunch of curry on the bottom of my dish which I noticed only after most of the noodles were gone.\n\nThe star, by far, was the Chicken Bao though. I immediately regretted not getting those! The plate had two steamed buns and a small salad. The chicken itself had a lot of flavor and made a really tasty combination with the mango salsa. It didn't look like a lot of food, and I only had a couple of bites, but my fiancé said he felt really full after eating both.\n\nWe will definitely be back to try a couple of the other Bao options. The menu descriptions sounded really tempting for the salmon one as well as the vegetarian with sautéed mushrooms. They have happy hour specials for $3 as well!
