Ok so here goes...have lived in Vegas for about 5 years now and after all of the word of mouth about Firefly from friends and co-workers, I finally made my first visit to the new Westside location. The crazy thing is that I actually made two separate visits in the same day with different friends, was so not planned that way however this place I could go round the clock! Is just crazy, have never been and then i go twice in one day! lol\n\nMouth Orgasm at it's best. I seriously sat and moaned for two hours straight, savoring every bite, not sure what the waiter and other patrons thought, so it was either, amused, aroused or annoyed? A tasty explosion in my beautiful mouth no less.\n\nI have to say is really night and day in comparison for my two visits, the first time was at 3pm, only one other patron in the whole restaurant was quiet and we obviously were seated immediately. The next visit was at 8pm, wow a whole other world, we waited about 30 minutes to be seated and the place was packed beyond capacity, lol. I have to say either way it is a fun experience! I have listed the goodies I was able to enjoy during my two visits.
