5 stars hands down!\n\nThey're ridiculously polite and nice here. When Linda Penwarden, the owner, returned my call, she was so friendly and chatty over the phone that for a few seconds I mistook her for a Linda I knew from university!\n\nEach time I've gone to their store, I've looked rather shabby: tatty jeans, caps et al. Yet they've not treated me like a homeless person.\n\nWith each step I take in their store, I make all their glass cabinets rattle. They praise my remarkable presence!\n\nI've had some repairs done here, and they're great. Though the different sales ladies give differing accounts about what can and can't be done and how long it can or cannot take, they're very accommodating for the most part.\n\nMy repairs were fairly simple: some links had come apart and needed to be put back together. Even though the first sales lady I spoke with wasn't sure if they'd be able to do it, not only did they do it, they didn't charge me!\n\nThey're really nice people. They're the kind of nice that If they could financially, they'd hand out high class jewelry for free to joe shmoes.
