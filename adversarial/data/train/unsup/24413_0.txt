Umm.. I might be biased a bit because I actually worked here while at ASU. So I figured I'd give you a few tips for anyone that hasn't been here before.\n\n- Not a place to impress a first date. Listen, you'll be here for at least an hour and a half (for 2 people), hour is you really rush. With LOTS of downtime that could lead to really, really awkward conversation. Go on a first date somewhere else and use this place to \"seal the deal\" guys, you're welcome. \n\n- Don't be cheap. If you can't afford to go all out, just save up and come back another time. Get the full 4 courses and a good bottle of wine. If you don't know anything about wine, don't be afraid to ask your waiter. Tell them you want to try something first before buying the bottle and they'll bring you sample. Tell them if you only want to under X amount of dollars, too. Don't be afraid to say that you are looking for something under $35, there were plenty of wines that are GOOD for under that price at the Pot. And there are VERY good wines under $50, so know what you want to spend if you don't have an idea already.\n\n- Make reservations. I probably should have put this first, oh well. \n\n- If it's a special occasion, let them know when you make the reservation. Ask for a private booth if you really want privacy during your meal. But please, don't have sex or get too frisky while in that booth. Yes, it does happen and it makes it kind of awkward for the server. Save it for later, and if you can't help yourself, ask the server to hold up the meal and go back to your car.\n\n- And finally, tip your server well. This is not your typical serving job and there is a lot going on with your meal. Between them cooking it, making sure your safe (guess what? hot oil can be dangerous!) and doing their best to make it special for you - it's only polite. \n\nI think that's it. enjoy it.
