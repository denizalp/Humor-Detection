I decided to meet a friend here on a whim for a relaxing Friday night dinner. I was looking for a place close to my house that specifically did a sushi happy hour. I figured this establishment was a good bet based on the reviews. Not so much. I then realized when it comes to sushi in Arizona, I've been steered wrong so many times, which makes me believe most people in Arizona haven't had excellent sushi, on a coast. When you've eaten a lot of sushi, you know quality vs. crap. \n\nThe good thing was this place wasn't the worst sushi I've had, but it definitely was down there on the list. The pieces of fish were huge and disproportionate to the rice, which should be the first red flag. Sushi is small & pricey for a reason. \n\nThe fish was cut haphazardly, the nigiri was three times the size as the rice beneath it. Oh, and the weirdest thing was this strange clear gooey sauce under all the rolls AND nigiri. At first I thought I was tasting something funny with the fish but after asking the waitress, we found they put ponzu sauce on EVERY single roll and under the rice with the nigiri. Now, don't get me wrong, I like ponzu sauce, but not on everything. When I'm ordering a yellowtail roll, I don't want a gooey sweet sauce masking the flavor of the fish and rice. Maybe they were trying to mask the flavor of the fish and rice? Hmmmmm. \n\nI ordered one of the special rolls. It was nothing special. I specifically noticed the tuna on the outside to be too firm and chewy and the spicy tuna on the inside to be way too mushy. It was all a horrible consistency.\n\nThe bill was cheap, $67 for three people and that's with about twice as much fish as we could eat. Would I go back? No. Was it the worst? No, but I'm not a fan of taking risks with sushi.
