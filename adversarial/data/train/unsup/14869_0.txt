Rounders is another one of those bars in Vegas with better than the environment food and cheap drinks. They have a nice seating area around the bar with big comfy chairs which is a big plus.\n\nOn the minus, the environment itself is a little mediocre at times. We literally had a catfight between two women bust out here where the bartenders and such did little to react and service can be a little slow at times. You can't really fault a business for the actions of the customers, but I think an attentive staff would have noticed these women were too drunk and screaming at each other for quite a while.\n\nAs for the food in particular, I've had probably 8-10 different things here and most of them are tasty. For example, the lobster quesadilla has big chunks of \"lobster,\" but it does taste like lobster at least. The steak quesadilla is really good, and my favorite might even be the chili cheese dog. One thing that didn't come out that well was the mini hot dogs. Scooter's version is 10x better. The sliders are average, but the wings are pretty good.\n\nBest of all though is that nearly half the time it seems like they have a happy hour going. All football games and like 2-7pm and 12-3am are happy hours, and all the food above costs around 4-5 dollars when it's half off. It's an absolute steal!
