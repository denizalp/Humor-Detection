I've never had to bring a computer to a shop before so I used yelp and found compudoc. I explained to Gareth what my problem was and he was friendly and thorough and took time to explain everything to me. Gareth was alot of help, very knowledgeable and experienced and I will be returning for anything I need in the future.
