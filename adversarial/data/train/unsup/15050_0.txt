Let me describe the OWNER of this store Jason with 3 words: Rude, Unprofessional, Disrespectful.  As for his employees, I'm new to guns and they were more than willing to help with all my questions.  I recently went to this store where I saw Jason scolding and yelling at one of his employees consistently for about 30mins in front of all customers.  I also witnessed a woman who was, as she was explaining to him, a legal alien with a green card as well as a military spouse being treated with the utmost disrespect in front of everyone.  As an active military member myself I have zero tolerance for disrespect towards the military and their families.  I left immediately and will never be bringing my business here again.  Jason owes that woman and her husband, who Jason screamed to her about that her husband couldn't even come to buy the pistol, an apology.
