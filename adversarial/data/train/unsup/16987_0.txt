Wow....I'm surprised there have been other reviews for this spot, even more so that they're so....negative. So much drama for a convenience store. Nah, I like this place because they always have Blue Rockstar on special. Yes, the one that tastes like Robitussin and is Zero Carb. Like carbs are even a factor with all the sugar napalm in that thing, right? I'll burn off three bags of Uncle Ben's in 3 hours with the amount of work I get done. When I'm not shaking. \n\nPowerade is always on special here too, as well as those 5-hour energy shots (they run out like crazy though, Tw33kers be buggin). I go to this location and the eastside one on Gibson when I'm in that part of town. Gas is plentiful and cheaper than chain stores. This Speedee usually gets love at GasBuddy.com, near the top. Note I said \"usually.\" That ARCO is a tough feller to keep down.\n\nAmanda, don't hate. Caffeinate. Life's too short.
