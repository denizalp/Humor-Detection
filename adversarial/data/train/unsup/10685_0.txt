Grand Cafe? A Grand price for mediocre food. \n\n I have to say that I was disappointed with the cream of mushroom soup,spaghetti with meatballs, and Pepsi. First off, I believe with a strong conviction that Grand Cafe ought to include a soup of the day or salad with the meal. This isn't the Las Vegas Strip! And if the soup or salad is $3, I feel ripped off considering that the Cream of Mushroom soup included zero mushrooms. Coincidental this soup tasted and looked similar to the Progresso Cream of Mushroom soup that was recently reintroduced to the Las Vegas market. A soup  that once had mushrooms in the broth. Fast forward to the spaghetti with meatballs. It is impossible to ruin spaghetti, but Grand Cafe came close with the meatballs. It wasn't cold or anything. Just below average. A significant portion of the plate was taken up by garlic bread. In my opinion garlic bread is filler. And the Pepsi was too syrupy.\n\n  The service was decent. Nothing grand and nothing negative.\n\n   The deal is that what I ordered at Grand Cafe was not worthy of $20. I could of dined in Red Lobster for that price. If I do return, I intend to stick to a sandwich with fries. The bottom line is that Station Casinos should bring back the value of their old Grand Cafe.
