Formally named Capitano's, It's not just a burger place anymore!\nI recently stopped by Pkaros to check out the renovations and the updated menu.\nThere is still a good selection of burgers on the menu, but they now serve Venezuelan items! \nEverything is made in-house, including the bread and the gelato!\n\nI tried the mixed meat pepito, it was delicious and one giant sandwich!\nThe chicken and beef mix was juicy, spicy, and tender.\nThe avocado sauce was sooo good!\n\nI didn't have room for dessert but the the dulce de leche cake looked delicious. The baked goods change here daily.\n\nThe arepas (pancake + meat) was popular here and so were the fries (almost like Latin American poutine!)\n\nIf you like croissants, the cachitos are ham and cheese pastries perfect for breakfast.\n\nThe service here was warm and friendly. I had a great experience here and Pkaros is one of my favourite spots to grab a bite in the neighborhood!
