A great atmosphere and fantastic people.  You can really tell that it's a labor of love.  Whenever we go, we try to swing by on a Thursday because that's when they debut their experimental brews.  My old faithful is their Brown Ale and we refill a couple of growlers of it every visit.  I'm trying to get them to bring back this delightful Pear concoction, so feel free to petition with me :)
