I am a long-time patient of Dr Crum, she has delivered all three of my children. I have referred so many friends and colleagues to her because she is not only an excellent physician but she takes the time to get to know her patients and actually cares about their feelings. She is a lovely human being and obviously loves her job. I cannot recommend her highly enough and actually, it bears mentioning that her office staff are phenomenal (and I'm \"in the biz\" and therefore highly critical). Her nurse Gaylin has helped me out so much over the phone over the years and always greets all the patients with a smile and professionalism. Always a good experience.
