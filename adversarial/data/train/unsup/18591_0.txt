I have been going to here since the cook from Tia Rosa's stole the recipes and opened gecko...   cause I thought their service was better and it used to be... NOT any more... two times ago the waitress tried to extort a 50% tip by asking me 3 times if I \"really needed change, really\" and this last time I went for pick up and they failed to add the Salsa to my bag (the only reason I like their food in the first place and I'm to lazy to make the salsa myself - recipe to follow)... I called and let them know and my wife drove all the way back to get it and they accused her of lying... Seriously??? like I would go there (5 miles) and then go all the way back to steal 6 oz of green salsa???  \nSo here is the Green salsa Recipe-  3 cans of La Costena Tomatillos drain one and dump all three into a blender,  2-3 de-seeded Jalapenos, 1-1.5 bunch of cilantro,  4-5 fresh garlic cloves and about 2 tble spoons of sugar (to taste) . Blend for about a minute and enjoy not having to be accused of lying...
