I was totally impressed with this restaurant. Me and 3 other ladies were serving jury duty and decided to eat here. We made it aware to the server that we were on a time crunch and she was extremely professional and have us perfect service. The grilled salmon that I ordered was cooked to perfection with a juicy pink center my only issue was that the portion was extremely small compared to a salad with salmon. And my favorite cocktail was their polish fix with vodka, lime juice, and muddled berries. I would recommend this place to everyone!
