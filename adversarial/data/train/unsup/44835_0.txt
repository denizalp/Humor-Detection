Very nice staff and was quick with my order. I had the coconut milk tea and that was delicious. I also ordered the tonkatsu ramen but I was a bit disappointed in that. The broth was just OK, as if it was missing some flavor. But what I did appreciate was the portion of it. I will come back here to try the chicken katsu which is what my friends ordered :)
