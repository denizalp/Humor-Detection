I was really excited to go Butcher and the Rye on NYE, and honestly I've never written a review that was negative towards an establishment based on service so I feel bad having to do this about an establishment that has such high ratings, but I don't want anyone else to get sick.  We ordered the bone marrow which was completely raw.  I'm an adventurous eater but this was extremely questionable. We've had bone marrow many times and it's always been a well cooked meat with nothing to worry about.  I served it to my girlfriend and a couple of my friends. I asked one of the waiters who wasn't our main waiter (who was incredibly kind and nice and understanding of the matter) and he said it's supposed to be buttery, but the fact of the matter is that it was raw. My girlfriend and I were the only two who were brave enough to try it because we thought there wasn't any issue, but it's about 30 min after the fact and we are both sick. \n\nThe drinks were bomb. The ambiance was amazing. The people were great. But the bone marrow was raw as can be. That's not okay.
