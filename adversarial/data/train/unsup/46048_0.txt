Eh. That is the best word that expresses my experience at the buffet at the MGM. \n\nThere isn't anything too special at this buffet beside the fact they serve rock crab legs, other than that, the food here is just...there. \n\nNothing really stood out to me, yeah there was okay brisket and yes there was okay prime rib, but when in Vegas, your expectations are high, especially when it comes to buffets. If this buffet was, let's say in Bay Area, then this would probably be one of the better ones in the Bay. But because it's in Vegas, this ranks as one of the buffets on the bottom of my list. This is probably why the price of this buffet is 40% cheaper than the others. \n\nIf I were to describe this buffet in one sentence it would be this: \"food that gets the job done.\" Because this is what this buffet is good for, a place where you can fill your body up. Don't expect a fine buffet experience, go to the cosmopolitan for that.\n\nI would rather take an uber from the MGM to the cosmopolitan and spend that extra $15-20 to eat at the wicked spoon because its worth it. Take my word for it.
