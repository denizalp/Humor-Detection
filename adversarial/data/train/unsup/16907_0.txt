Absolutely terrible customer service!\nWhen the smug girl on the phone took my order she failed to take my address for delivery. Assuming that they had it on file, I didnt even ask.\n\nFailure one was not checking the address or even bothering to take one. \nAfter an hour and a half I called to see where my pizza was, and was told that she didn't have the right number or the right address. I could hear a guy in the background telling her to tell me she tried calling but had the wrong number.\n\nFailure 2 and 3\nEven if I wasn't lied to about them trying to call, its hard for me to believe that the caller ID couldn't have been matched to the order time to get a correct number.\n\nThe food has never been much more than convenient. But mediocre food and craptastic employees just lost me for good.\nDon't give them your business.
