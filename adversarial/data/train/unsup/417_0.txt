How can I complain, when we paid $33 for a Friday night?  Seriously, I just reviewed the Rio's Seafood Buffet which cost more than that.\n\nOur room was soo much bigger than I was expecting. Sparse in furniture, and yeah, the lamps were weirdly stucco'd or something.  I can't even give a date for the decor.  And yes, the carpets absolutely had stains on them.  And I am thanking God that I am 3\/4 of the way to being legally blind, b\/c when I took my shower the next morning where the showerhead was clearly not environmentally friendly & I was standing in about 3-inches-above-my-ankles of stopped up water from when I started my shower---when I got a load of the ring around the tub after I put in my contacts, I definitely gagged, almost threw up -- but lucky paranoid me, I had stood outside the shower and scrubbed my feet & ankles before toweling off.\n\nAnyway, I think you absolutely get what you pay for.  And it's a pretty good deal, considering what I've heard about some other places.  Maybe all my good deals jinxed my luck, cuz this was my first trip in 7 where I didn't win enough to break even, but oh well, so goes it.  So if you're like us, where all you need is a place to crash, and you don't mind precariously balancing on one foot outside the shower to finish the shower, check this place out :)
