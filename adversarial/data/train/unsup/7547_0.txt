Fun place to chill! This place has huge size games to play such as checkers and jenga. Way cool when hanging here on a Saturday afternoon. There is plenty of space to hang out and not feel squashed. There are plenty of bar locations within the bar to choose from so you are not having to wait forever just to get a drink. I have eaten here as well and the food was okay. I would recommend that you come here more to mingle and have fun. There are plenty of tv's to catch the games plus you have the option of sitting inside or outside. This place has certainly upgraded from how it was years ago.
