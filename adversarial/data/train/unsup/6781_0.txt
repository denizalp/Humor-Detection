My front windshield got cracked by a rock kicked up from the road.  I got a bunch of estimates and this was $100 cheaper then the next best estimate.  I told them I would come in the next day, but then my plans changed and I just  came in the same day no appointment.  They had me out of there in less than an hour and no surprise charges .... I got it at the price they quoted me (no extra fees and the quote included tax).  The windshield they installed seems to be doing the job ... no wind in my eyes.\n\nThe owner was a pleasant fellow.  \n\nWhile I wish they had not tuned my radio to a Christian Radio Station, I guess that's not a bad price to pay for $100 in savings.
