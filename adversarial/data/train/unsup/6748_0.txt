Weird, three reviews in the past month or so -- Fiesta Mall must be putting out psychic waves.\n\nI'm giving this mall an undeserving 5 stars because I lived there when the thing was built. It was very exciting when it opened. I got my second job there -- selling Eva Gabor Wigs to old society ladies in the millinery department of Goldwaters. \n\nI spent many ennui-inducing hours at the arcade while my high-school boyfriend played Battlezone always promising that I could go next. \n\nI ate gyros in the food court, and visited my friends who worked in the various stores -- Warehouse records, Contempo Casuals, Sears, Wicks & Sticks, the Sunglass Hut. That should suffice to date me. \n\nIt was a thrilling big new mall in 1982-83. We thought that \"Tri-City Mall\" was the old outdated mall -- with the oil waterfall feature in the center where the elderly people would congregate with their walkers and canes and the new mothers with their strollers all \"taking a load off\" -- when they weren't eating at \"Sambo's\" -- SAMBO'S! can you even imagine!?\n\nI also knew the kid -- Justin Wolfswinckle or something like that, whose dad had owned the property on which they built Fiesta Mall. His dad took some of the money and bought Justin (then 17) a Lamborghini. Ridiculous really. \n\nSo here's to Fiesta Mall! And to capitalism's continuing love affair with planned obsolesence! Salut!
