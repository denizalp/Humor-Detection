I've been going to Dr. Torres for years, and hadn't really had a bad experience.\nI've never minded waiting for him...because he's a great doctor, listens to ALL my questions and concerns, and is NEVER rushed with me.\n\nHowever, I called Friday morning, with an emergency with my IUD and I needed to be seen. They got me in on Monday, July 1st, but it wasn't going to be with Dr. Torres.\n\nMonday comes, and I show up at 850, because I couldn't remember if my appointment was at 9, or 915... better to show up early anyways, right?\n\nI was told by the ladies that I was seeing a \"Connie\".\n\n I had my daughter with me, and my guy showed up about 930. An hour goes by, and they come get me around 1030 to weigh me, take a urine sample and my blood pressure. The nurse told me that they were just \"waiting for a room\" and that it shouldn't be much longer.\n\nWell, another hour goes by, which means that we had been sitting for two hours, and no doctor has seen me. I finally get called back, and the nurse asks me \"what I am here for \". I tell her that I am not sure, that the scheduler did not tell me what I would be doing.\n\nShe tells me to undress from the waist down. \n\nTen minutes go by, and I have lost my patience. What the EFF is the point of having an appointment and being seen two hours later? I had other things to do that day, and my guy had to get back to work. \n\nI put my pants back on, and we are leaving when this \"connie\" who in all the years I have been coming, have never seen. She asked my why I was here today, and I told her. She felt the need to question that. And then she asked what I was suppose to be \"had done\" today as well.\n\nREALLY? \nYou and your nurse are going to have me take my pants off and you don't even know what you are doing to me?\n\nNo checkout paper was given to me. Only a paper for blood work.\n\nI now have a $43 bill.\nI have never paid more than $20 for a copay here.\nSorry Dr. Torres, but your support staff is terrible.\nI will never see any one besides my doctor again.
