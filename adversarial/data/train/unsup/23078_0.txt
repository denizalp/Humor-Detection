Don't let the location fool you. I mean, yes, it is decorated as though my grandma put her knock knacks in there, and my daughter swears it smells a bit like old people, but the food is so good! We've had breakfast here a few times - I keep ordering the eggs Benedict made with corned beef and Swiss. SO GOOD!!! I have yet to order anything I did not like. Our new fave breakfast spot!!
