Wow, One of the best chicken and waffles I have ever consumed.  The chicken is big, delicious, moist, tender and flavorful.  There is syrup, hot sauce, jalape√±o honey (nice), sriracha syrup and at least one more that you can put in a small cup for dipping or drenching.  \nYou can find their location on the website.  The website also states that nothing is ever frozen and the chicken contains no added hormones, antibiotic or steroids.
