Trying to find this place when you aren't really ever in Planet Hollywood was a little bit hard but eventually possible. If you are looking for cheap but good food and you aren't really feeling like eating McDonalds go to Earl and check them out.\n\nThe sandwich is quite filling and if you aren't really a big eater than I would suggest sharing it with another girlfriend. Everyone seems to like this place a lot and the line can be massive. \n\nIf you aren't a fan of sandwiches than you might not like this place. The desserts are a little bit on the sweet side and not really my taste. \n\nBut if you do need to eat an  your on a budget I would definitely go here and try it out, if you haven't already!
