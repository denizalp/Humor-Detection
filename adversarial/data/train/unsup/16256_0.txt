Wow!!  For a kick-ass breakfast you have got to try the Menage a Trois, which is offered until 11am daily, I believe.  $3.95 for eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, hash browns, and coffee.  And for $1 more, you get your choice of two additional items, such as fried green tomatoes, breakfast quesadilla, pancakes, french toast, and much more.  It's quite an amazing bargain and the food is really good.  Quantity without quality isn't much of a deal, but this place definitely has both.  Not to mention, the atmosphere is quite cozy and cute.  \n\nI just have a couple suggestions for improvement which, if implemented, would make Latitude 41 a true 5-star establishment: \n\n- Kitchen: use larger plates and put the menage a trois and the additional side items all on one big Cheesecake Factory-sized plate.  This would allow food to be delivered more in an all-at-once fashion, which I imagine is preferable to most customers.\n\n- Servers: provide condiments without being asked -- this is pretty basic.  When you're serving toast, why not assume people are gonna want jelly?  Likewise, if you're bringing pancakes and french toast, save yourself a trip and bring along the syrup.
