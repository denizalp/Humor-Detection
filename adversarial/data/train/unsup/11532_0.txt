CONTAIN yourself.\n\nHaving heard so many positive yet diverse comments about DCP, I truly did not know what to expect.  There was the expectation of a \"park\" area, but discovering and exploring all the components of this space made for a fun night for sure.\n\nOn the superb recommendation of my high school classmate, she decided for us both to visit DCP.  She didn't want to stay around the downtown area, yet she didn't want to drive too far.  Thankfully, she was able to find a space near an entrance.  \n\nNOTE: \nParking is street and metered in this area.  Don't forget to feed the machine!\n\nThe space is beautiful!  The \"containers\" form 2 levels around the perimeter of the area\/property.  Situated within the containers themselves, visitors will find shops, restaurants, bars, etc.  Within the center of DCP, there are benches, seating areas, and the \"park\" complete with children's play area and stage (I'm guessing for use for performances\/bands, etc.).\n\nMy friend and initially walked around the first level to get a feel for the area, and then we walked up to the 2nd level.  We settled on a bar\/restaurant that was nearing the tail-end of their happy hour.  We felt very fortunate as it wasn't very crowded and we were able to talk and catch up and not feel rushed.  \n\nPost drinks and appetizers, we had dessert at a gelato shop downstairs and continued our catching up.  One of our last stops was to observe the fired-up praying mantis that guarded the main entrance to DCP.  That was pretty cool to say the least.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nFantastic space.  Family friendly.  Something for everyone honestly:  food, drinks, dessert, and play area for the kids.  \n\nBecome CONTAINED.
