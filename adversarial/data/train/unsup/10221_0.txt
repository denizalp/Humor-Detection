Terrible!  Went here for a friend's birthday celebration and were stayed maybe 5 minutes.\n\nFor starters, it was about 90 degrees in this place.  We started sweating as soon as we walked in the door.\n\nSecond, the \"strippers\" aka (scrawny boys walking around in what looked like toddler's underwear) were not cute.  The crowd was sketchy.  The bartender looked like a 50 year old guido.\n\nNot cute.
