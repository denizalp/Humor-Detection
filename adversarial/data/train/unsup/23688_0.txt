Recently opened and they're operating like they've been in business for awhile...I'm a fan...\n\nOno Service: For a new restaurant, I was really impressed with the kitchen who got our ayce orders out quickly.  The servers stopped by the table frequently to keep the drinks fresh and to check if wanted to put in more orders.  \n\nOno Sushi: The nephew fired away on all the deep fried rolls with lots of extras and everything I sampled was tasty and heavy.  I stuck to the nigiri with my niece and the rice to fish ratio is great!  Looking pretty close to 2:1 on most of the nigiri I ordered.  The fish was fresh and the salmon was especially tasty for me. We ordered extra salmon because I'm extra.  Dessert options of ice cream, sherbets, honey toast and mochi are there for after.\n\nOno Ambiance:  Contemporary asian decor with one main open dining area with a small sushi bar that seats around 6. The two glass walls make the dining area appear larger than it really is. I saw some picnic type tables to accommodate parties of 6+. Nicely decorated where a casual quiet date night is totally doable.  \n\nOverall this is another great ayce sushi option in Vegas on the east side of town.  I'm looking forward to checking out their ramen and other non-sushi dishes when I don't have time for ayce but that's another yelp tale.  Enjoy!
