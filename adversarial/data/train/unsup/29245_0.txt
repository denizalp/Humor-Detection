Called electronics department to replace a piece of dead hardware.  Clerk got the item from the shelf and it matched what I needed.  Price actually less then on Internet site.  Clerk told me he would keep it at the electronics desk.  This was about 5:30 PM.  Got there at 7 PM.   Clerk on duty had no idea what I was talking about.  No such product on shelf.  No such item behind the counter at the desk.  Insisted he was only clerk on duty during time period.  Never shopping for anything at Target ever again.
