The Venetian provides a rare all suite hotel in Las Vegas. We decided to celebrate my birthday here and I enjoyed many aspects of this property. For example the standard suite included three televisions in our room, down pillows, and upgraded bedding. We originally stayed in an updated standard suite. \n\nUnfortunately, I decided to pay more and upgrade to the Pallazo suite for the last 2 nights of my stay. This suite is much larger than the standard suite, but the furniture and furnishings were dated. I am not blaming the hotel for my mistake. However, I am a bit surprised that the suite was in some ways a downgrade. The staff was professional and hospitable, but did not offer anything for my birthday. Perhaps it is hotel policy to not offer amenities for birthdays.
