Servpro helped me clean up my worst nightmare! My toilet supply line gave out while we were at work where water was left to trickle downstairs ALL DAY! I came home to find my downstairs floors soaking wet; Carpet, tile and pergo flooring throughout. I had no idea where the water was coming from until I looked up and found water dripping down from hanging sheetrock on my living room ceiling! I found the bathroom where the leak had began and eventually was able to get the water turned off at the source. What a mess!! \nI called Servpro, spoke with Denise and about an hour later I had Scott and Paul on my doorstep. They immediately began extracting the standing water to save carpet and tile. The pergo flooring did not end up so lucky and had to be removed due to the wood expanding. I was concerned about mildew or mold growing due to the water damage but Scott was able to sanitize the area to prevent that from happening. The guys worked all night to clean up and set up their drying equipment. They both were super nice and worked efficiently to make sure I was taken care of!\nDenise was able to walk me through the whole process and she was extremely helpful with any questions I had in regards to my insurance company and completing my claim. I can't tell you how he was able to work with my adjuster directly and alleviate my stress! I hope I never have a need for water damage repair but I will definitely keep their phone number on hand if anything like this ever happens again. Thank you Servpro!!
