Welp.  Its unavoidable to compare Chez Nous on Grand with Char's over on 7th Ave, so I will do a dual-analysis of these spots.\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE:\nChar's is just a friendlier place.  Their doorman doesn't DEMAND his $5 like a put-out paperboy.  Chez's does.  Its kind of annoying and unsettling as your introduction to a night of hi-falutin drinking and lo-falutin boogieing.  Char's clientle seems to be in higher spirits and more polite as well.  Chez's are chilly.  Burrr.  If you stand in front of their seat to order a drink from the bar (because they went to go dance or something) they will let you know that you may NOT continue to stand there, even for a second.  The bartenders at both places are sweet and quick about their service.\n\nTHE DRINKS:\nWeak at both places, but IIRC, they are cheaper at Chez.  The no-card policy at Chez is a nuisance, so Char's is preferable here.  They both serve the typical booze and beer, so nothing really stands out other than the cost (Chez cheaper) and the convenience (Char's takes card).\n\nTHE MUSIC:\nThey are both MANIACALLY cool spots for some soul-funk-blues and great dance floors to boot.  This is the main reason to but up with any inconveniences, small or large, at either place.  \n\nTHE SET-UP:\nJust packed at both places.   If you want to come at a decent hour, you won't get a seat.  So, just forget about it.  Both buildings are pretty neat setups.  Chez is more of a railroad-style-room, and Chars more of a dance-hall set up.  Both have smoking patios, though Char's is small and quaint with tables and a busy atmosphere, while Chez's is (assuming) not complete and barren but large.  \n\nOVERALL:\nChar's Has the Blues AND the lead over Chez due to the fact that I can't seem to get over the vibe that I don't belong to \"The Secret Club\" ...shhhhh ... over at Chez.  But whatever, the drinks, music, and dancing will get me going at either place.
