This place is Huge and lots of fun for all. It's nice, clean, and tires out the little ones. You will thank yourself later when they go to bed that night - exusted. \n\n We have been once to check it out. Its $20 an hour per person but that hour can be plenty for a first time patron. My child loved it so much he begged to have his birthday party there.\n\nBooking the party was a breeze. Packages to pick from and dates and times that were available. They even called 2 days before the event to confirm times, amount of kids and all the food we ordered. Which was great. We chose a Saturday afternoon and this place was very busy. The great thing about this place is you can fill out the waiver and set-up an account online before arriving. So you're not standing in line trying to do this. A real breeze and time saver. You can also do this if you're just going in, not just for a birthday party.\n\nThe kids had a blast. They had an hour to go ahead and jump around, 30 minutes to come back to our table and have food and cake, than another hour to jump and play. A party is 2.5 hours and that was more than plenty. The kids were pooped, sweaty and had so much fun. The great thing is, we also had a host who took care of everything (timing things, when the food was ready, keeping the kids on track, decorations, plates etc). The only thing we needed to take care of was bringing a birthday cake and goodie bags for the kids. They took care of everything else and was a stress-free birthday party. Which doesn't happen too often.\n\nI think all parents should take their kids here at least once. Plenty to do for all ages and what's not to love about a trampoline park? Highly recommended.
