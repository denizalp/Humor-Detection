$8 flat rate for any pizza. It's definitely a good deal. They have some signature pizzas that you can choose from or you can choose to build your own. The concept is very similar to the many fast casual restaurants that are popping up (Chipotle, Qdoba, Subway, etc.) \n\nIf you choose to build your own, you get unlimited toppings for the flat rate of $8. They have numerous sauce options that you can pick from for the base of your pizza, so it makes it easy to be adventurous with your creation. The meats, cheeses, and veggies are plentiful in choices as well. They do not have a shortage of toppings to choose from! They have something for everyone here! \n\nI have eaten here a few times and I have not been disappointed with the quality of food or service. I have had a chance to have a conversation with Tony, the owner, and he is genuinely a good guy who cares about all of his customers. \n\nIt's a good place to pick up a quick meal, and I plan on returning for future visits.
