Charles is absolutely the best!  He is gifted and a master at what he does.  He does a perfect job, whether it's botox or fillers or fixing botched jobs from other places, all of which I've personally experienced. More important,  he is also completely honest and of exceedingly good character, not just after your money as so many are in the medspa business.  I would never go to anyone but him for cosmetic needs.
