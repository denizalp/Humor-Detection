Me and my son stopped in to try the food and the place was great! The other customers were having a great time. The employers were always walking around making sure everything was good. We were seated quickly, the waitress was so nice. The food was incredible! I couldn't get over how tender the pulled pork and brisket was! It was so huge too! It took me a couple days to eat and was great every day! I can't wait to go back!
