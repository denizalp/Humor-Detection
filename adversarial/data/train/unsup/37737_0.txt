I became familiar with At Your Service because they always have a table at Yappy Hour.  The guy that mans it is always friendly and very generous with the treats, as my dog tends to stalk his table just waiting for him to give her something.  They were also recommended by a friend involved with dog rescue.  As far as I know they are the only store that carried a particular cage muzzle I was looking for versus ordering it online.  I took my little \"Cujo\" with me so he could try it on.  The store is large.  If you are a fan of healthy, natural, high quality dog food and products this is the store for you.  Customer service was great.  The clerk spent a lot of time going over my dogs aggression and anxiety issue and offered me a card of a trainer that works with rescued dogs at a discount.  They fact that they also have dog adoption events at their store is another plus in my book.
