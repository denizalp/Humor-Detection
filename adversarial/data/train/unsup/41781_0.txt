So disappointing. The lines were insane. We bought tickets ahead of time and by the time we got through the line to buy tokens and the line to get a margarita it was literally two hours before we got anything to drink. Then another 30 min line to get a taco. The organization to buy tokens was terrible. There was such a long line but then there was a steady flood of people who had just gotten in and weren't waiting in line who went directly to the front and the security guy was catering more to to the people cutting than to the people who had been waiting for 45 mins. It was terrible. Will never go again
