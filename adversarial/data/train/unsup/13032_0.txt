My new favorite Viet spot in town -\n\nI now don't have to make a 4 hour drive to So Cal (@ Brodard's) and get their famous Nem Nuong Spring Rolls - these are so damm addicting. It's better than crack !  Trust me, they do it just right with each spring roll made fresh to order, wrapped perfectly and everything inside is a symphony in your mouth with all the textural flavors.  Then you dip it in the sauce - rinse and repeat.  Order both the pork and the shrimp paste b\/c they'll be gone before you know it.\n\nAlso love their Chicken Pho here - they bring the chicken on the side with a sauce you dip it in.  Their Bo luc lac, shaking beef, is also pretty decent along with the Banh Khot, the smaller Banh Xeo.  I personally prefer the Banh Xeo b\/c i love bean sprouts but if you want the Mini Me version, get the Banh Khot.\n\nGreat cafe sua da -iced coffee too!
