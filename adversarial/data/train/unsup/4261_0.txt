I had their CA burrito combo for lunch on a Thursday \n\n- A CA burrito without fries? Big time FAIL. Disappointing. \n- Red sauce was good.\n- I think this is 'nuff said. Take it off the menu if you can't make it right. lol. \n- Don't come here for Americanized Mexican food. Great for people that never had SD Mexican food.\n- Their hard shredded beef tacos were tasty.
