Regal, Regal, Regal,  do you treat me like a king at this location?   Hell no, not on my last visit with them!   \n\nThis past weekend, I took one of my friends to see the  IMAX Iron Man in 3D, and the flick was a pretty good movie, but the experience was flawed at the end, some of it was my fault, and the other was someone else.\n\nCatching the final episode of the night, there wasn't too many people in the auditorium for this slightly overpriced movie deal.   I question Regal's mock up of the IMAX screens and seating in this theater because it's not configured to the specification of a true IMAX theater.    Sorry Regal, but putting a IMAX projector into a regular stadium seating screen room is like putting a Lamborghini engine into a Honda Accord.   \n\nThe usual stadium seat are the norm for any movie house, but it's incorrect for IMAX.  On the other hand, the air conditioning levels is going to be the perfect for the up coming summer block busters.\n\nWhy the two star rating?   Well, I'm going to take a some blame for this, but not all of it.    There always some kind of final scene at the end of the credits for the majority of  Marvel comic movie , and we sat through the entire reel to see it.    Well, we were the last ones out of the auditorium, and I forgot my cellphone in the soda cup holder.    I didn't realize it was missing until it was 10:00 am (which was nine hours later)   So booked down to see the manager on duty to see if they had my phone, well they didn't, and the no customers were going inside till 11:30am (first showing of the day is 12:00pm)    The funny thing, I called my cellphone carrier to report it missing\/stolen, and they told me someone use it at 3:00 am.    Oh well, I was out of contract with my carrier anyway, and just got upgraded today, but if you can't see through this Regal....I would start watching someone at night.    \n\nPersonally, I'm staying with Regal's Fiesta location from now on.
