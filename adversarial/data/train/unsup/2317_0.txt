This company is a gem. After paying $80 for a ride from Yuma airport to Scottsdale with YellowCab, I was disheartened by travel fares. I still needed to get around tho, and I was happy to have come across this company. Very reasonable fares, and she even went out of her way to avoid the construction zone when that would have driven the meter up. The driver was friendly and accommodating, and had many suggestions for places to eat in the area. She even came back to pick me up when she said she would, even tho I asked at the last minute. Thanks for providing a great service!
