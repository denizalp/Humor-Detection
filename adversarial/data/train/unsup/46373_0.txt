5 stars for a 5 star job of taking care of our party of 33 without any problems!\n\nI called a week before and made the reservation, no problems.  We were seated once our entire group arrived, which was a tad annoying that we had to wait for everyone, but it is understandable.\n\nEveryone's order was correct.  No one made a face about having to deal with such a large group. Service was fast and friendly. \n\nThey won't split the check on huge groups, but we managed to all chip in enough to cover the bill in one go.  \n\nVegetarians can get the usual Italian stuff - manicotti, ravioli, pasta with marinara.  All meals come with soup or salad, garlic bread, a side of pasta (if you don't get pasta as your meal), cappuccino, and most importantly - free house wine (and yes they bring refills)!  Plan on $25-40\/person depending on how nuts you want to get.\n\nThe garlic bread is a particular winner.
