I have returned to this restaurant several times since our initial visit. I cannot say enough about the quality of this food, it is stellar. It's a very nice space and service is usually very good to excellent. But again, the food! The spices and herbs that are used are so unique and so delicious. We have returned with my mother and our neighbors on separate visits and all of them have absolutely raved about the quality and tastes of this food. It has become one of our most favorite places to dine in Las Vegas.\n\nYou can walk out extremely full on 5 to 7 plates, shared between two individuals. The prices do tend to run a bit on the high side though, which is the only drawback. Right now, with the code offering 50% off for locals, it is an absolute wonderful deal that you should consider taking advantage of between now and December 23.\n\nI should also mention, they have gluten-free and vegan menus.
