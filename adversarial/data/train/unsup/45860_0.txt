Hawaiian Fusion...mmmm....good.\n\nTheir sushi rolls (loved the Lakanilau - the accompanying sauce is to die for) make great appetizers, and the chocolate souffle is a MUST for dessert.  Cocktails are pricey but very tasty.  We liked the capirhina and the sangria.\n\nI had the Shellfish Sampler ($33.95), which came with 2 large pieces of shrimp and 2 large scallops as well as part of a lobster tail with risotto.  Doesn't sound like a lot of food, but it's quality of quantity with this meal.  So good.\n\nMy husband had the Roy's Trio ($30.95) w\/ hibachi salmon, blackened ahi, and misoyaki butterfish.  He loved it and says he would definitely, definitely get it again.\n\nOur group ordered a variety of things, but I also want to add that if you're not necessarily in the seafood mood, my friend ordered the beef short ribs and nearly passed out from shear joy.  Said it was the best ribs he'd ever had.
