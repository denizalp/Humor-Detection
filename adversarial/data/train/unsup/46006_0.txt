I've lived in Las Vegas since 1990. This was my first time going to this restaurant tonight.  The place was nice on the inside but the quality of the food for the price was terrible. You only got one choice of soup which came to me luke warm. Then the main course steak pasta meal was very bland. Steak wasn't seasoned and the meal itself tasted like nothing. Then they give you a cappochino that has no espresso or coffee content.  To rub it in my face in the end it came to over $70. Olive garden isn't authentic Italian but if you want better quality food I suggest going there or any other Italian place. I wasn't the only one that complained that night. A couple across from us asked to speak to the chef about the food. Don't understand how they lasted for so long but they have definitely lost there way since it first opened. You know the celebrities wouldn't eat this garbage.
