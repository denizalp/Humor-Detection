I've been enjoying Squarz for the past couple of years and was super excited when they opened up a cafe near where I live in Tempe.  I first heard about them through some friends who found them at local farmers markets and are regular customers and raved about the pies. My favorites have been the spinach and feta pie, the chicken pot pie, and especially the shepard's pie, which reminds me of tasty pies I had when travelling in England and Australia. I'm a huge sucker for savory pies, especially with the wonderful flaky crust that Squarz has. The croissants are also excellent with the perfect flaky texture and buttery flavor that can be so hard to find!\n\nThe pies change seasonally, based on ingredients that are available during that season, so there is usually something new to try in addition to the regular rotation of pies. There are also desserts available, although the focus is definitely on the savory side. \n\nThe new cafe is cute and intimate and has a variety of fresh salads and warm pies which is perfect for a quick lunch. I haven't tried the curry pies yet but those are next on the list, I know people who have had them really love them!
