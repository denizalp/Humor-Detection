Went for a birthday in February of 2016. \n\n1) The food was really enjoyable. I got to try about 7 different dishes and they were all between pretty good and great.\n2) Oddly disproportionate portion sizes. Obviously part of this is based on the relative price ingredients used, but most of the group seemed to find it hard to know how much to order. Some couples ordered 3 dishes and were stuffed, others ordered 4 and were barely full.\n3) Slightly pricey but I enjoyed the food, and it's just the norm in trendy parts of Toronto.\n4) The service was quite slow, and the two staff members we interacted with most were not agreeable at all. One was generally snippy and one smiled at the table an visibly switched to a scowl the moment he turned away (on one occasion he seemed to be muttering something, but I couldn't hear it...) Bad days happen but this was excessive; none of the servers seemed to be enjoying the work at all.\n\nIn all fairness, it sucks to serve a table of 12, so I'll probably go back as a table of 2 or 4 to give the restaurant a shot. If the service is the same I won't go back because the quality of the food doesn't make up for the attitude we dealt with. Fingers are crossed that's not the case though.
