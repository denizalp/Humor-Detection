Service was great! - Food was pretty terrible. \n\nWe tried Hamberg steak and a Kalbi+Kimchi fried rice combo. They can't survive in North York with this kind of food unless they're ready to step up their game.\n\nThe hamberg steak was pretty much a burger patty on a skillet, not the Asian 'Hamberg' steak. Literally I could see the ground beef ribbons, they didn't even bother to mix in anything. It was literally, a patty of ground beef with nothing.\n\nKalbi and Kimchi fried rice was really bad. The kalbi was so dry and chewy my boyfriend couldn't eat it. It was like beef jerky. I think it was just sitting there and they kept reheating it and reheating it. The Kimchi fried rice had frozen vegetables inside and was wet like bibimbap and not dry like 'fried rice'. The kimchi they used was sweet and not very Korean tasting.\n\nMaybe for highschool students looking for an alternative to McDonalds this would be OK. For me, I wouldn't go back here again.
