I am most conflicted. I have met Sheridan Su and he is a great guy. But the restaurant Chris and Joseph went to recently was nowhere close to the restaurant I ate at. Hey it's great to have friends write puff reviews but in the long term it truly does Sheridan a disservice.\n\nFirst, the good- the Pot Stickers. Yes, they were good and tasty. But once the order was placed they took 30 minutes to come out  and there were only a handful of people in the restaurant.  Plus I saw Sheridan AND another cook in the kitchen.  Does this neighborhood really support five small Pot Stickers selling for seven bucks?\n \nThis is my major beef with Fat Choy, there is a total disconnect with the menu and the neighborhood. Examples: They open for breakfast at 8am...this is a working class area...the working class is at work at 8am...also, pancakes and eggs sell for eight bucks...again maybe that works but not here. How about a breakfast special to draw people in...this is not Robuchon's...\n\nBack to the meal. I ordered  beer and I believe they brought me something close to a 40oz...I laughed...largest bottled beer I have ever had with dinner...who came up with that...\n\nPork Belly BLT....I was excited to try this, unfortunately the pork belly was more like bacon bits...there were hardly any there...I asked for extra sriracha mayo and there was not enough to even taste...and the bread was totally soaked in grill grease...absolutely brutal execution...\n\nPlease understand I want nothing but success for Sheridan. But I have never walked out of a restaurant feeling the owner had such a disconnect with concept and presentation as what Sheridan has done with Fat Choy. An intervention is needed without which Fat Choy will be gone by June.
