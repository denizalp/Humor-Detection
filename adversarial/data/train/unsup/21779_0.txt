From the outside, seeing the faded sign and run down building, if I were in LA, I wouldn't dare go in.\n\nI went on a weekday at about 3pm, as you could see from other Yelpers' posting, they had plenty of tables. The day I went they had plenty of empty tables. But I was ushered to a small table right at the entrance. What the F**k!! I refused to sit there and demanded an inside table.\n\nAs others had said, it is hard to find half decent Pho in Phoenix. Since Vietnamese restaurants are few in Phoenix, so you wouldn't be surprised the services are at the low end of the spectrum compare with LA, SanFran, or Las Vegas.\n\nThe food is OK, 3Stars.
