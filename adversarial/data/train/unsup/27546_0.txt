Cleo never fails. This is our 2nd time here and we absolutely enjoy every time. The food, the ambience, the service, the drinks. Everything. Such a cute place. \n\nFood- being local, from dec 1st-23rd. All restaurants except bazaar is HALF OFF. Including alcohol!! You just need you players card. What a deal so we couldn't resist but go to Cleo again. We ordered about 4 items. Started with the hummus with tahini with their pita bread. SO GOOD. Then we ordered the 3 kebabs for $29 which is the burribatta sausage which taste like salami, though that was the best, the lamb kefta which my boyfriend thought that was the best and the chicken which is nice also, not dry. The dish came with saffron rice as well. Then we ordered the scallops, TO DIE FOR. The favorite thing we ordered in my opinion, had this salad topped off with it with this sauce. It was sooooo delicious. And then we also ordered the grilled octopus which we love ordering at places but this grilled octopus was a little too sour for our palates. It was cooked well though. Just didn't expect the sourness in the sauce they put it in. By then we were stuffed. Along with dinner we ordered cocktails, my boyfriend ordered the gardo which was Hennessy and champagne and I order the vinebury which was super refreshing, it was like a spicy mojito. \n\nAmbience- super cute, very rustic and modern which tan leather booths, lighting is dark but it sets the right mood and atmosphere for it. There's books and shelves as decor. A lot of brown and white. Not too loud, not too busy at all. \n\nService- can't complain. Our waitress was super accommodating. She recommended our drinks and some things to order. We were totally surprised the alcohol was included for the half off deal. Couldn't ask for anything else. Our waitress was super nice and didn't rush us at all. \n\nOverall, an amazing experience. Love Cleo.
