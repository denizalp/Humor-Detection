Tell me I am crazy, I did not consume any brats during the time I was here.  WHAT!\n\nI will say that the cheese curds are pure delicious cheesey goodness, their bloody mary's are above par for a packed college bar in the morning, and their service was great.\n\nThe location is prime... this is some perfect people watching here.  Stamp of approval.
