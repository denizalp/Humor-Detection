I purchased a bike for a friend.  When the bike was delivered he had trouble assembling it and called the store. They had delivered the wrong instructions with the bike.  The man at the store insulted my friend and told him to ignore a certain part.  It turns out that was the part that needed to be assembled.\n\nA  few months later the battery broke and we called the store to see what the warranty was but did not tell him we already bought.  He said it was covered.  When we arrived at the store he wanted to charge us and we told him about the phone conversation and he said he did not know who we talked to and was not going to honour it even though I know it was him.  \n\nThen I had to move my car and went out and realized I had left my receipt for the bike inside.  My friend went to get it and he would not give it back and said he was going to hit my friend!  My friend then said there was a cop outside and that he was going to get him and then he gave back the receipt and my friend left with the battery still not repaired.\n \nDo not buy from this old man! His product is junk and once he has your money you are **** out of luck.  By the way they moved the store to Carlaw Ave. probably to run away from all of their angry customers.
