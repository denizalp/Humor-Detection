This place hands down has the best Pho in the valley! Yes the place is dirty and a total dive but that just adds to the experience.. if it were clean I don't think it would be very good. My theory is that Vietnamese places are usually a little dirty cause it's good luck! \n\nThe BBQ pork Bánh mì just makes my mouth so damn horny! I'm dripping just thinking about it! Be sure to try the Bánh mì bo kho (beef stew), its the best Ive had and none in Westminster or Santa Ana have come close.
