Introducing Sport Chek meets Athlete's World.\n\nIntersport is your standard sporting goods store and they carry sporty brands like Billabong, Oakley, Columbia, Merrel, etc.\n\nIt's a convenient store to have in the mall, but the service leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nGood selection, however limited styles.\n\nNot bad, but far from the best.
