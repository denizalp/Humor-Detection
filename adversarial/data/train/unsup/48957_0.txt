Was in town for the Steelers game of course!  Drove around the area the night before and the stadium just happened to be open....not to walk around the whole thing, but at least to walk in and go into the store, which was exciting!!!  \nDay of game was awesome...pleasant staff!  Stadium is HUGE and beautiful!!!  Loved seeing the walk of fame and all the other awards along the stadium in cases.  Good location, easy to find, plenty of parking!  Sat in section 529 which yes, was up high, but still a perfect view of the field!  Can't wait to return!!!!
