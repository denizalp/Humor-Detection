The steak was okay. A little gritty and not as tender as I'd hope. The Flemings Potatos were terrible! They wern't cooked all the way. Our drinks sat empty quite often. They forgot the butter for our king crab legs and we had to remind them a few times to bring it. For dinner at $150\nI would expect better. We wished that we had gone elsewhere.
