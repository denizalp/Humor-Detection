Bad vibes from second you walk in. Bunch of old men and super small like a match box. Sat at bar, bartender didn't acknowledge us and then we look at their VERY awkward menu and my boyfriend and I frequent at Steak44 and City Hall and have steak knowledge. When we asked if they had a porterhouse cut, bartender looked like we were aliens. He said he had to ask the chef because they don't normally carry it and saw him go to the manager. I've heard the food and service was bad and after our greeting we decided not to waste any money in that awkward place.  Very disappointing. City Hall worth the bucks!
