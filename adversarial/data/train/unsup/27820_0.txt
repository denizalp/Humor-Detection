I had lunch here today and it was nothing special. I had their dim sum and I think the the taste was just mediocre.  The quality of the food was alright as it didn't taste bad, but was not super tasty as well. \n\nI only waited for about for about 5 minutes for my table. The food came about relatively quick, but I didn't see the waiter come by again until I finished my meal.
