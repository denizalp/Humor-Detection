What can I say about a place that has a ton of flavored vodka and rum? I can say \"Whoohooo, Fruity Beverage!\". That's when we get every flavor of rum and mix it in a blas then put a half inch of OJ on top. Mmmm......\n They have a wide variety of things I don't see anywhere else.  Baron Jaeger, a honey flavored, belly warming, yummy shot. Tastes like pure honey.\n There are many others, you'll have to wander and see what grabs your eye and yells \"PUT ME IN YOUR MOUTH!\".\n Aisles are just wide enough yo get a cart through, employees aren't over the top friendly, I imagine they deal with a lot through a shift so I cut them a little slack. \n Cold beer is at a minimum, so plan on having to put yours in the fridge for a while. \nParking is easy, getting out on the street is easy as long as you're going north, otherwise, well, poor, poor you.  Hehehe
