Heard a lot about this place and the food is pretty good. We came at around 2pm on a rainy day and tried to be quick because it was an hour before closing. We seated ourselves and had a good meal of about $20 and a $4 tip. \n\nI got the meatloaf (mashed potatoes and roasted veggies that were a little too hard but still good and helped me few healthy to balance out the heavy meat and potatoes and it also made the plate look good with so much color presentation wise) and my bf got 3 side items (flapjack, egg, and bagel). He was pretty full of his side items so I helped him finish his food. The flapjack was a little too moist for him and he wasn't sure if it was undercooked or not but it was yummy with the warm maple syrup.  \n\n\nIt was a nice start to our day and wasn't too costly. I enjoyed the food and would probably order the Belgian waffles (my bfs mom took some to go one time so I got I tried them and they were DELICIOUS especially with the mixed berries)
