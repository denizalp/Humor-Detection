I definitely give this place 5 stars, my husband and I came in yesterday (same day I broke my precious phone ). And long story short he was professional and we were happy with his work. Not only was my phone cracked, my led was done for. He was able to replace both parts for an affordable price!! Before I found him I called & inquired on other places and because my phone is an S Plus, they charge at least $200 for JUST the screen (I had no idea about the whole LED part of the phone however). But overall we are very happy with his service and had to wait about 45 minutes! Which was perfectly fine, craft can't be rushed!! And with my clumsy self my husband and I will definitely be returning if we ever need anymore work done!
