ORDER: Masala Dosa, Sweet Lassi (don't get it), mango shake\n\nPros:\n- Huge selection of food; from my understanding, they have a buffet (I believe at lunch time), however I've always stopped by for dinner, never lunch\n- Offers interesting novelty foods- masala dosas are definitely different from the typical perception of \"Indian cuisine\"\n- DISCLAIMER: When the menu reads \"SPICY\", trust me when I say... IT IS REALLY SPICY. I've ordered dishes here that didn't even state (on the menu) that they were spicy, but they were. Their dishes make my tongue cry sometimes... \n\nCons: \n- Restaurants that offer meat dishes typically offer vegetarian options... why is it not the same vice versa? The Nilgiris is an all vegetarian restaurant\n- Service has gotten worse over the past year (I'm a regular). Their waiters used to be girls who were more attentive to customer needs.\n- This isn't necessarily a con-- but just keep in mind that you're supposed to go up to the register when it comes time to pay (they don't bring the bill to you). \n\nThey've started to cheap out. I used to receive potato salad with any\/every meal that I ordered here and they've taken that away. Also, the last time I ordered masala dosa, they cut my meal up into rectangles... WHY?! The waiters also tend to listen to my needs\/orders and don't come back at all. If that's the case, I'd rather settle for typical indian cuisine where my needs as a customer are met . NO SIR, I DON'T WANT SOME MORE.
