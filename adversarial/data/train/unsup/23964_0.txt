I have eaten here 3 times and I cannot believe I haven't written anything about this up and coming celebrity chef  Rick Moonen and his restaurant!  Met the chef he's a cool crazy guy.\n\nI might be bias considering I know the workers one in particular.\n\nThe staff are very polite, pleasant, and helpful.  The hostess were \"okay\".  We usually sit in the back at the sushi bar.  They usually tell us there's a 10 minute wait, but all the times I've been there there's no one? hmmmm?  I don't know. You tell me? LOL.  \n\nI did wait in the restaurant for my friend to get his paycheck and I've been ask many times if I was okay, or wanted any water. I thought that was service excellence  right there! = 0) = 0)\n\nI just ate there this past Sunday for lunch.  I did post some pictures.  My BF had the cat fish sloppy joe! Now that was different YUMM-CIOUSSSS! hahahhaa.  They have their own home made chips.  It was good, but a little salty.  My roomie had the tun melt on brioche bread.  I think its new on the menu.  I had the RM burger.  Very juicy.  \n\nI have yet to eat upstairs in their fine dinning restaurant. When I do, I'll be  updating!
