These pastries are not to be trifled with, no comparison comes to mind.\nI've been to plenty of places, but amazing apple's hard to find.\nYou can quote me, if you'd like.\nI'd suggest you take a hike,\nTo Manon, a destination to unwind!\n\nManon came highly suggested for a sampling of their $1.10 French macarons, of course I couldn't pass that up, especially since I was just a half mile away. I took a quick look through their displays and discovered they had some pastries with apple, and some filled with cr√®me, a few with raspberries, and chocolate too. If there is a dessert filled with Apple, you can rest assured I'm going to order it, and Manon had two. I chose to the French apple tart this time, I'll save the other for my next time through. It's not often that a pastry makes you blush, but this French apple tart sure did ;-)\n\nThe macarons were amazing, but the surprise winner here was the raspberry gourmandise. Rest assured I'll be back for that one when I visit again. If you've not been to Manon yet, I would strongly urge you to check your reservations and come by for some of the best pastries I've ever had.\n\nHappy Yelping!
