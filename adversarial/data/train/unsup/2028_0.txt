New location looks awesome. Had a great time playing bowling and shuffleboard. I like that you can take your picture for the bowling scorecard. Funny cartoons proceed after each bowl. He actual shuffleboard was very long and slippery. A lot of fun though. Food and drink options are vast. There's also an arcade, laser tag and some sort of zip line. There's also a prize redemption center. I'll definitely come back!
