I am a fan and will come back to enjoy their fantastic happy hour from 3-6 again!\n\nThey make an Amazing pink cosmopolitan martini, I was really enjoying them throughout the evening.\n\nThis place is dark and cozy with a touch of class! The service is great with friendly staff who really complete your experience.\n\nThis is a great spot to meet up for a drink and just unwind from a long day of work or sex. \n\nI only wish I had been a visitor sooner as this is a nice spot that I have passed a kazillion times however never stopped in.\n\nI will be back for happy hour for sure, with $5 Amazing strong cocktails how can you go wrong! Don't forget to try the pink cosmopolitan, you won't regret it I promise!
