I don't know about you, but the one person I would trust most in the field of tacos would be a luchador. If a Mexican wrestler can vouch for an establishments tacos, then really, they've just got to be good. And due to the number of luchador paintings in Cien Agaves, I think it's just a fact that these are some of the most delicious tacos in Old Scottsdale.\n\nThese wee little tacos can be ordered a la carte, or in a combo of 2 or 3 plus rice and beans. Go for three. Sure, two would fill you up, but why would you waste an opportunity to try yet another variety of taco? THAT would be ridiculous. I opted for an all seafood night, chowing down on a beer battered ono taco, the island shrimp taco (served with an awesome tangy and sweet sauce), and an ahi tuna taco. The first two were glorious, some of the best i'd ever had. They weren't huge, but they were stuffed liberally. This is especially true of the plump shrimp, which didn't taste remotely Mexican to me, but were delicious nonetheless. I unfortunately didn't care for the ahi tacos, and I love ahi tuna. They weren't bad, just very average. And average looks bad when next to glory. \n\nOH and did I mention habanero-lime margaritas? Sure they have plenty of different, unique flavors (hibiscus, blood-orange, prickly pear, cucumber) but that habero-lime is the perfect mix of refreshing and a kick. I would have had a dozen, if they'd had let me. \n\nWho knows when I'll be back in Scottsdale, but when I am, I'll be sure to chow down at Cien Agaves. And maybe even steal one of those luchador paintings!
