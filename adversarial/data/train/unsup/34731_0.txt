This book store has friendly helpful staff.  I stopped to pick up audio books for my drive back to Idaho.  The same lady helped me my entire visit and was cheerful and sweet.  \nThe store is clean, well lit, organized.  The bathrooms were clean and well maintained.\n\nI recommend Barnes and Noble contact the Starbucks Manager on their staff.\nThere is a Starbucks in the same building which is convenient; however, the staff running the counter at Starbucks was doom and gloom and frankly rude and acted \"put out\" to take my order.  I am a Starbucks gold card member and have ordered Starbucks coffee from Oregon to Kentucky..California to Illinois.  I expect a smile and a \"thank you\" for your business, not what I got in Champaign Illinois Starbucks inside Barnes and Noble.  Get your coffee somewhere else!!!
