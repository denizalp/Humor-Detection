Open till 2:00 am for you drunkies or concert goers.  Maybe I was a little drunk, and I just left a concert, and I do love hot dogs... Just not Haute Doggerys.  They use a good dog, but they are steamed, not grilled, so they aren't getting maximum snap on their casings.  No bueno.  In addition, they are on the small side, and their chili is somewhat forgettable.  If you are just looking for something to soak up the alcohol then this might be your place, but don't come here looking for a gourmet dog experience.
