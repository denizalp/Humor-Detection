Just opened recently in a nice small plaza that is still growing. \n\nOrdered the Breakfast Sausage Sandwich and the Chicken Sandwich and as you check in to Yelp you get a free cookie and we choose the overachiever. \n\nSandwiches were average size and a nice change of pace from  everyday burgers and pizza. They are good, the decor is a different mix of modern and homey feel.\n\nThe person at the cashier was not the most appealing person to be at the front and greeting people
