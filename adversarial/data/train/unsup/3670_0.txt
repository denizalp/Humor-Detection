The church says it's \"Baptist\" but their far from it. They don't use the King James Bible therefore their preaching is water-down and shallower than a frisbee. They have no soulwinning but they pay a lot of phony missionaries since there so lazy to go out, knock on doors and open their mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel. Wake up, hell is real.
