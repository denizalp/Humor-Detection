It is so nice to know a \"bug guy\" who you can rely on in the Valley. Based on the reviews here on Yelp, I decided to have Jason out to our home. I also waited until he serviced our home twice before writing this review as anyone can be a \"one hit wonder\". BTW, we live in what's known as \"scorpion alley\".\n\nPros:\n\n- He's a super nice guy. I enjoyed talking to him about non-bug stuff as well.\n- He knows his stuff. I don't think I've met many people who know more about scorpions, spiders, cockroaches, beetles, etc. If you have a question, he can answer it.\n- He's super passionate about what he does. You won't find many more people who loves bugs, and subsequently killing them, more than Jason.\n- He's fair and honest. Jason doesn't come off as a used car salesman. He wants to earn your business. He doesn't charge you for what is unnecessary, only for what you need.\n- He's thorough. I had him out at 10pm for our first appt and we walked every square inch of my yard. He pointed out place that I could improve landscaping, caulking, fixtures, etc to help some of the pest control myself.\n- He's earned a customer in me. All of those things above helped, but the bottom line, he got the job done. We've had great results and plan on having Jason out on a routine bases to keep the problem under control.\n\nCons:\n\n- I'll only get to see him a few times a year because he has done such a good job.\n- There are less scorpions for me to hunt, which I enjoy.\n\nThanks again Jason. \n\nOh, and in case you guys are wondering, we killed around 80 scorpions the first time he came out. Since then, about 5 months, I've killed 8.
