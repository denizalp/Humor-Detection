Typically I rent with Enterprise but this agency was a little cheaper. When I arrived it was not my typical lot filled with selections but the team made sure I was put in a car that I was comfortable in. The shuttle from the airport ran frequently, the staff were friendly and accommodating and I could see this company expanding and becoming a true competitor with Enterprise.
