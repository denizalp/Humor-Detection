Absolutely delicious! The lunch pre-fixe is available 7 days a week, and definitely one of the best deals in Vegas. The food is prepared very well, and while the portions seemed small, we left stuffed. I ordered the tomato salad, the lamb chops (extra $10 but well worth it), and the yogurt dessert, and the person who came with me ordered the Meze platter, the sea bass, and the yogurt dessert. I actually preferred the Meze platter to the tomato salad -- I think it had to do with the fact that the tomatoes weren't quite a fresh, firm and juicy as they could have been if picked at peak tomato season (my favorite are tomatoes off the vine). That being said, it was certainly tasty, but the Meze platter was even better! Each of the three dips were very different, but so good! Both entrees were simply prepared, but delicious. The lamb was tender and flavorful, and the sea bass - served as a whole fish - was amazing! The dessert was simple but well executed! \nAmbiance-wise, it can come off a bit stuffy and stale. They have a white palate going on. However, we opted to sit outside. There's a lot of vegetation which creates a small oasis from the flashing lights from the rest of the Strip. \nI'm a huge fan and would love to come back when I'm next in Vegas.
