Had dinner here with my husband late Friday night, after 9:30 pm. Walked in and  seated right away. Friendly and attentive staff - fun fact, they're family owned the original Mexican restaurant that was here when we moved into the neighbourhood 15 years ago in case anyone remembers them - was a fave go-to for us. We shared nachos fully loaded and the beef chimichanga & chicken enchilada special - just these dishes were enough (and more) to fill us up. Looking forward to our next visit.
