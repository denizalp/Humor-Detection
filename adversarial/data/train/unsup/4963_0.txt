Spent over 1000 for four good tickets.  Seats were good. Venue is nice. Sets were good but that's where it ended. Even my daughter and friend who were die hard fans asked away feeling like what a waste of money. \n\nDoesn't sing. Weak dancing.  At one time she is lowered from the ceiling in an Angel outfit and just waves her arms.  \n\nSo basically. Not singing. Not dancing. Just hanging like a puppet \n\nDoesn't speak much, and when she does she acts like a 12 year old. \n\nNever again.  \n\nRecently went to Paul McCartney, less money and huge talent.  74 years young and sang for almost 3 hours.  That brought me to the realization of what a real waste of money that show is.  She should be embarrassed
