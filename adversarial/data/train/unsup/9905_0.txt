I have no idea where to begin. The food was so good that there are no ways to emphasize it's greatness. \nLet's start with the very few negatives, which didn't ruin my rating for this place. I basically left the restaurant with an empty wallet and in search for a cheap place to grab something else to eat, since this omakase experience did not completely fill me up.\nBut now to the actual omakase 'experience':\nWe entered in to find the cutest little japanese restaurant, which was both cozy but well laid out, making it look upscale but not too pretentious. \nWe opted for the most expensive thing in the menu, which was the 5 course omakase dinner.\nThe server was a very friendly and well trained lady who kept refilling our glasses of water and smiling throughout. Since omakase involves Hiro (the chef) to personally make each sushi there and then, each course would arrive one by one, and therefore the dinner lasted a good 2 hours.\nThe first course was miso soup, and honestly, I have never tried miso soup that good my entire life! It was literally creamy. I could have drank a whole gallon of that stuff! \nI have posted pictures of most of the courses I got, which were all spectacular. I would like to specially highlight the butterfish sushi...it actually melted in my mouth!\nHiro was there quietly making sushi right in front of you with full concentration and passion, which definitely shows in his, what I would call, 'art'.\nI'm not a sort of person that's willing to spend more than $100 on a meal, but ever since this experience, I have chosen to eat at Hiro sushi at least once a year. It was definitely worth it. But, like I said, I did have to go home and munch on some more food after.
