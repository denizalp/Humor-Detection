Front office is a disaster. The dentist I had been seeing for 10 years left and I was never notified of this nor introduced to the new Dr. I received a robo letter telling me I had dental issues to schedule and the new Dr's name signed. When I called to ask they never bothered to send an introductory letter or help make the transition of care better.\nMy last experience there was less then pleasant as the office is much more concerned about their payments then your care and treatment. I had been in the chair for 3 hours and just wanted to leave. But rather then asking me to call the next day to discuss payment she could only say, \"So how are you going to pay for today's treatment? I had been a patient for over 10 years and never defaulted, you think a little kindness could have been shown. When questioning a charge the office manager just says the same thing over and over again like that answers it. It did not. Because of the mysterious disappearance of my doctor and the gigantic lack of professionalism of the front office I will be searching for another dentist. It's a shame because I like Curtiss, the hygienist, very much.
