I went there for Kaskade Sundays over labor day.  By far the largest pool party I have ever seen.  Here are some tips.\n\nIf you're not getting a cabana then show up early and claim a spot by the planter boxes or the pool sides.  People essentially lay claim to places to sit by throwing their towel down by the planters or along the water edges.  Smart move for anyone not in a cabana.  Bring credit, cash or krugerrands gold coins.  Seriously, bottled waters $21 each.  A friend got a bottle of grey goose for $950, also ridiculous, but when in Rome yada yada.\n\nThere's a gift shop in the back that sells sunblock, cameras and accessories.  The cafe has basic food items on the menu, don't expect much, you're not there for fine dining.  It also doesn't hurt to blend in by having a Jersey Shore tan and washboard abs...apparently everyone there has a crazy amount of free time to tan and hit the gym.  Last bit of advice, don't be one of those people that get blackout drunk then carted off in a wheelchair.  Drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son
