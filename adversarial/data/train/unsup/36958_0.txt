Came in for an X-ray of my sons neck that was ordered STAT. Office was not busy and was told it would be 20 minutes tops. We waited over an hour before finally being called back for the Xray. Office staff was rude and had no answers for why things were taking so long. They told me I didn't have to wait if I didn't want to. Made it very clear they don't really care about business or customer care. I have had better and faster service in a busy ED. Will never come here again as it was not the first bad experience we have had at this location. Would recommend avoiding this office and choosing another location.
