We live near so much good pizza that it's incredibly hard to choose now.  I had not eaten at Venezia's until almost 2 months ago, and we did the lunch special with a slice and a salad and a drink.  I forget the exact total, but it runs right around 6 bucks.  GREAT deal and GREAT pizza.\n\nThen, we've gotten delivery twice and I am so impressed with their website and online ordering system.  It's the best I've ever used.  You can customize the order, apply a coupon code, and pay online.  Both times we've ordered online we got our pizza in approximately 45 minutes.  And both times the driver was very friendly and had the cc receipt all ready for me to sign.  \n\nWe've had the Meat Lovers, Pesto w\/ artichokes & sausage, and the Hawaiian and enjoyed them all.  This pizza really reminds me of pizza I've had in NY.  The toppings are fresh and the crust is the right amount of yeasty chewiness.  Right now, Venezia's is my #1 choice for pizza.
