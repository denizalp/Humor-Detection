I feel like there is a lot of hype for XS being one of the hottest clubs in LV but there were a few things that turned me off.\n\nCons:\n- IT GETS REALLY CROWDED. It's nice to know the club is poppin but I couldn't get cray cray when all these people are just passing me trying to get through the dance floor. It was getting annoying :(\n- The female body outlines along the walls seems too sexualized. I like the idea and it looks artistic but I'm feeling like a strong feminist against it since they outlines boobs, nipples and all\n- AMF costs $17 + $1 tip = $18 of blue diluted sugar water\n\nHere's what I thought the pros were for XS:\n+ Sexy people partying all in one place (except the nasty you-know-what that my friends and I met at the bar)\n+ In the cabana outside, you can still hear Afrojack perform loud and clear\n+ Club doesn't close until 5:30am so you can definitely get cray cray here until the break of dawn :)
