Oh man... DON'T get me started with TAO night club. ARGH, so I came here with 5 girls total to TAO waiting for the rest of our bachelorette party.\n\n2 of the girls parted ways after only 10 mins of being there and then there was 3. The 3 of us started drinking at the bar\/restaurant area first before we went back up to the main club. Once in, it was PACKED... I mean you're lucky if there are tiny spots where you can BREATHE a little and have some room, but other than that, NO ROOM!\n\nThe main dance floor area WAS PACKED. SO PACKED that it was unbearable because you couldn't dance... \n\nBouncers there were rude and kept belly bumpin me thinking I was going to go under the velvet ropes to a table... which I wasn't ... argh all in all. I really don't like TAO NIGHT CLUB! I wished I was able to go to a better \"EDM\"-ish night club during my stay in Vegas, but I didn't have enough time to do that... Only upside was that Cash Cash was playing on the weekend of 7\/26 so that was nice... \n\nOther than that, I don't think I'll be returning to TAO!
