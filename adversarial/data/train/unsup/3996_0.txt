My fiance's family default dim sum place (practically go there every weekend or whatever we visit)!\n\nSuper crowded and long wait time we visited. \nInstead of the standard pushing cart, you place all your order from a sheet (you write down the quantity and check the box next to the dish you want). \n\nMy fav - steamed gingered egg white with baked pie crust! Sweet papaya fried dumplings! \n\nEverything else is pretty standard dim sum dishes. Nothing too innovative.. but still really yummy!\n\nWill continue to return.. since my fiance's family will be my family too :)!
