I used to have acne-prone skin, acne everywhere, cystic acne, scars, and bumps all over. But now my skin is clear. I went to Summer for a facial, and we ended up talking about my skincare routine as well(which in the beginning was problematic and didn't suit my skin at the time at all). After talking about my skincare routine we sat down and restructured my whole routine, implementing products that work for me. No bs, no hard-sale, just pure honesty and passion from Summer! and I've also been getting compliments on my skin, which I never got before!
