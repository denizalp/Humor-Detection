I finally made it to Tacos El Gordo after hearing rave reviews about it for ages. The place was pretty empty, but service was fast and efficient. I ordered one adobada taco and one carne asada taco to go. They were pretty small and they packaged them on tiny paper plates and wrapped them in foil. Not the best form of packaging I've ever seen and definitely not cost efficient for them, but I assume most people eat them there.\n\nEveryone always raves about how cheap this place is, and it is for the most part, but for the price I felt they skimped a bit on the meat and filling. They were definitely tasty and I really enjoyed the flavor of the adobada. Nicely balanced heat and sweetness. The carne asada was good too, albeit a little on the dry side. The condiments definitely enhanced the flavor of these for me. \n\nI'm a big fan of the adobado and I'll definitely be back again to pick these babies up next time.
