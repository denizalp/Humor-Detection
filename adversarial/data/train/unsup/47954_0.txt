I know two people who see Dr Susan and have had great experiences.  I was originally impressed with my doctor after the first visit, but after 1 year of baby stepping forward in progress... I'm no longer going to see her.  I felt she was too passive and not a lot of confidence.   She would tell me to try a few things and come back in 3 months to run the blood work again.  After going back 3 more times every 3 months and still not a lot of improvement and now hooked on a thyroid medication... I found a medical intuitive (medical medium) that got me down to only 4 total vitamins, off medication, on the right diet for me (not just recommending keto), and in therapy and able to tap into how I'm feeling in my body.
