Met up with a friend for lunch on Friday and was very pleased with this place!  It's been on my list for a while :)\n\nWe met up at 11:30, just in time to take advantage of the lunch menu.  My friend had a southwestern chicken salad and mine was Greek.  Both were really tasty.\n\nNeither of us took advantage of the baked goods but I have my eye on a couple of things for the next visit.\n\nJewel's is known for being gluten-free but none of our  food was lacking in flavor  or balance.  It's got a nice, low key ambiance and good service.\n\nThis place is cute and worth supporting.  I'll be back soon----there's a ginger snap with my name on it!
