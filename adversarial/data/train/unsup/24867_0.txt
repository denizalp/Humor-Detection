So every time we go to Vegas, we somehow end up at Planet Hollywood. Which brings us to Planet Dailies! Their good is acceptable, even enjoyable sometimes for the price. \n\nThe Staff .. oh the lovely staff! It is like they do things Just to annoy you and give you a horrible experience! After my 3rd visit here, I have to say I am thinking they are trained to act this way, because honestly it has been every single wait person we have had. \n\nMy last experience which I decided will be my last was a waiter who as I was paying him the check, leaned over and looked into my wallet and said to me \" I see you have a 20$ there, why don't you pay with that?\" Because I gave him a 100$ and asked for change! He complained that he would need to go make change and made a whole fuss about it ( it wasn't busy at all, we were his only table ) \n\nThen he huffs and puffs, walks away with my 100$ and comes back and shortchanges me about .75$. As the bill was like 27.25, he did not bother getting the change part back. Now I know it is only 75 cents and that is normally not a big deal, as his tip would of been around 5$ anyways, but hey it is the principle. If I am owed 75 cents, you give me my 75 cents! So when he denied taking it and just brushed it off as oh its only 75 cents, I decided that's fine, that's your tip, enjoy it .  Normally I would feel bad for not tipping properly, but he was a bastard the whole time we were there, and that was the icing on the cake. \n\nThere are SOOO many people out of work in our economy, how hard is it to find friendly people who want to work and make money? I don't understand how people who are LUCKY enough to have a job in this shitty economy can act like that and not care about their jobs.
