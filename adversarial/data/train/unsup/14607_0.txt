These QuikTrip locations are popping up everywhere, and I like it. Easy in, easy out - and the prices are generally better than just about everywhere else, without having to look it up on an app or drive around for a while.\n\nThough I will almost always pay at the pump, I have to say that the inside of the QT is also rather compelling, where instead of row after row of snacks that you know aren't good for you, they instead have what appears to be freshly prepared snacks and drinks that aren't good for you. Impressive indeed.\n\nNo wonder they can have so many of these places storming the city - with good stuff outside and in, they are like a money machine!
