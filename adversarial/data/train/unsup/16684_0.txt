It's my second day at Artisan and it supppper cool. I'm moving into the area in a few weeks and everyone who works here is super kind. I didn't take advantage of the club or very much time in the pool, but it's been DEAD. No people in the club at all. I'm not sure if it's because of the off season in Vegas, but for people mentioning how thin the walls are (which they are) it's been dead. Which I like. This place is rustic and retro. Still need to have some improvements.\n\nIf you are staying in room 423 and there is a small coffee stain the size of a pea in the upper left hand side of the sheets, then the sheets haven't been changed since before I got here. Just saying... \n\nI booked this place extremely last minute, so I can't complain, but I'm not going to give it 4 stars until I've REALLY experienced this hotel. \n\nI would come here again though, even if just to\nbeg if I could rent out a few of their books. They really do have a magnificent art collection. I love how every room is themed after artists and feature their works
