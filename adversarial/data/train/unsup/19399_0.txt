I had been visiting Phoenix for the holidays when my dog woke up with a terrible eye infection. I called North Central Animal hospital that was recommended by a family friend but they were booked with only \"urgent care\" appointments available for an extra fee. My experience was that you either have an appointment available or you don't . I kept on calling nearby vets and found a great place walking distance from where at I was staying. Very glad I took my business elsewhere!
