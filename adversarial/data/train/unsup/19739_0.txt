I'm that kind of girl who feels uber uncomfortable walking into a hardware store. I hate Home Depot. And I hate Lowe's. It's just not my thing. I don't fix anything. But my job location just happens to be right across the street from this Ace Hardware. And I'm grateful for that. \n\nI walk in here and show them a picture of what I need on my phone (the guys send me over to do their errands). No matter where I wander off to, someone is always right there to help me. Plus they always know what I'm talking about in my girlish gibberish (I need the thingy that screws into the other thingy that holds up that one thingy). \n\nWhile I still don't like going into a hardware store, I don't mind going into this particular hardware store. Especially since I know that someone is always there to get me exactly what I need, so I go back to work looking like a hero. Great job guys and gals!
