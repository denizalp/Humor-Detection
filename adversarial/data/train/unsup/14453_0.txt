The cocky and condescending guys who work here actually put out some damn good sandwiches. They know it, and have the awards to prove it, too. I can't tell if they're moody and rude as part of a gimmick to be more \"authentic\" with the NY 'hood style, or if they're just jerks. Zero sense of humor, always seem vaguely annoyed to have customers. \n\nPastrami sandwich here is pretty much a work of art. It's a contender for BF's last meal requests- delicious bread piled thick with pastrami. Just the thought of it makes him drool uncontrollably. It's his go-to sandwich at any deli, and he easily puts it in his top three bests.\n\nWe shared a featured special sandwich today: garlic bread loaded high with shredded beef, grilled peppers and onions, and marinara sauce and pecorino cheese. We opted for the \"large' since we were planning to share, and received what looked like an entire loaf of garlic bread that was perhaps close to 2 feet long. Luckily, we got it to go, but the damn thing was like eating a chunk of Italy- it was essentially an italian take on a cheesesteak, and I was quite surprised with the results.  Bread was delicious, just enough sauce to make it saucy without making it soggy, and heaps of toppings. I managed less than a third of this monstrosity, but staked my claim on the leftovers early- already looking forward to tomorrow's leftovers.\n\nThe pizza here also gets raves, and I plan on trying that... along with the Bronx Bomber, or the Anthony Special sandwiches... and their chicken piccata entree with mozarella sounds amazing too. Oh hell, I overlook the employee attitude problems because they make damn good food. Just let it be known that their score would be higher if they weren't rude.\n3.5 stars, rounding up.
