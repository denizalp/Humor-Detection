I'm actually torn between 3 and 4 stars.  Let's begin with the good things about this place.  The spinning classes are amazing.   Babette runs a fantastic class and I get a great workout.  They gym has lots of machines, so you never have to wait.  There's a huge pool (which I've never used, and probably never will), and lots of basketball and racquetball courts.  They even have a climbing wall.  Now let's talk about why I don't like it.  KIDS EVERYWHERE!!!  I have nothing against  children, but they out number the adults by probably 5 to 1.  To top it off, they pay like $5 a month for free childcare.....who is subsidizing that??? Those of us without kids.  I would prefer a swankier, more adult friendly gym, but those that exist here aren't close to my house, and usually cost $1500 to $2000 just to join.  So, I'll stick with this for now, and hope that they raise the childcare cost sometime soon.
