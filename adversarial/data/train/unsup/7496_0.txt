oh em gee... terrible food and terrible setting.\n\nI HATE buffets, but went here because a dear friend of mine talked about it for two days and insisted on going. I am glad that I went because it reconfirmed why I hate buffets. \n\nThere was a HUGE selection, but a huge selection of crap. You had your usual prime rib, seafood, mexican food, sushi, asian fusion etc.- all lacking in quality. I don't remember specific details, because there was so much food, but what I do remember is that they used snow crab legs- - lame!! I am not asking for stone crab, but at least Alaskan king or something more meaty. Way better options in Vegas... tsk tsk
