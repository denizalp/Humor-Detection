I will definitely stick with going to the fashion show. I came here to return a corset that I had bought from fashion show because the boning came out of it after only wearing it once. The lady that worked today was..well lets just say I felt like a complete inconvenience rather than a customer. She was frustrated that I was returning the corset because I didn't buy it at her store originally. I wanted to shop but decided to head to Frederick's fashion show instead!
