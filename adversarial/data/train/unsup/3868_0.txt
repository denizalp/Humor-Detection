I've always been a fan of Old Navy because, well, I like a good deal\n\nI liked this Old Navy because of a few things:\n\n1. It was super clean- Like not one item out of place. That is, until I started rummaging around.\n2. The staff- Constantly making sure things were okay and if I needed help, but not in that annoying, please leave me alone type of way.\n3. The clearance- They had an amazing clearance area that was pretty huge, even by Old Navy standards.\n\nThis Old Navy in the Town Square, located in Vegas, is probably one of my favorite locations ever. The selection was great. The deals were easy to find and I was able to get in and out without any hassle. There wasn't even a line, which was also shocking to me. They had exactly what I needed ( a sweater since I thought 65 degrees was cold) for an amazing price ($8) and I was back to enjoying my vacation.\n\nIf you're an Old Navy fan, this place is for you. And even if you're not, this location is worth checking out.
