They ran out of white radish Daikons !!! How !!?? You guy's just opened last week and plus no drumsticks too !! So mad, during prime time lunch hour too. Overall service was ok but much needed work on the food inventory portion of your store though. \n\nPricing wise. Lunch specials are a great deal. But almost $3.00 for a small cup of rice and kimchi as well, literally 1 scoop. $12 for DukBoKi, I mean really? (very small portion might I add). As you can see in my picture, probably like 5 rice cakes total and rest was just spicy sauce and cheese.. fak. Want real DukBoKi ? go to Soyo. \n\nBut let's get to the chicken. Overall it's good tasting with spices on point. \n\nWould I come here again ? Probably if they fixed a few things such as overall wait time for food, better service in refilling water, making sure daikons and drumsticks are available. I'm big on Daikons, maybe because I'm Korean and I can't eat korean chicken without eating daikons. It's like eating chicken nuggets at Mc Dee's without the bbq sauce. They just go hand in hand. \n\nI miss Kyochon.
