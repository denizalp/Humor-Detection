My favorite bar at the Wynn! \n\nDisclaimer: I prefer Parasol down as opposed to the Up version.\n\nAmbiance is the best on the strip,  no question.  \n\nGrab a table on the terrace overlooking the lake of dreams if you can (it makes dishing out $16 a drink more bearable). There are 5-6 performances they cycle through every half hour with each being really unique & visually stimulating.\n\nThere can be a wait for a table but I've never waited more than 10 minutes & trust me,  it's worth it. \n\nThis place is pretty chill & the crowd is older so if that's not what you're looking for then this place probably isn't for you. \n\nIn terms of drinks,  you can't really go wrong with any of the specialty cocktails on their menu. I've tried 6-8 of them and they were all great. They also bring you out some bar snacks which is always nice & basically unheard of at any other Vegas hotel bar. \n\nBest of all, Jonathan & Ian at Parasol down are great bartenders!  Best I've ever encountered in Vegas.
