Because of cold weather out, my buddies at work decided to go somewhere close. \n\nPittsburgh Poultry definitely covers the friendly customer service aspect. You are greeted when you walk in and if you want to substitute anything on the menu for something else they oblige! \n\nI got the White meat 2 piece meal with potato wedges. I got the breast and wing, with an extra wing. The wings were ok in size, but the breading and flavoring on both the breast and wings were good. Chicken was cooked properly and wasn't overcooked and dry. Sauces for dipping are all free which is nice. \n\nMy only complaint is the lack of sides. I do not like coleslaw or baked beans, so i was stuck with only the potato wedges which had a nice flavor as well! \n\nPrices are reasonable and not out of this world, which is good for someone working downtown trying not to spend a lot. The dine-in area is also kept clean from what I saw!\n\nAs Previously mentioned in another Yelpers review, since George Aikens closed there has not been a fried chicken to compare. Until now
