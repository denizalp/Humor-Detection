Popeyes is the same everywhere you go (as far as I am concerned). The only thing that makes this one a little weird is that it is connected to a Gas Station. This seems to be the norm for Nevada, but it is something I just can't get use to. But, while I have a problem with that little piece, I still got a 5 piece with fries. \n\nI realluy do hate that I like popeys so much. Damn you delicious chicken house!!!!!!!
