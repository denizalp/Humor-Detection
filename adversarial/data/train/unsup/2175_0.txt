Places with enjoyable outdoor seating generally get a 1-star patio bump, and Kona Grill has some nice real estate for dining al fresco. Yes, as with most Las Vegas patios, it overlooks a parking lot, but there is a bit of greenery to shield your eyes. Plus, there is generally some nice auto eye candy in the parking lot. \n\nMy first Kona experience was at lunchtime with the parents. Beware of the iced tea. We were all on a flavored tea kick after sipping on some fruity treats at Create and Sammy's, so we swiftly ordered up some of the enticing flavors at Kona. Little did we know that their flavors were delivered in a four-dollar Republic of Tea bottle! We searched the menu and found no indication that this was the deal, or rather un-deal.  $4 and no refills? I suggest sticking to the regular brewed tea. \n\nWe all went with the perfect pairings lunch offerings. You pick two from a nice list of options for $8 and change. I chose a salad and the turkey chili. My husband went with some sushi. The salad was okay, but I wasn't a big fan of the over miso'd dressing. I love miso, but it was really overpowering. The turkey chili, however, was yummy. My only complaint is that I wanted more! The sushi looked a little sad. The imitation crab was leaking pink onto the plate. Never a good sign, but my husband seemed happy enough.\n\nI wouldn't say Kona was a knockout experience for us, but there is that patio bump in effect, and the happy hour specials definitely demand a repeat visit.
