Some people just shouldn't work in the service industry and all of those people work at Kelly's. Both the bartender and our server were about 20% interested in us being there.\n\nAmbiance is cool, drinks and food are okay - there's no reason why this couldn't become my neighborhood hangout other than the staff. And that's a big reason.\n\nBut, I guess that's what one should expect from a place that's web presence is a Myspace account.
