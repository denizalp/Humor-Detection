The place has taken a dive, and I'm not sure if the owners care if their employees don't care either, and it shows on patrons (or the lack there off) since the past year.    There employees seem to enjoy hanging out, and talk among themselves, and forget that customer comes first.  \nI use to love their nachos, but even that has taken a down hill spiral, and the toppings portions have shrunk    I\"m not sure what happening to The Beach House, but they better start getting in gear, before they get nailed with a Tsunami, and start floating in pieces across the Pacific ocean.
