Grand Opening March 15th!\n\nI have been here twice since I found it on Yelp and can say joy is the right word! This is one of the coolest new tea places in Vegas. It's hidden in the back of an easy and large parking lot making the trip convenient to say the least. They also have a huge patio area that will be so cool for hanging out with friends during those hot summer nights. The only bummer here is both times I have been the patio was occupied by some heavy smokers. The owners obviously have not control over this but if you are looking to hang outside and this keeps up - you might prefer easy life or tea station. \n\nI had the jasmine tea with sea salt and boba, the oolong tea with sea salt and boba, and a jasmine milk tea. All excellent! Not too sweet, good sizes, the boba itself was average but that's all I need. I have also tried the fruity pebble macaroon which I thought was delicious. I don't really like macaroons but I love fruity pebbles! They have food on the menu but it isn't available yet, I am sure they will have it by their grand opening so swing by! \n\nYou won't regret trying out Tea of Joy and relishing in the joy of tea ;)
