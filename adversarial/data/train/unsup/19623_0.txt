I was looking forward to a pleasant evening out with my hubby. We are always so busy with our businesses that it's rare we ever get a chance to go out to dinner. Unfortunately for us, we made the poor decision to come here.\n\nHubby had warned me about the awful service here, but I'm open minded; I like to give every restaurant a chance before I write them off. Besides, I had heard that this place serves some awesome Mediterranean cuisine. With that being said, I'm not exaggerating when I say that we waited 2 HOURS for our food. The worst part is that we never even received it! After being told countless times by our waiter that our food will be done in \"10 minutes\", we eventually came to the conclusion that it was never going to arrive. Like several other smart parties before us, we decided to just get up and leave.\n\nI don't know how the owners think this is acceptable. At some point when tables are leaving one after the other without even being served, they have to realize that some changes need to be made. This review is solely based on service. I'd be interested in trying this place again. I'll just make sure I have a few hours to spare.
