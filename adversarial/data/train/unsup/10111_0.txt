Loving the location as there's finally a new library up in the southwest other than old and ghetto spring valley library.  This one is definitely spacious and bright with wide open windows.\n\nI do however need to deduct stars for a idiotic librarian who got all disgruntle about me whispering on the phone for only 2 min. First of all, yes i do realize its a library and i shouldn't be loud but I WASN'T.  Secondly, there was no one around me that could even possibly hear my whispering, and last but not least, there's freakin babies crying and kids talking all over the place, but nooooo, me whispering is going to bother all the invisible people sitting around me.
