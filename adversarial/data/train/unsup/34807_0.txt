Just dined in and was disappointed.  We have had their pizza before and  it is very good, but this time i got the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp.  Server said it was awesome.  They clearly use precooked, frozen shrimp, as I could not bite through these as they were like rubber. \nMy wife got the eggplant Parmesan, which was very good.  The most aggravating thing is that they still charged me for my side salad...call me crazy but if have to send a whole meal back I think comping the salad is reasonable.  Do yourself a favor, get the pizza or something simple and order carry out.
