We saw this place on both Man vs. Food and Food Paradise: Cheese Paradise and knew we had to give it a try when we were passing through town.\n\nThe one word that comes to mind immediately after entering Melt Bar & Grilled is \"kitch.\" There are big plastic Santas and big plastic bunnys and all kinds of other holiday decorations and memorabilia all over the place. Then there's the huge Dairy Queen sign and much, much more. When you're seated, your menu is printed on the back of a record album cover. Kitch. But in a good way.\n\nIf you can't find a \"grown up\" grilled cheese to select from the menu, you're just being too picky. Even as a somewhat picky eater, I found plenty to choose from. My wife and I definitely weren't up to The Melt Challenge (over 5 pounds of cheese, bread, and more) and decided to split a Wake & Bacon (fried eggs, bacon, and cheese) and a Westside Monte Cristo (honey ham, smoked turkey, swiss, and american battered and deep fried). We also ordered a Melt Pierogi on the recommendation of the server.\n\nWe're certainly not pierogi experts, but we enjoyed Melt's version as a nice starter before our sandwiches came out.\n\nWhen our sandwiches were delivered, both my wife and I were amazed at the amount of food. Along with the hand cut fries and sweet slaw, our sandwich plates were overflowing with food.\n\nBite after bite, both of us enjoyed our sandwiches. They were both as advertised and were a nice, grown-up version of the all-American favorite grilled cheese.\n\nHonestly, we don't know what the slaw tasted like. By the time we finished our sandwiches and a good amount of our fries, we just didn't have room to eat any more food. For the price, the amount of food is a ridiculously good value. College students could easily get 3 or 4 meals out of a single plate.\n\nThe only downside to Melt Bar & Grilled is the parking situation. It's a bit confusing if you're not from the area. We parked on the road at a meter (after hours) and were fine, but there are a ton of parking rule signs you have to read to make sure you're okay. Thankfully, the reading was worth it for the food!
