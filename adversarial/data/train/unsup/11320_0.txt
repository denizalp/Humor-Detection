While strolling around Downtown Glendale, the girls and I decided we were hungry.  Upon walking around the many cafe\/restaurants, we decided to give Kimberly Ann's a try.\n\nWhen entering, we were overwhelmed by the theme of this cozy little place.  It was pretty cute --- not TOO overkill-y.  There was tons of stuff to look at.  You can say this place borderlines cluttered.  I felt like I was on that TLC show, \"Hoarders: Buried Alive!\"\n\nSo anyways, two of the ladies got the quiche with chicken gumbo soup, I had the BLT, and we had some scones afterward.  The quiche just melts in your mouth, the BLT was cooked to perfection, and the Mae's scones were truly the best.  We shared a strawberry scone, a blueberry scone, and a cranberry scone with devonshire cream and lemon curd.  Yummy!\n\nAlthough the chips were a weird non-Victorian touch, I think this place is okay.
