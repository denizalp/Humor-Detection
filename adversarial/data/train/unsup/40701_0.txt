Came in here late on a Saturday night, just before a dance at nearby Brophy. The staff was very friendly, especially one girl who had great enthusiasm (or at least more than me :P) I ordered the Dark Chocolate \"Smash\" (what a fun name for their blended frozen coffee drinks!) While I waited, I was taken by all of the fabulous looking pastries and cookies in the display as well as the great, open interior. I was extreemly impressed with what was said to the owner's art along the walls. Anyways, back to the coffee drink... IT WAS ABSOLUTELY TO-DIE-FOR! After I got my drink my friend and I took advantage of the great patio and the cool (finally!) night. The only thing I could poke at, was that it took longer than I thought it would to get my drink, but I do realize that they are brand-new. What a great new spot! Oh, and P.S. -- I was surprised to learn that their cups made from corn biodegrate within 45 days! Now that's impressive!
