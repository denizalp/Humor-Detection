I'm not sure how much good Thai food is to be found in Arizona, but this place definitely hit the spot.\n\nAppetizers were good, but the Massaman Curry (my benchmark of Thai cuisine) was fantastic! Potatoes and veggies done just right, rice cooked perfectly, and the curry itself creamy and luscious, bursting with flavor. The fact that you can designate on a scale of 1 to 10 how hot you want your dish to be was a nice touch, and addressed my grandmother's reservations (this was her first time trying Thai cuisine).\n\nThey were really busy, so I think it's perfectly acceptable that the service was just a tad slow, but the waiter was extremely pleasant and helpful. The decor was ok, but I'd love to see the walls as vibrant as the flavors... don't be shy guys, your food is great- go for it! Make it real!\n\nBonus points for carrying my fave Thai beer, Chang!
