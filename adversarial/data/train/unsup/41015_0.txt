My wife and I have visited this restaurant many times this Summer. We have eaten from the menu and recently tried their buffet. What a surprising treat. Everything was flavorful and fresh. What a real find at a very reasonable price. Planning on returning very soon next week. Keep up the good work. \nIf your looking for a pleasant eating experience,  \ntry Khoo's. Very nice people and super friendly.
