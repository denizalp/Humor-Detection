I'm am glad I used my points to pay for this meal and not my money. I have so many I had to use them somehow and I was hungry and wound up here. Probably should have went to the oyster bar but I had nobody around to share with me. \n\nI ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with fries. Buffalo sandwich has barely any sauce so I had to ask for extra and the fries tasted like they were fries in old dirty grease :\/. The chicken was crispy from a lack of saucw but the chicken was poorly seasoned and very bland. Breakfast I've had here has been pretty good so I guess we'll stick with that instead.
