I have been on the diet roller coaster most of my life, all my adult life, anyways. There are good weight loss clinics and then this place.\nCalling this a medical clinic is scary.\nI did all the registration and then was(within a reasonable amount of time) called to the back.\nThe tech checked my blood pressure and weight. Then it was time to see the dr. What doctor, she's a P.A., not a physician! \nShe was ready to put me on a 750 calorie a day diet. No real physical, blood work, nothing. I walked out with a week's worth of phentermine, a syringe of vitamin B to inject a week later...\n\nBottom line, if you're serious about losing weight, don't waste your money or time with this seemingly fly-by-night \"clinic\". See a real bariatric doctor that takes time to know your body.
