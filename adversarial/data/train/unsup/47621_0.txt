Delicious, cheap, and great service! I was hesitant to try this place because White Elephant is very highly rated here and very disappointing but Thai Fusion Delight is amazing and the price is right! The one thing that doesn't make sense to me is why they would sell fried ice-cream when there's barely any seating there? By the time I got home (with my takeout about 10-15mins away), the ice-cream was mostly melted. Anyway, their green curry was delicious, so was their mango sticky rice, and their fried ice-cream despite it being melted. I find that thai food is overpriced in Calgary, and they're nothing special. This place is fair though. I'm a fan!
