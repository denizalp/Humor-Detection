Food (from HH menu):\n\nAlbacore Nigiri: 3.5 stars\nSmooth, good sized piece & tasty. \n\nTuna Nirgiri: 3 stars\nFresh, no fishy smell \/ taste & good portion size.\n\nSalmon Skin Roll: 2.5 stars\nThere wasn't much salmon skin inside of the rolls but more rice surrounding all of the rolls than anything. \n\nSquid Salad: 3 stars\nThe squid in this salad tasted exactly like the squid salad mixture that Costco has, except this had extra greens on the bottom of the mixture.\n\nDynamite Roll (Cali roll w\/ baked crab on top): 3 stars\nThis had way too much rice & sauce on top which overwhelmed the whole roll. \n\nOverall: clean place with good atmosphere & good sized portioned food here. \n\nIf you like rolls more than sashimi then you'll like this place. =)  \n\nService: Very slow, they forgot to check on us during the meal & we had to wave them down several times for water. -1\n\nTip:\nHH: M-F 4:30- Closing\nSat & Sun: 3PM - Closing
