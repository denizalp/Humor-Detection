I got a gift card for this place as a Christmas present so decided to watch \"The Interview\" here. If you're going to watch a movie, see if it's playing here as ticket prices are so much cheaper than Cineplex. The items sold at the concession stand are a lot cheaper as well. Staff here seem to be people who are interested in movies and not high schoolers in need of a part-time job. The place is clean with comfortable seats and small theatres (you can sit anywhere and watch movies comfortably). I like the location as well as it's literally ten steps from College Station.\n\nGood for: movies
