This was my first visit to a Casey's restaurant and although it wasn't five star, I certainly enjoyed my meal. \n\nAppetizer Cesar $4 - well sized to not overdo it, perfect proportions between the leaves, bacon, dressing and Parmesan. \n\nAppetizer Shrimp Tacos $9 for 2 or $16 for 4. - I took the 4 as my main. They were absolutely delicious and had that \"fresh\" taste to them. My partner in crime didn't approve that they were fried shrimp but they were golden brown and crispy while not dried out. My only qualm is that for playing nicely they were given too much lettuce on the bottom which made them very messy to eat. I still think they were perfect. \n\nRed Pepper Soup (as a side) - it was tasty but nothing crazy \n\nBison burger $16 - with blue cheese (average slice thickness). We both agreed that the patty was great and that the bbq sauce was banging! However, the overall burger was missing a slice of tomato\/onion, it was tasty and had great potential but just missed that umphh. \n\nBeer selection wasn't great, wines were slightly overpriced but they had seemingly good happy hour deals as well as $10 lunch specials. Service was very average, we sat at the bar and although it was an average Tuesday the service left a little (just a little) to be desired. \n\nWould be more than happy to return.
