Well we came here for our third time. And. Minus a headache  they couldn't find our reservation. So they make us wait but gave us two drinks (wow really). No.  \n\nThen they found us a room. Yes a nice room in (lux town smoking room )anyone knows me I'm NOT a smoker yuck. And then they wanted to give us two beds. Really. No.    So we in our room. Nice suite but then we find out. Again strike 3 only have reservations til sat umm leaving sun duh.  \n\nWe won't gamble here anymore. Due to card would t work. But they couldn't care about that. With the attitude they had ( and no headache had nothing to do w my crabbiness .  So another chance to fix reservations tomorrow cross fingers that they take credit for screw up and not blame on oh we changed our systems or whatever other excuse they can come up with.  Hope u enjoyed my ugh journey.
