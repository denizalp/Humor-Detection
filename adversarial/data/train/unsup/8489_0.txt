This is my 11th day of Key Realty school. Also this is the  3rd instructor I've seen since starting. Today the third instructor was Teddy, I'm guessing the owner of the school. Reading the other reviews I think this is definitely who the others are referring to. \nToday I was incredibly disappointed, when you start telling people, your own students at that, that they have little to no value because of where they live, that's where it goes too far. \"When potential customers ask where you live what are you going to say?\" Then a student would respond. \"Oh well you're helpless then.\" Or his approach on the value of a woman, \"Fellas in the room, what happens when you approach a girl in a bar and she says she has a home but in reality she has an extremely large loan she's waiting for you to pay off?\" If this is how you want to be talked to in a \"learning\" setting then by all means sign up. \nThe reason the school has earned 2 stars from me is because the second instructor (don't know his name because his stint in our class was so brief) was actually very knowledgeable and helpful. It's a shame he doesn't teach the whole thing, he's very engaging actually wants you to learn the material.\nIf I was to do this over again, I would pick the online course, all the books, CDs, and the other study material is very valuable, but for a cheaper price you can trim all the nonsense and get to Realty without the class.
