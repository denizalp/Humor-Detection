A while back, I saw 50 Shades of Felt ... a parody of 50 Shades of Grey for you slow pokes out there. Let me tell you, way more fun than the book. Yes, I said it. The book sucked so bad I couldn't even enjoy the sex part! \n\nThe play was hilarious. They took advantage of the main character's ridiculous inner monologue and turned it into a real character--Anastasia's inner goddess became a much needed big, pink, gay, fluffy, comedic break. Thank god for that. The 50 Shades storyline was much more enjoyable knowing I wasn't the only one who thought it was stupid. \n\nSeriously, some props need to be given for turning that sloppy, pathetic book into something entertaining for more than just my vagina. Yep, I said it again.
