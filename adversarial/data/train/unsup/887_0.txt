I used to come here when I wanted a free meal, because they screw up your meal everytime. They literally comp meals left and right. \n\nI went there with friends they got an ore cart (which is a whole dried out carcass) and we got a chicken. They came out soo dry.\n\nI mean like dry dry. Like it was beef and chicken crackers. \n\nThe waiter came over and said he would comp it and he could see how badly dry it was. Then he said free dessert.\n\nSo we naturally each ordered our own personal dessert :)\n\nMy mom went there and there was a waiter some how broke a glass on her lap. Dont ask how that happend but they tried to giver her a free Claim Jumper shirt!!!!\n\nMy mom was like Wtf! you jus ruined an expensive shirt and I have glassshards in my arms and legs. \n\nSo they gave her a free meal and a $100 gift card.\n\nThe french onion soup was all I used to get there before I was aware what was in food. I cant vouch for whats in there, but it doesnt matter anyway the food is bad.\n\nThey are really really accomodating but I think its because they are used to fucking up all the time. \n\nIf you want a free mediocre meal, come here.
