Dr. Nagy may be a fabulous podiatrist, but since the rules of the office are to require I provide my Social Security Number, I didn't get the chance to see him...they refused to see me. I do NOT give out that information unless I am filling out a credit application, which I was not. We will let the HIPAA review board sort that one out since I have already filed a complaint. In the meantime, I'm off to find another podiatrist, which is sad to me because Dr. Nagy has such great reviews. Now IF I didn't have insurance (that they verified) and IF they had mentioned some of this on the phone when I called, maybe I could have understood. But to be told I couldn't even see the doctor if I didn't provide my SSN is ridiculous (and I think a true HIPAA violation, but we will see). But they did not. I have satisfied my deductibles for the year, so my visit would have been covered at 100% by my insurance. And they knew all of that.
