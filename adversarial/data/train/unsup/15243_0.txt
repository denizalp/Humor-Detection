Sry this is not a 4.5! \nYes the show itself is nice and funny with some adult contents.. But for the price you can see much better shows in Vegas!\nThe seats are very uncomfortable. It's one those metal folding seats that you can find in any garage sell for a $1 and they are so close to each other that you can barely move around. The show is in a tent that reminds me of a circus.. \nIf you have seen most shows then you probably wanna see this as well. Why not? \nI recommend sitting in the back so at least you can see the full show. Sitting in front rows, most likely you will get harassed plus your neck will go out of balance. Don't do it especially if you had 1 too many drinks hehe...
