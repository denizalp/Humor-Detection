I agreed to a cost of $250.00 for spring cleaning. I emailed a complete list of services I wanted done and was provided this price, and was told they would be there at 9 am. Candice said there would be no problem with what was included on my list, that they were able to each item. The cleaners did not show up until 11 am and had A LOT to do. The work in some areas was great, but they did not complete over half the list. I contacted them requesting for a portion of the money that I paid be refunded, and was told they do not do refunds and was given the phone # for the cleaners. Funny, they do not answer their phones. If you want to see the email with the list and their agreement, contact me, I will be happy to show you. But I would not go with this company. \n\nThis is what they advertise:\n\n Lowest Prices! (Our rates are $80-$300 lower than our competitors)\n Same Day Appointments!\n 24\/7 Availability! (Call, text or email us anytime)\n 100% Green Products! (We use the safest brands, such as Seventh Generation and Mrs. Meyers)\n Family Cleaning Service (You will always know who is cleaning your home)\n Detailed Cleaning (We aren't hourly workers, so we won't rush through your home like others)\n Pet Friendly (We have extensive experience with animals, no need to put them away with us)\n\nThis is a scam. You do not know who is cleaning your house, your hire Keep It Simply Clean, but other people under other company names come to do the work. It is not guaranteed. They will not help you if you do not receive your promised services or appliances are broken.\n\nDetailed cleaning, what a joke. They did not even clean the baseboards in the bedrooms, the lights in the bathroom, they did not spot wash the walls completely. They do rush, and then try and get you to have their family members paint your house, etc. They ask about extra dishes or silverware to see you use them, if not they ask if they can have it. Trust be, beware. They will rush you and hurry out the door before you have a chance to fully look over their work. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.keepitsimplyclean.com\/ BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY. THEY ARE SCAMMERS.
