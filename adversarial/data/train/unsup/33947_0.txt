Very great and unique experience dining at a furniture store. The chairs were so comfortable! And the food was good too. \n\nThe burrata and the lobster role were beyond my expectations.  The scramble eggs were good too but was not that special. \n\nThe dipping mayo for the fries was also very special and delicious. It has a bit of a spicy taste to it that give it a good kick without being too much.
