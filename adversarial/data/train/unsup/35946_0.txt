Literally the WORST rental experience I have ever had. Was told their insurance was required and not optional and that ALL Vegas rental companies require it. I called my progressive insurance and verified that my collision and comprehensive does cover rentals. I showed verification progressive sent me and he said, \"see, you don't have rental reimbursement.\" That is for a rental when you car is stolen or totaled, not if you trash a rental. I asked if he wanted me to call progressive again. He said he'd call after I left. Then he said I had to prepay for a whole tank of gas and it wasn't optional. Probably another lie but at this point we had been there for over an hour and just wanted to get to our hotel for breakfast and a nap. Also be prepared for 2 shuttles to get to rental facility so add at least and hour to your travel and when they say estimate arrival time they really mean exact time. If you show up early at all you will be required to upgrade to what ever agent picks for you. Was not worth what you save over major brands and all \"required\" fees will bring your cost to hundreds more that you original quote. Be prepared to fight tooth and nail for every penny you have. Not worth the headache during a family trip and not worth the time and extras for a business trip.
