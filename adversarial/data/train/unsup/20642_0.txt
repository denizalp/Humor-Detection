OH MY! What a shocker this place was! I couldn't wait to try Vinny Boys. I have been dying for Italian food since I left home! You will not find good italian food here. STAY CLEAR of this place. The bathroom was so disgusting everything was so old and dirty. Everyone spoke SPANISH!\nWhere and how can they call this place an Italian Deli. I ordered a meatball grinder and the bread was so stale it fell apart. I couldn't even eat it. My husband said his wasn't that bad. I couldn't wait to get out of there. She showed me her pasta fagioli soup. It wasn't even in a tomato based broth!\nThis place was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!
