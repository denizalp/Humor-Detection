Went here on 11\/28\/15 for one last hurrah before my friend TJ moves to FL. Saw the great reviews and headed here.\n\nI ordered:\n- crispy chicken skin ($9): a bit over seasoned and powdery. We didn't finish them.\n\n - black rice & oxtail risotto ($14) - huge rim on a small bowl. Just tasted warm with no flavor. TJ refused to try it because she said it looked gross.\n\nMy friend TJ's bill was $33 and she ordered:\n- 2 sunrise beers ($9 for 2)\n- cauliflower - looked like a jumbled bowl of steamed colorful cauliflower. She said it wasn't good \n- tater tots - legit just plain tater tots. \n\nThe place looks good but the prices aren't justifiable by what we ate. We both said it wouldn't be a place we'd go back to.
