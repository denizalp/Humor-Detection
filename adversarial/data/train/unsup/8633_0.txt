You don't have to grow the \"hydo\" to be a fan of Sea of Green. Anyone who wants to grow organic can benefit from their selection of organic fertilizers, amendments, and other goodies for your garden - whether soil-based or hydroponic. \n\nPlus their staff is really friendly and knowledgeable. It doesn't hurt that they complimented me on my ride - instant gold star!
