I am an addict!  This place is fantastic...If they don't have it, Tammy and Mike will get it for you :)  I have several pieces of furniture from them and they worked with me on prices.  I have been there so often that when I said I wanted buttons, Tammy gave me a tote from the back room and sat me down at the table.  This place is exactly what you are looking for when you want a treasure hunt, to find something that no one else has and to connect with business people that are good and decent folks.
