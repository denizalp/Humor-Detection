Selene is AMAZING and I would not take my dogs anywhere else BUT Elegant Pet Grooming.  The salon is relaxing and calm and they take sure great care of the pets that come through that door.  The grooming is reasonably priced, the service is excellent and the expertise in grooming is unmatched.  If you are thinking about taking your dog or cat in.. just call and make an appt.  You won't go anywhere else after.
