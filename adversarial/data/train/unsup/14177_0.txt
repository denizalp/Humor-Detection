The only reason that I gave it a star was because it was the least amount that i could give and I feel that the Manager's customer service certainly deserved at least one star.\nUpon my arrival, I noticed 3 men working behind the counter that were talking to a customer before he walked out. I was looking for certain items and didn't know where to start so i past by the counter a few times before asking. Not 1 of the men greeted me or even asked me if i needed any help. After asking for help, the Manager or the one whom i assume is the Mgr, showed me to what i was looking for. After a few minutes of perusing, Mr. ever so helpful Mgr. double checked to make sure that my shopping experience was up to par. I don't care about being treated like a V.I.P., but I at least expect to be acknowledged as a person as well as prospective customer. I couldn't beat the prices so the only factor bringing me back are the deals. Wait a minute!! There are more than a few play it again sports and craisgslist always has deals,so there really isn't any reason to return. Silly me!!
