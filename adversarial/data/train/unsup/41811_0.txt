Worst experience I have ever had in my life. I am an older, single female moving from out of state to be with family. These gentlemen came to my home packed up items that I didn't even ask them to pack up took everything to my new home and threw everything on top of each other inside my garage. I had to call family members over to help me get to my items, I couldn't even access my dog or cat food that I had just purchased which I asked them to set aside. Everything was so piled on top of each other boxes that were 6 ft tall were three feet tall. Upon inspection of that box, I realized it contained a family heirloom which was glass and of course was now broken. Before realizing that terrible job they did, I not only bought them lunch but also tipped them $100. After my terrible experience I contacted their customer service to inform them. I was first offered $50, the second time offer $25 BY THE OWNER which was insulting. The final straw was my returned check of my hundred dollar tip that I gave to the movers. This was the worst experience I have ever had I would not recommend it to my worst enemy.
