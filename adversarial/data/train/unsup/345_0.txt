This place is as good as it gets! Drinks are custom made to to each individuals liking.This helps with the fact that I am picky with the particular way i like my drinks & it keeps them very consistent in the way they taste each time i order. costumer service is great too, everyone seems like they are enjoying there self while working. Even the tapioca seems to have  a better taste here. Prices here are also inexpensive. Ive only tried a couple drinks but ive already fallen in love. I'm pretty addicted.
