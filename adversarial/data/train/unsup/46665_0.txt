I had been waiting to try breakfast at this place for awhile. We visited on a Sunday around 11am. Waited about 15 minutes. As soon as we walked in, we were not greeted. Then the lady finally said \"what's your name and how many?\". After we gave her the info she never said anything else she just ignored us like we weren't standing there then asked the next person the same thing. I thought it was very rude to be honest and I wanted to leave but my boyfriend wanted to try the food also. The waitress was nice. The food took some time to come out. Muffins were nothing special. You don't get much food. I ordered the huevos rancheros and I took one bite and did not touch the rest. They had huge tomatoes in there with oinions and big pieces of bell peppers which I never seen on huevos rancheros. All I ate was the potatoes which tasted like bacon or sausage (This is a problem because I dont eat pork). We will not be returning.
