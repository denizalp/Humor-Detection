I'm such a fan of the uber casual dinner I had here last night!!!  I had this nagging urge for a chicken sandwich and the Burger Bar provided it well.  My picture looks like a rainbow of colors thanks to the carrot\/celery \"add\" option!  The bread on my sandwich was squishy and fresh, the portion of chicken was huge and the fries were a perfect compliment of crispy heaven.  The price was right and the service was happy.  Thank you Burger Bar for not only having chicken on the menu, but doing it right--you were exactly what I needed!
