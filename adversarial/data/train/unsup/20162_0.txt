Was forced to go here for a family shindig.  I have had loathsome experiences at other Terroni joints.  \n\nThe points:\n\nTerribly uncomfortable chairs!  Two were wobbly and broken.  How can you relax and unwind after a long office day when you're constantly readjusting your seat?  You can't.\n\nAll 14 people in our party had to arrive before they would take us to our table.  Consequently, there were 12 of us milling around the cramped entryway.  Is 12 people not enough of a sign that we are indeed coming?\n\nFood is mediocre.  Smoked swordfish and eggplant pasta?  What was I thinking?  I wasn't...  The smoked swordfish tasted like microwaved turkey bacon.  Shudder.\n\n$15 for a beet salad?  You betcha!  \n\nWon't split a bill.  Isn't this 2013?  The age of technology?  Why am I using the calculator on my cell phone?\n\nCan I omit an ingredient?  \"We don't do that here.\"\n\nSeated 40 minutes before drinks were on the table.  Not servers fault.  Managers fault!  Who would allow one server to look after a party of 14 and another full section?  \n\nDelicious panna cotta.  \n\nI don't get why this place is so busy.  I guess if you follow trends, you'll wind up here.  I encourage you to investigate your own family neighbourhood gems.  The Ma and Pa restaurant around the corner has gotta (praying) be better.
