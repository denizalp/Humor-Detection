I did something this week that I don't do very often... I decided to do business with a company that didn't have any Yelp reviews and wasn't a referral from anyone I know.  \n\nThis all stemmed from the fact that my daughter, who turns 3 next month, decided she didn't want to sleep in her crib anymore.  She climbed out more times than I can count, so I knew it was time to transition her to a \"big girl bed.\"  So... when our go-to handyman didn't return our phone call, I found Mr. Handyman on Yelp and gave them a call.  I spoke to Doug each time I called and he was professional, knowledgeable, upfront about their pricing, and sounded nice enough.  We needed to get someone in soon, and he was able to send me a handyman within 48 hours.  Not bad!\n\nRay was the handyman that was sent out to our house.  He arrived early and got to work... He actually did the job pretty quickly and left 45 minutes later; before I realized that there was a part of the bed frame that I wanted added (a drawer to go underneath the mattress).  This is what happens when husband and wife don't communicate in detail by the way... \n\nSo, I called back the main number to Mr. Handyman, spoke to Doug again, and asked nicely if there was any way he could send Ray back over to add on the drawer.  Sure enough, Ray came back.  Only to find that we didn't have all of the parts needed to complete the additional task.  Ugh!  They charge by the hour by the way.\n\nLuckily, Ray assessed the situation and figured out what was needed and made it happen.  I probably overpaid but mostly because it was our fault for not having everything we needed ready to go.  Nonetheless, Mr. Handyman and Ray specifically were great...  If you have maintenance or repair needs, give this company a call.
