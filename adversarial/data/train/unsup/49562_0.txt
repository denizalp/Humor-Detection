Came here on a Monday night where the Easter prices were still going on so we paid about 155 for 3 people. \nI think we waited about 25 minutes or so in line. They seat us and i grab a plate and scope out the buffet and it seemed like they had a pretty good selection. After trying different foods I realized I wasn't too fond of many dishes they had there. I enjoyed their fingerling potatoes, but I mean I didn't exactly pay that much to just enjoy a simple potato dish. \nThe dessert selection was good, I always enjoy trying different desserts after a meal. They did do a good job with that aspect. \nProbably wouldn't come back but I'm glad I tried it out.
