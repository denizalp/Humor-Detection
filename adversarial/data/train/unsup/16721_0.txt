Let me start by saying that I love Gordon Ramsay.  Hell's Kitchen is still one of my favorite reality shows and his steakhouse in Paris (the casino) is one of my absolute favorite restaurants anywhere in the world.  All that said, I was woefully unimpressed with his Pub & Grill in Caesar's.\n \nGiven that we love GR, this was initially an easy pick for lunch after it opened in Caesar's.  The menu looked promising, and if it is GR, it has to be good, right?  Sadly, no.  Not even close.  \n \nThe wife went with the Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips w\/ Mushy Peas ($30) and got a single, small, bland fish patty and what seemed like frozen french fries.  The peas were cold and off-putting in both flavor and texture.  All for the bargain price of $30.  Gotta love Vegas, right?\n \nI ordered the Chicken, Kale, and Bacon Pot Pie ($24) and honestly believe that I've had better chicken pot pie from Marie Callender for 1\/4 the price.  There were actually more vegetables than chicken, and it needed salt.  The pastry was dry and flaky, not the least bit buttery, and didn't do much to compensate for the lack of flavor in this dish.  I am so disappointed...even still.  C'mon, GR; you are better than this!\n \nThe main thing that salvaged a 2 Star rating was the service and the ambiance.  Our waitress was super fun and really made it feel like we were in a pub in London.  Other than that, and the wishful HOPE that a GR establishment can't possibly be this bad back-to-back, I likely won't give this place another shot...there are, literally, hundreds of other options in Vegas.
