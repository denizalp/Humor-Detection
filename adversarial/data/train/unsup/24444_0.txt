The veggie combo I got here has the unfortunate distinction of being both the skimpiest and the priciest I've ever been served, and I've ordered them in 11 cities and four time zones. My first thought when it was served was, \"Wait ... is that an appetizer?\" My plate came with the requisite lentils and cabbage, as well as pureed potatoes in place of the customary solid ones. \n\nThe two problems with the servings: their size, given that the plate they were served on was largely injera, and a lack of variety. I'd been hoping for greens and yellow split peas, which commonly come with vegetarian combos along with salad greens. \n\nI was tempted to order kitfo -- raw beef -- to fill out my plate but took comfort in the fact that at least my bill likely would be small. Surely, a veggie combo that's half the size of some I've been served elsewhere would be half the price, right? Quite the contrary; my bill was more than $14 for about $7 worth of food.\n\nThe restaurant's atmosphere is a saving grace; it's bright and inviting. There's free Wi-Fi; you just have to ask an employee for the password. And while I've had to work to get employees' attention at some other Ethiopian restaurants, that wasn't the case here. People were quite friendly. \n\nBased on some other reviewers' pics, perhaps visiting here as part of a group results in getting more food and better variety. But if your solo experience is anything like mine was, the results will be underwhelming for both your palate and your pocketbook.
