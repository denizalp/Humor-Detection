Sometimes you encounter a restaurant that knocks your socks off from out of the blue.  Lotus of Siam was not one of these establishments.  After hearing rave reviews from Gourmet Magazine, J. Gold and that putu from Kevineats.com, I felt compelled to dine at what many have claimed to be \"The best Thai restaurant in North America\".  Dear readers, I think they may be onto something.\n\nDitching our group of friends, my Thai paramour and I courageously walked-in to the restaurant without a reservation and were quoted 1:30 wait for a party of two.  Luckily, mi corazon is as fluid in her native tongue as she is easy on the eyes and successfully flirted (right in front of the ignorant farang guests) our way into a table after only 15 minutes.  Yet another example of the eventual geopolitical power shift from the West to the Orient, suckaz!\n\nThis would prove to be an auspicious beginning to what would culminate in the best meal of our Vegas trip and quite possibly the year.  Unfortunately for us, we were only a party of two and we also had a pressing engagement at XS after dinner.  Because of this, we weren't able to order the full breadth of the menu (like garlic lobster and crab dishes) but we made do with:\n\nNam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice Salad with Issan Sausage)\nKhao Soi (Egg Noodles in Coconut broth with chicken)\nCrispy Duck with Penang Curry\nGarlic Prawns\n6 glasses (1 bottle plus 2 additional servings) of Prum 2009 Kabinett Riesling\n\nAs corazon expressed to me after the first few bites, this is as good as it gets outside of the homeland.  Granted, she remarked that the cuisine was a bit \"fusion\" and not within strict adherence to traditional Thai cusine, but she was nonetheless glowing with her praise.  As for your humble author, dear readers...  I was in Siamese heaven, fusion or no.\n\nAll of the dishes we ordered were excellent, with the Khao Soi and the Nam Kao Tod being my personal favorite.  In addition, the crispiness of the garlic prawns was perfectly married to the garlic infusion and the duck meat was SO juicy and provided a perfect (albeit extremely rich) counterpoint to the Penang curry.  All of the food went amazingly with the J Prum Riesling, a steal at $35 a bottle...\n\nMaybe I had a few too many glasses of the aforementioned wine, because I distinctly remember in between bites whispering to my girlfriend that I wanted to have sex with her on top of all the sumptuous vittles.  Of course, being the modest Thai lady that she is, she shushed me and expertly directed my passions towards the food despite entreaties from your humble author for acceptance of, \"just the tip, sweetie...  come on, just the tip\".  \"OK, OK, later!\" she hissed at me.  What a saint, mi corazon...\n\nLocated in a semi-grimy strip mall, the location is nothing special, but the food was several notches above any Siamese cuisine I've had in the states.  Surprisingly, the service was very good as well.  Granted, I'm always expecting treatment at Asian restaurants to be one notch above the brutality that American POW's experienced by the Japanese during the Bataan Death March...  but illustrative of Thailand's \"Land of Smiles\" moniker, the servers were gracious, friendly and efficient.\n\nTotal bill came out to $123 for all that food and wine.  Officiously, I took out $25 in cash and gently put it in the payment tray.  \n\n\"What, you're not going to pay for the rest of the meal?\" asked my now beleaguered (but very full) girlfriend.  \n\n\"Just the tip, sweetie\" I replied slurring...  \"Just the tip.\"
