This Starbucks is one of my favorites. The staff member that took my order was paitent and took the time to assist me with a few coffee related questions, my drink was made correctly and per my order, and the store was clean. \n\nNote, this store isnt usually packed full of customers, which is nice when you need to find a seat.
