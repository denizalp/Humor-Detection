Don't be fooled by the lack of reviews, the pizza here is well made, and matches up or exceeds the major pizza franchises. My buddies and I felt like having a lazy day at the hotel room in Vegas, and wanted to get some simple delivery. Who knew it would be so difficult to find establishments willing to deliver directly to the room! The fact that this spot delivers straight to your room is a major plus and very convenient. We got the Sicily supreme pizza, plenty of toppings, and the food was still warm. Definitely appreciated the friendly service over the phone as well.  For those lazy afternoons in after a rough Saturday night in Vegas, I recommend checking this joint out.
