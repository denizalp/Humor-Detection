Ho mama. \n\nI've never had a fish taco before Seven Lives. That garbonator taco is something else; filled to the brim, layered with different flavours, and then served in semi soft (presumably pan fried) tortilla. \n\nGarbonator has so much in it, half of which I couldn't distinguish. Oozing cheese at the bottom. A shrimp chowder-looking filling. Fresh tomato. Man, I really want to describe this thing in detail but I think I scarfed it down too fast. \n\nAnd those fresh salsas? Damn.\n\nYou're gonna have to just go.\n\nEdit: It's gobernador!
