My first experience with A&M Corsons (Scottsdale location) was fantasic.  That location is conveniently close to my work. The store was staffed with friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff who helped me literally turn my pool blue from green.  However, this review is for the Chandler location.\n\nI figured I would go by the Chandler location to test my newly cleaned pool water and purchase some misc. supplies.  The location was scheduled to close at 6pm and we showed up around 5:45pm with a water sample.  The only staff in the store was very dismissive and not friendly.  When I asked him to test my water sample he only remarked \"your chlorine is high,\"  when I asked him about everything else (phosphates, alkalinity, etc.), he told me he could not test those because my pool needs to settle as to not give a false reading.  \n\nWhen it was time to check out, I tried to pay with cash and the employee winced and remarked, \"you don't have a card?\"  I was puzzled and asked why they didn't accept cash.  He told me that his drawer had already been counted.  \n\nImmediately, it became evident that the sales associate wanted to close up the shop ASAP and that meant not properly testing my water sample or providing any customer service.  Throughout the whole interaction, his attitude was very poor and spoke to me as if I was wasting his time.\n\nI will not be bringing any more business to the Chandler A&M Corsons.  My suggestion to anyone in the area would be to visit the Leslie's Pool Supply on the northwest corner of Elliot and Alma School.
