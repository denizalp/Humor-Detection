Service has gone WAY downhill. Called in for an appointment and they had us explain what was wrong. Showed up for appointment. Had to explain two more times to different people what was wrong for a total of 3 times. How many times do we need to communicate the EXACT SAME THING??? After sitting there for 45 minutes after our appointment time we told one of the staff we couldn't. She suggested next time we make an appointment. Really? So different then the appointment we had today? Uh... ok... \nSad because we love their products and we would totally expect to wait if we just popped in randomly.
