We first went after a long bike ride and it was exactly what we wanted and needed to refuel! I had shrimp, brown rice and sweet potatoes. Seasoned well and reheated great too! My bf loves the kimchi steak. \n\nWhy it won't be my weekly post gym spot: \n\nThe only non-soda drinks they offer are iced tea or bottled water. Really? There are so many amazing health conscious and unique beverage choices out there. \n\nAll food is served in togo containers and all flatware is plastic. And all beverages are served in styrofoam cups. Ughhh, 1990s called. So even if I finish my meal, I still bring my garbage home to recycle because they don't. Why is Vegas so wasteful?! \n\nI will go back bc it's my style of lunch but Ill bring my own drink and take my food home.
