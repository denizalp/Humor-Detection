In the words of the great poet John Mellencamp, Hurt so good. Come on baby, make it hurt so good. Also, any time I hear or say that all I can picture is the episode of Will & Grace where Jack graduates from the weird nursing school and one of the nurses sings that at the ceremony. Gah, I love that show.\n\nBack to MADabolic, hurt so good indeed. I have been wanting to try this place for a long time, but I was little too scared. I signed up for ClassPass and this is the of the studios involved. So, I took a deep breath and went with a friend.\n\nEvery workout has been different so far. Expect to see five different stations. They could be anything from punching bag, to weights, running (even suicides. ugh) and even the row machine. And expect a good solid workout. The same class and sequence runs for the entire day. \n\nI've taken classes with both Carl and Cristina. They thoroughly explain each station before class and demonstrate the proper technique. They are both extremely motivating and help you during class to make sure you are using the right technique. (They probably get frustrated with me... I'm always doing something wrong.)\n\nYou reserve your class spot ahead of time. You will need boxing gloves for most classes. You can buy them or rent a pair there. I bought mine. I'm not sure how clean you can get gloves... and trust me, you will be sweaty.\n\nIt's a great workout every time. Don't be intimidated. The instructors and clients are all really nice.\n\nOne word of warning right now with the South Blvd construction mess: leave a good 5 minutes earlier than usual to get here. I was almost late yesterday morning because I got caught in traffic.
