I am re-writing my review based on the multiple visit that occurred after the unfortunate event couple years ago.\n\nWhoever is the current manager, you deserve recognition. \n\nFrom the moment I arrive to Kampai to the end of my evening, every single detail matters. The staff are attentive and make sure I have an amazing time. \n\nI never ate at Kampai but always come for drinks. \n\nGoodbye Soubois, Kampai is my new second home!\n\nTHANK YOU TEAM KAMPAI!
