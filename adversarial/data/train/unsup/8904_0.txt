Dive bar...I think not.\n\nBar that people have tended to forget...I think so.\n\n20 years ago, this was the midpoint between my residence and ASU.  Back in the day, the drinks were strong, the food was from the restaurant on the corner or across the street at Arco.\n\nToday, I walked in hoping to find football, food and beer.  I found a bartender and 2 other patrons.  11:15 AM, games are already on...and there are several posters touting cheap beer during games.  I ordered a PBR and asked about ordering food only to be told that the cook has not yet arrived nor called in.  \n\n11:30 AM, I have finished my first beer and asked for a second.  Still no word about a cook.  \n\n11:45 AM, I have finished my second beer and I am ready to pick up and go when someone breezes through the front door and announces they have arrived.  Looking quizically at the bartender, he says she's the cook.  She proceeds to take her coffee behind the bar, fix it with cream and sugar and chat with the bartender for a few minutes...then she's off to the kitchen where I presume she is getting everything turned on.\n\n12 PM...the bartender returns and asks me if I need another beer.  Another $2 PBR is set in front of me.  The cook comes out and asks what I would like to order.  I let her know I want a pound of wings, as hot as she can make them.  She asks if I want the wings grilled and I reply that I don't care how they are cooked, as long as they are physically hot and spicy when they are put in front of me.\n\n12:15 PM...I've polished off the latest PBR and wings have not been put in front of me.  I ask for another PBR and state that if the wings are not done before I am done with the beer, I am going to head out.  \n\n12:24 PM...I am presented with wings.  I take a taste and ask for tabasco.  The cook asks if they are not spicy enough, and I reply that if they were, why would I ask for tabasco?  She scuttles back to the kitchen.\n\nI've been careful to pay for each round and the wings when they are presented.  I've also been careful to tip exactly 10%, as this is not the service I would want and certainly not what I remember.\n\nYou want football, wings and beer?  You can do better than this.
