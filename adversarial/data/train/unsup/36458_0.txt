Not bad, actually. I got the Mediterranean salad and was pleasantly surprised that the chicken was actually grilled in house, right before serving it to me. This is rare for airport food. \n\nAlso, the lemon vinaigrette, which I was regretting because the first taste was too tart, paired quite well with the raisins and feta cheese. \n\nI'd do it again.
