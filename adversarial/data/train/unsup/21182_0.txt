My 2010 VW Jetta was not living up to my standards, so I wanted to see what my options were. I checked out Honda's website & saw what greatness there was in Accords & Civics. I've had several Accords before, but this was back in the 90s.\n\nLeland Thompson, sales manager, & Perry Flythe, salesman, were fantastic to work with. They listened to my concerns & wants & they were able to put me in a brand new 2014 Honda Accord EX-L. It has all the features I wanted & they were able to lower my car payment, by a few dollars. Hey, a few dollars is a few dollars!\n\nPerry was very knowledgeable about the Honda line of cars. He was very patient, as well. \n\nWhile it took a bit for detailing, the dealership was busy that day with sales, so I wasn't too bothered by this. Free popcorn, water & Wi-Fi kept me content while waiting. \n\nVery pleased with my car buying experience!
