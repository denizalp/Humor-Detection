I must say I'm not impressed. The service is slow. The staffs are not very passionate in serving their customer. They never refill our drinks  even when it's empty. The food is not that great. The only thing that kept me eating for a while was the king crabs, rock crabs and some other seafood. Well I must admit I'm a big seafood lover. One thing I don't really understand is that they don't readily provide the tool to crack the crab shells open (sorry I don't know what it calls). You have to ask the staffs to get it. After we left, nobody even bother to say thank you. We just walked out....
