Don't even know why i decided to give them another chance...last visit, youth hockey teams running up and down the halls screaming like animals and no Management to get parents to intervene....this time....\n\"Do you have any upgrades?\", as i am a Hilton Diamond member....\"no, all our rooms are the same\"....but they DO HAVE their Presidential suite available....just didn't want to give it out...also, they have their premium suites....guess they didn't want to give those out as well....\nfront desk person is clueless, MOD thinks \"premium\", which they charge extra for, is the same....bunch of idiots...giving the Hilton Brand a black eye......
