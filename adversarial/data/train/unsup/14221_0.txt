I've heard a lot about this place, so I was really excited to finally try it.  I was told in advance to get shrimp instead of the craw-fish so you don't have to do as much removing of shells.\n\nThe waits are long here and parking is very scarce up front, so be prepared to park on the side street.  The menu is very simple and the waitress is more than willing to explain how everything works.\n\nWe ordered a basket of the hot fries for the table and they lived up to their name.  As tasty as they were it's a good thing to split with a group because I imagine they wear on you in the long-run.\n\nI decided on the Hot N Juicy special sauce shrimp.  They bring it out in a hot plastic bag and from there you go to town.  After an intro lesson from someone in our party, I was peeling shrimp faster and faster as the night went on.  It definitely is a lot of work peeling especially when the food is still a little hot, but on the plus side it slows your pace of eating so you don't eat too much!\n\nAfter all was said and done the food was OK, It's been 3 days and I still have a hint of garlic smell on my hands and the next day when I went for a run my sweat smelled like the sauce!  For all the effort you put in I wish the food was better, but the experience is something to live.\n\nTip:  Make sure to not wear any fancy clothing and possibly ask for gloves so your hands don't stink for days.
