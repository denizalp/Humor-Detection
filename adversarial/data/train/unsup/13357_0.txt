I love this temple. It holds a dear place in my heart as I have a plaque here for both sets of grandparents that I visit regularly - my parents bought a space for each of them back in the early 2000s when the temple recently opened. While it's situated in a strange location with a few small strip mall stores around it, the temple itself is a portal to another world once you step inside. The beautiful statues and the chanting bring a sense of calm over you almost immediately.\n\nOther awesome things about this temple include the classes they have: want to learn wing chun? or how to play the Chinese violin? Or how to write Chinese calligraphy? Then here's your place! The classes are cheap and the community is extremely nice. I look forward to my Chinese violin lessons next year!\n\nAnd lastly - the food here is amazing. It's a bit pricy for $8, but let me tell you - the laksa here is insanely good. And it's entirely vegetarian, but don't let that stop you. The soup base is the best around, and the noodles are just right. They also have a large variety of teas for $8 a pot, which is a bit steep (ha! get it?) but their fruit tea is SO GOOD - and it comes with little biscuits, if that's any consolation. \n\nThe catch? You have to be a member. And that will set you back $30 a year. But seriously, $30 a year? You can totally afford that, and the cost goes back to the temple - totally worth it. At the very least, stop by and check out the beautiful statues!
