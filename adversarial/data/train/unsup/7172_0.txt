Zero Stars if I could. 10 Days after shipping, my order was held at a post office but the tracking number did not specify which of the post offices in my zip code was holding the package.  When I called Frank & Oak they told me to \"visit the nearest one.\"  I live in Los Angeles. We have lots of post offices.  The only solution they offered was to file a claim.  The never offered a credit, nor a discount and refused to cancel the order and resend another hat.  They only agreed to a refund and if the hat ever did arrive they would charge my card for the full amount even though it was already 7 days after the expected arrival date. Spoke to three different people at the company and will never order from here again.\n\nHere is the online chat transcript:\n\n Frank and Oak  Tue, 11\/29\/16 04:09:43 pm America\/Los_Angeles \n \nHello, how may I help you?\/Bonjour, comment puis-je vous aider ?  \n \n \n \n \n  Michael 04:09:47 pm \n \nHello  \nUnfortunately, I have not received my order 04:10:00 pm\n \n \n \n \n  Frank and Oak  04:10:03 pm \n \nHi Michael!  \n \n \n \n \n  Michael 04:10:09 pm \n \nThe order number is 400809576  \n \n \n \n \n  Frank and Oak  04:10:14 pm \n \nThank you!  \nI will look at it one moment! \n \n \n \n \n  Michael 04:10:31 pm \n \nthank you  \n \n \n \n \n  Frank and Oak  04:12:38 pm \n \nThabk you for teh wait!  \nthe* \nYour order is currently in LA post office. 04:14:42 pm\nthe location is LOS ANGELES, CA 90024 \n \n \n \n \n  Michael 04:15:10 pm \n \nis there an address?  \nIs this item being delivered to my house? \n \n \n \n \n  Frank and Oak  04:15:37 pm \n \nNot on the tracking link.  \nBut yes it should. \nUSPS say held up in post office 04:16:08 pm\n \n \n \n \n  Michael 04:16:29 pm \n \nHow do I receive the ordered item?  \n \n \n \n \n  Frank and Oak  04:17:27 pm \n \nOk!
