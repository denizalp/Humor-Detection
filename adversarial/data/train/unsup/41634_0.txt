Delish tacos and the nachos are amazing! I get Fernandos every time im downtown from a long night of drinking. The tacos: very tender and full of flava  the nachos: by far my favorite place to get nachos, ANYWHERE. Well worth $8. They are generous with every ingredient that comes with them. Make sure to stop by here!
