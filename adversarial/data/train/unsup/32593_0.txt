We visited Beso's with a group of friends and felt fortunate to be seated at what would have been Eva's  table (which I had requested for while making reservations). \n\nLet's start with a review of cocktails\/ wine- both were excellent! My girlfriend ordered a raspberry flavored cocktail and another one ordered an apple martini. Both were fantastic! I ordered a red wine blend recommended by the bartender, called prisoner. Very good recommendation indeed.\n\nWe were excited to try the steaks here. But to our disappointments, mine and a friend's filets were served at room temperature. After some debate on whether or not to bring this to the waiter's attention, we decided to say something to him. The waiter was extremely apologetic and took both our steaks back. My friend decided he did not want to risk another lukewarm steak while I decided to give it another shot! This of course was the 2nd bad call of the night (the 1st one being to dine here). This time they served the filet charred. To add insult to injury, my baked potato was not fully cooked.\n\nAlthough the manager did come by our table to apologize, we made a decision never to eat here again! It was a waste of money and time!!!
