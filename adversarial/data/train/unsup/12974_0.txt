Someone once said \"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting it to come out different\".  (No, it probably wasn't Einstein or Franklin.)\n\nI guess I'm insane as I have gone to this McDonald's repeatedly for some time, hoping beyond hope that it will get better.  It hasn't.\n\nThere is ONE good thing about this McDonalds.  The woman who is the regular at the drive in window in the morning keeps the line moving fast.  I always know when she isn't there as the line is backed up to the edge of the parking lot. On those occasions I typically park and go inside.  This is always a mistake.  \n\nWhen you go inside in the morning (I typically pass through at 7 am) the place is fully staffed with about 8 people visible behind the counter, cooking, etc.  Oddly, I often stand there for a couple of minutes before someone who looks either disinterested or bothered comes to take my order.  \n\nI'm not sure why I always try to get a fruit and yogurt parfait for breakfast.  Yes, the fruit and yogurt parfait is a breakfast item.  No, they don't make them first thing in the morning.  Whaaaa?  \n\nHere's the scenario that's played out at least three times in the last month.  \n\nMe:  \"I'd like a fruit and yogurt parfait please.\" \n\nYoung man, talking over his shoulder:  \"We have any parfaits?\"\n\nYoung lady, opening cooler:  \"No, she didn't make them yet.\"\n\nYoung man:  \"She didn't make them yet.\"\n\nMe:  \"Shouldn't they be made for breakfast?\"\n\nYoung man:  \"I don't know.\"\n\nMe:  \"Okay, bye.\"\n\nI just don't get this.  The manager has often been involved in this exchange yet rather than saying to his staff, \"Hey, your job first thing in the morning is to make the fruit and yogurt parfaits\", apparently the manager has no interest in SELLING A PRODUCT.\n\nAnother gripe of mine is the utter unpredictability of the staff's ability to add stuff to coffee.  Sometimes it's perfectly made with the exact right amount of cream and sweetner.  Sometimes you get it and there is what appears to be three drops of cream and no sweetener in it. \n\nI'm guessing the \"lets sell a machine that makes adding stuff to coffee faster so we can make more money\" mentality is what causes this.  I've seen them use the gadgets, apparently correctly, and yet the result is what appears to be black coffee.  \n\nMaybe they should just stop offering to  add the stuff to the coffee for you and go back to the old days when you just got the coffee, cream and sweetener.  \n\nOr maybe I should order it with the cream and sweetner on the side.\n\nOr maybe I should go to Dunkin Donuts. \n\nAnd yes, I agree with the other reviewer that for some reason the prices at this McDonalds are much higher than the two or three others I go to.  The coffee, for example, costs $1.90 whereas at the others I go to  it costs $1.75.   \n\nIn closing, pick another McDonalds.  It will stop you from ruminating on all the things that are wrong with this one.  \n\nChris
