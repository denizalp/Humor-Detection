$6.99 steak dinner special means I don't have to schlep it to Ellis Island if I want a cheap steak fix..which I haven't had in 2 years but still...\n\nI got a $20 match play coupon in the mail for my birthday here and they offer $10 match play coupons on the back of the Flamingo and Decatur Smith's supermarket reciepts.  So my wife and I go and the bartender just puts a $20 in my machine..lets my wife use 2 coupons so she has $20 in free play now.  I also had a buy one get one free entree coupon to top it all off.\n\nMy wife orders the cheeseburger which was just ok but I get the steak dinner which is a pretty sweet deal for all the stuff you get.  This is quality late night drunken food for sure!!  \n\n7 drinks later, I end up hitting quad aces and quad 5's in back to back hands and my wife hits a ten high diamond straight flush on her machine!!  First time either of us had ever hit those high hands in our limited video poker experience.\n\nDrinks were comped for our play, dinner comes out to $9 and we cash out for $100.  Pretty fn great!!!
