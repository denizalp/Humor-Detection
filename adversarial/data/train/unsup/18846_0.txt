Madison no doubt has some of the best egg sandwiches out there. I'd only ever had McDonald's egg mcmuffin (a zillion years ago, mind you), so perhaps my expectations weren't all that high. But my oh my, Marigold Kitchen's egg sandwich is one of the best I've had since moving to Madison a year ago. Would of gotten five stars had the bacon been cooked a little longer.\n\nFor a side I purchased potatoes, which I generally would douse in ketchup - but there was enough flavor where, dare I say it, my favorite condiment was not necessary. \n\nTried the Peppermint Mocha with Soy. Not a fan. Boyfriend enjoyed the coffee, but wished there was more of a selection rather than just one Regular or Decaf carafe. The unlimited refills made up for his griping, though.
