Had high expectations going in, and it definitely did not disappoint. The wait was 90 minutes, but they took down our name and gave us a buzzer so that we could go shopping instead of waiting in line. The buzzer did go off after around 90 minutes. Our server was extremely attentive even though it was incredibly busy. Servings were huge as well (not complaining though).
