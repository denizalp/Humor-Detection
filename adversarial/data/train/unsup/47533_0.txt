Well 6 years ago I would have said that this buffet was the best thing I had ever had Not anymore. \nAfter having the buffet at ARIA the buffet here was like a Golden Corral compared. \n\nFood was tasteless. Most over cooked And the crab legs were no bigger than a pencil and COLD who serves steamed crab legs cold? \n\nThe sweet section was nothing more than frozen petit fours that you could buy at a Sams club thaw and serve. Was told they were made fresh in house daily. Not true. Maybe unfrozen daily. \n\n116.00 for 3 people and honestly I would have enjoyed Panda Express more than here. Waited about 45 minutes to get seated and probably only ate for 20 minutes and that's walking through the lines included\n\nVery disappointed and just don't see a return trip for us.
