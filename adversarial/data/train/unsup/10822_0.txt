Illumilatte has been my go to place to see friends and it's also a very great place to do work or study. \nWell I have been exceptionally pumped about this cafe ever since I heard of its illuminati theme :-) The interior is pretty hip and the wall arts are iconic. \nSadly enough, Illumilatte used to sell large macarons with cool flavors but now their display case is full of desserts like normal sized macarons to rose meringue sandwiches with chocolate ganache filling. They also have more filling things on the menu such as paninis, and they just added salads onto the menu, too.\nWell I've had their signature Illumilatte drink and despite the heat, I do order it hot (it just tastes delicious hot). The employees are super considerate enough to always add latte art and I always get a kick out of that. I have also had their ice green tea latte, Java truffle frap, cream frap (green tea frap with white chocolate macadamia), and their earl grey tea by the pot. The cream frap is by far my most favorite and I order that every single time I come.\nI really enjoy my time here and I have actually never had a bad experience with service or with any of my orders. I definitely recommend this establishment!
