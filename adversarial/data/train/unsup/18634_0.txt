A small airport that needs some improvement. \nThis place seems to be in the middle of a big rebuilding effort. Most of the terminal is done, but the parking garages and car rental areas are still under construction. \nThe lines for security here are long. Bored TSA agents mindlessly repeat the same instructions over and over. \"Shoes off! Laptops out!\" \nThere aren't many places to eat here. I love it when local restaurants are featured in the airport. Not here. Wendy's is one of the slim choices for food. \nLong moving sidewalks take you past movie posters of feature films that were shot in the Charlotte area. There were a lot of car racing films shot here, and Evil Dead II! \nThere aren't too many things to see or do here. No big public works of art. No interesting shops. Just newsstands and fast food. \nThe traffic here is maddening. At the arrivals area, traffic is slowed to a slow snarl, and it takes for ever to get out of there. \nI'm not a big fan of this airport.
