Want a hand held lunch that you can enjoy with variety? Empanadas are the way to go and Republica Empanada has made it so!\n \nIn a small location with some parking in a lot and more available along the street, flavor packed empanadas are created daily to satify many different tastes.  These are thick doughy empanadas made in an over rather, they are thin discs of dough that are stuffed, folded, sealed and fried to crispy perfection. They have many options for fillings, my favorite was the Boriqua, which was filled with arroz con gandules (rice with pigeon peas, they are like the baby of a pea and a lentil, a little fatter than a lentil and drier than a pea) and pernil (puertorican style roasted pork with lots of garlic, olive and annatto seed flavor).\n \nThe restaurant is small and can get full around the lunch hour. They offer daily specials that are NOT empanadas but are delish. I had a chicken, rice and her sopa that was thick and almost gumbo-like once that was YUMMY. It is counter service and they are friendly plus can help with any questions you have on the menu.\n \nI can't wait to try them for dinner one day soon!
