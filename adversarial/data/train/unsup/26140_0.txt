The best BBQ in Arizona!  Recommended meats in order of taste; fatty brisket; lean brisket; pork ribs; pulled pork; sausage; turkey; pastrami.  The truth is that everything is amazing, so you can't go wrong with any choice.  The meat is never reheated, so everything is always moist and delicious.  The side selections are limited, but I am a fan of the beans, and coleslaw.  I know people that love the grits, but I have never been a fan of grits from anywhere outside of the south.  Only downside's are parking and wait time.  The parking is very limited and can be difficult to navigate.  It is very common for their to be an hour or more wait time in line!  BBQ fans know this is common for the best places.
