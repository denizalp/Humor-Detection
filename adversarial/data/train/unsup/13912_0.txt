So I visited this place two times over this weekend.... sounds bad right? \n\nFriday we shared a pizza and wings, 3 Capt and Cokes for me and several large mugs of beer for my sexy wife. Everything was great and the bill was cheap. \nWe also tried some of the Spin Dip, Alfredo Chicken and garlic knots. Those were all good too. \n\nSunday, the Cards were playing and so was the Green Bay and Vikings on at the same time. We had to go to a bar that had them both. \n\nI had the burger and a salad. While the burger was OK and most of you would have loved it I was underwhelmed and had hoped for better. I was disappointed by the salad too. It was lettuce and carrots and 2 small cherry tomatoes. \nThe buddies sliders and wings were good.
