Had breakfast this morning at Apple Dumpling and found a hair in my biscuits and gravy.  I pulled it out but then could not eat because it made me sick, so I put it back.   Mentioned it to the server and the cook came out and told me that I put the hair in the food.  I explained to him what I had done, but he continued to blame me for the hair.  With the added burnt pancakes, cold eggs and a late kids meal, we will never visit this place again.\n\nBad service and bad food....it's a shame that yelp does not allow no stars....
