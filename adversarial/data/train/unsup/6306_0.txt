I wish I could give Corepower Yoga 5 stars because they have the right idea! True \"power yoga\", heated classes, spa like studio and affordable! However, the atmosphere is similar to taking a yoga class at a college sotority house. Let me explain...I am a full time working, married, mother in my mid 30's. I have been practicing yoga for 15 years at various studios around Chandler and Gilbert. I have been looking for a true heated power vinyasa flow class near my house for a long time, so I was really excited to hear about the new Corepower Yoga studio that opened a few months ago, offering power yoga in a heated environment. Like I said, the yoga is challenging, very scripted, but challenging (especially the sculpt class) and the studio is great; however, in every class that I've attended I am the oldest person in the room by 15 years. The only people I've seen in the classes are 18-23 years old. Furthermore, everyone seems to only wear sport bras and yoga shorts to class...there is zero modesty at Corepower. In the locker room, hallway, and even in the studios before class begins I have to listen to groups of girls taking loudly (sometimes inappropriately) about roommate drama, class schedules, their plans for the upcoming weekend, and various dating stories. Corepower Yoga is more of a college hangout than a yoga studio. If one practices yoga than one understands the importance of feeling connected to the studio of practice  and the yoga community. I will not continue practicing at this studio because I have not been able to connect.
