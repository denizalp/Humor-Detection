A few things...\n- This place is located in one of the older, and more colorful, parts of Chandler\n- When you find the place you'll wonder if its the right place\n- Parking can be a challenge\n\nOrdered biscuits and gravy.  Not bad...little light on sausage but pretty good overall.  The biscuits were very good, but for some reason seemed to be somewhat toasted...odd.\n\nGood place...will go again.
