I would give this less of a rating, but at least 3 out of 4 flights were on time.\n\n1: cheap my ass!! They nickel and dime you to the point where your budget goes right out the window.  $450 turns into $560 in a flash... And this includes NOTHING!\n\n2: comfort. There is no such thing. I didn't know you could actually get seats that close to each other. \n\n3: shit service.   That sums it up.   Shit
