Meh. Boyfriend and I shared the Tottie Rolls (good, but definitely not \"the best egg rolls you'll ever have), Shrimp Tom Yum (tasty, but doesn't hold a candle to the soup at Malee's), Queen Alaskan Roll (tried it because it was the daily special, but did not enjoy it), and the General Tao's chicken (just ok). Everything on the menu - Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese and Chinese dishes - sounded good, but it just didn't blow us away in the taste department. The restaurant's atmosphere was nice, and the waiter was excellent and very attentive. Probably the best part of the meal was the iced green tea - it was very flavorful.
