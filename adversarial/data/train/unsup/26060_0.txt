Large Menu, Check. Angry waiters, Check. Huge Portions, Check...you are at a diner.\n\nThe food is good, the coffee is strong as hell, the waiters are super busy at all times. \n\nI love that they served fruit with all of the breakfasts, the potatoes are awesome, the omelettes were cooked just enough, not dry. I love that they also serve beans.\n\nWorth trying for a cheap meal, great outdoor seating.
