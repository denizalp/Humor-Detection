I've been holding off on reviewing Kitchen Table because I wanted to check it out more than once. But, now that their second location will be opening soon on the westside (closer to me) I doubt I'll make the trek back to Henderson.\n\nWhat I tried on my lone visit was outstanding. The sweet, warm, pillowy soft monkey bread was everything I thought it would be and more. The pork belly benedict had enough heat from the jalape√±o Hollandaise to wake up my palate, without numbing it and the pork was crispy, yet tender. The salted caramel pecan donut, to finish my meal was a nice, sweet way to end a great meal.
