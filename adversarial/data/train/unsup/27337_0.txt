Staff is friendly and changes channels if requested. The gym is relatively clean. There are readily available updated Precor machines. There's plenty of TVs easily visible from the cardio machines. Parking is never an issue.\n\nHowever, in December 2015 they informed all their members that this gym was being upgraded to a \"Super Sport\" and made members pay a fee to upgrade their membership or get locked out. In early 2016 they re-classified it as a \"Super Sport\" but then provided none of the amenities of a \"Super Sport\" (towel service, personal TVs, etc.). They later changed it back to a \"Sport\", proving the decision to be a crappy money-grab by corporate.
