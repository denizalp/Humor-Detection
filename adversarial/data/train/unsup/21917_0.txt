Cheap and good are the two words that come to mind. I was rather fond of my $12 tender, chicken fajitas and $4.75 Modelo. I would do it again. And, thus, though I generally avoid the half-star math, I do think it was a 3.5 star meal. \n\nThe reasons it didn't push through to a 4-star:\n1. The atmosphere. I am not sure why exactly, but the main dining area makes me feel like I am in a college dining room. They have a back room for private events that is spacious and filled with light, but the front space lacks character. \n2. Chips and salsa. The salsa trio didn't light my fire. \n3. Delayed greet. This is one of my odd pet peeves with service. It really bothers me when it takes longer than 30 seconds to be greeted by my server, and here, it took several minutes. Once we were greeted, service was good, but first impressions matter!\n\nOverall, it was a good meal. Like I said, I would do it again.
