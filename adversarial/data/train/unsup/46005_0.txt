My boyfriend and I recently moved to Pittsburgh and Chicken Latino was a great introduction to the Strip District scene! Between the five of us, our bill came to about $60 for a variety of appetizers and entrees that we couldn't even finish! Also, it it a BYOB which is always a plus.\n\nThe service was great. Our server was very friendly and the food came out fresh,fast and hot!\n\nI started off with a Honey Dew slushie made with fresh fruit which was amazing! I will always, always order one of those! \n\nWe ordered the plantains, jalapeno poppers and yucca fries to start. They have this homemade green chile sauce that is really delicious. We were encouraged to mix it up in some mayo as a dip for the yucca fries. I'm not a huge fan of mayo, but it cut the spiciness of the sauce just enough to be a perfect combo! I ended up dipping a little bit of everything!\n\nWe split a whole chicken and a beef platter. One came with rice and beans, the other with fries and cole slaw. The sides were all delicious, but the meat was unbelievable! Slow roasted seasoned rotisserie chicken and chunks of beef that were so tender it was falling apart!\n\nWhen I have friends or family visit the burgh, this will definitely be one of the places we take them! Can't wait to go back.
