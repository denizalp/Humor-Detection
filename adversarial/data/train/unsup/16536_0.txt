Can I give a review without granting a single star?\n\nMy dad came home pissed off because he was at this Asian market since 9:30 am.  The sign on the door said they will open at 10 am on 4th of july.  More people began to show up outside the store, waiting for it to open.  \n\nAt 10 or so, the owner was there and visibly changed the written 10 am to 11am.  People were complaining to him saying they've been waiting, and he just turned around and walked away from everyone without a word spoken.\n\np.s. his restaurant down the street (DT's) sucks too. \n\nThis is actually the last time me or my family will be coming here.  The store always feels unwelcoming and the owner needs to get off his high horse and smike, and greet his guests with kindness.   For lack for a better word, he's a dick.
