We walked over for lunch because we were waiting for Sycamore Brewing to open. It looked like we were the first ones there at 12 on a Saturday, a little strange but who cares when you are sat quickly and the beer comes out quicker. The service was great Our waitress Lauren was attentive and she chatted with My mother in law and Aunt about her trips to Europe. My mother in law in heading there in September. Our food came out quick but not so fast as we couldn't enjoy drinks. The food was hot and fresh and cooked right, we sat outside in the patio area and they had fans on and with the breeze it was not to hot to be out in the sun. After we paid the tab we checked the games they had two cornhole setups and giant jenga. This place would great for happy hour with all that to keep busy. i will definitely be back and bring a crowd to enjoy everything they have to offer.
