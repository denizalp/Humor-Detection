Good for the Korean Choice in Pittsburgh, but overall strange.\n\nFood is very expensive for the dishes, dolsot bibimbop is tasty. Every time I go, I notice that the standards have been slipping. Service is okay, not very attentive. Free sides are only served sometimes. Strange atmosphere with K-pop videos on loop on the televisions. \n\nWhen we went about a month ago, after we ate, my girlfriend was asked to wait upfront while i was in the restroom (presumably so they can reset the table ... even though the restaurant was mostly empty). When I came to find her, our waiter who just served us, tried to seat us again and then told me that the bathroom was for customers only. Strange that he didn't remember who he just served
