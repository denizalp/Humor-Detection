My puppy had a spider bite and after I went to several other vets this was my last hope.  All the other doctors we had seen had no clue what it was- which was so scary.  We walked in here from a referral, saw the doctor within 10 minutes and within 2 seconds she knew exactly what it was and how to treat it.  Since then this has been our new vet.  We even board them here!  We drive all the way from South Summerlin and I wouldn't change a thing.
