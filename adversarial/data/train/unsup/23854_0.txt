Heard Island Flavor expanded as well as went under new ownership, so we had to visit.  Glad to report it's still as good as it ever was!\n\nThe fam & I were driving on the SW side of town that night thinking of what to eat for dinner.  It had been a while, so I think it was me that said, \"Let's go to Island Flavor!\"  And off we were!\n\nGot to the parking lot and all looked to be the same outside.  But upon entering - we noticed the place is now much bigger!  Island Flavor knocked down the entire wall to the business next door (which used to be their Hawaiian mini mart of sorts), effectively making their restaurant nearly twice the size!  Lots more room now for us hungry locals, and lots less wait!\n\nWe got easily seated in 5 minutes.  But then my anxiousness started because I had to wonder - was the menu under the new ownership still the same??  Fear not my Hawaii friends, the menu for Island Flavor is pretty much intact!  All the usual favorites are still there, and thankfully the size portions are still there too!  Don't be shy...eat all your rice!  Poi too if you got it!  Make you big boys & girls!\n\nWe were hungry so we ordered BIG:\n\n-Mixed Plate ($11.50) with Chicken Katsu & Teriyaki Chicken\n-Mixed Plate ($11.50) with Furikake Chicken & Hawaiian Style Roast Pork\n-Loco Moco ($9) - 10 oz. homemade burger patty, over rice with 2 over easy eggs & smothered in gravy\n\nEh!  Still taste the same as I remember!  Glad they didn't change up the recipes too much if any at all - still ONO!  Brok da' mout!!  Island Flavor makes some damn tasty chicken katsu, and thankfully the katsu sauce has flavor too!  Furikake chicken was salty & sweet at the same time, and the Hawaiian Style roast pork was tender & savory with the gravy.  The Loco Moco - who can say anything bad about that?  Great grilled hamburger patty (need those burnt edges), a runny egg, rich gravy...over a Mack truck portion of rice!  Definitely drool worthy!\n\nAloha spirit is still there at Island Flavor too, gotta love the service for us kama'aina!  Pleasant, fast, friendly, but at the same time no rush for us to get in and out.  Probably could have stayed to talk story!\n\nIsland Flavor no worries, you guys still doing good.  Keep it up, we'll be back soon!  Shakas!!
