Came here while waiting for a doctor's appointment. It's located at Bathurst and Lawrence where the Metro and Winners are located. This parking lot is a zoo, and I had to wait for parking in the back. Going inside, the place is fairly big, and the smell of acetone wasn't too high. Rose was my nail technician and very nice. I had called prior to see if they could take me, and they were able to accommodate. However it does get busy so make an appointment. They had a lot of colors to choose from for shellac. I will say that although it isn't their fault, the towels they use do look fairly worn out and stained, and I prefer places that use new tools when they do my nails. Regardless, I was there on a whim, and I feel they did a good job. The price for shellac removal plus shellac manicure was 30 bucks, which is a lot less than my usual place. If you pay cash they won't charge you tax.
