Skip this joint. How do you have the name RINGS in your name and serve frozen onion pre-made onion rings? So disappointing. The chicken wings were so so, probably frozen too. We were there on a game day and it was just blah blah blah....waitresses in see through black leggings talking betwixt themselves instead of providing good service. They should have paid us to eat that crap.
