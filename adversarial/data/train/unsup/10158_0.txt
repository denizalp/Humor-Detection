This is my VERY first review where even the one star i gave is NOT deserved. I honeatly dont see how this place stays in business especially with Sura open right across the street.\n\nNot only will we never be back, we didnt even stay for dinner, even after being seated. Yes, our large party up and left after we saw the menu and realized how expensive it was for such a small variety of food. They offer 3 menus. The $16 has about 8 items, the $20 about 12 items and the $25 has about 15 items. Problem #1 your entire party\/table has to get the same menu. Problem #2 (more of a personal once because it is my fav) they dont have Kalbi on any of the menus. Problem #3 they charge full price for anyone over 7, now i want to meet a 7 year old who can eat just as much as a full grown adult.\n\n We left and went to Sura where the selection is about 4 times that of Korean Garden, they charge half price for kids under 12 and yup they have Kalbi. The service there is great as well. \n\nTruly a disappointment
