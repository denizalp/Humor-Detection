Such an extreme disappointment.  For booking a two bedroom suite and paying the rate we did in order to stay at the hotel, one would think that everything would be 5 stars and above.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.\n\nHere are the major problems experienced with our stay:\n1) The sinks in both the mini bar as well as one of the bedrooms kept making loud popping noises.\n2) The toilet in one of the restrooms smelled like straight sulfur, as well as marijuana.  I addressed the odors with one of the attendants that came to restock the mini bar and his response to me after I mentioned the smell of marijuana was \"and thats a problem?!?!\"  Why yes, sir, that is a problem when you don't partake in illegal paraphernalia.\n3) The cleaning service only entered our room once in three days even though we specifically requested that the room be turned over.  \n\nClearly,  the standards don't seem to be held as high as one would expect or require when booking a two bedroom suite.
