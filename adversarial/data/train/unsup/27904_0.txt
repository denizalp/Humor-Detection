I got off work at 9p and bf and I wanted to go to a restaurant, just sit at the bar and have some drinks, apps, and a dessert. We took the opportunity to try Sea Stone. \n\nI've always liked the decor in that building. Its very appealing and its also practical for the staff. The one thing I wish they would've got rid of is the stupid water table. That thing is tacky. And its broken. \n\nSince we just had drinks and an app, I can't review the whole dining experience. We sat at the bar. Our bartender was a young kid with bandanas, tattoos, piercings, and remnants of black fingernail polish. All of the other patrons sitting at the bar dressed likewise, the Vegas rocker punk demographic. \n\nWe got the porcupine shrimp appetizer, which tasted very similar to Chinese honey walnut shrimp. It was a really small portion for $11. If you go to Joyful House and order honey walnut shrimp, you'll get twice as much for the same price. \n\nFor our appetizer and one round of drinks, we paid $26 before tip. \n\nSea Stone is just like Hannah's but more Korean than Vietnamese. \n\n* off the strip, non-casino
