I did not have a good experience here.\n\nI walked into Suzanne's Bridal on a Monday, was looked up and down by the \"store manager\" and I was told there were no rooms available for me and I couldn't be helped that day. I was fine with that I made an appointment for the next day.\n\nThe next day I came in and the sane lady at the counter looked me up and down once again. Apparently, the mental picture she took the day before wasn't good enough. Long story short, I did not have a pleasant experience. The sales lady was very pushy, made assumptions about my budget (never even bothered to ask what it was), and tried to sell me a size 8 discontinued dress when I'm a size 0\/2. She did tell me that sizing down from an 8 to a 0\/2 would be easy and not mess with the integrity of the dress... \"However we do not make alterations to discontinued dresses here.\"\n\nI was not impressed by their selection or service was so glad to be out of there.
