Had the turducken burger. Burger was moist, duck was great and the egg was cooked well. Could have used a little more sage aioli, but other than that it was solid. Substitued fries for mac n cheese. Worth the dollar up charge. \n\nPros:\nFood was solid\nNot very busy on a Wednesday for dinner\nDecent beer selection\n\nCons:\nBartender said there is only a happy hour on Wednesday.\n\nOverall a solid place for food near the stadiums. Should be fun once the pirates start playing.
