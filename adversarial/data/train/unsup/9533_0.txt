Took me a bit of driving around to find the place, even with two different navigation devices... it's not me, I swear. The place is hard to spot, located next to a bar and some other restaurant, it doesn't even have a legit sign, just a banner. \nNote: it's right across from Cleveland Institute of Art. \n\nAside from all of that, the food was decent. I ordered the following: full order of Tandoori Chicken, Goat Curry, Chili Chicken, Palak Paneer, and 3 Naan. Well, actually, I ended up getting (and paying for) two goat curry dishes, since they screwed up the order somehow even though \"ek\" sounds nothing like \"do\".\n\nThe goat curry was the best out of the meat dishes. Right amount of spice and flavor and the meat fell off the bones, literally, I found them separated in the container. The tandoori chicken had a good taste but was way too dry for my liking, and the extras (typically saut√©ed onions and green peppers) were a jumbled mess inside the container. Also, it had a orangish tint to it which kinda freaked me out since I've never had tandoori chicken that wasn't crimson red. The naan were good, but it's kinda hard to screw up pre-made frozen naan.\n\nNow the chili chicken.... AVOID. Unless you want typical American-Chinese restaurant chunks of fried chicken just smothered in Sriracha sauce and crushed red peppers avoid this $13 plate. Seriously, it looked and tasted like the sesame chicken I order from Chinese restaurants, except a lot more spicy. \n\nOverall I was pleasantly surprised, I'm extremely picky when it comes to Indian food, I've been a bit spoiled with being Indian and all, but I can see myself getting food from here again... and by food I mean goat curry and probably nothing else.\n\nI also want to add that the place is a bit on the expensive side with each dish averaging around $13 (us Indians are known to be cheap), but once again this may have to do with me being spoiled by $3.99 chicken biryani on Devon Ave. in Chicago.\n\n\nBottom line: All rants aside, it's a good place to go get some Indian food as along as you avoid the Chili Chicken.
