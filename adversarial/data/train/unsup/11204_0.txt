A friend recommended this place because of their \"awesome tacos\".  Unfortunately I have to respectfully disagree with my friend on that, because he is wrong.\n\nThe free chips (just average) and salsa were a decent start to the meal.   I ordered three tacos - a soft corn tortilla with shrimp (meh...), a hard shell taco with pork (the worst of the three), and a soft flour tortilla with crispy fish (clearly the shining star of the bunch and the only reason for the second star).  \n\nBut it was Taco Tuesday after all... so I figured I would try a margarita and make the most of my guy time!  Unfortunately, my drink tasted more like margarita-flavored water than an actual margarita.  Ugh...\n\nBeing Taco Tuesday, they were super busy (which I thought was a good sign)... but all it really meant was that I was going to have to wait and wait and wait to place a drink order... and a food order... and to get more chips... and to pay our bill. \n\nI get the appeal of this place with its prime location on Scottsdale Road, open-air setting, and fun atmosphere... but there are too many incredible Mexican restaurants to experience to settle for the ok place in a cool location.\n\n**TWO STARS**
