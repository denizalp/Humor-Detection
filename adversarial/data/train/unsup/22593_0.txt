My husband, two French Bulldogs, and I visited the Palomar for a weekend getaway. Phoenix's proximity to Las Vegas lended itself to be a quick escape, and the Palomar made it a no-brainer with their dog policy. \n\nI had stayed at other Kimptons across the country and knew they are well-known for being a dog\/pet-friendly. They will not nickel and dime you for extra fees like most hotels do for bringing your dogs with you. They have zero breed restrictions, size restrictions, or number restrictions for well-behaved pets to join you on your vacation. I went online and booked a SMOKING deal for three nights. \n\n\nThese are a few of my favorite things.....\n \nAmenities\/Location: The Palmor is centrally located within walking distance to the baseball stadium, the basketball arena, and the convention center - not to mention close to amazing restaurants\/bars, gym (EOS\/OrangeTheory next door). Their pool also looked chic--although it was too cold to take a dip in December for me. They offer a nightly social for evening cocktails (dogs welcomed) and coffee\/tea in the morning in their lovely lobby with plenty of seating to enjoy the atmosphere. The room comes with a yoga mat, umbrella, robes, and welcoming dogs bowls and mat. WiFi was free since I am a Kimpton Rewards member. They even offer complimentary bikes for guests to use during their stay. We did not enjoy them but loved the option for future visits.\n\nStaff: The entire staff was attentive and friendly. They welcomed our dogs and us and made the stay memorable. They always opened the doors with a smile while we were exiting. The front desk staff always waved hello and goodbye. We had no problem requesting extra towels or for a razor with shaving cream (since I forgot mine at home). They take a genuine interest in you and your stay and provide helpful advice on all things local. They went out of their way to send complimentary  chocolate covered strawberries and hand written thank you note for our anniversary.\n\n \nIf you have a choice on where you stay, give Kimpton a chance to wow you. I have zero gripes about our stay. I have been a Hilton Diamond member for the past 8+ years. However, my preference is Kimpton over Hilton at every turn. They will be merging with IHG in early 2018 which is a welcomed opportunity to earn points with both chains on one rewards program (since Kimptons are found only in major cities). I hope they keep their boutique, whimsical, love-of-all-pets, and chicness intact. I cannot wait for my next Kimpton stay!\n\nHot tip: Book your stay via their app and save $$ with their mobile deals!
