The best part about this café is that even though the latte art is obviously incredible and fantastically intricate, the drinks actually TASTE good too!\n\nWe visited on a Saturday morning around 10:30 AM, and it was pretty empty. The baristas were nice enough, and we ordered a Chai Tea Latte and a Hot Chocolate (both with latte art - the baristas ask you what picture you'd like on your drink, and we just asked them to surprise us!). The Hot Chocolate was sweet but tasty, and the Chai Tea Latte was quite good and wasn't overly sweet and overpowering. Overall, quite good and enjoyable.\n\nWhile this is a nice spot for a quick date or meet-up, it isn't the swankiest or prettiest of atmospheres - the décor is quite plain and isn't as bright and inviting as some coffee shops you may be used to working in (i.e. Dineen Coffee, this is not). So personally, while I would definitely come back again for drinks and a coffee hangout, it isn't a spot I'd come back to by myself to work for an extended period of time as it isn't as cozy as I'd personally prefer. Overall, however, this place is definitely worth a visit - the drinks are delicious and the latte art offerings are truly unique and special! \n\nFor two drinks, we paid around $8.00. We also found parking at the residential street directly across the coffee house (although the street allows non-permit parking only at certain times, so check the signs before you park there!).
