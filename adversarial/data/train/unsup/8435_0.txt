You know how they say not to order fish in a steakhouse? Reverse that statement completely at Sushi Roku- despite being named for their traditional fish dishes, they do a damn good job with meats. Order a steak or at least try a meaty app if you visit, you won't be sorry. \n\nGET IT:\nTuna Tartare Phyllo Cups with yuzu guac and soy truffle- beautiful and delicious!\nBrussels Sprout Chips with truffle oil- crispy and addictive.\nMushroom Tempura with Creamy Miso- so savory, great sauce.\nHanabi- spicy tuna on crispy rice. But only if you've never had it. I'm a fan.\nSalmon Sashimi Carpaccio- this was the better sashimi app we tried.\nDiablo Salmon- a daily special roll, served with an incredible honey soy sauce.\nWagyu Sliders- thick and meaty, get more than one because you won't want to share\nGrilled Lamb Chops with Chimmichurri Sauce- two piece app, super juicy!\nPrime Rib Eye Steak \"Japonais\" or Filet Mignon- you can't go wrong with either of these large orders of tender, flavorful meat, sided with garlic green beans and potatoes. \nDIY S'Mores OR Chocolate Lava Cake- I mean, if you have to do dessert, you can either go with a something fun or something reliably good. Don't expect both.\n\nSKIP IT:\nYellowtail diced chilies- It's the same dish you can find anywhere else.\nSeared Salmon Sashimi- the fresh was better\nRoasted Cauliflower- a fail. \nKatana and Shima Rolls- pretty basic, actually.\nAssorted Mochi, Bananas Foster, Pumpkin Spice Bread Pudding- one was unremarkable, one was a little weird, and one was served cold.\n\nPresentation of all dishes was stellar but the service wasn't as attentive as the location and price point led me to expect. Being that it's in Ceasars and specializing in seafood, be prepared to shell out (pun intended!) for your meal. They've got a solid HH available daily from 4PM til 6 or 7, depending on the day.
