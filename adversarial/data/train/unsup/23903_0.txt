If you've been to one Sin City location, you've been to them all. It's not great beer by any means. In Vegas standards it's as craft as you'll get on the strip. Sure everything comes in plastic cups but you'll be hitting the street soon after anyways.\n\nThe prices aren't great but they're decent. They don't charge tax on top of their prices unlike some other brew pubs *ahem* Beer Park *ahem* so it's fair enough.\n\nThey sell Sin City gear and growlers which is pretty amazing considering you're right where all the action is. Sure beats drinking a yard of frozen sugar with a minuscule amount of alcohol while walking the strip.\n\nMost of the locations serve the same few beers which are average or below. This one had an extra tap for seasonal release which just so happened to be a double IPA. Actually it wasn't bad.\n\nTheir Hefe is pretty good and their regular British style IPA ain't too bad, so long as you're not a hop head.\n\nMost of the locations have great service. Especially from the ladies. The guy working here was pretty cool as well. I've never had bad service from a Sin City location, so I'll give 'em that. \n\nVegas not being a craft beer hot spot is an understatement. However, it's nice to be able to grab a decent beer to waltz from casino to casino while trying to beat the heat. There's no better way to do that than with an ice cold beer.
