Ate here Thanksgiving night for the Black Friday sales. The staff was amazing, super friendly and helpful with reccomendations. The lady helping me was so sweet. She asked me if I was Thai. The Thai food here is decent, but not my go to. I had the Pad Ka Pao (spicy basil chicken) made with ground chicken. They have Filipino Adobo as well. Both were decent.
