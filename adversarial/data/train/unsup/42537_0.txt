Came in today (March 18, 2016) for dinner with a reservation (a must!).\n\nOrdered:\n\nPakora chicken;\nChicken wings;\nManchurian chicken; NOT good.\nShrimp fried rice;\nBeef rice noodles;\nWine fish dish;  NOT good.\nFried squid;\nTofu with vegetables;\nCurry vegetables.\n\nEverything else was good.  For Manchurian chicken, Yueh Tung's serves the best Hakka version.\n\nPrices are reasonable.  \nServings are worthwhile.  \nSoftdrinks are at $1.25 ($2 in most restaurants).\nWashrooms are clean.\nTake-out orders are busy too!
