This was my second year attending the Life is Beautiful festival.  The first year I was soo drunk it was difficult to completely enjoy.  I still saw some memorable performances by Stevie Wonder, Major Lazer, Hozier, and my favorite midwest hip hop group Atmosphere.   \n\nThis year was even better. The event was very well organized. Life is Beautiful really makes it easy to spend all day enjoying the music, art, food, and beverages.  The Container Park was our go to chill spot this year as always.  The Zappos experience was also a great place to relax while checking out Kalliope which is a mobile Dj sound and lighting stage.  Zappos provided a cool Hydro dipping experience as well.  \n\nParty favors were abundant every where but there was plenty of security and medical personal around to keep the festival safe and secure.  There was not one moment where I felt that trouble was brewing.  Thank You Life is Beautiful for provide a safe environment for people to share peace, love, unity, and respect.  \n\nYear two also provided great entertainment for me. The Jane's  Addiction performance was one of the best I've seen.  Empire of the Sun and Galantis were also memorable.  The four main sound stages provided a unique sound experience for all tastes of music.  We spent the most time at the Ambassador stage. The Troubadour was mostly EDM which had a terrific lights how that reminded me of my youth spending Saturday nights at dirty warehouse parties in Chicago with lest dirt and sweat andbetter air circulation.   \n\nI did find most food options beyond my price point I was willing to spend. I am sure all the food was delicious though.  This year they added comedy to the daily lineups at The Venue and the other spot on 7th that I forgot the name of.  \n\nOverall a fantastic festival experience and I cannot wait until 2017 LIB.  See you next year peeps.
