Scrumptious. Seriously, it's yummy. The kitchen can get a little backed up, but it is worth the wait. We started with vietnamese ravioli. The tender wontons are stuffed with chicken, shiitake mushrooms, celery and served with a sesame sauce. After devouring those we couldn't wait to dig in to our entrees. I had the drunken noodles. I like spicy and ordered a 6, after the owner warned an 8 was too hot. They don't mess around with spice here. I like that. Flat noodles, tossed with a perfect blend of seasoning, tomatoes and green beans. My husband must try the sweet and sour chicken at every new place we try. This version was a bit lighter than the usual, no thick breading, just chicken stir fried with pineapple, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes and cucumber. I am anxious to return and start eating my way through the menu.
