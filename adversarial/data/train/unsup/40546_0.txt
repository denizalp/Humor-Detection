Great food. We got in late to our hotel from our flight and were looking for a place to eat. Friendly staff and they were more than accommodating to my wife's allergy. Recommended if you're visiting Charlotte. Minor nit - they may want to consider some wall hangings or white noise to dampen the background noise.
