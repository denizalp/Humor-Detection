First, I have to say the service was great. Our waitress and host were both super nice and attentive. I also liked the atmosphere. Outdoor seating is always a plus. \n\nThe food was good but not great. We all liked our food but nothing was worth raving about. I had the stellar chips (tasty - skip the sauce it comes with and use the sweet chili sauce), veggie lettuce wraps (meh), and the Brussels spouts (I'd ask them to skip the sauce or put it on the side next time - flavor was overwhelming). My boyfriend got the steamed pork pot stickers (super good!) and the short rib ramen (I didn't try but he liked it well enough). My friend got two sushi rolls: yellowtail (very good) and lucky summer roll (pretty much a vietnamese spring roll, basil was too much and overpowering).\n\nI would go back again if someone invited me and they were set on this place, but won't be rushing back. While it wasn't a bad meal, there are too many other places in the area I enjoy more.
