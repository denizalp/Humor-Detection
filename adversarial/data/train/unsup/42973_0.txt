I have been many, many times but have never got around to reviewing this place.  I just had the Char Heel and the Whistle Pig and I do not care what is in hot dogs!  If hot dog haters would get their nose out of the sky and try this place they wouldn't care less either.  The dogs are nice and juicy and and the toppings will make sure to shower up afterwards.  When you get the dog, don't put anything else on it other than jalepenos.  I feel that they come the way it is intended to be eaten.  We have always had good experiences here and their rooftop seating is especially nice during this time of the year.
