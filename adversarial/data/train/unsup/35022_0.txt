I have been going here since I was a kid! Consistent quality, and just plain delicious while also being a bit addictive. Their pizza is sicilian style and light as air, which I think is much better than when sicilian pizza is too dense. The outside can be easily mistaken for a garage and I have passed it up by accident. I love it!
