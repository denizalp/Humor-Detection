I've been stalking this place to open for months as I go to and from gym. Rachel's has some very healthy options which were missing in the Trails Center.  Breakfast (all day) salads, pasta (with options to sub whole wheat or quinoa) wraps, sandwiches (gluten free bread offered) burgers, soup, baked goods, kids menu..something for everyone. I'm all about the made to order juice. Popeye's Secret has always been my favorite (apples, spinach, carrots, celery, beets & parsley) you can get wheatgrass: $2 for 1oz or $3 for 2oz. They make great smoothies with a $1 protein powder add in (most contain froyo but I'm sure you can leave that off)\n\nIt is bustling at lunchtime with to go orders, folks on lunch breaks and the obligatory Summahood SUV crowd. What makes it particularly pleasant is the staff who are always cheerful:  particularly Manager Brenda. Owner Kent (sorry I initially called him Eric: my trainer @ 24's name) is usually on hand; was kind enough to support Yelp Sandy fundraiser, asking today how we did (sorry the football game didn't go your way :)\n\nAll my impatience has been rewarded with a super clean place that will please carnivores, kids and vegans at reasonable prices with friendly service. The items \"On the Lighter Side\" including juices have nutritional content (kcal, fat, fiber) so you can make informed choices. I'm already a regular; couldn't be happier to have locally owned Rachel's as part of my rotation of stops.
