This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Hooters is WAY better if you are looking for more bang for your buck. Lets start by saying we got there at 11pm after driving from Idaho. We were going back to san diego and wanted to stay the night in vegas for a break from driving.\n\nWe waited over an hour to check in for our hotel. We had to walk really far through a nasty foul smelling garage to get to our hotel room. First the tv looks like it belonged in 1970. The bed was made but the comment card was filled out from the previous guest in the sheet... so was it changed??\n\nWe are not really too picky but that grossed us out. The door was broken and plastered back together. The bathroom was disgusting and rusty. We decided to get drunk in order to be able to stay there. If we were staying there longer then 7 hours we would have checked out right away. We went to bed around 3 and woke up at 8 and left. We didnt want to use the shower or anything because it was so disgusting.\n\nThis is the worst hotel ever and I wouldn't even stay there for free.
