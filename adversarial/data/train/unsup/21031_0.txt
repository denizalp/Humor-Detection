This place is located in a popular shopping center area with other great quality places. The food was delicious and made fresh. I feel that they really tried when it came to customer service and I appreciate that. The waiter checked on us often. We were seated soon after entering. The part where they lost stars was this older guy who appeared to not speak English well brining items to the table that we did t ask for and we thought were free. There was a huge miss understanding and lack of communication. The guy was cleaning tables, brining food out, and appeared to signal\/talk to guests with his limited communication abilities. He came to our table and brought wine poured it said taste and enjoy then immediately walked away. We were confused asked him was this for us and if this was a gift the nodded smiled and waived his hand. A gift you pay for?! Well it was on the bill. We brought this to the servers attention and he went to get the older gentleman to explain his actions. The server stayed out of it. Well I came here because it's my friends favorite spot and I wasn't going to ruin her last night out in the city, but I don't plan on returning after that. Charlottes growing and has several spots popping up I try something different or new.
