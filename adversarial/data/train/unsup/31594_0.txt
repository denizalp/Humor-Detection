The bartender and kitchen manager were awesome this afternoon for taking great care of my son.  He is undergoing treatment for leukemia at UH Rainbow and has not had much appetite but a steak sounded good to him.  We are anxious to get him to eat anything so this was a good thing. \n\nI was disappointed to find out that the steak was no longer on the menu.  The bartender went to talk to the kitchen manager to see what he could do. The manager came out, introduced himself and said that he would take care of my son.  He went back and prepared a delicious steak and side dish for my son. \n\nWhen he brought the food out, he asked for my son's name so that he could pray for him and then said that he was taking care of the bill for me. \n\nThe kindness, caring, and generosity of the staff was beyond compare.  Thank you!
