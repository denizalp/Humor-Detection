I ordered the spicy salmon roll, and I wasn't crazy about the spicy mayo-based sauce they drizzle on top of it.  I called and let them know this, and they offered to replace my order with a regular salmon roll.  It was delicious.  Excellent customer service and top-notch sushi -- I recommend No. 1 Sushi Sushi very highly.
