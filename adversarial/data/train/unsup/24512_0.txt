I got off my last day at work  with a colorful poster in my hand from my co-workers.. went in to my car and drove here to Motorcars for a routine maintenance check and tire change.. what do I see on my windshield?? a freakin' parking violation ticket from work?!!! irony of my life!! \n\nanyways, i went in and totally forgot that it was cold outside because of the very warm welcome of ms.georgette.:) i was attended quickly and in less than 30mins, I saw my suspended and tireless car at the workshop. Their mechanic patiently explained what has to be done to my car and made honest and sensible suggestions about tire options.:) He also allowed me to take pictures of my \"baby.\" \nI've been coming here for 7yrs now and was always treated well.:) For me, great experience matters and that's what I get at Motorcars on top of their exceptional skills in taking care of my car.:)  \nAlso, nothing beats a warm, freshly baked and FREE cookies that you can get while waiting.:)
