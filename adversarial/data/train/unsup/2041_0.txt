Busy bar area. Feels like the place is built from cardboard though - feels slapdash. I don't get the \"restaurant\/nightclub\" thing; most restaurants don't have speaker stacks or a huge dj booth! Service in the bar was friendly but slow. Our friend had a blended margarita that had a bunch of plastic chips - he pointed this out to the waitress, who said, \"I didn't make it!\" and tossed the plastic chip. No offer to remake, no offer to take it off the check, no concern. Given that, the plain-looking food everyone else was being served, and the el cheapo decor (not to mention the massive dj booth), I think I'll get my Mexican fix elsewhere.\n\nSpecific problems:\n\nThe service needs to speed up. It's friendly enough, but I shouldn't have to wait ten minutes for my credit card to be processed.\n\nThey need to focus on quality. Plastic chips in a drink is 100% unacceptable. Not acknowledging the problem and offering to make it right is abominable.\n\nThe decor shows signs of an identity crisis. This isn't a cantina, and it isn't a nightclub. It's a big white room with a giant DJ booth and speaker stacks. The restaurant looks uncomfortably like its main design goal was to clear out the tables to make room for dancing, and nobody enjoys eating in what seems like a \"temporary\" space. Lighting comes primarily from color-changing LED panels, making the room look even more harsh and uninviting.\n\nThe food simply looks uninteresting.\n\nHow in the world can a \"cantina\" open without having a drink list? Really? You had time to build a DJ booth, move the exterior walls inward five feet, and nobody had a day to sit down and come up with a drink list? Appalling. \n\nFrankly, there's nothing about Lolita's that makes me want to come back. Even if it were just a dedicated nightclub, it looks cheap and uninviting.
