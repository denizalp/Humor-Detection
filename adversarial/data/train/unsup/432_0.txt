30 inches. Of pizza. For 30 dollars. YEET. If you like pizza, why would you not give this place your time of day? The quality of the Larry and Carols' pizza would probably hit a 5-6\/10 if you ask me. It's a satisfying, yummy pie with good distribution of sauce, cheese and crust. So while the pizza is just average, the fact that the menu offers a \"King Kong\" 30 inch pizza option should be enough to satisfy any pizza lover's passion. The King Kong is a great option for game days, campus events or just some 'ol American gluttony.\n\nI never did the King Kong Pizza Challenge in store, but my buddies and I tried to eat one in a hour by ourselves in an, it didn't go well. I've attached the photos for your sadistic entertainment.\n\nAlso, King Kong is a dope movie. 1933 was a weird year and that movie really helped turn things around and establish legitimacy in American sci-fi\/disaster movie making, so thanks for doing cinema some justice, Larry and Carols.
