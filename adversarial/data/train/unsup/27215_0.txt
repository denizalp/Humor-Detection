Seriously such an amazing experience! We were greeted with complimentary mimosas and a breakfast plates. Bottomless mimosas were $20 with lunch and $10 with brunch and they have 5 flavors!!  food was authentic Mexican and the service was amazing! Our serve Luis made the experience even better by always ensuring our glass was full and our questions were answered. Can't wait to come back!!
