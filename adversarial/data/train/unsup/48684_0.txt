This is the original aroma I used to go to all the time so I'm somewhat loyal to the \nLocation but I have to say it's gone downhill since a few years ago. Their \nMenu, like many other Aroma locations has expanded and I like their food a lot but service has gotten a lot worse. More mixed up orders, longer waiting times and the worst are the washrooms. They are half broken, never stocked and the last time I came in, the entire place reeked of feces. It was revolting. I am half considering reporting them just so they're forced to improve. It's unsanitary and disgusting and not fitting for a place with such a good reputation.
