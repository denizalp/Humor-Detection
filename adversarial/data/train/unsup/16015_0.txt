Went here 2 times now. Presentation and quality is good. I had the chicken strips first trip with the fries and habenero sweet sauce. The second round had the California Chicken sandwich with the Blueberry Cole slaw which was good and different. The drink selection is great. My only complaints are the lack of menu items. They really only serve chicken strips on buns or salads or by them self. My second complaint is the terrible name \"PDQ\" I mean that sounds terrible and then to find out it stands for something like people demanding quality or something along those lines. Kind of lame and doesn't help describe the type of  food on the menu. I would suggest changing the name and maybe adding some more variety to the menu as going here often could get quite boring if the menu doesn't expand. But will definitely return when in the mood for chicken.
