***4.5 Stars***\n\nComo En Casa is a hidden gem on Yonge Street just north of Wellesley.  This place has authentic Mexican fare from recipes of the owner's family.  The fish tacos were fabulous, my SO went back for seconds!  The Three Milk Cake is delicious; I could have had a whole cake to myself.\n\nI highly recommend Como En Casa if you are ever in the area.  This is a stand out place with all the food choices in the area.
