I was intriged by the concept of this restaurant, Chinese and Mexican but not fusion only two cuisines sharing the same room but is unavoidable like anything else that you put together for a long period of time it will eventually somehow mix to create some kind of a new twist of the two....enter the Viva China Taco.\n Viva China Taco, beef tendon and Kumamoto oysters is one item that I found that had some kind of asian and mexican mix. I thought it was ok, the tendons are thinly sliced and fried and raw oysters placed on top. Te texture was not what I expected though, soft on the outside, crispy and crunchy on the inside...next!\n Silencio tacos, made with duck tongue, another chinese delicacy that talked its way into the tortilla,  tasty and sweet because of the fresh lychee that tops the taco but nothing too memorable, something I would only eat once in a lifetime and now is done and over with. \nAfter the less than stellar appearances of the viva China and silencio tacos I decided to stick with the tried and true. I ordered the carnitas, baby braised pork topped with chicharrones and a green sauce, also I ordered the Baja style fish taco which ended up being the best of the tacos I tried that night but at 6.50 a taco it was expected, those two bites had better be packed with memories. \nThis may be a chinese and mexican restaurant, two of the most economic cuisines, but being this another creation by the famous Spanish Chef Jose Andres, be prepared to drop a heavy peseta.\nService was awesome, everyone from the hostes to the servers were very attentive and efficient...definitely not chinese service. The room is nicely decorated, very modern, very colorful and fun, not the typical mexican sombrero on the wall...it is more of an Asian theme. \n Next time I'm here I'll try some of their Chinese dishes or maybe I'll try some of the other mexican plates or why not, I might just be in the mood for some CHINACAN and order both.
