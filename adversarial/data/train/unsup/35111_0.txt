The food is exceptional, but its a little pricey. Service is okay. Could be a bit more attentive. I had to get up to get more rice. Other than that they ate very friendly. They make this papaya kimchi, oh its amazing. Im half Korean and never had the papaya kimchi before. I wanted to but some, but they don't sell it on the side. :-( \n\nI'd recommend this place.
