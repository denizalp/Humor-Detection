It's true : Having grown up in California, I love me some In-N-Out!\n\nIt's definitely over hyped, but the food is consistently delicious. They do the best job of lettuce wrapping burgers around, make that animal style with my fries done extra crispy. \n\nThey pay and treat their employees much better than their industry counterparts, which explains the fabulous customer service. \n\nHaha, give me a break, it's almost non existent ... At least at this location recently. \n\nSeeing as this In-N-Out is by my office, it's convenient and I used to come here often when I was a young, dumb fool that thought it was OK to go out for lunch daily. I never remember having problems with my food or the employees. \n\nDropped in here last Sunday to grab a #2 to go: Animal Style, Protein Style, Extra Crispy Fries.\n\nKayla the cashier was beyond rude and made it visibly known that taking my or anyone else's order was a complete inconvenience to her. \n\nI asked twice to make sure she noted Protein Style. Dirty looks and a yes. Practically threw my card and receipt back at me. \n\nWhen I looked at my receipt, I saw it wasn't listed. Kevin calls me up to grab my order, and I asked if this was done Protein Style. He said no but would happily remedy this. \n\nUsually Four stars for the food. Four stars for Kevin, ZERO stars for Kayla. \n\nI don't come here very much, but I will likely stick to the In-N-Out on Chandler and Price from here on out when I decide to indulge.\n\nSorry for the two star rating, In-N-Out, but maybe you should consider removing this superbrat from a customer facing position or not hiring these types all together.
