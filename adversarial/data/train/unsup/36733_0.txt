I had the best time at Dick's Last Resort. We were seated in under 15 minutes on a Saturday evening. Not because the place was empty. As a matter of fact, it was very full. We were seated quickly because of the amount of seating available. Believe me when I tell you, there is a lot of seating. The decor is very flashy. Not in a gaudy way, but in a fun have a good time way. There was a man making the most incredible balloon creations I have ever seen. And he made them each so quickly. They were not all animals so I cannot say he was making balloon animals. They were balloon creations. He made a seahorse and a little puppy, but he also made a little mermaid. I was and still am impressed. Dick's is a theme restaurant. The theme is service with an attitude. Our waiter seemed like he was trying to do his part of being rude. But it did not seem rude so much. He did make sure we were taken care of the entire time we were there.\n\nI ordered a Big A__ Burger with cheese and bacon. The burger was a half pounder, was cooked just right and had a lot of flavor. The bacon was the same. Juicy, not to crisp, and flavorful. The bun was very light and flaky making it a perfect burger. I have to be honest and say that the fries were not the best I have ever had. But, the fries were crisped just right and had a very good flavor to them as well. For not the best they were pretty darned good. My wife had the Steak Sammich. I did not taste it, but she said it was very good.\n\nI am looking forward to going back to Dick's. I can't wait to try the tri-tip, brisket, ribs, pork and other items on the menu.
