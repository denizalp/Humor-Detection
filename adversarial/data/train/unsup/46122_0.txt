I came here with my fam last night and our experience was just okay. There was 5 of us and it cost around $75 bucks for all of us to bowl two games. Kind of pricey considering we had a 4 and 6 year old with us. They don't offer any packages either which is kind of lame.\n\nThe women's bathrooms were disgusting! Three stalls I didn't dare go in and to top it off there was no soap. Gross. \n\nWe also had a group of teenagers next to us that had no bowling etiquette. Obviously, this isn't the bowling alley's fault, but it was super annoying! All 4 of them would stand where you bowl (never in the waiting area), and at least two would go all the way up to the lane each time someone had a turn, and often stand so far over they were blocking our lane. I had to say something twice when my sister could actually not even throw her ball. My 4 and 6 year old nieces behaved better!!\n\nWe decided we were only going to bowl one game so we asked if we could have a refund for the other game we paid for and they said they don't give refunds. So they gave us vouchers for free games, but nothing for the shoes. He said to just mention it when we come back and that they'll waive it. That was kind of frustrating because what if we wanted to go to a different location?? \n\nI personally wasn't a fan of this location and probably wouldn't return. Too much going on that made it more stressful than enjoyable :\/
