Clean, quiet and many outlets for your laptop charger. The desks are big enough for study groups and they only make one single announcement 5 min before they close the library, as opposed to some other libraries where they start distracting you starting half an hour before they close.  Their book and DVD collections are great and the internet is excellent.
