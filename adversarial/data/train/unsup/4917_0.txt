Yes, it's kind of a cesspool, a place that you don't touch the handrails, and a place you'd never stay....it is Circus Circus!!  Back in the day their Steakhouse @ Circus actually had one of the most famed Sunday brunches in the entire valley!  Those days are gone, but what isn't is the place to pop in for a hour to have fun with the kids!  Cali loves to pop in and play the $2 midway games where you're nearly guaranteed to come out a winner!  Your kid will love you for it, and you'll find yourself a kid again if for just a little while!   Just don't touch anything!!
