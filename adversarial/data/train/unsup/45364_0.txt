Their rolls are yummy but it doesn't make up for the fact that:\n\n-They are SO stingy with ingredients, yet charge top dollar. \n\n-You wait forever. Even if you order ahead your order won't be ready. \n\n-Service is meh.\n\n- No coffee stoppers?? So I'm just supposed to let my coffee splash all over my car I guess.
