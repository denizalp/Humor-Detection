I came here in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday, there was only one guy ahead of me, and I still had to wait 20 minutes for a haircut. The prices are a little high for such a basic haircut as mine. I'll go to Great Clips next time, they have better prices and faster service. I'm not looking for a super fancy hair cutting experience. I value speed and price. Super Cuts should be the place to get a fast haircut at a cheap price, but neither of those things were as good as I would have expected.
