Once upon a time in high school, my best friend took me to a concert that was supposed to be a surprise. This involved blindfolding me on public transit and taking me to the Phoenix. I'll forever be grateful to the staff for not laughing while I was beside them (at least not that I could hear) and letting me in without any questions as to what the hell was going on.\n\nThat's one extra star for the Phoenix, which I would rate as a 3 for a concert venue and a 2 for a night out. Every time I've come to a show here, it's been fun. Any time I've come for anything else....ugh.\n\nFirst off, I don't care what anyone says, this area is kind of scary. Just a bit above sketchy, I've seen many a homeless man drinking a bottle of rubbing alcohol and chasing people around. Around the actual Phoenix, there's lots of people around, so it's not as bad, but I still don't feel 100% comfortable in this part of town.\n\nAnd then the actual \"nightclub\" experience. If you're into the whole Richmond Street vibe, which includes waiting in line to get into the venue, playing crappy top 40 music and having weirdos try to grope you on the dance floor, then this is your place. They play \"alternative\" music to appeal to a slightly different crowd, but if you ask me, it's all the same garbage you'll get in the club district. 905-ers crowd the joint, get incomprehensibly wasted and head back to their hotel rooms to barf and \"hook up\" before the long ride back to the GTA in the morning. Not my kinda fun, but if you're into it, the Phoenix on Saturday night is your place to be.
