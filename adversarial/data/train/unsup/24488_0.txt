My Saturday night experience: It took five minutes of us looking forlornly around the cavernous space until we made eye contact with a host. The server was a disaster -- inattentive but bizarrely formal (\"Would madame like a salad with her short ribs\"?). Opie and The Beav, the eager bus boys, were more professional than any of the other floor staff in the joint. The cocktail list was really interesting but I won't be back to try them because it took half an hour to get one. The entrees were just OK. At this price point, I expected much more.
