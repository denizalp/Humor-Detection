We stayed here for one night during our road trip through Canada. I was looking for a cheap hotel just to shower and rest in for a few hours. For one night, this place was perfect. Not sure if I would've been able to stay here longer. \n\nUpon entering the hotel, it's small and cunning in an old-fashioned way. Check-in is pretty quick, the girls at the front desk speak both English & French.  Good luck finding street parking - if not, they use a public garage 2 blocks down for about $15 CAD a night. The rooms are TINY and seem super old, but clean and functional. What threw us off is that the room seemed slanted, I kid you not. I have no idea if we were just delirious because we had a long road trip, but every time we entered the room, we felt totally shifted towards the window. Same thing happened when we were on the bed. Did this happen to anyone else?? Lol. \n\nWe woke up once or twice during the night when people were getting back to their rooms. Walls are thin and space is small so you hear what's going on in the hallway. Didn't hear anyone in their rooms, though, thank goodness. \n\nLoved the location of this hotel. Right smack in the middle of Old Montreal. You will find many food options and things to see near by. We left our car in the garage and walked all over. Also, you can't beat the price. We paid around $50 USD for this room and were not disappointed. Just remember - you get what you pay for. Can't expect 5 star for $50.
