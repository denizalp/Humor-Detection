I wouldn't recommend this company that my home builder used.  My home inspector noticed the garage door was bulged and the builder setup for Lodi to come out to my house and replace some of the panels.  It took them SIX attempts of coming out to finally have the right parts.  They came without any parts, they came with the wrong panels 3 times, they cancelled coming, I could go on.   I called Dan and asked to speak to a supervisor finally who never returned my phone call.  The tech that came out finally was very nice, but it didn't make up for the aggravation of dealing with them.
