I know this is a 2nd review from me but I need to add that after we left Dicks we rushed over to MGM for a show. Once we sat down my niece realized she left her wallet on the table at Dicks. After the show we went back. Luckily, the manager had noticed the wallet and put it aside. Assuming the worst we were happy to recover it with all the contents in tact. It might be called Dicks, we might expect to get treated a certain way but aside from that all of that the staff is stellar!! Especially Stephanie, Barry & James.
