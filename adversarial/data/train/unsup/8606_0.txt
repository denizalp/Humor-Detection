Item's Selected:\nNitro-Cold Brew\nVegan Cheesy Tomato Pocket with Shallots, Garlic and Mushrooms\nVegan Almond Shortbread Cookie with Dark Chocolate and Hazelnuts\nGluten Free Vegan Lavender Twinkie\nVegan Kiwi, Raspberry and Cream Galette\nVegan Raspberry Cinnamon Roll\nTriple Chocolate Rye Cookie\nWhite Chocolate Butterscotch Pecan Scone\nBlood Orange Pound Cake with Toasted Macadamia Nuts\nShe's My Cherry Pie\n\nNow open for over a year and a half, the Roastery and Bake-shop owned by Juanny Romero and Joshua Walter of Sunrise Coffee finally finding its audience by little more than word of mouth and selling out almost every day, Saturday at Mothership Coffee Roasters found both Beth Ryan-Small and Sinead Kravetz present in the recently revamped kitchen where the duo now have more room to work their magic, the front of house buzzing with activity of a predominantly 'hipster' variety.\n\nHaving now done away with hightop bars in favor of more comfortable seating both indoors and on the patio, those wishing to stand still given that option by way of windowside ledges, it was to a short line that patrons were greeted just past ten o'clock this past weekend and with no seats available it was with eyes locked on the pastry case that many waited, a few of the items already gone with replenishment promised shortly. \n\nStill focused on using the best Organic, Fair-Trade Beans and Local Produce available, but taking an additional step by going so far as to make their own Vegan Cheese and Meat-Substitutes in-house, a look at Mothership's current line-up shows the same fifty-fifty split as prior with a focus on those with dietary restrictions, the re-warmed Vegan Pocket virtually indistinguishable from one made with Butter and Dairy products as Chef Kravetz Cheese sauce paired brilliantly with the flavors of Onion, Garlic and Mushrooms that will make most do a double take to be sure they aren't eating a traditional Calzone or Pizza Roll.\n\nFully convinced that Mothership's carbonated Cold Brew is the best of its kind, whether locally or as far away as Portland or New York, those looking for something sweet will be happy to know that the Chocolate Twist remains while almost every other item has continued to evolve, the Shortbread Cookie made with no animal products as good as any Snickerdoodle in town with a quarter of it also dunked in Chocolate while the soft and subtle Rye Chocolate Chip has been bolstered by two more types of morsels to create a Triple Chocolate puddle at the center of a crispy browned rim.\n\nIntrigued by the Lavendar Twinkie, another of Kravetz's ideas that does not overwhelm with florals thanks to the thick Cream and a drizzle of Dark Chocolate, those expecting a dainty cake will find this firm and moist cake a whole lot more fulfilling than that popularized by Hostess, the Pound Cake sold by the register even more dense but given levity by the Citrus with added texture from toasted Macadamia Nuts.\n\nIgnoring the ignorant comments of people who have claimed the Scones are too heavy, the weight of Chef Beth's innovative flavors no different than those at Bouchon when accounting for the doubled size, the current version topped in Pecans with center pocketed in White Chocolate and Butterscotch are nonetheless a dish best shared simply based on the size of the pastry, a similar statement applicable to the Vegan Cinnamon Roll that is virtually indistinguishable from one made with eggy Brioche and Butter, this season's version topped with traditional glaze plus a drizzle of reduced Raspberries.\n\nRounding out the collection with two Pies, one technically a Galette, even a general ennui for Kiwi's was overcome when the cooked fruit was placed in the context of a crisp Crust, Raspberries and a non-dairy cream base that tasted slightly nutty, though a true love for Sour Cherries and lame 80's Music proved even more rewarding in the individually portioned and stuffed-to-bursting She's My Cherry Pie.\n\n***** Located in a corner of the city rarely seen my Tourists, DTLV Denizens or Summerlin Housewives Mothership Coffee Roasters continues to chug away like the little Engine that Could, no Public Relations firm or real Social Media presence to be noted yet still selling based on the quality and creativity of their products almost every day.
