Tiny portions and mediocre food. They are way too expensive for what you get. They charge about as much as Bad Daddy's but it's McDonald's quality. Also not happy with the fact that they don't have kids meals. Not into places where I have to pay $11 for my 4 year old to get a burger, fries and soda. The line was out the door and it was packed. But that's only because it's new and just opened. I don't see it staying that way, not with what they charge anyway.
