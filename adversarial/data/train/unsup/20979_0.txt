Parched after the Exodus concert at The Rex Theater, I discovered a CoGo's as I wearily marched towards the Station Square trolley stop late one evening. \n\nAglow in the hazy evening, its exterior was the color of a baseball that had seen many games, and the interiors were all the dingier.\n\n$1.69 (!) was required to quench my raging thirst with a fountain soft drink, and there were no lids to match the size of the cup, so I had to dump it all out and get a smaller receptacle.\n\nMinding the cash register was a elderly woman who had no business working at her advanced age, let alone at a convenience store well after dark in an area known for street crime.
