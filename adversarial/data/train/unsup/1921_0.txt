An Irish pub?  Maybe if it were at the Dublin Hyatt Hotel, but this place was a little too pretentious for Dublin or Champaign.  Lighten it up a little bit, maybe some more casual decor to offset the strikingly attractive architecture.  They did a great job making the interior beautiful, then they foul it up with two big flat-screen TVs.  What is this place?  An Irish pub with the football game on the TV or an upscale country-club cafe?\nThey clearly hired all redheaded young women as waitstaff.  \nThe food was delicious.  But over-priced for the tiny portions.\nWe went for lunch on a Saturday in October, 2011. Fisherman's stew was delightfully flavored, but two miniature shrimp, two mussels, two morsels of fish, and four croutons at $9.95.  My date and I split two entrees for lunch.  Our other choice was Fish & Chips at $9.95. Also well-prepared but about as much fish as one would get with a McDonald's fish sandwich.\nThe topper was an iced tea for $2.50.\nSo I was paying downtown Chicago prices for downtown Champaign, and I left hungry, wishing we had gotten fish at Legends or a burger at Farren's.  With a tip and no alcohol, one iced tea, two lunch entrees, we were out of there, hungry, for $30 on a Saturday at noon.
