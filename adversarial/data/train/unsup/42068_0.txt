Came here on the weekend with some pals to bowl and let me say this much: why aren't we bowling more often? Was told when we arrived that this bowling lane would be closing sometime in 2018 and I was sufficiently bummed out. \n\nOK, back to my experience! This is one of the larger Bowlerama's that I have been to. We got to experience the Cosmic Bowl, which was great. Only downside? They had strobe lights which isn't great for someone who has epilepsy (like me). I wish that would have been a consideration. \n\nOtherwise, the staff was super friendly and the lanes well maintained. We shared some food, had some beers and scored a couple gutter balls. It was a bunch of laughs. 10\/10, would come again.
