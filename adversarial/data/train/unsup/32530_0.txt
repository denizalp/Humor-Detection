It's hard to find authentic Filipino cuisine in Toronto; but finally, I was able to get an opportunity to try this amazing restaurant.\n\nI went to try their Kamayan Sunday dinners, which is basically a hand to mouth meal, where cutlery is not required. There were bamboo leaves laid across the table, and two chefs masterfully laid out each component of our price fixed menu ($40 per person) onto the leaves. There was a huge variety of different tapa styled dishes, that were absolutely to die for. The sauces, the rice, every single item was made to perfection. I literally cleaned the food off the table\/leaves! The flavors were out of this world, and I can't wait to go back again!
