Beautiful, delicious, and comfortable--I always feel cozy and sated here.\n\nEnvironment -- casual & friendly. Place orders up front and seat yourself. The space is carefully decorated without being fussy, with fresh and dried flower arrangements accenting simple wood furniture. The lights are often dimmed in the late evening, which can read as romantic or homey, depending on your company.\n\nFood & drink -- pirogi are a favorite. I've tried several things on their ever-changing menu, and nothing has disappointed. The cocktails are always a pleasant surprise. I will say, though, I once ordered a whiskey sour without thinking about the egg involved, which makes it off-limits at a vegan bar (they were very kind to make an effort to substitute something, though).
