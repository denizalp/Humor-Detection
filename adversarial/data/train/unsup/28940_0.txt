Missing a home cooked meal?Try this place out here located in Henderson. If you are craving authentic Peruvian food that is mom and pop atmosphere, you can check this place out. \n\nMenu has a lot to choose from. Most of the prices on the menu can range from $9-23 depending if it is meat or seafood. If you have not tried Peruvian food before, I would suggest Lomo Saltado (beef, onions, tomatoes, and french fries w\/side of white rice) for your entree or the rotesseri chicken (you can choose from 2 pcs ($9) or the 4 pcs ($14) depending on how hungry you are). The chicken comes w\/a huge plate of fries. This will give your mouth a little taste of what Peruvian food has to offer.\n\nWhat we ordered: fiance had the 4 pcs of rotesseri chicken w\/fries. As for me, I ordered the Arroz Con Mariscos  (rice with seafood (scallops, mussels, shrimps, and octopus and veggies (peas and carrots)). We also received complimentary salad for the both of us to share.\n\nThe food was phenomenal. Rotesseri chicken came out juicy, evenly seasoned and not dry. I was in awe just with one bite. Use the special green sauce that adds a little spice to add the wow factor. Fries of plate, I hope you love them! They give you a whole plate . The arroz con Mariscos, was bomb. It had moistness, fresh, and the seafood still had the proper balance and taste. To drink try their traditional corn drink or passion fruit. This will add sweetness to your meal. Want to go all out, the also serve wine direct from Peru or beer. \n\nAll in all, we came out with happy tummys and satisfied. Will definitely come back to taste other platters on the menu.
