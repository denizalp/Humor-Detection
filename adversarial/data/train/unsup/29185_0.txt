One of the best taco places in Vegas hands down. Their food is authentic and the employees are always friendly and enthusiastic. Typically I go to tacos el gordo but it's so far away from me, and it's always crowded no matter what time I go. When I heard about this I was so excited. And I was not disappointed at all. They even have elote!! Everything here is so bomb and fresh, and the ambience and set up is so up beat I love it.
