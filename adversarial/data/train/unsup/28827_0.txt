I really recommend this place for locals and non-locals. The atmosphere is very casual and and the service very friendly. \n\nWhen they forgot to tell me that they were out of one of the blackboard specials, the strawberry crepes, I ordered my usual eggs benedict. When my order came, the manager came over and told us that it was on the house  because of the long wait. I really appreciated it because I wasn't really expecting it. \n\nWill keep coming back!
