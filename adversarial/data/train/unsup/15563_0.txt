I've been a proud member of Navy Federal Credit Union for over ten years now. I already had a number of bank accounts, but my brother encouraged me to open an account. (He was enlisted at the time.)\n\nAt the time I lived in San Diego so it made more sense to have a local account. Living here in Phoenix I have less of a need to visit my branch. But when I do, I positively *love* it!\n\nNicest people ever!\n\nPlus they always have cookies. And lemonade! \n\nNavy Federal (overall) is wonderful. Any branch I've ever walked into has been the same. You really can't go wrong with banking with Navy Fed. \n\nI ring Navy Federal, they pick up the phone. (Within minutes.)\nNo matter whom I speak to, any issue I've had has been resolved.\nPronto.\n\nGreat online user experience.\nSame with smartphone.\n\nAmazing customer service.\nThe exact opposite of dealing with the global banks I've previously been associated with.\n\nI [heart] Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\nThat is all.
