I was surprised at how bad the pizza was. I've seen yelp give good reviews to pizza places before that I wasn't wild about but those places weren't bad they just weren't great. This one is an exception. I went in for 2 slices. The first being a white sauce slice...now I'm not exaggerating, I literally had to smell my shirt and arm to make sure I wasn't losing my sense of smell. I couldn't really taste anything I mean it had sliced tomatoes on it and I couldn't real even taste them. It was mega bland, like a white rice and unflavored chicken kinda bland. But I was like well maybe white sauce just isn't their thing.\n\nSo I bite my pepperoni slice and I'm like ah I didn't lose my sense of smell. The second slice was like flavor country after such a bland slice. But then I was like man this is kinda dry, the cheese also does not have much flavor, pepperonis are kinda meh. Does this even have pizza sauce? \n\nI went to this place starving it should have been great, even with a heightened sense of smell and taste it was bland and dry. I don't even want to imagine what it's like in a semi fed state. \n\nLittle Cesar's is average to me. This isn't even as good as that. Why spend 5 bucks on this when I can get a whole pizza for the same price that actually tastes better? Can't speak for the rest of the menu but the pizza is really sub par. Can't understand the high marks it has. Maybe it's better as a fresh whole pizza? Maybe?
