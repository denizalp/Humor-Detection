When my son called them at 11ish in the morning before he went in for shingles, they told him to wait until 1:00 so they could go to lunch. When he arrived Anna  said that they really aren't an urgent care place but they understood why he would think they were because it says urgent care on the sign, in the name and online.  Supposedly, according to Anna they are more of an internal medicine place and that they wouldn't bill insurance even if paid all up front. They gave him a list of the real Urgent care places and sent him away. The one he drove to on the list, Boulder Quick Care, appeares to be permanently closed. Son is now driving, sick as a dog, to another place. Don't waste your time here or on their website.  Hours and services are misrepresnted.
