Came here with my boyfriend to get some new hiking shoes. When you're looking for something specific like this, the employees are very helpful. The man that helped us with the shoes had great suggestions and was genuinely trying to find us the best shoes for the best price. Sometimes if you're just shopping during a sale, they can be annoying. They like to constantly ask you if you need help and if you're like me, just looking around, it can get annoying to be asked that all the time.\n\nThe best day to come is on Black Friday where they give away free socks with every $5 purchase. Don't forget to check the back room for the best deals!\n\nAlso, don't come here expecting actual military surplus. They have very little of this kind of stuff.....think of them more like an outdoor supplies store. They charge extra for bags so don't forget to bring your own!
