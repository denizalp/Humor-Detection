I was here once.  I was lured with the promise of free beer for a hosted party sponsored by Dos Equis.  Indeed. There was free beer to be had.  It was in \"the jungle room\".  There was a cute waitress in a pith helmet who smiled at me and locked eyes with me in a way that says, \"I'm so sorry the room I'm waiting in smells like the vomitorium.  Please tip me I'm cute and I obviously need the money. Did you see my stupid hat?\"  Since the beer was free, I made sure to take care of her as best I could.  That's a hell of a way to make a living.  Because they are clever like that - they were spinning Jungle in the Jungle room.  Was it good Jungle? I don't know but I don't think so.  Being a fan of most types of electronic music I would like to think I'd know good jungle when I heard it but I'm no afficionado.  We went downstairs where the music was a little more R & B contemporary.  Which is to say, not to my taste.  They did however have gogo dancers who had obviously wrapped their feet in animal skins to fend off the biting cruel cold of  Phoenix in the summer.  In stark contrast to this, they were wearing lingerie and nothing else over the rest of their bodies, proving that the furs were doing an exceptional job in keeping them warm.\n\nThe best thing I can say about this place is  that I didn't have to pay for my drinks the one time I went, and I got to see a woman attempt to dance in five foot stilts.\n\nWoo.
