Hi Frank and Joey,\n\nI just wanted to say thank you for the party bus rental.  The bus was AWESOME!!!  I have never seen a bus jazzed up like that it was way more than I expected.  Our group had a blast and your driver was absolutely hilarious.  He had us all in stiches and he is a keeper!  Thanks again guys I hope you end up reading this as I really did have a wonderful time.  Take care and thanks again!
