Liberty Bell Arch is about a 5-6 mile hike and the route is largely marked by cairns. It took my husband and I 4 hours to complete as first-timers. I utilized Norm. K.'s review in addition to the write-ups on hikinglasvegas.com and birdandhike.com to navigate the hike. \n\nThe beginning of the hike was a bit discouraging - there is a complete lack of markers and cairns are extremely sparse. After maybe 3\/4 of a mile in, the trails become more visible and cairns start sprouting up like seedlings during spring. Once you get about a mile in, you start coming across the focal points of the hike. \n\nFirst up is the old ore car and the abandoned mine. We explored the mine, although it's quite small. Still neat to check out though. Then you come across the hike's namesake, the Liberty Bell Arch. Last but not least is a view of the Colorado river. We took our snack break here taking in the views.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this hike for beginners. I'd also only undertake this hike in the winter or spring since there's no shade provided. Overall though, this hike was an adventure!\n\nYELP'S 2018 REVIEW CHALLENGE: #5
