Oscar turned it around for us! We came in from our flight late, had a rough time maneuvering around the airport, & was being quoted high prices everywhere in Vegas, i.e., hotel, car rental, etc. Oscar was friendly & down to earth. We didn't feel a salesperson was trying to scam us. Now we feel our vacation at Vegas can actually begin w\/ a fresh new start! I wish more customer service specialists can be like Oscar & car rental places like \"Advantage Rent A Car!\" (All their staff were friendly too!)
