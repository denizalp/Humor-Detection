When it comes to dining out, great food, price, and atmosphere is what you hope to get. Well, you'll get that at Omoide. \n\nThe last time I visited Omoide Noodles was in July. They were a relatively new spot on the block. the biggest gripe I had at that time was that there was not enough noodles in the soups. Well, they fixed that! \n\nI had the Pumpkin Croquette as an appetizer again and it was just as I remembered. It is a crunchy tempera style pumpkin cake with a dipping sauce.\n\nThen I had the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen with egg and he had the Miso Tonkotsu Ramen. Trust me the Spicy Tonkotsu tastes much better than it sounds. They have a spicy version and a regular Miso Tonkotsu for those that don't want to drink a lot of water with their soup. I've heard other's say it isn't spicy - well then they must have also changed that. It was spicy this time around.\n\nIt was a pleasant experience. I am always happy when I return to find things have improved. They have increased in a star - 4 stars now!
