My child and I walked into the salon . The lady up front was nice and the stylist who was asked to do my childs hair was not available untill 3 pm.\n\nThat is when in went down hill.\n\nYou see my child is a 13 year old transgener . They wanted a boy hair cut and when we stated that , the stylist looked at us and loudly gasp and said..\n\nWHY .. And when I stated again .. Because that is what they want. ... again . loudly .. WHY .. \n\nWith the attitude of digust and disbelief.\n\nSo after looking at photos online I was irritated , we left and  went to another salon and had a great experience.
