I think Red Rock Lanes is the nicest local bowling spot! It's very clean and even kind of trendy looking haha I feel like they have less lanes than the South Point bowling alley but they also have a \"VIP\" area where you can host private bowling parties! There are plenty of flat screens and plenty of seats for your cheerleaders to cheer you on from and they are located right by the parking garage (park in the garage by the far right elevator) so you don't have to walk through the casino to get there! They have lots of rules but they are not strictly enforced so that's nice! Like most bowling alleys they have an arcade, bowling shop & snack bar (we didn't sample any food) & a fun bar area! I really liked their bar area because they had pool tables, shuffle boards, dart boards and video poker. They also have 2 sets of restrooms on each end of the bowling alley so you don't have to walk too far. The cashiers and all of the staff were friendly for the most part...\n\nI would give RRL 4 stars but I feel the bartender, Steve, just really wasn't that nice. There were about 15+ of us so maybe he was overwhelmed since he was working alone but it just seemed like he was trying to upsell on everything.. I asked him if there were any drink specials and he said no so I mentioned the big poster up front with the \"After Dark\" specials and he was just like \"ohhh you mean those...\" So my friend ordered a $2 domestic draft special and he tried to talk her out of it saying it's too small... I tried ordering a $3 cranberry vodka and he said that it was going to be very weak.. WTF why have the damn specials if you're going to be a beyotchhhh about them!?!?!?! HAHA So I ended up getting a $9 cranberry vodka instead which really wasn't even that strong! Pitchers of Bud light are decently priced at $9. Any who... the bartenders at South Point bowling alley are way friendlier and make the drinks much stronger!   \n\n\n\nHOT TIP:\n\nAfter Dark Specials (Sun-Thurs:) $1.50 games; $2 domestic drafts; $3 well drinks!!!\nCosmic bowling: Fridays 6pm - 2am $4.95 & Saturdays 6pm - 2am $4.95\n\nOpen 7 days a week.\nMonday - Thursday: 8am - 2am\nFriday: 8am - (no closure)\nSaturday: 24 hours - (no closure) \nSunday: 24 hours - 2am (Monday)
