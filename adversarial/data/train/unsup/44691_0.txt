The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice. I love the decor. I have to say the food was exceptional but the service wasn't as great. My boyfriend and I got a bunch of appetizers. Dumplings, shrimp dumplings. We also got the rice roll with pork and the specialty soup dumplings that is VERY VERY good. I would recommend this place to anyone. I just hope the service is better next time!
