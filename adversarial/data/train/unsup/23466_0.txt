Absolutely NOT! This Doctor wasted my time! I went in for a consultation and asked for the tip of my nose to be \"slimmer\" since there is a slight bubble, and he suggested that he inject my under eye lids with fat to \"make me look like a Kardashian\" were his words. \n\nHe asked for my medical records, a month later, now his receptionist tells me, \"we can refer you to someone else, we cant meet your expectation\" OF WHAT? Me, wanting my nose slimmer? OR HIS expectation of trying to make me look like a Kardashian... NO THANK YOU!\nThis guy is a Joke...
