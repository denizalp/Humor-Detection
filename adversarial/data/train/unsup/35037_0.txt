This restaurant may not look much but it is TOP NOTCH!! The food is so delicious and fresh. And the portions are enormous with very reasonable (cheap) prices. The service is perfect - very very speedy and the women are so sweet and the best part is they remember you every time you come in. They remember what you like to eat and many other little details. I feel like a VIP every time I go in. I highly recommend this restaurant. The menu has something for everyone.
