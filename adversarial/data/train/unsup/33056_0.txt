Excellent food and groceries, but this is a very poorly managed establishment. The employees literally look like they are moving in slow motion. There is zero organization in the deli, and customers walk around aimlessly since there are no clear signs indicating where to go. I come here about once a week, and it's the same story everytime. Plan to spend over twenty minutes just to pick up some deli items. The problems could be drastically improved with simple signs, but they are popular and management probably just doesn't care. The quality of the food will keep bringing people back until another deli\/restaurant opens next door.
