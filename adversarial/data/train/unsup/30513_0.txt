The All-American Bar & Grille (AAB&G) is located inside the RIO Hotel & Casino. There are two distinct areas of the AAB&G. The front half is a bar area with seating & TVs to catch the sports events, and a dining area in the back. The food is good and so is the service. As the name implies, it is \"American Pub fare\" with a selection of salads mixed in too. This is a great place to have a hamburger & beer after a round of golf or a day at the pool. It is also a good place to go for BBQ, steak, or prime rib too. We have eaten there since the Rio opened in 1991. \n\nOver the years, the menu has expanded to include many more varieties of beer, appetizers, and entrees. There is something for everyone on their menu. The only unfortunate part is that the prices have really increased. No way, no how, a cheese burger & fries should be over $10, and I don't care how good it is. A domestic bottle beer is now $5, and really should be closer to $3. Bar management should realize that the more reasonable drink prices are, the more beverages their patrons will consume. Of course, I'm not the one paying their rent, but the prices that they are charging today no longer qualify it as a good value. That is the only shortcoming that I can see with AAB&G. Aside from that, AAB&G is a good place to eat.
