I was comped here for a weekend and made full usage bringing the boys with me.  Saw some fights, lost some money but all in all a great time as always on the strip.  \n\nThere's nothing I can add to these reviews really, high end facilities and located north center of the strip.  \n\nIt's one off my bucket list to stay and play a round here as well.  We had a suite over looking wynn's 18 holes and I dreamt of the day where I could afford to play a round and stay at the wynn on a single trip.  Now that would make me feel all grown up.  Great hotel.
