I came to Jared's around 12 pm on a Sunday afternoon and I just wanted a nice burger and tater tots but something happened that I will never forget. A woman was robbed right in front of our table. The robber had a knife and ran off with her purse. We started running after him, but the real hero was an employee from Jared's. He ran after the burglar and caught him hiding. He ended up getting the purse back and saved that woman's day. \n\nAnyway, food was delicious. You get a good selection of toppings for free on your burger and fries\/tots. Service was excellent.
