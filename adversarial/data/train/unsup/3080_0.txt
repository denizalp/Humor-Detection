so... for express.. it's very slow.  we aren't rude at all and realized that there were not enough waitresses to accommodate everyone in express mode, so we chilled and chit chatted.  the decor is nice... very clean, but it is still very new.  it's very small, but I always find the smallest places serve the best food! \n\nwe walk in and they were friendly.  \nsmall as it was, the waitress took awhile to even give us water.  [i guess im just used to someone giving us water right when we come in at other joints.]\n\nso I turn around to try and wave one of the two waitresses down to let them know we're ready after about 10 minutes... and she comes to our table to let us know that it will only be a few more minutes.  she apologizes.  \n\n1st timers so we're forgiving.. \n\nwe finally order & the food came out quickly.  but!  they forgot my husbands soup.  so again, another 10 minutes go by & my husband finally gets a hold of the waitress & she apologizes again & grabs his soup. \n\nmy order: seafood noodle: MORE seafood please!  a little skimp with the fillers but there is plenty of broth & noodles.  the broth is really good though!  but it needs more shrimp, squid... maybe some fish?\n \nkids: shrimp, bbq, & shredded pork plate & beef noodle soup... both of which the kids said were very good.\n\nthe food is really good.. service on the other hand... is questionable.  we only got 1 serving of water & when we asked for our check she finally realizes that we didn't have water... another apology.\n\nmaybe another waitress? idk... but all in all the food is very good!
