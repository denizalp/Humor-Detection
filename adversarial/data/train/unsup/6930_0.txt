You have got to try the Fire Roasted Fresh Artichokes, even if you don't like artichokes.  I love getting to the heart, especially since it has an amazing smokey flavor.\n\nAnother amazing winner is their Avocado Eggrolls.  Every single person I have taken here is in love with this appetizer.\n\nMy family adores almost every entree we have tried here, sans the Cuban Sandwich.\n\nNow to my most recent problem with them.  My wife and I took our daughter here for her 18th birthday dinner (at her request).  My wife told them in advance we were here for an 18th b-day, and then reminded the hostess upon our arrival.  At no point during our stay, did anyone come out to bestow birthday wishes to my daughter, although we did witness their singers at two other tables.\n\nGreat food, hit & miss service, and sometimes no birthday wishes... :(
