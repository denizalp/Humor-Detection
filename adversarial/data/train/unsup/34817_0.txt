This is an adorable candy shop.  There is a lot going on here-a bakery area with cookies and gelato,  alcohol slushy bar, cheeky gifts, t-shirts, and of course, candy everywhere!  This is a cool place to look around in, but the prices are outrageous.  I think it was $16 or $18 for a small box you filled up with choice of candies.  I did think it was cool that all the staff were promoting their lip tattoos by all wearing the pink leopard print that day.  I figured instead of paying $12, I would just go home and buy online for $3.  \n\nAsk for their free text club membership to immediately get 15% off your total order!
