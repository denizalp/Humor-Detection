I came into Noir last year when one of the apprentices needed people to practice on. Free lashes and getting to try out something I've wanted to do for a long time? Win-win!\n\nSo when I decided to get lash extensions before my trip to Mexico, I didn't hesitate to book an appointment at Noir. \n\nI arrived about 10 mins before my appointment, was greeted warmly and sat on the couch to wait for my lash tech to finish up with the client before me. The decor here is nice, black and white with pops of color and lounge couches for you to lay on during the lash application.\n\nI was shown the different lengths of lashes and once I settled on one, the process of taping my lower lashes began. This part can be kinda scary, there's tape really close to your eyeball - I kept thinking about that one clip on Jackass when they were giving themselves paper cuts on their eyeballs AHHHHH! \n\nObviously your eyes are closed for the entire appointment, I tried chatting up my tech but she wasn't very talkative so I did the next best thing - took a nap.\n\nI was done in about an hour, my lashes looked great and honestly $75 to not worry about doing your make up on vacation is worth it! \n\nUpkeep is a little tricky, I'm a side sleeper so my lashes did shed a bit quicker on one side than the other (they recommend not doing anything to smush your lashes into your face or using oil based make up) and as your lashes grow out they will snag a bit on Q-tips and cotton pads.\n\nI just let my grow\/fall out on their own, but they do offer free removals of their lashes if you decide not to get refills or a new set.\n\nSince eyelash extensions are such a hot commodity now, there's a lot of places claiming to have \"certified eyelash techs\", but I've seen some girls with questionable extensions (globs of glue and lashes stuck in clumps). So be careful, do your research and go to Noir! - it's your EYES we're talking about here!
