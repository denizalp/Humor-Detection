Even though we came a early in the year before everything was in bloom, this is still a beautiful garden where you can get away to relax. Unfortunately, it looks like the peace and tranquility won't last much longer as the garden is already bordered by public park area on one side and a 20-story high rise condo building under construction on the other side which is already affecting the backdrop of photos.\n\nAt the center of the 3.5 acre garden is the Koi pond where you can buy food for $1 to feed the frenzied fish. The footbridge, tea house, and 12-foot waterfall also provide good photo ops. Many events held at the garden including the Garden Gate Run in November. Or you can hold your own event as the facilities are available for rental.\n\nAdmission is $5 for adults and $4 for students\/military\/seniors. Parking is readily available in the lot right outside the garden. Stop by now, while you can still enjoy the peaceful setting because soon you'll have condo residents peering in on you as you attempt to meditate.
