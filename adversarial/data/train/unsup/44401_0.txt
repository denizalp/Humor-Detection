Whoever said this rivals New York pizza must not have any taste buds! I'm actually from NYC and this place is worse than any place I've ever been to in New York. I went to this place when I was visiting Montreal with friends and this place was down the block. I got 2 slices (one bacon and the other chicken). I ate the bacon one and was not able to finish it. It made me sick. If this is good for Montreal pizza then I would suggest not to eat pizza in Montreal or at least don't compare it to New York. Go to Montreal for the poutine not the pizza.
