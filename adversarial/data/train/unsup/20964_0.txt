I went to tour this place today and it was just alright. Way overpriced and the lady who gave us he tour did not speak proper English and was dressed for a night at the club. I would recommend at least updating the appliances if you're gonna charge that much, other places for the same price are bigger in the area with updates full size appliances. Not to mention I almost fell down the stairs because the step was so narrow compared to the rest of them.
