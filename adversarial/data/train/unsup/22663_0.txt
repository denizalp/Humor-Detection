There are some dishes that are meant to be share, as sharing is caring?! or just some of the dishes are suppose to serve 2 and up?\n\nApkujung Restaurant's Chicken Ginseng Soup with Noodle & Congee ($23\/2 people servings) would be a dish that I would love to share with my friend or vice versa.\n\nBTW, Ginseng Chicken Soup traditional are supposed to be consumed on the hottest day of summer.. for me anytime is a good time! \n\nWatching the food heating up from in front of you while munching on banchen, hot pot style. Then when the chicken is ready, the waitress would come and cut it up and serve that to you..... then you wait again for the noodle to be cooked...and she came back and serve you again.... then you wait for the congee to be cook, and now you have this congee that has all the nutrients from the chicken and ginseng that suppose to be really good for you?!\n\nHealthy, Tasty and Wholesome! That's how I felt after having my meal. And drinking the yogurt drink after as dessert did help with digestion.\n\nThe question now is when am I coming back to have that again? I need support, I could not do this alone..............
