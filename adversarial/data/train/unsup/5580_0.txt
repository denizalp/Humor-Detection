The dinner-and-a-concert thing was getting unreal last year, but this would be our final outing of 2013. To top off our season of live experiences, we had one more Stage AE show to catch as well as stomachs to satiate beforehand according to protocol. I kept forgetting about a certain North Shore food-and-drink destination named Soho, so with them in mind, Kay, a mutual friend, and myself strolled on over after parking the car to see how they measured up. \n\nThe interiors invoke a noirish urban landscape not unlike Bruce Timm's vision of Batman's Gotham City or the city of Chester Gould's Dick Tracy with a sparsely detailed skyline acting as the focus of the dining room.  Swankiness be damned, our gracious and gifted server Jess treated us like Rat Packers despite our denim-and-band-shirt attire, serving us above average food with agility, style, and congeniality. \n\nTo kick off the meal, our power trio shared a serving of Soho's Thai Shrimp. On a bed of greens and lemon wedges came an octet of plump, reddened sweet\/sour prawns that dazzled our palate with their Asiatic\/Oceanic blend of sugar, sting, and brine. \n\nOffering the proverbial \"a little of everything,\" Soho also crafts a fabulous Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It was a must, and in lust I fell, deeply...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FnI36r9sdG4\n\nA puffy, doughy, floury, artisan-proud, stone-baked crust held moist cubes of chicken breast, a typically tart tabasco sauce, and a a gloriously glutinous blend of mozzarella and provolone. At 12 inches around, this was a magic carpet ride to pizza pie paradise. \n\nThe Caramel Turtle Bundt Cake was almost akin to a chocolate sticky bun with its adhesive, candied walnuts. A scoop of vanilla cream soothed the heat and richness of this igneous breakfast treat turned dark and inverted, lacerations of caramel amplifying the sweetness with slightly sinister salty bent. \n\nSoho: Far from So-So.
