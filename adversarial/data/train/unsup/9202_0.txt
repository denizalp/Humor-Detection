Fremont Street Experience....there is a lot to see.  Walk into the surrounding hotels and casinos like the Golden Nugget, Four Queens, Binions, Mermaids and the D Hotel (the former Fitzgerald). There's the souvenir shops, ABC store, outside bars, kiosk booths selling bags or dolls, as well as the photo booth where the females can take a picture with couple Chippendales for free.\n\nFremont Street is covered with a large canopy and there is nightly showings of the LED lights.  Walking along the street at night you may find different characters like Dora the Explorer, Spongebob Square pants, a minion, as well Darth Vader.  There are street performers like the Latino man with his guitar, the gold man who sings, the drummer with short arms, the flexible man who manages to fit himself in a small box, or the other flexible guy who can roll along the street by bending backwards.  There's going to be an OMG moment when you spot two or three females topless.\n\nHeading eastward on Fremont Street you will come across more restaurants and souvenir shops as well as the Harley Davidson store.  There's the Walgreens store right across of Denny's restaurant.  The adventurous individuals will want to try the Slotzilla zip line.  A ride that will take you from the front of Neonopolis center to Fremont Hotel or beyond.\n\nIf you have an upcoming Vegas trip then enjoy the Fremont Street Experience.
