I love The Sweet Tooth Fairy! I've been to this location twice and both times I had excellent customer service and the yummiest treat! First I had the original sugar cookie which was very good. Not too much frosting which is how I like it! Then today is my BIRTHDAY and since I had signed up to receive the emails, I got a free cupcake!! I chose cookie dough and it was to die for! Will definitely return for another!
