After 2 voicemails, an email and a quote request, I haven't heard back from them at all. Multiple phone calls were made with no answer. \n\nI was going to leave this be, but a company not returning your calls or emails or responding to their quote tool online is simply bad business. \n\nI ended up renting a cargo van and picking up the furniture myself.
