Pssst . . .  This is a top notch restaurant, and you can actually dine here without breaking the bank (relatively speaking) if you do a bit of homework.  I'll even give you the Cliff Notes.\n\nIf you go to the restaurant bar (the Bubble Bar), they have a special menu with 10-12 items.  You can order them in \"little bites\" for $10 each, or \"big bites.\"  The little bites are tasting menu portions - the big bites are full size portions.  The best part (among many)?  Many of the bar menu items are the same things found on the regular menu, but at a fraction of the price (even the big bites)! \n\nPut it this way - I had the whole bar to myself (it's not that big - FYI - I went on a Wed., so can't say if it crowds up at other times).  I had three little bites (oysters, lobster avocado salad, truffle-artichoke soup), one big bite (Turbotin), and a half order dessert and a glass of wine -- the whole thing cost $100 (not cheap, mind you, but a heck of a lot more manageable than the hundreds of dollars other folks drop there).  They also threw in 2 amuses, plus their awesome assortment of fresh bread.\n\nOh, right - the food and service -- both outstanding.  I'm hard pressed to think of a better place in Vegas, and certainly not for the price I paid.\n\nIf I ever have a chance to go back, I'll probably design my own tasting menu in the bar - how does a 9-course tasting menu for $90 sound?  Just don't tell 'em it was me who let the secret out . . .
