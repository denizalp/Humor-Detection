No clue why people like this place so much. \nMy eggs, bacon and pancakes looked like they should have been part of a child's kitchen play set and tasted like plastic to match. \nService was bellow average. There were 3 severs for the place which you would think would be enough for maybe a total of 20 people (12 of which were a group of police officers). \nDrive right by this place and go have the cheep breakfast at Ikea - I'm positive it will taste better.
