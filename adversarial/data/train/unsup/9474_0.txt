Planeta Mexico serves authentic Mexican food.  We ordered the taco and burrito platter for two ($20) which came with 4 tacos and 1 burrito.  We got to choose 2 flavours for taco and 1 flavour for burrito.  The chicken tacos were better than the fish tacos, which were a bit dry.  The beef burrito was standard but it could be bigger for sure.  The beans, salsa and rice that came with the platter were really good.  \n\nPrice wise Planeta Mexico is pricier than all the other Mexican restaurants I have been to.  For example, it costs $12.50 for 3 tacos at Planeta, while it usually costs $10 for 3 tacos at other places.  This is a 25% price premium, though it is understandable due to the location.\n\nThe homemade green chili sauce is to die for, and it tastes exactly like the one I had in Southern California.  In fact, the food at Planeta Mexico tastes like the standard Mexican food you can get in Southern California, not much better or worse.  This is where it hurts, that the typical standard in Southern California is regarded as so good and authentic in Toronto.  It speaks volume about the lower standard of Mexican food in Toronto.  \n\nI give it 4 stars because it is authentic and convenient.  The service is friendly.
