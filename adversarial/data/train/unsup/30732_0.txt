Dr. Morantes and his staff are fantastic!\n\nI was in town (from NC) and had a tooth issue I needed to get checked and he was able to see me. Upon checking my teeth he concluded that I did need to get work done but since I was leaving town soon he wouldn't be able to complete it himself.\n\nDr. Morantes worked really hard and found a dentist where I live in NC that he trusted to do the procedure the right way, and after having the procedure done I can say that I would trust his opinion for any further dental care!
