I went here to watch the boxing match between Mayflower and Marquez. The food was good, we sampled 4 different favors of wings and they all had a great taste and texture. Our service was great and the place was packed - though we got there super early and had great seats in a booth. The manager came to our booth during one of the preliminary fights and told us that since we were in a booth they were going to move people to sit with us (she said something about it's a requirement to have 4 people to a booth during these kind of events). I was a little annoyed, but if that's policy then I didn't mind so much - plus it would have been cool to meet some new people. However, people never came. I don't know if there just wasn't as many people as the manager had expected, or the groups were big and didn't want to lose two people to come sit with us. Either way we ended up having our own booth the whole time, which we preferred anyways. \n\nThe fun for the crowd really started during the main event, there were whoops and yells and cries of defeat or success. Super fun - and what really topped off my experience was the bathroom! Clean, roomy with a sitting couch and cute mirrors all over the place. It smelled good too.\n\nI would definitely come to a Buffalo Wild Wings for a big event like this any time!
