I  was so excited to find this baker and one that had such great reviews to boots. My now husband and I went in for the tasting which the glavors were amaxing and they were great to work with. They really worked with us and figured out some changes that we could make that would get us the price range we wanted. I have been in the food industry for year so paying $5+ a slice was something I refused to do. Our cake was suppose to have fondant on the bottom tier and buttercream on the top 2 with different flavors in each tier. Out wedding day came and they were suppose to deliver the cake at 12pm, as our ceremony was at 4 and I wanted to make sure our photographer had enough for photos, well 3pm rolled around and no cake. I had My sister call and they told her the driver got stuck in traffic and was 20mins away. My sister then went to talk to my now husband and he had just called as well and they told him they had just left the store (we were getting married in Queen Creek which is a good 1.5hrs from their store). This really frustrated me as why lie? Plus we paid an extra $100+ for delivery and it wasnt there. The cake finally made right as we were finishing our ceremony at about 4:45pm. The cake looked beautiful but was all fondant, late, and the top tier was leaning. We took the top layer home and because it was 4 layers we took the top 2 off and I immediately found out why it leaned. It looked as though the cake broke or was dropped and the middle was crumbled making it to where the straws used to support the cake couldn't stand up straight. Overall the cake was good and for the most part beautiful but on someones wedding day you shouldnt be 5hrs late and and least apologize (which hasnt happened yet). At this time I'm unsure as to if i would use them again or recommend them to others. The stars are because of being so late and lying to sister as the cake was beautiful dispute the leaning and not being exactly what we ordered.
