Look I'm just happy about the hours. Of course there were a few minor flaws (long-ish wait, crusty atmosphere, not the cleanest restaurant ever) but I'm happy to forgive those. The staff was friendly and hard working. The food was really satisfying. As a vegan who's traveling thru phoenix for the night and needed a bite to eat when everything else was closed, this place was ideal. I recommend the jackfruit sandwich!
