Amazing food, friendly owners. Hidden gem. Highly recommend. The menu literally changes daily! I had the almond & spinach pâté, French onion soup, salmon salad, & the pumpkin tofu red curry (my fav)\n\nCame back for a second visit, OMG the buffalo cauliflower is a MUST. It was the BEST I've EVER had!!! Salmon cakes were also delicious. \nBaked Brie was boring.
