This place never disappoints. You may overlook this restaurant because it's hidden in a dated shopping center, but don't let that fool you! This restaurant is so delicious with tons of variety and the Asian decor adds so much to the experience. The food is always hot, fresh, and very flavorful. Dinner for two will cost you around$30. They always have a happy hour during the week
