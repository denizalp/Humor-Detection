I've eaten here a couple of times in the past. This last time, my son chose to go here for his 13th birthday dinner. \nThe night started fine, we walked in and were seated right away, the server brought drinks and bread. I mention to him that it was my sons 13th birthday and he nodded and said okay. As we where finishing our meal, he brought our check and no offer of dessert or singing to my son. I was greatly disappointed in this,as another party there was also celebrating a birthday and they were being sung to very loudly by the staff. My son, a little shy anyway, didn't seem to mind, but I certainly did! I paid for I meal and we left. We celebrated instead at home.
