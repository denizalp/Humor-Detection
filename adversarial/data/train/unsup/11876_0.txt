Man, each time we eat here, we're not disappointed.\n\nNot a huge fan of eating entirely on the strip, my party tooled out on Spring Mountain and decided to gorge out here.\n\nThings to get whenever you're in Joyful House:\n\nSalt and Pepper Squid\nHot and Sour Soup\nBlack Bean Sauce Crab\nMa Pa Tofu\n\nNow, make sure that the guys hear you correctly.  We ordered the crab but maybe he heard \"crap\" - the waiter ended up bringing out a totally different dish.  We had to send it back but at least they were \"friendly\" about it.  Yes, for what we could tell, they didn't spit in our food.  But man, that crab was the $hit and we killed the entire thing.  All 2.5 pounds of it.
