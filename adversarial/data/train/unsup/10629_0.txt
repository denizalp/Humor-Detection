Cool outlets a mile from Fremont street.  Lots of premium stores but also plenty of stores that you can afford as well.  The outlets were just about complete with the addition of several more stores and restaurants including Off Sax and Cheesecake Factory.  There is a large parking garage and a taxi and bus pick up drop off area as well.  One note the outlets are outdoors so get there early if you want to avoid the blistering summer heat.
