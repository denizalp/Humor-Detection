Raindrop Cake (a.k.a. Mizu Shingen Mochi) is available in Vegas!? Thanks,Yelp. I'm so exited!\n\nThis cute caf√© is so cozy with relaxing piano music in the background. I came here in the morning, but this is a perfect place to have a cup of tea after dinner. Love the wall decorations.\nI never had real Rain Drop Cake in Japan but I tried to make it myself about two years ago when I saw a recipe on YouTube. (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pCQUMAD-Jao) Nope, I couldn't make it as good as the picture so I forgot about it until I recently saw it on Yelp. \nThe Rain Drop Cake is perfect for someone who's watching calories. I don't think it has any calories (if anything 15 or so) but sweet and refreshing. Perfect for summer. Kinako soy bean powder and green tea syrup matched perfect with the Rain Drop Cake. Some may say it's just a tasteless, colorless Jell-O, but I do not think so. It's better. I can't wait to have Original (Kuromitsu black sugar syrup) version!!\nI also had their Jasmine tea (unsweetened). Freshly brewed and delicious.\nThe girl (I think she's Korean) was so nice and friendly. I can tell she's the kind of a person that can still put a nice smile on her face even if she was having a bad day. Thumbs up for her :-)\nAcross the street from Walgreen's. (Same shopping center as Dairy queen) Outside seating available. Easy parking.
