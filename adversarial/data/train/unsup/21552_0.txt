Over the past two or three years we've attended 6 or 7 birthday parties at Rock The Tea and we have hosted one of our own there a couple of months ago.\n\nRock The Tea is very clean, nicely decorated, spacious and it has a great selection of quality dress up clothes\/accessories. The staff is friendly and professional. \n\nLittle girls love this place for birthday parties. Girls get pampered - hair, nails and (light) make-up and each girl gets to select dress up clothes, shoes and jewelry. The party usually includes some sort of game or craft,  a \"fancy\" meal, and a fashion show. \n\n The only reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is because I had a party with 22 girls and I felt that the flow of activities and organization was not as good as the other parties that I had been to at Rock the Tea.\n\n\nI recommend Rock the Tea for a fancy girls party of 12 or less girls.
