Good Ol' Red Lobster!!\n\nDropped by for lunch as I was kinda feeling nostalgic and wanted to rehash the past.\n\nGrowing up my family would come here for lunch after church on Sundays. \n\nThe food had remained the same. Nothing special, but it never disappoints. \n\nAs usual, I ordered the trio shrimp feast.\nReally filling! I shared with MR who got a \"build your lunch\" (portion looked really sad so I gave him some of my fried shrimp and garlic shrimp).\n\nI really enjoyed having lunch here today. \nService was quick and courteous. \nOf course, I will be returning as I have for the past 20 yrs.
