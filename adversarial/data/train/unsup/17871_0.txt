Had a very stressful week at work and the moment I had a little down time, what did I want to do? Go to Ikea of course!!!!!! Not even joking, I literally perked up and I was so happy to go. \n\nThis is my favorite IKEA over the North York one and I've been here many times, sometimes 3 days in a row. To get here, you're literally going down highway 7 and it's super easy to get to. It's so simple I've never had any driving anxiety going there (compared to the North York one which is quite hectic and parking is sort of crazy too). This location is perfect as it is situated in sort of the middle of no where which gives them lots of parking and you usually get your choice spot.\n\nThis IKEA has mastered the retail experience for me. They know. It's psychology. Even though I don't want to buy any furniture at all, we still go through the whole first floor to look at the awesome set ups they have. It's always enticing and a beauty. Getting a little peckish from  walking? When you finish the floor, head over to the cafe for cheap eats with a variety of dishes. Not that hungry? Head downstairs for 2 hot dogs and a drink for $2. The Market Hall is my favorite area as there's just so much stuff that I shouldn't buy but pick up anyway. It's dangerous for a hoarder. While employees are sort of hard to find, the logic and branding behind the company makes it clear on why they do the things they do and I 100% stand behind it. I will always go to this IKEA and continue to buy crap I don't need. \n\nI LOVE IKEA!!!!
