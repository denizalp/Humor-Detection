The only reason I'm not giving Uncle Sam's 5 stars is: the salads are meh and it's a bit pricey in my opinion.\n\nOn the other hand, the pizza is really, really good.  In my top 5 pizzas ever.  But what I crave the most from here are the Mushroom pepper cheese steaks.  This is comfort food at it's greasiest and finest.  I order it with peppers and banana peppers and it's fantastic.  Great wings, too.  I order them with extra medium sauce.  \n\nI've had other items here, but basically, if you want the best of the best, stick with the pizza, cheese steaks, and wings.
