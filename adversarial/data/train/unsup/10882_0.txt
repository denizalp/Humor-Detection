My \"bro\"(after taco time I question if he's my bro, hence the \"bro\") Baltazar was begging us to go to taco time and said they were the best tacos in the world. He's from Montana and grew up on this stuff. Because Montana is well know for good Mexican food right. We land in Vegas and he drags us out to the middle of the desert. Our uber driver took us on a mission around the desert to get there. Meanwhile my friend and I are thinking man these better be the best damn tacos we ever had. We get there and it's some beat up old truck stop in the middle of nowhere. Look at the menu and I couldn't believe that a meal only comes with one taco, what the hell am I supposed to do with one taco. And the \"mexi-fries\" are just dam tater tots. I'm Mexican and had no idea tater tots were Mexican-news to me. So I order the taco meal with \"mexi-fries\" and an extra taco. We waited like 30 minutes for anyone's order to come out. When our order was ready the guy said tacos, \"who ordered tacos?\" My friends and I and other customers just stare at each other, like this is a taco place everyone ordered tacos. So we are like is this order 518, they guy was dumbfounded and said \"two tacos?\" I'm like yes we all ordered tacos is it #518, he looks at the screen 3 times. I'm just like I'm taking these damn tacos I'm starving. Sit back down and I have no ketchup for my tater tots so I go ask for some, took them 10 minutes to acknowledge me, by the time I go sit down my food is cold. Open up my taco expecting to eat the best taco I've ever had in my life. Jesus Christ it tasted like nothing and my taco crumbled in my hands. The tater tots tasted like tater tots, um okay. Vegas has the best food in the world and this guy takes us to taco time. 2 hours later we all had the squirts on our bro weekend in Vegas. From then on we do not let Baltazar pick any more food.
