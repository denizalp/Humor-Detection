Awful experience. Arrive at 11:55 today. Seated at 12:00. 15 minutes later we had to get up and ask for a drink and for someone to take the order. We never saw a server again. At least not at our table. The people next to us got decent service. It seemed like the new their server. We finally had to leave. When we told the hostess on the way out. It was just, \"ok\" like that was a normal occur again. Never again.
