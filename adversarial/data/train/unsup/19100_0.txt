Great steak, huge servings, excellent service- comes with a high price too. Good thing I was invited here by a supplier.\nDinner comes with complimentary bread, pickles and olives. The olives are fabulous. Their prime rib is  about 1.5 - 2 inches thick and almost covers the entire dinner plate. All entrees come with broccoli and carrots. Their desserts are wonderful as well. We had pecan pie, cheesecake , chocolate mouse.
