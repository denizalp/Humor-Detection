Great place. Had XL Pickle Chicken Nashville Hot with Grits. We also had the Rubin with Garlic Fries.  Everything tasted great. Checked in with Yelp and got the free fried pickles. Awesome, light breading  and great. Food was excellent, portions were right. Chicken had a light breading and was juicy. Grits were good, if not a little too much size wise. The only small complaint might be the garlic seasoning on the fries, a little too much for us. Otherwise, service was great, server kept our waters full and checked back often. Great place to eat.
