I decided to stop at this restaurant on a whim because I was driving by and I was hungry.  This is a dual store, where they a Taco Bell as well as a Long John Silver's restaurant.  \n\nI arrived around mid afternoon and ordered some fish and chicken.  As I waited for my food, I was told the wait would be 10 - 15 minutes for them to cook it fresh.  They did not offer to bring it out to my table so I had to stand at the counter, waiting.  The wait was approximately 20 minutes.\n\nWhile the fish and chicken were fresh off the fryer and tasty, the fries and hush puppies were cold.  It's sad that the cheapest things on my plate were the least appetizing. \n\nThe staff did not apologize for the wait, nor were they too friendly.  Unfortunately, the manager who was manning the fryers did not bother to make eye contact with me either.
