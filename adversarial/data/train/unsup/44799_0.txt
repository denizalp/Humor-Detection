I have been to over 30 different Chili's in my lifetime and I do have to say that this one tops It Off . Every time we go we always get a warm welcome at the door from the host staff. The servers are always very attentive. And this has the fastest food served then any other chilis I've been at. And the food is always hot and fresh, drinks are always topped off, and tables are always pre bussed. This is my favorite chilis and the only one that me and my husband will ever go to. \nIf I had to give a negative feedback , the only thing would be maybe more manager presence on the floor. Out of the eight times we went I have NEVER seen a manager. Day or night.  But staff does very well without them. :).
