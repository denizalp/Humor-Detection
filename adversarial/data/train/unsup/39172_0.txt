Took 6 of my grandkids here, what a great time. They loved the interactive stations and getting to see all the ironman suits. It was great seeing their expressions with every thing. Playing the video game at the end was an added bonus. Just F.Y.I. don't go into the video game if you want to go back and look around some more because after the video game you go to the exit. Will definitely go back when my other 2 grandkids are in town. Awesome time!!
