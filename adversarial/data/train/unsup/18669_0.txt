Ughhhh butter pecan ice cream is the best ice cream I have ever eaten. I don't think I've ever ordered butter pecan in my life but one sample spoon bite changed my life. I got a single scoop of it, which was surprisingly big. Halfway through eating it I started getting nauseous because I was already really full from dinner. But I kept eating and now I'm laying in bed dealing with the consequences of my gluttony. Worth. Every. Bite. \n\nButter pecan: salty, sweet, creamy. Lots of pecans. They had a slight popcorn taste which was cool. \n\nSalted chocolate chunk cookie: chewy with crispy edges and a really nice salted taste. Also one of the best cookies I've gotten at an ice cream shop. \n\nPlease go.
