Normally I would say that Archies is one of my favorite Thai food places, but this time was not as pleasant. I walked in to a busy atmosphere and it took one of the girls walking by me three times before I was greeted. I place my order at 1:23 for just basic pad Thai and some red curry.... After patiently waiting, at about 1:55 she says it's coming out in just a minute. Finally my food is here and I can go enjoy it at home, well the pad Thai was great as usual, but I've been having bad experiences with curry lately so I'm always extra careful when eating it... And of course there it was, a giant, black, wavy piece of hair, I almost puked. I couldn't believe it, I'm literally still in shock as I'm writing this review! I didn't pay 23$ plus tip for food with nasty hair in it! I just don't know if there are any decent Thai food restaurants left in this town, so discouraging.
