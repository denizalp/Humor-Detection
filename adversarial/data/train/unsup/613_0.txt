If you are looking for a place to live in Old Town, this is NOT it. This place claims to be going through major renovations to make everything a lot nicer. Well, don't be fooled, this place is basically an old crappy car with a nice paint job. They put in some new cabinet doors but kept the old disgusting cabinets, painted over the walls but kept the awful popcorn ceiling. Currently, they are also still leasing to section- 8 residents, meaning most of the people who reside there are a bit trashy. The management is terrible, rude and very uninformative. The dumpsters are always over flowing with garbage and there are constantly people driving by and rummaging through your garbage, it is awful. Not the mention, the building has had bed bugs and rather than treating surrounding units and the complex, they only treated one unit, hoping the problem would disappear. I would not recommend living here, the newer renovated units are decently priced but please keep in mind that you are sharing a complex with people who pay dirt cheap for the older disgusting units. DO NOT live here, you do not get what you pay for.
