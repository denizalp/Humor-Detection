I came in during lunch because my nails were busted again and I hadn't gotten them done since 2017 :O \n\nThey were able to take off my crusty SNS and do a fresh new gel color in about 40mins ~. Since I only had a short amount of time, I really appreciate how fast they worked. \n\nMy gel manicure cost $30 so it's decently priced and looks amazing. I am still on the hunt for a new nail salon in the Tempe area, so I will probably try a couple more out.
