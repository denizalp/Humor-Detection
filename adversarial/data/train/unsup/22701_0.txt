Ok, ok, I know you're all shocked, 2 stars, but, truly I have experienced better.\n\nThe handsome beau and I stopped here one evening after a horrible show at PSQ (Pippin) and we wanted a cocktail.  I've only read all the amazing reviews from you, my fellow Yelpers and well, I just wondered what all the hype was for.\n\nIts a dark basement type bar which I didn't mind, but oy the chairs were uncomfortable.  (Listen, I've got a booty so I may need a little extra in a good chair, but these were so small and uncomfortable I wondered why they even had chairs.)  I liked that there weren't and TVs in the place.  I typically think most people don't know how to have a conversation without distraction anymore.  \n\nThe cocktail list is impressive, I think they're right up there with VTR, Pier W, and Crop cocktails.  They take the time to make them and they're boozy.  Honestly, I can't even recall what I ordered, but I know I didn't like it.  My beau enjoyed his beverage of choice.  There is water on the table, which I liked, I'm a water drinker and I always feel bad about running a server's legs off because I like my agua.  \n\nService was garbage.  The hostess \/ waitress appeared so infrequently and some guy randomly appeared to take our order, someone else brought our drinks.  Frankly, I was so confused as to what kind of service or lack thereof was happening I didn't know who to flag down for the bill.  And flag down, I had to.  I'm sitting with empty glasses and I either want a drink or a bill, someone please come to my table!\n\nIt was a diverse crowd to be sure.  I'd say somewhere 30s and up.  So you can be sure you'll avoid some of the teeny-boppers or tourists of E 4th.\n\nWhat I did decide is I don't need to go back.  I can get just as decent cocktail somewhere else with better service, better seats, and ambiance.  But, by all means, don't take my word for it.
