Going into this place really teleports you to an east coast bar\/pub\n\nUnfortunetly the local customers are not what you expect to see in an east coast bar\/pub\n\nNo obvious cops shooting the shit after a shift, frankly not a lot of people at all. Of the two bars that shared the McCaffrey name. this bar is by far the lesser of the two. From what I've heard Seamus doesn't even own this place anymore. Maybe that is part of the problem...\n\nPolice patches adorn the bar..so I'm surprised to not see any police.\n\nThere used to be a large collections of lepperchans, I didn't see them last time I went (pub crawl) but I did see a friend from another bar...that was cool. Other then that..i will continue to stay clear of Seamus McCaffery's.\n\n\nSorry Bud. \nmay ye luck be at anothee Baah
