I wouldn't give any stars if possible! Went in and waited 1hr for the guy to start my relaxer, then he resumed asking questions to a manager that was too busy to pay attention. Fast forward 4 hrs hrs later and I have burn marks all over my scalp that has me in so much pain that I consult with the floor manager and she gives me a facial moisture lotion that is supposed to help. Well it helps for about ten minutes and then with chemicals in my hair and a very inexperienced stylist ( if he could even be called that) he is now blow drying  the chemicals he failed to wash out of my hair deeper into my skin.\nAfter having one side of my hair dried and feeling sick to my stomach, like i wanted to vomit, I decided to leave and tell them I don't wish to continue with this experience. Asking for my money, I politely refuse showing the manager what my hair looked and felt like and instead she offers me to come back two weeks later for more trauma. Also, refusing to accept the fact that I shouldn't have to pay she then reduces the cost to a 50% off discount! \nNeedless to say I will never be returning. And you should STAY AWAY!
