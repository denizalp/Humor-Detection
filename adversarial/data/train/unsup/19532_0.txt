No chicken at kfc. Seriously at 9pm on a weekday I pulled up to the drive-thru and was presented with a mumbling unintelligible female voice stating that they were, \"out of chicken, but if I wanted to wait 20 minutes they would make some more.\" I responded all chicken? Your out of all chicken? To which she responded, \"yeah.\" Wow, what an experience a KFC with no Chicken.
