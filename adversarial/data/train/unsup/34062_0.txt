I wouldn't ever think about doing business with this company again, especially after my move-out experience.\n\nI paid for a unit here for a lot longer than I anticipated and experienced the following:\n\n-Horrendous billing\nI lost count how many times I had to call in to correct them when they billed me for the wrong unit or the wrong amount and my emails about the issue went unanswered.\nThey also made several promises to refund me the 1\/2 month I didn't use and then the entire story changed on my scheduled move-out day this month\n\n-Skyrocketing Rent Prices\nIn the last year alone that I used this facility they raised my rent by 40%, with no warning for either of the two increases. And this was after repeatedly botching my bill, requiring me to go out of my way to get them to correct their own issues\n\n-No use of the dumpster\nThey won't let you use their dumpster, even for papers and have a big sign which threatens big fines if you do. But they have no problem encouraging people to dump their trash at the Basha's across Granite Reef. I wonder if anyone knows about that at Basha's.\n\n-Paint dust \nThey painted with a cheap spray method that left a layer of white paint dust on all of my personal items and furniture. I still haven't been able to clean everything.\n\nAvoid this company and this facility.
