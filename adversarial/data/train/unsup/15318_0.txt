As we walked in we saw the \"cash only\" sign and started to walk out since my wife and I only had about three bucks in cash combined. One of the employees said they could take credit cards after we told them why we were leaving. How convenient. Obviously, they just don't want to deal with credit card fees. I can't fault them for that, but it's not exactly a business practice I like.\n\nOur lunch consisted of the goi cuon ($4.95) -- shrimp and pork spring rolls that were missing any sign of pork. The bun cha gio ga nuong ($7.95) was decent. egg rolls and charbroiled chicken with noodles. The portion size was plenty but the chicken lacked flavor. Adding plenty of fish sauce helped a little. The broth of the pho tai ($7.95) had plenty of flavor and was the highlight of the meal.\n\nService was excellent and friendly. They didn't have a problem with me sharing the b√∫n with my son and even brought out a separate bowl with noodles for him. Located at Jones and Desert Inn, it's closer than other Vietnamese places so chances are I'll be back.
