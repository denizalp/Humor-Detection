f this place! \n\nmy boyfriend and i walked in, looked at the menu and walked out.\n\nthey charge 3 dollars for a bowl of rice. wtf?\nthis place is more like korean bbq, not japanese. false advertisement!\n\nand the portions would have been really small, had i ordered them.....\ndont want to pay $40 for a snack for one person. sorry! dont like leaving places hungry.\n\nso thats why we left...\n\ni hope they close. prime retail space can be used for something else. rip off prices. get them out now.\n\ni guess they tried to differ themselves from all the other korean bbq places in lv. fakers.\n\nim mean, but i think its bad business. i really do.
