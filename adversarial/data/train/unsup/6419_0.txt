They are absolute swindlers.  I have had to get Buick's corporate customer service department involved, and the district manager lied about what assistance they had offered me.  The service rep I spoke to also lied through his teeth.  This is a horrific dealership, and I will never purchase from them again.  Contact me and I'll be happy to provide documentation and exactly whom I spoke to and how they ended up overcharging me $12k that they refuse to do anything about.  Avoid!!
