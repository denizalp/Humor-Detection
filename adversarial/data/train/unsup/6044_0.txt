READ THIS PRIOR TO GOING TO COULTER CADILLAC!!!\n\nTO: response@coultercadillac.com\nSent: 1\/31\/2013 6:20:02 AM\nSUBJECT: RE: Thank you for visiting\n\nCassidy Cavin,\nARE YOU JOKING! EARN OUR BUSINESS? EVERYONE READ THE BELOW PRIOR TO GOING TO COULTER CADILLAC! \nAs promised we came back to your dealership last night. Your New Car Manager, PAUL GLANS\" was very rude with us using the old scum bag CAR SALES tactics claiming he lost the key to the White Diamond 2013 Escalade Platinum which I spent over 2 hours previewing earlier in the afternoon. You were aware we were coming back last night? YOU AND THIS SCUM BAG waisted our time? I told you that my wife was a CFO and conducting Board meetings all week and we had a short window to buy the 2013 Escalade Platinum. We even called you to ask you to pull the auto out while headed there so my wife could see the auto which you agreed to do? PAUL GLANS (THE SCUM BAG) was insisting to walk around our \"trade in\" 2011 BMW 550i in advance to even showing my wife the 2013 Escalade Platinum?  Uhhh... this is 2013 not 1980? Flash-back??? I gave you guys the info on the trade earlier in the day including a pay off amount. This is horrible business. You and PAUL GLANS were cherry picking us which is a form of discrimination! EVERYONE READ THIS! This happens to be Coulter Cadillac, you and PAUL GLANS problem, not ours, as we immediately called Mike at LUND Cadillac who has inegtity and merrit and is dropped off a Platinum Escalade ESV Black Ice to our house the next morning. YOU LOST A SALE! Cassidy, we suggest you go to a more repitable dealer to work in sales capacity as long as that scum bag PAUL GLANS is working there. We also suggest PAUL GLANS crawl back into the hole he crawled out of as we are headed to all the online reporting sites to share this horrible experience with the Universe. PAUL, you can't discriminate, cherry pick and treat customers like this.  Question? Does the owner of Coulter Cadillac even know that PAUL GLANS treated us like this or is that scum bags trying to sweep it under the rug as if nothing happened? One thing is for sure, the owners WILL read about it. Go to your BBB page. Thank you, Valued Customer \n\nDear Amy and David,\n\nI sincerely apologize for what happened last night. I always want to give my customers first class service, and unfortunately you did not receive it. So if there is anything I can do to still earn your business and make things right or possibly your business in the future, please let me know! \n\nThank you,\n\nCassidy Cavin\nSales Consultant\nCoulter Cadillac Buick GMC\n1188 E.
