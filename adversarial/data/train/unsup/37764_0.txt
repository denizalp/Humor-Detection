Found out about this location through a flyer in the mail. It was their grand opening today. The restaurant itself is very modern. Has music playing through out the place. It has bowls or burrito you can order from the set menu or you can custom make your own. I had the DIY Burrito from the set menu. It reminds me of a Subway, where you can see the food that they prep from. All the seafood looks fresh. The burrito I had, included spicy tuna, crabmeat and yellowtail. Jalape√±o, avacado, cucumber and masago finished it off. The staff is friendly and helpful. The burrito price and size is about average to other places I tried around town. The fish is really fresh and tasty. So if your around the Anthem Hills area, should stop by and give it a try.
