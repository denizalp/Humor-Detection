Came back here yesterday for my 6 week appointment.  This time Crystal colored my hair and she did a great job, she also advised me on what we'll do in the future, a nice touch.  \n\nThe cut she did last time was so great it was still working for me, easy to style and looking good after 6 weeks. So she only needed to give me the slightest trim.  \n\nWhen I reminded them that I had reviewed them on Yelp they offered me a free shampoo and blow out before my next appointment YAY!\n\nGuys this is also the place for you.  I saw a young guy come in with basically a messed up mullet and ended up with a really great updated look. \n\nLOVE this place.
