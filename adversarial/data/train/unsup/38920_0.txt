This is a very nice hotel!  Located within Calgary's downtown core, it's walking distance to river and most downtown attractions. \n\nOur favourite feature about this hotel is the pool\/hot-tub\/waterslide area. Our kids can spend hours in the pool while we exercise in the adjacent exercise room that overlooks (and accesses) the pool. \n\nThe club floor is nice and the lounge serves up an above-average breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres.\n\nThe rooms are spacious suites that allow kids to sleep while parents can stay up later in the separate seating area. \n\nOverall, the Sheraton Eau Claire is our go-to spot whenever we're staying in downtown Calgary.
