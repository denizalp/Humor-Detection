S: Hey Angelo\n\nA:Oh hey Superstore whats new?\n\nS:Not much just the usual business. Wide variety of produce at prices cheaper than Co-op or Safeway, an international isle that tries to cover the ethnic minority demographic of Calgary, a bulk section made for kings, and a cheese section largely dominated by President's choice.\n\nA:Yeah President's choice is allright\n\nS:Yeah! Allright if you like paying for extra cash like a chump. Are you chump? Don't answer that. Did you have some of their fresh sushi and pizza?\n\nA:It's okay. Sushi is a bit expensive but pretty good. Although some people I know got sick from it. Also the pizza is super cheap but tastes like the cardboard roll you get after you run out of toilet paper.\n\nS: Whatever. Ok so I notice you're wearing some Joe fresh flanel shirts\n\nA: Yeah, but the prices are going up, it defeats the purpose of having affordable fashionable clothes...\n\nS: Shut up. It's 7:30 am, time to drink your capsules you putz\n\n14\/30 Underdog Challenge\n\nI am loosing it....
