DIVEUX MAXIMUS. Yeah, this is a dive and a half. \n\nI had heard good things about this place and I was thinking of giving it a try, so I went to meet a friend here for a drink and there are two things you must remember: \n\nOne? Again... yup, this is A dive. Two? Once you are there you will certainly catch the irony in the name. As this place is as narrow as a the world perspective of a fundamental Baptist. \n\nBeer is generally cheap, lots of graffiti line the walls, a number of tv's above the bar playing sports but there is not a lot of seating. On that last note, this locale is just so-so and not much different than a place like Sneaky Dee's... except for the lack of space. \n\nYet... could I see this place getting packed? Totally. \n\nIt has that run down, should-make-you-question-the-hygiene-of-the-joint... Mmm... or that je ne sais quoi that acts like catnip to cats that hipters simply can't say no to. \n\nAll in all, not a bad place to drop by from time to time if you are meeting a few friends. Just not too many.
