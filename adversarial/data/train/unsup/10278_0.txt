A dive bar that features Chinese food? Now those aren't two things you hear in the same sentence!  After trying this place I know why! \n\nMy buddy and I stopped at Chop and Wok on the way to the airport  and ordered the food to go. The NFC championship game was on in the bar and patio area, so this review is a bit late.  \n\nWe both got the same thing, a chicken and veggie combo on brown rice.\nI barely had time to eat a couple of bites as we rushed to return the rental car. 2 bites was 2 too many.  My navigator on the other had time for a bit more. Sad part is the chicken tasted like it was still frozen.  If you have ever microwaved one of those prefabbed frozen dinners, that is the level of flavor this dish had, bummer. \n\nHad high hopes for this place but all I can say is yuck! I hate to give it 2 stars but that was some bad Chinese food.
