My son lives at these apartments and I stay some weekends. I just want to say that since they switched property management, it's a nicer environment! The front office staff are friendly and helpful, the maintenance workers are friendly and do a great job with repairs. They seem to care and listen. \nThe grounds are very well kept and the overall property is beautiful. Worth every penny I pay!
