I have been to the week-end buffet a couple of times.  I am not sure if they're still doing it but, it was absolutely mind-blowingly good.  Expensive - $20 which is more like NYC prices.  But, good home-cooked traditional Korean dishes that to me are like Asian soul-food .  Recommended if for just once in awhile due to the high cost . (the buffet is ONLY on Sundays.)
