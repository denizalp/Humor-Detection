Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nHubby and I have lived in this area for about three years and the first year we were here I used to shop at this location quite frequently. I stopped because of their lack of organic food. I switched \"close\" grocery shopping at Albertson's. \n\nWhat a difference a few years makes!\n\nA few weeks ago I ran into this location primarily to go to US Bank (our bank) and was AMAZED at how crowded and crazy it was in the middle of the day! A weekday at 2pm and it was hard to find a parking space. It took me ten minutes to get through the parking lot and another ten minutes to walk through the traffic, get to the door, find a shopping cart...I decided I would not buy anything there and just use the banking area and leave. When ditching my shopping cart, I walked across the front of the store and it was filled with mothers and loose running children out of control. It was like a circus show.\n\nThe worst part of the experience was I overheard two young grocery bagger guys talking about how drunk they were last night and how they had to work all day today still drunk...really?!??! \n\nI can not imagine what it's going to be like when they get the HUGE apartment complex open across the street.\n\nNo thanks. I will stick to Sprouts, F&E and WF.   :(
