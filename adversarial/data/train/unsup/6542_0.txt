I WILL NOT be going back to Regal cinemas again. \n\nI took the girls there today to see the Muppet movie... on the way since it was an early 10:50 am show i got them a smoothie and got Bianca a Starbucks. \n\nI paid $40 dollars for the tickets and $8.95 for a bucket of popcorn.... then got stopped like we were shoplifters or something with the staff saying no outside food or drink. Now i get they want you to by their concessions. That is why I bought the popcorn... but i am not feeding my kid milk duds and red vines for breakfast and they don't have anything close to nutritious. \n\nAfter arguing with the manager i got my money back....we see at least two movies a month as a family and i had my daughters birthday at that theater and it cost me over 1000 dollars ...... I WILL NOT BE going back.
