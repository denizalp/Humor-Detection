Amazing!  Our first time but  wont be the last. The food was fabulous, ambiance inviting, and the service was wonderful.  Went there for a bday dinner. We were immediately greeted and seated.  The wait staff was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  Chef marc came to our table 3 or 4 times to help us decide and check up on us. \nWe had the antipasto for two which had amazing sliced meats and cheeses. For the app we had the mussels farro, it blew me away I couldn't stop eating it and would gladly order it as my main course in the future.  For mains we had the filet migon saltembuco and the lobster ravioli. The filet was  amazing accompanied with a smokey unbelievable delicious escrole. My lobster rav was homemade and contained large delicious chunks of lobster. It was the best I ever had. To finish I had the mocha-chino, it reminded me of my family and my childhood. Followed by dessert, we had the lemoncello cake it was fabulous one of the most amazing cakes I've ever had. The slice was huge but still I wanted to take the whole cake home. It will be a cake I compare future cakes to. \n\nI recommend you try this place for yourself
