I sometimes wonder if this Supercuts is where they send their weak links--like getting bumped down to AAA from the big leagues. Were it not a 5-minute walk from my house, I'm sure I'd have given up on the place. It's not that this is a bad place to get your hair cut...no,  actually, it is that. It's not a *terrible* place to get your hair cut, just merely bad. Their haircuts are not so egregiously awful that they provoke anger...just never really what you asked for. Your wait isn't hours-long...just longer than they always tell you over the phone. Folks are polite here, at least, sort of.
