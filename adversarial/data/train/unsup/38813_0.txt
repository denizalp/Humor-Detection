The set menu for Valentine's Day 2014 was \"just okay\" but I get that it's difficult to pull something like that off cost-effectively. I wouldn't do it again to be honest but I will definitely give their full menu another shot. The appetizers at the bar that I tried a few months back were intriguing, as is the extensive wine list. Some yummy specialty drinks on offer here as well. The top rate service definitely makes this place feel special. Was here for a special occasion in late November and they gave me a box of truffles!
