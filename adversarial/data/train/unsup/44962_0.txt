We ordered the garlic knots, a pepperoni pizza, a combination with no olives (picture), and a cookie pie. The garlic knots were really really good and you get 12 for only $4.75!! The pizza was okay.. I didn't like the taste of the bread or the stringy super long pieces of onion. I ended up drowning it in ranch . The cookie pie was good! Not the best one I've had but pretty decent (it is hard to go wrong with cookies).
