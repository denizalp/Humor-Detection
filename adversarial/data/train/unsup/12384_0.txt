WARNING - The owner threatened to sue me again today (Feb 2018) since the last threat (mid-2017)... I logged in after a long lull, planning on deleting mean girl reviews I wrote during my teenage years but srsly??  Be careful if you're a walk-in, don't you dare voice any concerns to Joyce, her first response will be \"You just see who gets the last laugh when I take you to court for libel!\"  Just told her to stop perennially threaten me with court orders over this review (I really was considering taking this down if she changes her mind)...but nope.  She insists she'll take me to court.\n\n- - - - - \n(2010 experience)\nEver want to get royally shafted?!?\n\n3 cut & up'do's, in a 3-hour appointment slot (set up 2 weeks ahead of time).  \n\n7 hours later:\n- my friend's highlights turned GREEN: they blamed it on the fact that she didn't tell the stylist she sometimes dye her hair with drug store hair dyes.\n- I didn't get my haircut because they spent the whole afternoon trying to fix my friend's hair (and FAILED). \n\nWe were late for the event because it took up 7 HOURS.  We sat there from 2p.m. to 8:45p.m..  We came out with a handful of company logo-emblazoned cosmetic mirrors, ball-point pens and lip balms as souveniers.  \n\nLuckily my boyfriend got his haircut first (1:45p.m.) and he wasn't expecting anything other than a crew cut.  And I am glad our up-do's were creative ones; it was up, thick and fierce, and has some structure to it.  Looked like we were the only clients that entire day.\n\nThere's no way they're convincing any of us to fork out $950 for Cinderella Hair Extensions.  We were nice clients, they were nice people but obviously the stylists need to go back to barber college.
