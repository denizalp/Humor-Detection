I went to Pangaea Land of the Dinosaurs on a Friday morning with my 5 year old son.  He loved it!  I was shocked by how much he already knew about dinosaurs that I didn't lol.  \n\nMatt was our tour guide.  He was very informative and patiently answered all of my son's questions.  The dinosaurs looked realistic; they moved, blinked, and made noises.  The attention to detail was great!\n\nThe base price of the tickets for kids and adults were the same.  Then at the back of the exhibit theres an option to purchase add on activities for about $5 each. I highly recommend that they charge more for children's tickets and make these add on activities all-inclusive for children. It would ensure a longer and more enjoyable stay, because children do not want to just get the basic tour and leave; and parents are not expecting that these activities would be tacked onto the base price once their already inside.    \n\nMy son's favorite was the inflatable obstacle course (Comes with base price).  It was pretty empty when I went so there was no line at all for any activities. I also liked how clean\/ well kept everything appeared. \n\nI purchased the dino cart ride for an extra $5 which he enjoyed as well.  I stayed for slightly over an hour, but I think the expectation from most parents is a 2 hour stay at the price point.  \n\nsolid 3.5\/5 stars.  If they only offered all inclusive wristbands\/tickets for children and no option for just a base ticket (for kids) than I would give it 4.5\/5 stars.  Has great potential if they would make this important change.
