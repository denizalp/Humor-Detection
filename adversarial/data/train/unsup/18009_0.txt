I've been looking for a dance studio for my 5 year old daughter for dance classes.  My child's school teacher warned me about this place for their rudeness in customer service and they only cater to \"serious dancers\", not a young child friendly studio if your child only wants to dance for fun.  Because the location is ideal for me, I still called to get more information hoping that it is not so bad.  I must say, I was WRONG.  The person answered the phone did NOT want to talk to me at all.  She repeatedly said that they are at the end of the semester.  All information are posted on the website.  When I asked her if I can bring my daughter come in to try one class just to see if she is comfortable in the class.  I was told there is a $20 charge to try the class (many places offer one free class to try out regardless if you sign up for the class). To me $20 to just try one class is steep especially for preschool class.  \n\nThis place is crossed off from my list
