How do you go to San Francisco and NOT have the clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl? How do you go to Austin and NOT have barbeque of some type? How do you go to NYC and not have a slice of pizza? You dont! You have to do those things to experience how folks there chow down.\n \n    So if in Pittsburgh, you throw caution and your diet to the winds and try a Primant Bros sandwich. In town for a Pittsburgh fottball weekend, (Panthers-ND, Steelers- Bills and even Slippery Rock-Seton Hill) our first stop after the hotel is the famous PB, within walking distance and smack dab on the fringe of Pitt's campus.\n    \n     Over time Ive learned to trust my inner voice. \"Buy this stock, its a great investment\" or \"Marry her, it'll work out\".  Sometimes I go against it, with rationale like \"eat it, you've had worse\", or  \"so what if I'm husband number five?\"   Well, sitting down at PB's I had a naggin feeling to get the capicola or the pastrami...Not a naggaing feeling, more of a screaming \"GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!\" vibe going on.. Nice atmosphere, easily navigatable menu,  (\"GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!\") a good mix of beers, TV's all around the room.  This is a Pitt landmark, gotta take in the full experience (\"GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!\").\n\n      So here's the waiter ,a  fine and friendly fellow and I can hear my mouth and brain arguing. (Mouth: \"Get the number 2, I dont care, I hate this guy anyway from last nights tofu\"..  Brain: \"We're paying for this, jerk, get what you really want\") Mouth wins and I order the hamburger patty with the requisite fries, colesalw, tomatoes and thick sliced Italian bread.  The rationale? Its their #2 seller, after beer!\n\n     The food comes and it only take 2 bites to chastise my brain for not taking charge  (\"GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!\"). The coleslaw makes the fries cold, and the hamburger patty well, I'll be kind.  Imagine taking off your shoe, taking out the inner sole, placing it on the grill for 3 minues, them placing it into a  sandwich...Bland, over done, totally buried by everything else in the sandwich. No amount of ketchup could save it..   (\"GET THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!\")   I probably should have just taken it out and eaten a cole slaw\/fries sandwich...\n\nOf course while I'm eating, (well enduring is more like it) the sandwich, the next table orders the pastrami....It looked deleicious, hearty, tasteful. My one time to eat at PB's and I choose (like the guy in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) poorly. I wont slam Primanti Bros with one star because I had alternatives and only one visit. (Note to Brain: Stand up for yourself!. Dont let the Mouth make all the decisions, he only works here, you're supposed to be running the place!..)   \n\nIf in Pittsburgh again, I will try PB's again. And I will get, all togther now:  THE CAPICOLA OR PASTRAMI!
