Let me start off by saying that I am the so called \"friend\" of Dave S. as mentioned in the previous review.  What you are about to hear is the truth and not Dave's liberal propaganda.  First, some facts:\n1.  Dave wasn't even hungry to start with.  He just wanted to go home and pass out.  So he was already in an \"anti\" mood.\n2.  Out of the kindness of my heart I paid for the weird guy on the rickshaw to pedal us over to the shop.  I also paid for the deep fried mac and cheese and we split it.  (Typical liberal, free loading off others.)\n3.  I never said the cheese steaks tasted good.  I only hyped up the deep fried mac and cheese.\n4.  Dave doesn't even know if they really offer peppers or not.  HE DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR ANY.  Maybe they don't offer them but Dave was too busy being an angry liberal that he didn't even think to ask.  I got an idea...when the lady taking your order asks you what you want on your sandwich....you should tell her!! \n\nThe live DJ in the shop and the party atmosphere at 2 am is a can't miss.  I even meet some fat ugly girl there that just sat down, didn't say anything and started eating the scraps off my plate.  Where else can you get that kind of entertainment?  However, we both did agree that the deep fried mac and cheese was great.  As for Dave's claim about the stale bread and dry meat, it tastes great to me.  As I was busy enjoying my great meal, Dave was trying to explain to me why he didn't like it.  See, Dave had just returned from a 1 month trip in south east Asia.  Dave said he didn't like the meal because his \"palate had changed\".  Wow, sorry Dave.....I apologize that the Philadelphia Sandwich Company here in America doesn't use dog as its prime source of meat.  So Dave, some parting words of wisdom.  As the great Elbert Hubbard once said, \"Genius may have its limitations, but stupidity is not thus handicapped.\"
