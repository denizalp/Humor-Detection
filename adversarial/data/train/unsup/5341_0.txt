Great Staff and great doctors. I've been coming here for about 10 years now and I have never experienced anything but the best. Dr. Ginger Lane always goes above and beyond and shows tremendous compassion towards her patients. I definitely recommend this clinic if you're looking for a primary care provider. Thank you, Desert Family Medicine.
