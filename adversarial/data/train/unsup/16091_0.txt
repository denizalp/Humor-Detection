Course was in decent shape, but their golf carts were terrible. If you go outside of any of the designated boundaries the golf cart stops and you have to put it in reverse to move. The problem is that their gps system must be off because the carts were constantly shutting down even when we were on the cart path. When I talked to the manager of the course he basically put the blame on us and said we must not have been on the path. Probably won't golf here again unless they fix their carts.
