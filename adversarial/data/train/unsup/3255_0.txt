A recent Canadian expansion of an American chain I've patronized for some time. A selection of 15 or so olive oils (usually including a Novello) from across Europe and the New World, plus a larger number of flavoured oils, all of which can be sampled, which is the biggest plus in my books. I wouldn't necessarily come here for an everyday oil but rather for specialty finishing oils and the gourmet dips, jams, and other condiments on offer. Bring your own bottle to save a couple of bucks on the bulk oils!
