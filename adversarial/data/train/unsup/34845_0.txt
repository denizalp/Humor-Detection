Tony Waller was fantastic!! He explained everything to me and helped me select the best deal for me.  I bought a fish starter kit and can't wait to expand it.  He also helped me get several things for our cats.  Thank you Tony very much.  He works at store #573 on south Rainbow if you can visit that store ask for him.  Steve and Lori Miller
