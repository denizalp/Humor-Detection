Hailey thank you for putting the Yelpies on High Street together. It's been a while since we had a large event like this we so many Elite members and I loved seeing long time Yelp Elite friends! The staff present at different shops we all welcoming and gracious. Some of my favorites were Growler USA, Yogurt Time and Pinspiration I will definitely return to these shops for my future needs.\n\nThe award presentation part of the evening was very sweet seeing so many newer Elite members being rewarded for doing their part to keep Yelp a strong community of fun loving people. Also shout out to Monica O. and Ursula W. for getting well deserved props on their off line Yelp activities! Last but not least Thank You High Street for being an awesome host.
