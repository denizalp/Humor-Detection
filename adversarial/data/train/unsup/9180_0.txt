One of my favorite restaurant concepts is now 10 mins from my house! And on my first trip in, they seem significantly less busy than the Old Town location- however I was closer to breakfast time and what I'm sure is a bustling lunch crowd. Fresh juices will run you $5.75 for 16 oz or. $11 for 32 oz. also have 24 oz smoothies for $5.75. While lunch is still my favorite meal here- normal go-tos are the teriyaki chicken protein bowl ($10) and chicken and kale sandwich ($9).. but bfast did not disappoint. I opted for the sprouted grain bagel sandwich which is served with your choice of meat and egg choice- I went for bacon and egg whites. It's served with an avocado pesto spread and provolone ($7). I would definitely order it again! Also look forward to trying their avocado toast ($5) and cold brew.
