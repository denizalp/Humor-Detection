I'm going to give them a 3.5 mostly because of the area they are in.. I wouldn't say it's in the ghetto but it's not the nicest of neighborhoods.. \n\nAny who.. I got my hurrrr did here and I would say it came out great especially for the value.. I got a cut, ombre & style all for only $85 + tip! I have long hair so this is a steal compared to most other places. I dyed my hair black a couple months ago so we couldn't get it to lift to a really blonde color without damaging it but that's fine because I was very satisfied with the end results~ \n\nThe salon, itself, is very cute and girly with hot pink and black everywhere.. But you can definitely tell that it does have some age to it.. \n\nHOT TIP: Daphne is the hair stylist who did my hair and I do recommend her if you need to get an ombre done ;]]]
