There must be something wrong with me...\n\nSo many people love this place, rave about it and become die-hard fans of it.  But I was not one bit impressed.\n\nThere must be something wrong with me...\n\nThere are so many 5-star reviews; so many fellow Yelpers claim that this is the best buffet in Vegas.  But what I experienced was really an average, mediocre, 3-star Vegas buffet.\n\nIs there something wrong with me, or is it true that the quality of the food has gone downhill lately as many of my Yelp friends have observed?\n\nThe first impression was bad.  On a Monday afternoon during the slowest week of the year in Las Vegas (12\/15\/14) there was a ridiculous 20-minute wait for a table.  An entire section of empty tables was not being used and vacated tables were cleared and reset very slowly.  To make things worse, the hostesses were really slow in seating people.  We were eventually led to a table that had been vacant for at least 10 minutes.\n\nThis is inefficiency at its worst.  Maybe the management team should visit some Chinese dim sum restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley to observe and learn how tables can be reset really efficiently and customers seated very quickly.\n\nThe second impression was bad.  The food was, for the most part, a disappointment.  (Maybe I went in with sky high expectations after reading so many raving reviews.)\n\nTo be fair, there were some items that were very good.  The jalapeño creamed corn was excellent and was a bomb side dish.  The sautéed finger potatoes were also excellent.  Roast beef was tender and flavorful.  The lettuce wedge salad with ranch and bacon was fresh and tasty. The several dessert items that I tried - such as the pineapple carrot cake and white chocolate mousse - were both creative and delicious.\n\nBut some items were really bad.\n\nThe fried chicken wings were served in cute little frying baskets which was a nice concept of presentation.  But they were salty - salty like they had been marinated in brine.  The meat was also tough and chewy - the wings were really big, which meant that they were from some tough old chicken.\n\nThe shrimp cocktail looked pretty and cute in a shot glass - another +1 for presentation.  The cocktail sauce was also very tasty.  I grabbed 3 servings (yes, 3!) and the first 2 tasted ok.  But the third serving had a bad fishy taste and smell that I could not stand.    \n\nThe Asian food items were very nicely presented in tiny woks or traditional Chinese carryout boxes.  But the quality was terrible.  The fried udon was so salty that I could not finish it.  The congee was salty and flavorless.  The so-called \"sushi\" was borderline disgusting.\n\nThe breakfast sausage was tough like beef jerky and overly salty.   The mac and cheese was, you guessed it right, overly salty and the pasta was so overcooked that it was way too tender.\n\nIf this buffet were from a second-tier hotel\/casino in Vegas, it's probably acceptable and might even be considered good.  But it definitely does not live up to the expectations of a top-tier name like the Cosmopolitan.
