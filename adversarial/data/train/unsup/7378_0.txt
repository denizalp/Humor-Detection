This place looks really nice, has a lot of nice reviews. I had a gel manicure. I get gel manicures all the time at another place. But they were full. The quality difference is astounding. They didn't leave my nails in the light long enough and they barely did any coats. In this case I believe my nails didn't last long enough because the process wasn't done the way it is supposed to. Usually I can get my gel nails to last 6+ weeks and these barely made it a week. What a joke. Go somewhere where they do it correctly.
