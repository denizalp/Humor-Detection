Over half of my nails were chipped by the morning and I was just there the evening before. They did a manicure\/ pedicure in an hour total. The services were extremely rushed and not thorough, not to mention, obviously the polish application was very poorly done. With the vinylux polish used on me, you are not supposed to apply a base coat first, and they did. Also, you are supposed to use the vinylux top coat not a normal top coat. I'm sure this contributed to why all of my nails have now chipped, not even a day later. I even asked about the top coat and they said \"this works better\". I use those polishes on myself regularly and they last for days with no chipping. The decor was nice and the ros√© was tasty, but I will not be referring anyone there nor will I go back myself. Also, the music selection was very strange, but that wouldn't have been a deal breaker if the rest of the experience had been better. (In addition, just trying to make an appt to get in there was a couple week process. They answered their phone once in the 8 times I called, offered a text option, so I opted for that route and it still was a delayed response time)
