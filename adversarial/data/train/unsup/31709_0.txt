I will never go back to this place save your money .  They try to label themselves as authentic Filipino food and they are not at all in my opinion.The servings were puny and did not taste very good. We were advised at the beginning by the server that the entrees were meant to be shared, but they arrived in sizes not nearly enough to satisfy a single person.\nThe restaurant was also not well maintained and the washroom was dirty and smelled very bad. There was a pungent stink of urine as I went down the stairs towards their bathroom and that smell really just registered in me.\nWhen the dessert plate came which we were so excited to try the ube leche flan , we were so disappointed as the plate the server has left has hair on it. When we called the server back she said I don't know who's hair is that and took the plate and replaced it and not offering anything else.  I've been to much better restaurants and only paid half the price.
