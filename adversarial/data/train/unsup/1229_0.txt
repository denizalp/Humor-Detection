Holy sh**t...STAY AWAY! OMG this is insane. Dilapidated old building. Broken windows on empty building on it's \"car lot\"... Dirty, stinky car! Yuck. \nWe are locals and I didn't even know that 1. This place existed. \n2. They offer locals a discount... That they don't TELL you about... I only got it because I heard another guy say, \"I get a discount for being a local? Cool. Yes sir!\" I turned and said... HEY and she \"gave\" it to me. They use high pressure tactics like a car dealership to sell you on insurance and auto gas fill. Totally ridiculous. I found them on orbitz God only knows what junky place priceline would have chosen for me!!! \n\nMy junky little rental was given to me DIRTY INSIDE & OUT! He said, oh I'm sorry our car wash is broken, apparently so is their vacuum. First thing I did was get an air freshener! WOW. It didn't smell like smoke. But it did smell like a musty old closet in a 1930's basement apartment...that someone DIED in...and was found MUMMIFIED. \n\nDid I paint a picture? I hope so. If you decide to still rent here. I wish you the best. \n\nThe only positive about renting this car... I paid $130 for 1 week rental. \n\nGOOD LUCK!!! \nThe best thing that could happen to this car lot... Is a FIRE.
