After recently having knee surgery, a friend recommended Spooner's for the physical therapy I have to have.  Torrey, Nick, and Sarge have been outstanding in putting together a program for me.  The exercises are challenging and varied without too many repetitions. The PT's are hands on, and I always appreciate icing at the end. I am constantly reevaluated, and the program is tweaked to meet my changing needs.  I have seen improvement in my range of motion, strength, balance, and flexibility in a short time. The best part is that it's always fun to go there.
