It's dirty, it's grimy, it's loud, there's no draft beer, but damn do I love visiting EBs from time to time. A place like this is a special part of the community and I'd wager that most neighborhoods like Plaza-Midwood have one. It puts the dive in dive bar and the bar there too. The bar staff is pretty darn alert and they have a decent selection of bottled beers and plenty of liquor too. One of my favorite little inventions is their Shot Wheel of Indecision... if you want to drink but don't know how - bam - you've got an easy answer.\n\nThe jukebox here rocks and like most these days you can search and download tracks from a big central service. There's all the typical country and rock but I can still dig up some weird tangents that raise a few eyebrows from the eclectic crowd. Sorry, but I'm that guy.\n\nThe pool and darts are free and generally well maintained, as is the furniture. The bathrooms are, well, they're bathrooms. After the smoking ban, the EB's team built a big patio on the side of the building for smokers and have come out winning with a great place to hang out outside with a solid view of the uptown skyline.\n\nOn a bar night it can definitely get loud and rowdy. EBs is a place where the atmosphere depends on the patrons, and like most of the venues in Plaza-Midwood it's an exciting and raw place to be!
