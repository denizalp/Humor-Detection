Meh. I don't see what the big deal is here. \n\nA small ramen shop that can seat around 25. It wasn't too busy when we dropped in here last Wednesday.\n\nOkay, the broth was pretty good. But the noodles failed to impress, and the meat was dry and chewy. The egg was cooked proper but failed to wow me. They have weird flavours like bacon and cheese ramen. My friend wanted the pork cartilage ramen but were only informed it was unavailable when trying to order. \n\nThe menu has errors in it. In most, it will say pork x2 which, I guess means 2 pieces of pork, but the Hokkaido ramen, it just says pork. We asked if there is less pork in that one and she said no it's the same, it's just a printing error. Well, you should fix it.\n\nService was good though, quick and pleasant. \n\nThey do sell Asahi Black though, which seems to be running out all over the city haha.
