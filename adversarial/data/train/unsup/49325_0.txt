came here since it has been pretty popular lately, and i ordered the chicken on the rocks as a friends recommendation. got a large size half rice half fries for 2 and it was huge we couldn't even finish it. rice and chicken and sauces were good, originally asked for mild but it was too little so i got the little spicy and it was good. the sauce is pretty intense spicy tho. the fries were ok, kinda cold when i got it. i had a glance of their takeout menu and i think their everyday special is the medium chicken on rocks? not 100% sure tho. it was good but just not as good as i thought since it has been so hyped up lately. i'd come back tho
