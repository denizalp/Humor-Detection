Phenomenal! The wait was long, but it was absolutely worth it! I had the brisket and the pulled pork and both were cooked perfectly and delicious. Get there early to make sure that you get to try all of the different meats because they sell out quickly. Be ready to wait an hour or more, but it was 100% worth it!
