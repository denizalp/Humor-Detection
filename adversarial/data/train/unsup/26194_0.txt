I was in a hurry this morning, so thought I would go thru a drive thru for breakfast and having heard about Kneader's breakfast, I thought I would give it try.  I ordered the mexican omelet and it was delicious....as is all the other food items I have eaten at Kneader's.  It comes with their amazing whole wheat bread which​ is always tasty.  The drive thru girl was charming and sweet and the whole experience was another good one.  Kneaders knows what they are doing....I suggest you try them if you haven't​ already.  #LFTHX
