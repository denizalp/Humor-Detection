I guess Dollar Rent A Car is attempting to replace all their customer reps with machines. I'm standing in line waiting for the next person at the counter to say \"Next!\" but all of a sudden a lady at the side tells me one of these machine kiosk is available so I hop over thinking it'll be faster. Next thing you know, I'm FaceTiming with some random lady in who knows where. At the same time you have to pick up the phone to communicate with them like you're visiting them in prison. Maybe she is in prison. Maybe Dollar Rent A Car is outsourcing the work. \n\nAnyhow, I much prefer the procedure with a human being physically in front of me instead of through a computer screen. It's a hassle to hold on to the phone, pull out your driver license and credit card to show the camera. Make sure you double check your vehicle before driving off. I almost drove off with a Volkswagen that had a huge scratch mark in the back.
