Let me first say I, we love Chinese food!\n\nWe were really hungry tonight so I decided to use Yelp to discover the best Chinese restaurants. Several came up and unfortunately I chose the WRONG one. $23.10 later plus a$3.00 tip I arrive home open my food and boy was I surprised! The Egg Foo Young was just one degree from burnt!!! The picture came out lighter than the actual patties. It was cooked in very old oil. Wish you could smell it... No on 2nd thought; I wouldn't do that to you. The patties are swimming in this old oil. Our order of Vegetable Chop Suey. It too was not good and had that same old old oil smell. So tonight it will be peanut butter for me and my daughter. \n\nThey may have been good at one time but that time has passed. I will never go back. Besides that they have boxes upon boxes all over the place. Think twice before you order from here.\n\nPretty disgusted.
