Good for sportswear, I think they are insanely expensive. I get here rather regularly by the Little Woman. \n Although she buys quite a bit I've found that the clothes don't fit me, ever. \n The sales staff is usually nice, it can be a bit sparse by the shoes, but I'm usually in the sales shoe area, lol.  They have a large selection and I usually find cute sneaks there.\n The try on room is just one decent sized square, ask to be let in.\n Returns are usually easy, and the parking lot is large, even if it's busy from the Dollar Store next door.
