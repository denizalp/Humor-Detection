This place is an institution. If you grew up in Boulder City and moved away, you want to hit the Pit Stop whenever you come home. The service is great. They are the most friendly and some of the most beautiful people you will find. I am not talking about physically beautiful (even though they are), I am talking inner beauty. They are the kind of people that ask how you have been, if you have not been around for awhile.
