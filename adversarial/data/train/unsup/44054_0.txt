I sent my daughter to Microfix to repair her iPhone. Here's her review: Microfix is literally a life saver. I completely shattered my phone, rendering it useless. I brought it in and they fixed the screen and the battery in about 20 minutes, lowered the price lower for me, and gave me free items for my phone. Super nice service and easy to do, totally reccomend!!
