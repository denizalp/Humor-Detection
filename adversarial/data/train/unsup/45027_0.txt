First time here. Normally visit Hanks at Green Valley Ranch when we venture out for steak. I had the ribeye and it was excellent. In fact, it was one of the best I've ever had. My wife had the filet and lobster tail. The filet was good. The lobster tail was dry and without flavor. The sides and appetizers were so-so. The reason I won't be back? The beer selection. Yes, they can name off all the beers they have but they are obviously upset to do so. Second, their beer selection sucks unless you want Budweiser, miller lite, etc, etc. I asked for a porter, which goes great with a steak. No porter. I asked for an IPA. Nope. I asked for an amber ale. Nope. Anyway, their bar manager needs to be fired. I'm surprised that a steak house with such good reviews wouldn't take the time to add a couple quality, craft beers to the menu.
