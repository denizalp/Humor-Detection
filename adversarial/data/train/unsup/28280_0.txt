This place deserves more reviews!!\nStarted my laser treatment in August for 3 body parts, but now I'm down to 1 part because Christine doesn't wanna do them lol...but really she just doesnt wanna charge me something that no longer require more treatment.\nChristine is extremely polite and professional. Very knowledgeable and try her best to answer my million questions. I talk to her like I'm talking to a friend! \nShe educate me about my treatment, from showing me the types of laser beam to different wavelengths that suitable for each body parts. \nI plan to start another part of my body with her! \nThis is my first online review and I give it to you Christine! You are so amazing you know that?!?
