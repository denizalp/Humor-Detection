What is up with this place?? Smith's quality with Whole Foods prices? No thanks.  I go here once every 6 months, then immediately realize WHY I  don't go here.\n\nI kinda live in the hood, so I don't find it terribly \"ghetto,\" as some people have said... but it's just not that great and the prices are SO HIGH.\nOn the plus side, the cashiers are usually friendly.
