Omg... The chicken sandwich. Sometimes with avocado, sometimes without. I can't comment on anything else because that's all I ever had. But once you taste the brioche bread, you are done looking at the menu again. \nSuper friendly service. You can preorder over the phone so the food is ready when you get there. Great if you need to go back to work quickly. Wish they were open at the beginning of the week though.
