This was our first night in the Cleveland area on June 28, 2017. We thought we would try a local eatery and picked one that served BBQ. Always fun to compare our pallet for BBQ with that which has treated us well in the KC area. So off we went at 6pm. But when we arrived, it was closed with a sign that said sold out. Good news, bad news. So we opted for another local, Melt.\n\nWe arrived around 6:30 and were seated quickly. Drinks ordered and arrived promptly too. But what to eat since everything on the menu was different. Almost went for the Monte Christo. Should have gone for the Monte Christo, but opted for the 1\/2 Mighty Macaroni with slaw as the side. The Yelp pictures of the sandwich looked so good and creamy as does they menu online. My spouse opted for the 1\/2 Mushroom Melt and kettle chips. Liked the holiday related decor and the noise level enabled us to talk to each other very easily.\n\nSandwiches arrived in a reasonable amount of time but mine didn't look anything like the picture on their menu or in my head. The mac n cheese was fried, but it was just a block of mac and not the ozzing cheese anticipated. Mine tasted ok, but very dry. On the other hand, my wife's mushroom melt was very good, so a 50% hit. Took one bit of the slaw, and my mouth was burning. Never had very spicy slaw. Also wasn't warned that it would be spicy, so maybe this is the norm in this part of the country. On the other hand, my wife's chips were very good. \n\nOverall, my meal wasn't what was expected, therefore the resulting rating. My wife's was very good, therefore the mixed review. On to another local eatery tonight, but won't go back to a Melt when in the part of the country.
