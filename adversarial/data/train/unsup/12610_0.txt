Glad to see this place up for sale. I guess the rude and condescending nature of the staff didn't go over well in the neighbourhood. Good riddance Huntsman Tavern!  Let this be a lesson on how not to treat your customers like garbage!  Looking forward to the change.\n\nUpdate: the windows are boarded up. Ding dong the witch is dead!
