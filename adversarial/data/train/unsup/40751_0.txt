Absolutely among the best bagels I've ever had- as others have noted, a nice combination of Montreal and NY style. Crispy, dense, moist on the inside, AND they are not remotely stingy with the excellent cream cheese. Go simple: Plain, sesame or poppy with plain cream cheese, you'll thank me. An absolute treasure.
