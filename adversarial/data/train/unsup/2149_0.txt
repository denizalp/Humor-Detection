Maybe I went on an off day- or ordered the wrong thing but my vermicelli with BBQ pork, vegetables, and egg roll were just ok. The BBQ pork and egg roll had some good flavor but the noodles and vegetables were lack luster. Service was fine for a typical hole in the wall place. My sister and her husband love it here so I'll definitely give it a try and order something different next time.
