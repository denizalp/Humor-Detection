So to start with the good: The waitress was totally friendly, helpful, funny, attentive without hovering or pushing, gave good suggestions, seemed like a nice person. \n\nThe room is pretty and white without feeling cold, glowy and not overbright, a nice place to spend time, spotless downstairs bathrooms, nice layout, small but not crowded, well done. \n\nThe sauces were really tasty. The wine list is thoughtful, I had an inexpensive biodynamic red that I really enjoyed. \n\nUnfortunately, it's a meatball restaurant, and if you're going to hang your hat on a potentially gimmicky single food item you had better make the best gosh darn meatballs in the land. And these are definitely not that. Every grandma ever makes better meatballs than these. Three small mealy dry meatballs for 7$ is just a bummer. \n\nI ordered the classic beef meatballs with a side of linguini in spicy roast tomato sauce. I thought these would be tasty together, but they were served in separate small dishes so it was tough to make that happen. Sacrificing basic dinner deliciousness logic to a food trend concept makes me so sad. \n\nSo anyway. I ended up with all this sauce, which was tasty, leftover in these two different bowls. So I ordered some bread. My waitress, to her credit, flinched a little when she told me the bread would be $3. I ordered it anyway, bc I'm a sucker for punishment? Or because I assumed that at $3 this was going to be some delicious fresh hot homemade bread. Bread that would turn the meal and the night and possibly my whole life around. But alas no. A stale bun the likes of which you can purchase in bulk at Costo was served warmed up, but not warm enough to take the fridge cold out of the center. Serious mega so much bummer.  Good thing the company was lovely =)
