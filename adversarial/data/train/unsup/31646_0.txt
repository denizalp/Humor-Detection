I loved their fruit tea the second I saw their poster, I told myself I must try it. \n\nThe aroma inside was amazing. I love the fresh baked bread smell.\n\nThe decor was so pretty. I enjoyed every area that you can be in that store. I loved how they had sofas and high top stools. The plant wall behind the high top stools made the place look very cozy and upscale.\n\nWhen the beverage was severed it looked exactly just like  poster. They had watermelon, orange, lime, blueberry, passionfruit. I just wished I had asked for it to be either 1\/2sugar or no sugar. \n\nI can't wait to go back and try something new!
