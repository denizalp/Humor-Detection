Came here after shopping around in the area and visiting a Best Buy and Audio Express, for a double din in dash stereo. Audio express quoted me up to $1,500 when I called them out on their marked up pricing and you can tell they must get a commission since the guy seemed to be really wanting the sale bad, which didn't help at all.  \n\nSun Valley was great, I told them exactly what I was looking for and he immediately recommended what I needed, gave me a clear number for number fair quote, no pushy sales no smoke and mirrors, and let me walk out of there without feeling like I needed to make a decision right away. I called him later that afternoon, he ordered some parts he needed with a small deposit and I had my install a few days later all for almost half of Audio Express quote. I'll be sure to be back for any work in the future....
