LOVE THIS PLACE! Everything about this place is so quirky and aesthetic. When we arrived, there was a ton of college students (well at least one person per table), the boyfriend and I ended up sitting in their Volks Wagon tent which is adorable btw. We ordered their honey toast, and golly! It was AMAZING. Just thinking about it makes me want to visit again, lol. Great place, would love to visit here again, SOON.
