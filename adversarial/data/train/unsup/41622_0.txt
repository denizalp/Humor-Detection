I regularly go to In Touch Wellness for massages with Nick Brown. He's just excellent at what he does--very responsive to my aches and pains and so forth and regularly changing things up with different techniques that just always seem to make each massage better than the last. Admittedly, I used to just go wherever a Groupon might take me when I'd randomly treat myself to a massage, but after working with Nick, I committed to regular massages which are fairly priced at In Touch. It's one of the best investments I make in myself and my well-being. Great location, super nice office staff, extremely convenient. i can't say enough good things about In Touch and Nick Brown in particular!
