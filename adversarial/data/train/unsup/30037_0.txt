The staff and therapists at Keith Kleven Institute of Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation are professional, compassionate, friendly, punctual, and helpful. My every experience with them, from intake to evaluation to the physical therapy and rehabilitation processes has been comprehensive, effective, and nothing short of spectacular.  The therapy sessions I have received during the course of my treatment have always aided in reducing my pain levels and furthering the healing process. Everyone at the office from staff to therapists really take special time and attention to ensure that they are providing the best care that is right for your specific issues.  My entire experience with the Keith Kleven Institute has been nothing but positive.  They are truly exceptional and the best physical therapy providers in all of Las Vegas.
