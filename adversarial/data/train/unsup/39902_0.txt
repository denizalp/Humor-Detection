Horrible horrible mush for food - food tastes like they took it out from a can and sat on it for few hours and then served it.  Chips are small cracked and stale - like the ones remaining at the bottom of the large pack you buy and then the bottom remains for few months.  Salsa is water mush.  Dishes are horrible.  Avoid at all cost unless you are dying
