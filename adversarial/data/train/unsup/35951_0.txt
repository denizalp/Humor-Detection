I've been coming to Mankind for well over a year now to get my haircuts for the simple reason that I love the unwavering attention to detail that has remained consistent throughout all my visits.  The staff here is very pleasant, and you will even become acquainted with the owner's pup that loves to wander around the shop keeping everyone company!  The place is always very clean, and there is chilled water for those waiting for their appointments. \n\nFrom the moment I step foot in Mankind, I feel comfortable and welcome.  I've been getting my haircuts here for over a year from Ariam, and she is truly a master.  Really looking forward to returning for my next cut, I always look my best after leaving here!
