I travel to the airport frequently for work. I also have a TON of luggage - equipment we use for presentations, laptops, white boards, heavy and odd shaped luggage. In the past I used those blue shuttles, but they were inconsistent and sometimes would have too many other passengers and not enough room for my luggage, on the way to and from the airport, which has caused me to lose flights, so...\n\nI asked around about private transportation, and a friend recommended AZ Elite. I wish I'd known about them sooner. He picks me up right on time, every time. He loads the luggage, and then makes sure he unloads it to the outside at the check-in, or to a porter, if I request it. He makes leaving for the airport a million times less stressful than it used to be.\n\nWhen I come home - if the flight is early, if the flight is late - he's always at the baggage carousel waiting. He loads up all of the baggage so I don't have to haul it out to the curb, which is one of the best parts of this service. I'm usually tired and stressed, but the calm of home that used to wash over me once I got to my house, now washes over me once I, and my stuff, are loaded into the car.\n\nBeing met at the baggage claim by someone who is going to take care of everything, it's the best welcome home I can ask for. This is, without a doubt, the best way to travel, at least while I'm on the ground.
