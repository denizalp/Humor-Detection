FRIED GREEN TOMATO HEAVEN.\n\nI seriously love this place. I've gone three times now, and every time it just gets better. I don't know how, but they continually outdo themselves. \n\nIn terms of location & decor, I prefer SouthPark to Ballantyne, although both are nice and both are delicious.\n\nI've only been for brunch, but it's the best brunch food I've ever had. A couple of stand-out meals:\n\nSmores French Toast if you need an incredible sugar rush & incredible gourmet french toast.\n\nLemon Poppyseed Waffle--not too sweet. It's just perfect. Fresh fruit on the side perfectly compliments.\n\nBiscuits and gravy--the best gravy I've ever had on a Southern biscuit. Period.\n\nFried green tomatoes--you can see from the first sentence how I feel about them. I'm in love.\n\nSeriously. If you want a nice brunch, go to Terrace. Just remember that there's no alcohol before noon on Sundays :)
