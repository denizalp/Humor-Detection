This place has its interesting idea - according to the waitresses, they make breakfast food using their own vegetables that they grow in the back yard. As much as I would like to believe in it, I was a little skeptical about that statement. Cuz that would have required a giant farm to support vegetables EVERYDAY!\n\nAnyways, this place is very busy, and the lines are always very long. I tried two different options on their menu and I think I like the shipwreck the best. I would highly recommend that. Other options were ok. It is a bit pricey compare to other brunch places in Cleveland but the portion size was pretty big too, so I guess it is a fair price!
