A great bar! Loved the vibe of the place and the drinks menu blew me away! I tried to pick a suitable beer for my craft beer loving husband and ended up asking the barman for a recommendation and he chose something that my husband loved! I tried a few different cocktails they had created and they were all amazing and not too pricey! We didn't try the food but it all looks and sounds great. We hope to have dinner there but barwise the guys behind it know what they're doing and can recommend and or make you something amazing!
