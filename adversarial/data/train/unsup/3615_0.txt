Always have fun at this club whether it's Diplo playing or some conference event. The layout and vibe are pretty solid. The service is pretty good. They have an outdoor area with a view of the pool which is beautiful at night. \n\nThe lines are long but that's a good thing because you know it's popular...and I can see why.\n\nIt's what you'd expect at such a nice hotel like Encore.
