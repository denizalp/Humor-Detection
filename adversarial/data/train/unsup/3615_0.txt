My sister who is a fellow Yelper in Cleveland loves with this restaurant! It was perfect for family dinner! We started with the hummus appetizer. The Hummus was super smooth and have a nice garlic flavor to it, came with cucumbers, celery, and pita chips.  I had the Panzarella salad and a bowl of the tomato bisque with grilled cheese croutons! Yes you read that correctly, grilled cheese croutons! Little bite size GC, they were the perfect touch to the tomato bisque. The Panzarella was a great salad with: fresh arugula, onion, cucs, tomato, capers, and thinly sliced parm. I loved both of my choices! Mom had the veggie sandwich with the artichoke risotto cakes. The cakes, which I tried, were unbelievably good! I'm not an artichoke fan but in this preparation, it was unavoidable! My sister had the kale with salmon salad and her hubby had the bisque and a chicken quesadilla. He also loved the bisque and said it was one of their popular items! \n\nSomething AMAZING about T6 is that, they have PLENTY of GF and GFA items to choose from. This is awesome for people with those allergens or food choices! My sister has a dairy allergy and we were BEYOND pleased to find out their desserts included a vegan chocolate cupcake with cherry butter cream frosting and a balsamic glaze. It was so tasty, the cake was moist and super fresh! \n\nCannot wait to come back during the Christmas season and then in the summer!
