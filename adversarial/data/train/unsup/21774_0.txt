Taza is a refreshing and healthy Mediterranean\/Middle Eastern restaurant in the heart of the Warehouse District. In a sea of sports bars, Taza is a welcome escape.\n\nI stopped here recently for a quick bite with Yelper Jane F. I had the green tea and the salad with chicken shawarma. Was I totally head-over-heels? Not necessarily, but the food was exactly the lightweight lunch I was hoping for, and i'd be back. The salad was super fresh and the service was fairly quick. Our server was very attentive, to the point where she even offered to take the straw wrapper I was nervously playing with (nervous habit)!\n\nI think Taza is always hoppin'. I've actually never seen it empty. If you're a vegetarian or vegan, I think you'll also be over the moon. The menu is healthy and looks very accommodating to all dietary restrictions, which is super hard to come by in Cleveland. I will agree with the others-- it can be pricey, but hey, you're in the heart of the city. They also have a great outdoor patio, you know, just in case its in the 70s in the middle of November ;)
