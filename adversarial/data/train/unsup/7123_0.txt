Wow. Major disappointment.\n\nWe used the free house wine offer, and gave it to my mom.\n\nI ordered the \"crispy\" (deep fried) and \"sticky\" (covered in mozz cheese) balls (I guess they are trying to make the old ladies blush when they read the menu) in diablo hot. ($10) for two. I also ordered a Caesar salad. \n\nMy guy asked the owner (who was our waiter, and parks his lambo on the sidewalk, in front of the place) what dish is their best, especially for first comers. His answer... Chicken Parm.... really? Chicken parm? He got the marsala.\n\nWe ordered calamari for an appetizer. It was not crispy. It was flavorless. Seriously, needed salt and pepper.\n\nMy beef balls came (haha, they are suppose to be \"gourmet). The extra money you spend to have them \"crispy\" and \"sticky\" go to waste. There was no texture to these meat balls. They were pure mush. The sauce was pretty good though, and spicy.\n\nWhen the marsala was delivered, I knew that the veggies on the side were either frozen, or out of a can. The carrots were the circles with the crinkle pattern on them, and the broccoli was just the stems, not the fluffy tops. The marsala sauce was overly sweet.\n\nOverall, Meh. No thanks.
