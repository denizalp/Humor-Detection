I am leaving this practice.  The epitome was when my PA said that he has problems too.  I was stunned and could only respond that well, I am not his doctor!  Crazy.  Between the bureaucracy of the office and now the defensiveness of the PA, it just isn't working.  I tried and tried - longer than I should have to make this work.  I feel as though they are just a money mill.  I loved the idea of a one-stop shop, but they find reasons to make you keep returning on such a frequent basis, anyway.
