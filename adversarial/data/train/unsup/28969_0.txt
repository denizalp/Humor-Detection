I like the fact that you can customize anything that you purchase here. But don't understand why they have a different menu at different places.\n\nIt has happened with me 3 times now. They have a different menu at Pickering and a different one at union station.\n\nOverall I am happy with the taste of the food. Especially because I am a vegetarian and I get to customize the menu as per my needs and choices. \n\nThe veggies wrap is delicious and my favourite coffee and muffin. My kids always go for the junior chicken which they just love and my husband tries different things every time. And he gives a thumbs up to every single thing he has ordered till date.
