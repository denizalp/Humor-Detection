Lots of delicious options with a great space!\n\nI really like this restaurant for many reasons & it's a casual location with really great food. Its open to the casino floor & it has great energy. I've never ordered something I didn't enjoy & as for the decor goes it's surrounded by roses...I love it!\n\nSome of the dishes I recommend are the jidori chicken, chinois salad & all the pasta dishes! I'm a big fan! \n\nThe service is always great!
