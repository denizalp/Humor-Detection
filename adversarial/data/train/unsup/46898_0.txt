Walked in to look at the menu, and spoke with Tommy who suggested I try NexGen on my natural nails. I took his recommendation and was so pleased. He assured me it would only take 30 minutes to do and he delivered a beautiful job in said time frame. Cannot stop looking at how beautiful my nails look, and have been getting so many compliments on them. I've been highly recommending Tommy to anyone who asks. Will definitely be back!
