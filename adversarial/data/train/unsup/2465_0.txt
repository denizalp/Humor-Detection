Atmosphere: \nSo hip. Great lighting. \n\nDishes: \n-Oysters (Appetizer): Classic. Good. Perfect start. \n-Braised Short Ribs of Beef (Appetizer): YUMBERS. The meat is so tender. Risotto was perfectly cooked and tasty, and I don't usually like risotto.\n-Halibut (Entree): Cooked to perfection. Asparagus, mushrooms, and potatoes were salted well. YUM\n-Nutella & Vanilla Bomboloni (Dessert): Basically nutella filled donut holes coated in sugar, with a side of banana gelato. So good, will try to recreate this at home.\n\nDrinks:\n-Billionaire: Absinthe, need I say more\n-Berry Smash (or something like that): If you don't like acid-y drinks, this is for you. \n\ntldr: Every time I go back to Vegas, I'll always have a dinner here.
