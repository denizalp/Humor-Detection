Great place to get your hair did!!\n\nI have been going to David Wallace for over a year now and have been quite impressed w\/his magical hands. I think his prices are very fair and he is pretty precise and \"Type A\" when it comes to looking like a rockstar! Plus, he's very witty and we have great conversations.\n\nLoved the fact that he also uses sulphite-free shampoo\/conditioner for post-color treated hair.\n\nIt's also a good\/reassuring sign when I strike up convo's w\/his other clients and they have long-standing tenure w\/David - that speaks volumes, IMO.\n\n** Text\/call him w\/plenty of notice - he fills quickly!
