We have been here several times and even after moving across town, we come back whenever we get the chance. \n\nWe recently came here for my dad's birthday and had a group of 10. I made a reservation the night before and they had the table ready for us, even when we came 10 minutes before we were told to arrive. \n\nEverything we have tried on their menu has ten delicious, and if you have a big group I recommend ordering a variety of items and sharing. They have a spinning circle in the middle of your table to make passing the food around easy. \n\nThe owners and all of the employees are so kind and helpful. Please add this to your list of go-to chinese restaurants. (they are extremely kid friendly and went above and beyond to make sure the kids were as taken care of as the adults!)
