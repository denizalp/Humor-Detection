WARNING: BEWARE OF THE NUGGETS\n\nWe went there earlier in June. Now I'm not originally from Madison so I don't know if there were previous establishments before that Burger King, but the placing of the drive thru was weird. You have to drive around the shared parking lot to get to the menu and speaker, placed along the fence. \n\nWhen we pulled up to the window, the cashier handed us our drinks...with about two inches of air between the liquid and the lid. Then another employee  told us to move to the curb and they would bring our 2 orders of $1.49 nuggets out to us. I know what it's like in food service, I've been there. You need to prepare more product so you move a car to a spot to keep the drive thru flowing. \n\nSo when we got the nuggets, at least they were hot and fresh. We plowed through one box, no problem. However when we started chowing down on the second, my friend asked me to try one because the flavor was off. Sure enough, she was right. They did not drain them long enough so the grease reabsorbed into the breading. Boy, did I regret doing that favor for her. I kid you not, I almost crapped my pants. Like walking down the sidewalk, stopped dead in my tracks, I almost dropped a big one, right then and there. Thank god, I made it to a bathroom in time. When we called about it, they were very rude, claiming it wasn't their problem. All we did was tell them what happened to help the common folks' protect their pants. Honey, I'd rather pay $1.49 for a decently drained order of nuggets than spend more money on a new pair of undies. So if you want clean underwear, avoid this establishment.
