I've been here twice recently and really want to like this place but just have a hard time finding anything that I really like. I think another Yunnan restaurant has left this one in the dust. I eat and eat hoping my taste buds would find love here but it looks like my taste buds already found love with another Yunnan restaurant and this one just can't compare. \n\nThe lamb hotpot looks great in the photos but when it was brought to our table, I find it sorely disappointing. First, it was smaller that I thought. When we first walked into the restaurant, the lady in the next booth was eating a hotpot and it was huge. Our lamb hotpot was a lot smaller so maybe they were low on lamb today. Second, it had under cooked vegetables and not enough lamb. And I don't know how this is possible with Yunnan cuisine but it lacked flavor besides just being spicy. \n\nThe noodles here are decent but nothing amazing. I would eat this if I was hungry but don't particularly care for it. The Chongqing street noodle was decent but nothing amazing. I've also tried two of their beef noodles from the previous visit, one was the beef hotpot noodle and another beef noodle stew. They were also rather mediocre. \n\nService here is generally friendly and decent. They give you incentive to write them a great yelp review with a meal discount or free soda (as seen on their menu). I do feel somewhat duped when I saw that as I had higher expectations for the food.
