Best food truck around! If I was able to rate two thumb up in addition to 5 stars, I would.  \n\nI tried the California Burger, very tasty; avocado, pickled red onions, pepper jack cheese, chipotle aioli and a sunny side egg to top it all off... If that's not a flavor blast in your mouth I don't know what is. \n\nI invite anyone, whether you have a sophisticated pallet or not, to indulge in the deliciousness that is Aioli Gourmet Burgers.\n\nGreat food,  great staff what else could you ask for?
