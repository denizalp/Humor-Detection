If I could replan my visit to Toronto would have I visited Casa Loma? No. \n\nThe castle itself is beautiful and it was cool to hear about the history. But, it was overcrowded, the trip to the top was not that exciting and the restaurant was wicked overpriced. There have been tons of movies filmed here so that was cool.
