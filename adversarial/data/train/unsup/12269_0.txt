Was at the W last night for a Bachelorette Party.  Clearly, I don't get out much... well, at least not to hoity-toity Scottsdale spots... so I was floored by the ridiculous $16 drinks.  No, thanks! Water, please!  \n\nThe people-watching was topnotch.  The girl prancing around the lounge in her tiny turquoise bikini is still making me laugh... seriously - cover it up.  You are inside and the sun isn't shining!\n\nThe pretty waitresses that are all stuffed into teeny, tiny black dresses were very friendly and happily separated the check into smaller tabs for our large group.  \n\nCertainly, the W is a good place to go and drop tons of money... and do some hilarious people-watching of the Scottsdale crowd... but it really isn't my thing.
