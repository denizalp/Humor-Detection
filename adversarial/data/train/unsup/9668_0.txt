I typically don't write reviews, but this place deserves a raving review. I ordered a gyro and fries, it was a great portion, and the taste was unbelievable. I've had many a gyros, even the ones at the Greek festival weren't this great. Also, the service was very friendly and quick. Do your self a favor and eat at Mighty Gyros.
