DEFINITELY AVOID!!!! WORSE TANNING SALON IN CHAMPAIGN. My wife and I stopped by to see about a membership for her. After a big winter storm, they only plowed one of the two lanes in front of their shop, and the employees decided that it would be smart to park in the single lane, making it impassable. We pulled up, my wife went inside to ask about memberships, I stayed in the car, another customer parked their car right behind us, and ran inside for a tan. We asked the girls to contact the customer so that we could get out, and they just told us that she was in the process of tanning. Trapped between parked cars on their single plowed lane (which should have had the two lanes plowed), we then tried to get around the parked cars, and got stuck. Instead of helping us get out, the lobster-red employees just sat inside and watched. Any responsible manager would have not allowed customers or employees block the front driveway until they plowed the other lane, or unless they stayed in their car in case it had to be moved. \n  After digging, we got out, and went to CLASSIC TAN instead. The price was much better then the tan co., and the girls working the desk had more brains and responsibility.
