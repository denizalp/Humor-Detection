I love cowbell. It's not the healthiest place to eat but it's oh so delicious. As far as starters go, the pretzels with cheese dip are delicious. It doesn't taste like cheap low grade pretzels out of a freezer. They are perfectly crisp yet fluffy inside. The wings are great and they give you a perfect amount for one person. I got the corleon and the mozzarella was fresh as were the veggies. It had the perfect amount of spices. The balsamic drizzle was right amount of sweet. I never save room for dessert but I need to sometime to try their shakes. Friends of mine swear by their burgers and I will certainly be back to try one soon!
