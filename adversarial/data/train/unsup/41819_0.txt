We sat at the bar for lunch. I'm vegan and have other special dietary restrictions. Sad to say that our server wasn't open to any suggestions for me. My husband had a cesar salad with salmon and it was \"just ok\".  The Pinot Grigio was the house choice and no other. The house choice was not good. I opted for water. I tried the sangria and that was tasty but served in a small glass with ice to the brim. We spent $60 just to leave and go eat lunch somewhere else.  Very disappointing lunch experience. Thankfully I was able to eat a delicious lunch elsewhere.
