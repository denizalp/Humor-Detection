Jukebox just opened last night in a neighborhood with a made up name. They call it Hingetown. I refuse to call this area that name. It was a cozy little bar. Most customers were nice. The bar takes recommendations for the jukebox. Customers get a token or two with each drink order to play a song on the box. This might be the only bar in Cleveland that will have Mobb Deep on the jukebox which is reason enough to show up. The draft list is mostly Midwestern and was impressive. Jolly Pumpkin Oro De Calabaza was $6. A back and front patio is coming soon. Brick walls create a nice cavernous bar area. I can imagine drinking here alone and listening to Townes Van Zandt to pass my time.
