When my mom and dad were dating they once ate dinner at my dad's mom's house.  Grandma G. served tomato paste and noodles and called it spaghetti.  Nino's does the same. Not only do they charge you an arm and a leg for it but they even go as far as to charge extra for meatballs or meatsauce!  If you like bland, boring food look no further, Nino's is for you.  Honestly, I can make better spaghetti at home.  Ignore the hype.  Avoid this place at all cost.
