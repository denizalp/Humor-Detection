Went to Vegas and decided to check out this place with my partner and re-live some of the best childhood moments, all over again! \n\nThis place is great with tons of vintage and new pinball machines and classic other arcade video games. What's even better about this place is the wonderful people who work here, I was fortunate to meet Charlotte and her colleagues, they're very friendly and helpful. I love the concept of this museum and wish we had one like this in Toronto. You can easily spend hours getting lost in these awesome games. Perfect for families to spend a few hours and show kids what real video games are!! Will definitely go back when I'm back in Vegas!!
