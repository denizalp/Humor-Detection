I rarely write reviews for salons, but felt compelled for Mai's shop after our visit.\n\nAll the negative reviews below are not for Mai, who purchased the shop from previous owners. Mai is a fantastic owner who really puts in time and effort to make sure that your experience is great.\n\nMy fiancee got eyelash extensions here while we were on vacation and she was extremely pleased. Mai gave her meticulously placed extensions and the finished result looked great. She was also just a really positive, kind person who we enjoyed talking to during the treatment. Although I was not getting the treatment I was able to watch her skillfully apply the lashes and appreciated her positive vibe. The price was right for the quality of treatment- I've seen cheapo eyelash extensions advertised, but Mai took the time to make sure everything was great.\n\nThe store itself is clean and well-kept. We were checked in and out quickly and without hassle. Highly recommend this gem!
