Not really a fan of this massive mall. Nearly every typical mall chain store you've heard of is here, but some cool extras are thrown in: Dicks Sporting Goods, Potato Corner (actually a kiosk just off the food court), and H&M. The surrounding plazas are full of still more chain stores, should your shopping needs not be met here.\n\nI do not recommend this mall if you are looking for anything specific. Out of the four or five sports and shoe stores, I was unable to find wide-fit mens tennis shoes. Footlocker doesn't carry tennis shoes at all, Dicks doesn't carry wide, Famous Footwear and the others have nonexistent customer service and\/or clueless employees who were genuinely surprised by the concept of shoes made specifically for tennis, etc. I experienced similar frustration when hunting for a strapless bra. Ill spare you the repetitive details.\n\nThere are plenty of shops to browse if you have time to kill. Bathrooms off of the food court are the cleanest ones here. Layout is nearly identical to that at Meadows Mall, on the other side of town. The baseball cap store is in literally the exact same spot. Spooky!
