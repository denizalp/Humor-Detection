I have driven by this place quite a bit and never realized it. Tucked between two popular clothing boutiques, Tandul adds something special to Tremont.\n\nThis is one of the first Indian restaurants in CLE I've ever felt was truly authentic. In a hard decision, I ordered the chicken tikka masala, while my friend opted for the vegetarian paneer tikka. I was delightfully surprised by how hearty the portions were, and thought it was unique that the paneer tikka came on a skillet (i've always seen it on a skewer). Our food was all around colorful, flavorful and served with generous portions of white rice. I also recommend getting a side of their butter naan to round your meal out!\n\nThe front half of the restaurant is a bit dark. While there's some ambient twinkle lighting, the nob could be turned up a bit more to be well lit. Otherwise, the restaurant is comfortable with hybrid couch\/chair tables and high tops. There also seems to be plentiful street parking near their block, especially in the evening when the surrounding boutiques are closed. Will definitely be coming back here again...and I loved how on our way out, the manager gave us a $10 coupon off our next delivery order! Nice work, Tandul.
