i walked in this store with the objective of reviewing it first before the objective of buying anything.  i bought something.  nice work natures footwear.\n\ni bought a pair of those dumb looking sorel boots.  dumb but warm. dumb but waterproof.  dumb but, well, dumb.  sorry thats all i got.\n\nthey have a handful of brands from which to choose and two women you can choose to help you.  i preferred the one who started to help me and could have done without the one who took over.  luckily my wife talked her up while i shut up, ignored her and paid attention to my boot shopping experience.   i did overhear her staying stuff like most people usually are fine with an insole and dont really need the podiatrist prescribed and created orthotics.  oh.  thanks doctor-who-decided-to-work-in-a-shoe-store-for-fun.  then she mentioned or rather tried to pat herself on the shoulder by confirming with me whether my podiatrist had told me that of course i should be walking around in slippers and not bare feet at home because it undoes all the work thats been done by the orthotics.   right.  even if that were the truth, try sticking to selling shoes and not giving me your general orthotics diagnosis.  maybe that was her way of trying to pass off one of her mocassin slippers.  no thanks.\n\nanyhow the other lady was quite pleasant and easy to talk to and they do have a bunch of different comfortable looking brands as i said and i picked up those boots for 100 bucks.  it seems like a decent place to go if your focus is comfort first.
