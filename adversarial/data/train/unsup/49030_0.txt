Had an extremely poor customer service experience  with Malia. First she forgot my drink I asked her for it and she ignored me. Then I had to drive back through because she forgot my chips. She didn't order a large drink like I asked and then argued and said I didn't order it correctly.\nShe needs to be retrained & an attitude adjustment
