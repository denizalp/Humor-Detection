Kevin is AMAZING!!! I was visiting my girlfriend here in AZ from California and was in desperate need for a new set of acrylic nails. I saw this salon on yelp, I liked the reviews so I went. We were greeted as soon as we walked through the door (that's a big deal to us) I told them I needed a full set, they said no problem and paired me with Kevin. As I watched him I really appreciated how he took his time making sure each nail was perfect before moving onto the next step. He was really personable, easy to talk to and he has a nice sense of humor. At the end of our experience I had a new set of beautifully manicured nude nails and a new nail technician. Thank you Kevin!!
