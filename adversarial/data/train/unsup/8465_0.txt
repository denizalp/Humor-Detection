I'm sorry but I don't understand how this place has a 4 star rating. Come on yelpers! I really wanted to like this place as it is a 3 minute drive from where I live. I was extremely excited when I found out that there was a sushi place opening up and that I might perhaps have a new sushi place to go to besides the usual sushi spots around the area. Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I were very disappointed. It was a mediocre sushi place; the rolls weren't great and the appetizers weren't anything special (calamari, gyoza, seaweed salad). I came back a few weeks later to give it another shot and was just disappointed once again. The service is definitely excellent and the prices are decent.
