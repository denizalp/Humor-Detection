Great show! We sat in the bottom area and totally worth it. We could see so much detail and it was more amazing seeing these people perform such crazy stunts. Didn't get any food or drinks here cause it's expensive af. Honestly even the nosebleed seats didn't seem all too bad either. While we were waiting for the show this usher was cracking up jokes with everyone. It really helped pass the time. Someone get him a raise haha
