I was so excited for this restaurant to open as I'm a huge fan of fish and chips and I love Gordon Ramsay. However just like I was with Burgr, I was let down with this place. I split a three piece with my friend on a Tuesday night. The chips were good, but unfortunately that's where the praise ends.\n\nThe fish tasted like nothing but butter. The breading was insanely thick and was way too salty. It was extremely greasy and bland. I might as well have just fried a stick of butter and eaten that. I ate one bite and let my friend eat the rest. Completely inedible. It's been several days and I still get mildly sick to my stomach recalling the the food here.
