Tonight's bill was made up of 5 bands. 5 underground METAL bands played here between 5PM and 9:30PM. \n\nYeah, it seemed even stranger than you can imagine. When last I darkened Diesel's doorstep, I caught the sturdy, celebrated UFO in concert. Tonight it was Swashbuckle (tongue-in-cheek thrash\/death with a Pirate image and a drummer dressed as a parrot),  New Jersey's (like Swashbuckle) young power\/prog\/metalcore-ish lions Mutiny Within, curiously whimsical Canuck progressive deathsters Augury, old speed\/thrash\/power dragons Death Angel (positively lacerating), and Swedish melodic death\/metalcore headliners Soilwork (thudly, groovy, as unstoppable as a freight train hijacked by The Green Goblin).\n\nThe crowd was friendly, chatty, no one got hurt in the pit, but like my UFO experience here, I think I would have rather seen this show at The Rex (what goes on there these days?). \n\nIt's too bionic, glass-and-steel swanky, there's not enough room on the floor, and pillars block your view everywhere. \n\nLuckily, we got onto the balcony, and after trying different spots, we got into what we thought was a sort of VIP area (I think the staff just let people sit in the roped off areas since the fans were doing it anyway, and they didn't want trouble) complete with couches and got the best view of a concert I had ever had at any show I've ever attended. We were right above Speed and the boys, and I could see everything, including the mosh pit. Bear in mind that I had to kneel on a leather couch, lean forward over a rail, and wedge myself between my date and you guessed it, another pillar. But I wrapped my arm around the pillar and stuck out my other arm, which made me an interesting sight fer sure, especially when the lights hit me. \n\nThe Phantom Of Diesel they called me. HAHAHAHAHA!!!\n\nThe sound was superb. That does bear mentioning and helps give Diesel a 3. And it does look nice enough on the inside and out, but having a metal or rock show here is just an ill fit in my opinion. When did they start having metal concerts here? I can recall High on Fire playing here fairly recently. \n\nWhat's with the flatscreen TV's? I kept looking over at a \"House\" re-run while Mutiny Within played and a Steeler game while Soilwork was on. Odd. \n\nAnd the Buffys and Dippity Dudes were uh...leery of us metallions as we made our way out after Soilwork's set.  That's always a sweet emotional nectar. You see, the show was held early so that The Saturday night game of Hooker and John could commence at 10 sharp. We can't be depriving those people of their right to be asinine, now can we?
