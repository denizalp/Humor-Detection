Ever since we walked into HTC few years ago, it's been our go to place if wanting\/needing piercings done. \n\nThese guys know their stuff! Staff is very friendly and helpful and are not there to just upsell you items. Remember to bring proper ID, this rule is strictly enforced.\n\nMany family members and I have had piercings done, and this is the only place we trust!\n\nHTC cares about you, provides you excellent customer service, sure it might be busy, but don't worry they will not overlook you or rush you through it. They make you feel like you're more than just a paying customer, they know that you are making a lifetime commitment and want to make sure you are 100% comfortable with your decision and completely educated on the aftercare of your piercing. \n\nIf you are looking for a shop to go to, from ears, nose, lips, belly or whatever make HTC your place to go to!
