Comme Par Hasard (literally \"for as random,\" or \"by chance\") is a cute old home in old downtown Longueuil converted into this very nice and cozy Bistro. It feels like you were invited to a friend's or Grandma's house for dinner, with old traditional chairs and decor, soft lighting, and really friendly service. \n\nThey have a good local biere (beer) menu that has strong beers (7.75% to 9% alcohol) as well as beers on tap and foreign bottles. There is a daily changing chalkboard of specials and favorites.\n\nThe three of us all opted for the same daily special, an Okoberfest special with weiners, sauerkraut, with side spoons of dijon mustard, served with pomme frites and 2 small glasses of beer (biere blanc et rouge). The special ($21.95) included  soup or salad. The soup was a deicious pumpkin cream, and the salad included pumpkin, cheeese, greens and beets. \n\nDessert was a large mix of chocolate pudding and chocolate mouse, but they had many other choices, like pumpkin creme brulee.\n\nPrices were not astronomical and service was very friendly and welcoming. I would recommend this place for friends, romance or business.
