Went to lunch on a Sunday with some girlfriends, and they picked Anzios, found out that the place has been in business for 28 years, I love small local places!  And it looks like fellow Phoenicians love it too!   \n\nI ordered the fettuccine alfredo and added chicken to it, the creamy alfredo sauce has some great flavor, couldn't get enough of it, even used the garlic bread to mopped it up, oh soo yummy! The noodles cooked perfectly and the chicken tender and tasty! The garlic bread was perfectly toasted & soaked up sauce beautifully!  The side salad was crisp & fresh, a perfect little salad.\n\nOur server Gus made sure that we were taking care of, very friendly and helpful!  \n\nI love local places & great service!  I will be back!
