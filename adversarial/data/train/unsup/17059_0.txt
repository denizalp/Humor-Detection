I am always in serious need of some solid comfort food in large portions before leaving Las Vegas, this was the perfect place for me after an entire weekend of excessive drinking! Had to get a really good spicy Bloody Mary with Goose vodka first, it was more than a great pour, very spicy and salty, not to mention strong too, loved the cheese in it! \n\nLooked through the extensive menu, lots of items looked very comforting and appetizing. I had lobster roll, it came with three small lobster rolls, kettle chips and housemade slaw, OhMY, just how amazingly flavorful and delicious they were, definitely one of the best lobster rolls I have ever had! Hubby had a hot dog with skinny fries. He loved the very well seasoned oversized all-beef hot dog, I loved the fries of course. Thought we just ordered some snack food, but the portions were so big! Wish we had time for beer, the selections were huge. \n\nThink I have just found the perfect spot for comfort food and Bloody Marys!
