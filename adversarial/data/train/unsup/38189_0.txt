Great twists on supper club favorites! Saturday evening I had two friends visiting from out of town, and we stopped by the Avenue Club. From my fantastic wedge salad (fantastic flavors) and shareable fish and chips (homemade potato chips that were delicious) to the fried cheese curds and chicken with goat cheese sandwich, we all loved our meals. Their brandy old fashioned was solid, and my hubby enjoyed trying the New York Sour, one of their signature cocktails. The ambiance is a super fun and a little retro. The blondie sundae at the end of the meal was definitely worth it.
