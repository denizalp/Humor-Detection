Ruchi has a tasty vegetarian and vegan lunch buffet (South Indian style) from 11-3 for $9. I sampled a few of their items including a palaak\/spinach dish, rasam, sambar, idli, cabbage curry, and tofu curry. Fresh dosa is made per table, and desserts include payasam and gulab jamun. \n\nOverall the buffet items were pleasing to the palate and satisfied my craving for Indian food without needing any meat. Most of the items today were vegan, with a smattering of vegetarian dishes. My favorites were the dosa, vegetable rice and the cabbage curry. The rice was flavorful, colorful, and had a lot of different vegetables in it. The rice was well cooked and tender. The cabbage curry had a coconut milk base which gave it a slight tropical flair and had a delicate flavor. The dosa was excellent, lightly crisp, with a wonderful potato mixture inside. Most of the dishes had a bold, spicy punch to them. The spinach dish was my least favorite since it was too salty for my tastes.\n\nService was exemplary. The host was friendly, very engaging and warm. They probably have some of the best service that I've encountered at an Indian restaurant.\n\nThe interior is spacious, with a lot of tables. The buffet was nicely presented and well organized. \n\nThe buffet for a weekday (Not sure if the price changes on the weekends or if it offered then) was $9 and the total with tax came out to be slightly under $10. Not bad for a buffet!\n\nI'll come here again for the great service and lovely vegetarian and vegan items.
