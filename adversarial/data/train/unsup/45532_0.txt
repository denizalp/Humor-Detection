Stopped in few times for afternoon lunches and will undoubtedly be back at some point based on its location and the fact its open earlier than most of the other places in the area. They also have a small patio out front and a slightly larger patio in the back, which makes for good beer drinking in nice weather.\n\nThe food has all been pretty good from my experiences. Not necessarily impressive, but satisfying enough with no major issues or complaints. Most things on the menu are in the $10-$15 price range.  \n\nThis weekend I split a cheese pizza and basket of sweet potato fries with a vegetarian friend of mine. The pizza was quite good with a thin crust and they brought olive oil, parmesan cheese and dried chillis to the table to help with making things even better. Sweet potato fries are a good thin cut and crispy rendition, however losing points on being served with a boring plain mayo to dip in (rather than a chipotle mayo or something a bit more interesting as most other places that charge $6 would offer).\nIn a past visit I had the veal sandwich with fries which so far was the most notable thing I've had there, but with a vegetarian in tow last time, there was a moral dilemma of ordering a breaded baby cow sandwich.\n\nThe beer is a bit more expensive that most of the other places in the area ($17 - $21 ranging from a pitcher), but the food has more selection and better quality for other pub type places, so it redeems itself.
