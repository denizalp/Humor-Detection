I drive by this place several days each week, intrigued yes.  One would think with a name of Biscuits that would be a signature dish, wrong!\n\nI arrived around 0900 Sunday, the parking lot about half full.  Seats were placed outside the front door,maybe a sign the food is good if there is a que. Upon my arrival the place was maybe one-third full, you could select your table with ease.\n\nI ordered the biscuits and gravy,egg with cheese, and 2 buttermilk pancakes. The service was pretty quick,food arrived timely. But that is where the good review ends.\n\nThe butter on the pancakes would not melt, little surprise as the pancakes were like room temperature. The eggs were cold,and the biscuit and gravy same. The biscuit was like 2 inches in diameter, pretty small. The plate the meal was served on was room temp at best, maybe that contributed to the cold food and maybe there was a delay in brining my food to me.\n\nBottom line, terrible experience. Who likes a cold breakfast. I WONT be back.\n\nYou gotta be kiddin!!!
