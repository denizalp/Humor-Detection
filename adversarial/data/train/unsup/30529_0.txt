Significant other unit and I just visited for Christmas\/New Years. Loved every minute of the visit since there are so many things to do, see, and eat! There's no equal to a relaxed walk under a realistic blue sky littered with little puffy clouds, while passing high-end stores and boutiques. \n\nThe rooms at the Venetian are suite sized, well appointed, comfortable, and feature gorgeous bathrooms... but if you look carefully you can see some maintenance is in order to spruce them up (bathroom door handle loose, one sink backed up, dent in the wall near the bed, in-room safe wasn't closing, etc.).\n\nThey added The Palazzo since I was last here in '00 and it's enhanced the allure and entertainment options immensely.\n\nWe enjoyed dinner at Dal Toro (Lamborghinis viewable through the glass wall), and breakfasts and lunches at the Canyon Ranch cafe (cheap and yummy! Plus: normal portions). SambaSushi was lively and delicious, if a bit pricey (but what isn't in Vegas, right?) \n\nNew Year's Eve dinner was at Valentinos for a 10:30 pm seating... the rear room was a little blah with a burgundy color scheme...all went well up until near midnight, when our waitress forgot to serve our Moscato D'Asti to go with our dessert--nonetheless a lovely experience.\n\nWill definitely come back here if in the neighborhood.
