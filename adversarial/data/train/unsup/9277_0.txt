We stayed at the Ramada Plaza Hotel  for Labor Day weekend 2015 and had a fabulous time. We were literally in the heart of downtown Toronto. \n\nWalking distance to everything beautiful Toronto offers.\nIf traveling by greyhound buses from NYC, the main terminal is roughly 7 minute or less walking distance from the Ramada.\n\nCheck in is usually at 3PM, we arrived 1 hour early and was able to get in with no hassle. Additionally, we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite. \n\nThe hotel itself was a nice experience. The staff were helpful and filled with energy no matter what time of the day\/night we had a question.\n\nOur room was clean and smelled fresh. It was great space for a party of three and very comfortable.\n\nShould you become exhausted and prefer to just relax in the hotel, definitely explore the restaurant in the lobby.\n\nI would highly recommend to stay here should you decide to choose a relaxing and laid back and affordable environment.
