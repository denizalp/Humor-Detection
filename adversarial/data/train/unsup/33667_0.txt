I'll start this out on a good note...service was wonderful, friendly, attentive & entertaining! The decor is great & upscale. Unfortunately though, the food just was not that great. If this was an average priced sushi place I would give it a 3 star, instead of a 2 star. The prices are far above the typical though, because of its location on the Strip. \n\nIf you're a tourist looking for sushi, I recommend paying for a taxi & taking a trip up Spring Mountain Road to go to the many sushi & Asian restaurants not far from Las Vegas Blvd. If you're a local, there are far too many amazing spots & AYCE sushi joints off the strip for me to ever recommend even trying this place. \n\nFish is bland. Rice was on the dry side. Fish & rice are the main ingredients in sushi, so this place definitely failed me. If you're looking for drinks though...this place does not disappoint, in that aspect.
