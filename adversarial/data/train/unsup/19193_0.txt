I tried to patronize the nail salon since it was on my side of town, NEVER AGAIN!\nI thought that I was the only one in the nail shop because it was fairly new, so since I was only getting a manicure I tried them out! Well......they assigned me to the older lady that worked there and spoke \"BARELY ANY\" English! I asked her to shape my nails gently and nothing more....she filed them off! My nail was shorter than the skin of my nail, I asked for the other girl that was busy doing I don't know what, since the place was empty, she looked at my nail in disbelief saying how sorry she was....I washed my hands off and put my coat on, asked my bill amount...she told me $13.00 not only did that mean I was paying more than the $12.00 they had listed for a manicure...BUT, my manicure was not complete. I didn't hesitate with paying because I was buying the best lesson I could ever had purchased.....NEVER AGAIN!!! I am heading to where I am use to going to get my nails done....and pray that they don't die laughing at me!!!
