Had to come to terms that hotel rooms in Toronto are expensive. So we picked this one because it's modern and has an excellent location. It is connected via PATH to Union Station. It is possible to arrive at Toronto's Pearson Airport, jump on the Union-Pearson Express train, and check into your hotel room without ever getting a drop of rain on you. We had two rooms, both were in excellent condition.
