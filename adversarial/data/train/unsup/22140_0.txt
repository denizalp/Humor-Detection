I used to come here for pan de sal, but since nearby Manila Bakery serves up FANTASTIC, still hot-from-the-oven rolls, I only visit Lee Lee's for Lily's peanut butter, Silver Swan soy sauce, Datu Puti coconut vinegar, cans of coconut milk, and, when I have a taste for halo-halo, some jars of sweet white beans, mung beans, and jackfruit\/langka.  I also like the Philippine mangos and purple yams I find in the produce section.  $0.70 cents for 5 or 6 heads of garlic is pretty sweet, too!\n\nDurian shakes, pho, and a few stir-fried items at the restaurant nearby, now called Pho 68, were, as I recall, delicious, but it has been at least a year since I frequented the place.  Lately, I've been dining at Pho Van, which is next-door to Manila Bakery.\n\nOne complaint, and a major one... why must all Asian supermarkets have that certain smell?  Could it be the storing of rice?  I don't know, but I've yet to walk into one that didn't reek of it.
