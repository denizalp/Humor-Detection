Wish I could give a better review like everyone else. Not sure how I got a photo facial and completed two passes and saw absolutely no results. No coffee like grounds of pealing or any clearing of my skin of which I thought I paid for. \n\nIt's a good thing I didn't fall for her up sell and try to by any additional packages while she completed my photo facial. Mean while my first experience being there I felt like I was being judged depending on what type of person I was. With the questions and judgmental tone if I used products from Nordstrom or Cvs for my face and if had money to afford these type of services just seemed offensive. This wasn't my first photo facial and this woman is one that doesn't make you want to come back for another. Mean while she will remind you she works on tips and she has her lunch box open for you to tip her. \n\nPlease don't ever tell me you work on tips and to tell me to tip you... if you deserve it I would tip you in the first place you would and never should feel you need to tell someone that.\n\nPlease think twice before buying a Groupon to this location or visiting this establishment.
