I have worked on my own cars for years doing basic repair. When a check engine light comes on there is only so much one can do before heading to a shop. This was my first time at this shop as they have just taken over the location.  I found the people and the shop to be very fair and responsive. This is my first response ever on Yelp, I wanted to take the time as I am that pleased with their service.. Tom H.
