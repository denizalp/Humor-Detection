Decent pho, fo' sho'.\n\nThis is a no frills, Vietnamese restaurant that has all your requisite noodle soups and rice plates. We were deliberating between Hoosier Cafe or this place and decided to go on a more adventurous route since we had never eaten here before and it had good reviews on Yelp.\n\nWe browsed through the menu once we were seated and decided on sharing the shredded pork spring rolls. I ordered the #11, beef noodle soup with tofu and vegetables ($6.95) as my main meal and had a bite of the broken rice plate with BBQ pork (#23 I believe, $6.95). After telling our server that we wanted the pork spring rolls he gave us a sour look and asked, \"Have you had them before?\" as if this was an exotic Bizarre Foods delicacy with three heads and eight eyes we were unknowingly getting ourselves into. I replied \"No we haven't\" to which the server remained tight-lipped and didn't feel the need to provide any extra explanation. I'm not sure why there was such consternation? When we got the spring rolls they tasted fine, nothing out of the ordinary! The shredded pork was balanced with fresh crisp greens. There might have been some offal in the rolls but it didn't taste bad or anything. The fish sauce it was served with was a bit too bland for my tastes so I mixed it with some Sriracha and hoisin sauce. \n\nThe pho was a sizable portion of noodles broth, tofu, and vegetables. I liked the broth. It had a bit of an unctuous feel to it, but it didn't detract from the savory taste of the light yet flavorful beef broth. The bit of BBQ pork I tried was good and had a bit of a smoky flavor from grilling.\n\nService is about what you'd expect from a no frills type place. Our order was taken, water and food served, with no additional follow ups. We paid at the counter.\n\nOverall it's not the fanciest place nor did it provide a resonating tone of friendly service to me but it gets the job done for providing hearty flavorful meals that are reasonably priced. \n\nOverall 3.5\/5.
