I was a groupie when it came to their food truck and would run and grab a cup of coffee when I was near their location. I always had a cheerful personality greet me and the coffee was always spot on. So of course I followed them on facebook and was doing my happy wiggle dance once I found out they will have a permanent place to call home. It took me awhile to actually make my way to their location since I live on the far NW part of town and rarely go into their neck of the woods. So one cold rainy day I was doing my errands and I got a wild notion to make that voyage and endulge in some caffeinated happiness. It sucks to look forward to something for so long, drive way out of my way to get that same love I received in the past to be treated like I was a annoyance. It wasn't a busy day at all otherwise I would let it go...no smile, no greeting, just looked right through me like I shouldn't be in here. I asked questions regarding the popcorn for sale...simple question...\"what flavor is this one?\" He gave a nice glare and told me the flavor is on the bottom of the cups and walked away :-\/ ummm it's not very clearly mark I'm sorry to be such a pain in your of so busy day :-\/ I moved out of state now so most likely I'll never come back. Hopefully they go back to the warm greetings I was use to before. Hopefully it was just a bad day and I happened to be on the receiving end. Either way my voyage left me kinda bitter that day.
