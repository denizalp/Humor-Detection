Tryst is definitely one of the prettiest clubs I've ever been in! Not in terms of the people per se, but the actual club itself! As soon as you walk in, you see a beautiful waterfall in the front. Without it, Tryst would look just like any average old club. \n\nMy friends and I weren't in here for very long... maybe about 30 min because we had a deal with our promoter where we had to go to Tryst for a little bit before we went to XS. But I wouldn't have minded staying at Tryst for longer! It's definitely not as crowded or as poppin' as XS but the music was pretty good and I liked the whole atmosphere. Overall, decent Vegas club.
