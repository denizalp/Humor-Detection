Impromptu cheat meal when I was invited to lunch at the end of a conference at the Venetian- and so worth it. I had the Blue Plate Special- two pieces of fried chicken with spiced watermelon and a buttermilk biscuit. I had to add a side of southern style cheese grits, as they're hard to come by on the West Coast. The fried chicken was easily the best I've ever had. The skin was crackle-crisp and deep golden brown, with dark meat so tender that the juices ran when I cut into the meat. The spiced watermelon didn't do much for me but the biscuit was soft and flaky (combined with honey butter- to die for). The grits were a bit chilly and thus stiffer than I would have liked but the creamy flavor was amazing. Overall the fried chicken is worth making 100 more trips for. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm levitating to Yardbird straight off the plane.
