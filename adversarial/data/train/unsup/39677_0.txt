Just stayed here for 3 nights and loved every minute! The hotel was so clean and the rooms were spacious and cozy! Customer Service was awesome, we requested late checkout the day we were leaving and they let us keep our bags in our room until 1pm. I will definitely stay here again. Thanks for an awesome time.
