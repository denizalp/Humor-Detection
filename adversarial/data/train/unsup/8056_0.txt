The Yelp reviews were so positive I figured there was no way this restaurant would be a 'miss'.  My family loves BBQ food, the photos of the restaurant online looked great, and with so many good reviews & accolades from the Vegas Community.  \"#1 BBQ Restaurant in Vegas\" and so forth.  What could go wrong??!!??\n\nThe four of us made reservations for the 4th of July at 5:15PM.  We showed up prior to 5PM and were seated immediately as the place was empty outside of a few customers seated at the bar and two other tables.  All of Town Square was understandably slow due to the holiday.\n\nService was so slow.  SLOW!  Unbearably SLOW!!!  Just to place an initial order glass of wine, deviled eggs, and the meatball appetizer seemed to take forever.  We thought we'd start with the Happy Hour specials then order a large platter combo and take home what we didn't eat.\n\nThe meatballs showed up first but the deviled eggs didn't arrive for another 10 minutes.  We felt as slow as the service was it could possibly take an hour to get our entr√©es.  \n\nThere was no sense of urgency or 'service' from the staff.  I assume the GM was on vacation and had the 'B' Team on duty.  This happens a lot this time of year and while everybody deserves their time off, they should still ensure that customers can be taken care of properly.  if you can't, just close for the night like 'La Bella Napoli' did.\n\nThe deviled eggs are fantastic btw!...  Really Really Good!  Simply the best I've ever had!!!  The bacon wrapped meatballs were too hard, dry, and cold.\n\nLife is too short.  We left in search of another restaurant and ended up in Claim Jumper nearby.  The GM was working and the service was fantastic.
