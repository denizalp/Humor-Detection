Lobster me please.  Lobster me good but please don't steal my wallet once I drift off into a coma.\n\nIt's my favorite crustacean and always more expensive than my Casio watch.  Even when I do find lobster rolls, they are without an abundance of lovely lobster meat. This place gives you a nice heaping of lobster meat at a great price, ~$12.\n\nThe quality of the lobster meat is questionable though, but it's enough for me to eat and not barf.  The lobster rolls come with a bit of coleslaw and potato chips too, so you don't need to order fries unless you really want to soak up some giggle water.  The roll is buttery and delicious by itself.  I'm sure it will be a good enough to devour in-between Fat Tuesday sips.\n\nMy only lobster-y wish is that the lobster mac and cheese had more meat in it.  Am I asking too much?!  How can you give me an awesome lobster roll and then send me a lazy lobster mac and cheese?  Okay, I'm a brat, but I still recommend this place when it comes to snorting anything with lobster in it.
