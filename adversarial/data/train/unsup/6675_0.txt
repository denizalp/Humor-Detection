Went on a Sunday around 9:30, the parking lot was packed but there were still empty tables to be had inside. \nAll the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly.\nWe were waited on quickly. We were both in the mood for a Mexican type breakfast so Doug got the Bandito Scramble and I got the Breakfast Tostada with Chicken. We got our free Banana Nut Muffin which was moist and delicious. We didn't have to wait long for food. Doug loved his, devoured it, I didn't taste it but it looked good. Mine was huge, and was more like a breakfast bowl. They used a Crispy tortilla salad bowl, stuck it to the plate with refried beans and stuffed it full of potatoes, eggs, and chicken. The chicken was rather bland so I wish I would've gotten the carnitas instead, otherwise it was good, but I wouldn't get it again. \nThe menu is huge, so many options, it's hard to decide. I want to go back and try more, plus they have a pet friendly patio!!
