Great old-school Tex-Mex restaurant that has been around for a very long time. I have not been in over 10 years but had a very good meal excellent service Andy Cool vibe from the patrons. Definitely worth checking out not the best place for Mexican food but definitely an interesting old school spot in Old Town Scottsdale. Ryan the bartender is the bomb he will definitely take care of you and make you feel welcome especially with his drinks and pours. Great guy.
