I have been going to Dental Design of Arcadia for years although I have recommended them to many people, I never thought to write a review because at the end of the day, it is the dentist.  Just like many a folk, I do not like the dentist.  There is something just uncomfortable about having someone poke and prod the inside of your mouth. \n\nBut, the cleanings at Dental Design of Arcadia are always so gentle, the most gentle that I have ever had, and I leave questioning why I hate the dentist so much.  There are certainly other doctors that require MUCH more uncomfortable positioning.\n\nThe same person, a cheerful girl named Lindsey, always cleans my teeth.  And every time she greets me like an old friend.  My husband shares a similar report.  It's like the dentist office where everyone knows your name (in a Cheers way, not in a creepy way).\n\nI knew that it was the dentist office for me when I learned about their massaging chairs. YES THEY HAVE CHAIRS THAT MASSAGE YOU.  It's not deep tissue or anything amazing like that, but I do appreciate the sentiment.   Just like I appreciate the water and juice in the waiting room, the pretty pictures broadcasted on monitors above the reclined chairs, and the bowl of hand-sanitizer that you can take on the way out that looks like a ballpoint pen.  I always take  three.  Except last time, because I forgot to take any since I was too busy rustling around in their Halloween candy bowl.\n\nTHANK HEAVENS, FINALLY, I FOUND A DENTIST THAT GIVES OUT HALLOWEEN CANDY INSTEAD OF STICKERS AND SMALL BOUNCY BALLS.\n\nNot only do I feel like they know me at Dental Design of Arcadia, I feel like they *get* me.\nI am looking forward to seeing them soon when I return to get my cavity filled!
