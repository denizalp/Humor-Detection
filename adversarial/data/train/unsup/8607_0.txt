Small and sweet.\n\nNot a lot of tables, not a lot of bar space, no room to dance, no DJ, but a receptionist \/ bouncer \/ ID taker person at the door makes it seem super official and serious. Drinks are good, but expensive, but if you want a break from the casino action or you are just getting started, come to this \"lounge\" that has no lounge singer and doesn't just let anyone in!\nWe came in with about 20 of us and practically took the place over.... just how I like it!\n\nService is good, drinks aren't watered down, and it's swanky inside!\nYELP check in means you get a BOGO cocktail!!\n\nBTW - my sister left her credit card here and when she called later on (after realizing it), they had it ready and waiting for her.
