How can you people call this place a sushi gem?\n\nI came here based on the hit and miss \"great sushi\" reviews, and was sorely disappointed. The price point is correct, don't get me wrong, but here are all the ways they have displeased me:\n\n- Rather rude, surly waitress by the name of Sophie came by but luckily I wasn't stuck with her because Rosa, a sweet girl managed to cheer up the place with her smiles.\n\n- They serve you a beginning appetizer of a soup with tempura flakes (yuck) that looks like miso. I thought it WAS miso soup and drank it, but they do bring you another bowl of REAL miso soup later. Don't be fooled by this soup offering, leave it aside and don't touch it.\n\n- The salad is pretty gross. \n\n- The sashimi I ate was half frozen. I can forgive \"pretty cold\", but I was biting through ice chunks.\n\n- The decoration on the plate was cheesy and kind of gross. I don't want fake plastic flowers on my plate, it must have been collecting dust for days before coming close to my fish... YUCK.\n\n- They didn't give enough rice (kind of stingy).\n\nI would not come back. Granted, they are Japanese (and speak it), but I would not come back here unless I was in the area and starving with no hope of making it to Japango or Yuzu no Hana.\n\nAt the very least, they are better than the crap Chinese-run Japanese restaurants. That gives them an extra star boost.
