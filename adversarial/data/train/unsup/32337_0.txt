Ordered a lunch to go. I had chicken in garlic sauce with an egg roll. The egg roll was just the right amount of fried and very juicy. The chicken was in a sauce that was bright red for some reason. I'm assuming it was from the chili? No matter why it was red, it was delicious. I would eat here again without a doubt. For under $7, I had a filling lunch that didn't upset my stomach. Success!
