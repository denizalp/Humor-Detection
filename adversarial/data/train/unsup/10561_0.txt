Yay, open down the street from home! This place, in my point of view, is like a man's pic-n-save. Not everything is quality, but it sure is affordable. Don't get me wrong, they have great items. Lots of tools and things you don't see in stores. I'm a chick, and it's not all that thrilling. I'd rather be in Target. I can see the attraction for the men folk, so I'm glad we have it. lol.
