If you're looking at this review it means that David's Bridal is the last place you would look for a wedding dress. Those polyester and plastic pearl concoctions are panic attack inducing.\n\nAnne Gregory is the exact opposite of David's Bridal. Gregory's selection of wedding dresses is to die for and they know  exactly what to chose for you. It's an elegant boutique, and the staff are super close -- and not at all snobby.\n\nI told Gregory that I didn't want a princess pom-pom dress, instead preferred something more chic and feminine.  Every dress Gregory chose for me was better than the last. I loved walking out to the row of mirrors, where other women were being fit to their gowns and awed over by family and staff. \n\nGregory understood my budget and helped me find a dress that I absolutely LOVE.\n\nJust know that women do help you try the dresses, so don't wear a thong.
