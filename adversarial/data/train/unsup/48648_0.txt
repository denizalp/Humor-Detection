Full disclosure - I'm a regular, and have been for about 3 years or so.\n\nIt's the best straight-up Greek the Danforth.  Simple and delicious.  No pretension.\n\nNormally I have late-night takeaway, but when I've eaten in the service has been attentive but not overpowering.  Best order: gyro platter.  Food for a crowd and their gyro is juicy, flavourful, and comes with excellent salad and other fixings.  The dolma and spanakopita are all made in-house and remind me of my grandmother's recipes.  Their lamb chops by the piece can't be beat.  Do yourself a favour and order a bottle of old school Molson Dry with your gyro (an in-house thing) - you won't be disappointed.
