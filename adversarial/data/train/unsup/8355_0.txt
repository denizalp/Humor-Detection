This updated review is for the grooming salon. I've been taking my dog to the groomers here since he was a small puppy. I admit I had to go through at least 3 or 4 groomers before I found the one I really liked and I have requested her every single time I've called to make an appt. Her name is Sharon and she's been awesome with my dog. My little guy can be a handful at times as he doesn't like his nails to be clipped or his paws touched but somehow, Sharon manages to get the job done. She gives him the extra attention by giving him belly rubs when I drop him off.  I don't know what I would do if Sharon ever decides to leave Petsmart because finding the right groomer is not easy.
