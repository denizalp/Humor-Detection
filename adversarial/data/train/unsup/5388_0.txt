Kaga is definitely a step up from Ginza. Still run by the same people but with an upgraded menu.\n\nHere you will find fish flew directly from Japan arriving every Tuesdays and Thursdays if you want to have whole fish fresh sashimi.\n\nMenu is covered  most of what you expect from a more traditional Japanese restaurant. They also has Omakase starting from $50.\n\nLunch Special starting from $8.\n\nSushi Set ($10) has a good selection of fish. Quite a good value. The only complaint maybe the rolls were rolled too loosely and falling apart when picked up by chopsticks.\n\nStaff is friendly and attentive. My tea cup was not empty.\n\nGrand Opening 10% off with coupon.
