On my first visit to Phoenix, this restaurant was across from my hotel.  At first I was skeptical: would Greek food in the southwest be any good? Then I told myself I was being unfair to Phoenix and decided to give it a try.  I should have listened to my gut. \n\nFor a restaurant with \"Greek\" in the title, I'm amazed at just how bad the \"Greek\" food was.  I tried both the moussaka and the pastitsio, and both were completely underwhelming.  First of all, both were topped with Italian-style tomato sauce and Parmesan.  No sign of the bechamel that is supposed to be atop the pastitsio (even says it on the menu!).  The \"macaroni\" filling was actually giant pieces of penne, and there was no hint of Greek spice anywhere.  The moussaka was even worse: same Italian sauce and cheese on top, but filled with what appeared to be peelings from zucchini and eggplant, all rather al dente.  I sent it back.  The pita wedges and the hummus on the appetizer plate were very good and the best thing I ate.  \n\nService and management were both quite good; they kept my water filled and offered to bring me something else for free when it became clear I wasn't happy with my food.  I won't be back.
