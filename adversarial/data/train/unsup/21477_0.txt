My goodness this was one of the most awkward experiences I had. Walking in one of the employees is yelling at a customer asking her all loud very sarcastic if she wants masago which I think some people may not know what that is if it's their first time it's smelt egg the little orange eggs that pop in your mouth which I love BTW.young teen age kid acting very rude and I think they need a lot of work in the training department. Luckily for us we didn't get that dude to help us. I ordered the dragon in burrito form and Yuuuucccccckkkkkk!!  the eel still had the bones in it so gross and undercooked. I don't usually bash on food places like this but I think this hype is fake. You can't fool a sushi lover like me trust me I'm a pro in this department although our guy serving us was very polite and everything I think they just need to hire better workers that can make this place shine.
