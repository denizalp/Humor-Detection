Amazing experience. Beautiful wine list. Perfect servers. Food at it's very best. You know what you're getting into when there are no prices in the menu, but totally worth the money. Had the rock crab and a perfectly rare steak. All kinds of extras come to your table as well, pickle tray, amuse bouche, chocolate covered things. Would reccomend.
