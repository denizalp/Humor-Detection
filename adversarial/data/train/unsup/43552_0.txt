Been visiting Bertha's Cafe for almost ten years and it always delivers both for breakfast and lunch.  I would recommend the roast beef and blue cheese sandwich.\n\nBeth also supplied the desserts at my wedding which tells you how great a baker she is - whether the pecan bars, brownies, or caramel desserts, you can't go wrong.
