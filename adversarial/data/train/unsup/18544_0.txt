Times like this I wish I were blind or poorly sighted...this place looks worse than a hole in the wall...smells \"special\" when you walk in and honestly...if city inspectors aren't retardo..this place I think would definately be closed down.  The washroom is absolutely filthy so please pee in a cup if you must go or wear depends when you come....I promise..you will thank me for this advice.  It really made me want to throw-up when I went down there and how unclean it was.  I wish there were portable showers cause I felt so dirty when I came out of there....\n\nAnyhow...onto the review.  As I was saying...if I were blind or poorly sighted...this place would be awesome!  From price to taste to service...it was all pretty bang on.  The portions were large and the food was just delicious.  We had the pork bone soup, dumplings of course and beef  wrapped rolls.  I have to say...when we first walked in...expectations were at 0...and then BOOYA!  food was fantastic.  \n\nAlthough I expected to get food poisoning or see a rat run across the floor and the building to collapse at any moment....none of these things that my wild imagination dreamt up happened.  We left very satisfied and a smile on our face.  \n\nWe will be back...but likely for takeout.  Not sure I can handle the sight of this place...maybe I'm just a snob... :(  I guess I'm more high maintenance than I'm willing to admit....
