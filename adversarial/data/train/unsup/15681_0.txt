I had shopped Home Depot, Lowes, Empire and other local routes. On a whim I called express and they set up a in home estimate. I had forgotten about it because of a medical procedure I had done earlier in the day but on time Robert showed up. He sat in our home and talked with my wife, the reason for the visit. They were able to go through all the types of flooring, and figure out what she liked and didn't like. We went from doing just one room to doing 4 rooms. He spent almost 5 hours as my wife waffled back and forth on what she wanted, and redoing estimates each time. \n\nThe install date was for Monday. he had told us carpet first and then hard materials the next day. There was a little confusion so we had cleaned out the carpeted areas of the breakable things. They showed up to do the hardwood in the living room instead! No big deal just was expecting different. The floor went down well and the installers were great.\n\nThe next day they came I believe the guys name was Juan. He came and did the install on the 3 carpeted rooms. Joking with my wife and doing a fantastic job. About 3 hours in to the install they realized they had messed up measurements in the master closet. He called his boss who called me and alerted me. He said he could put it together with scraps but that wasn't right, and asked if they could come back on Wednesday to finish just the closet. They showed up first thing and finished off the closet with out fail.\n\nThe floors look awesome and are as expected. The price was on par with what I expected to pay and the service was great. I see all the negative reviews, but scheduling and price were easy to do for us. Communication was above what I expected, and all in all it was a great experience. Their ads say they have been in business for over 40 years, being in business so long they have to be doing something right was my thoughts and it worked out.
