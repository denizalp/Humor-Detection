While searching for new carpet we stopped here to check out the choices and prices. Huge showroom. So many choices of flooring. I wish I could have hardwood, too many rules in my condo HOA. :(\nI knew I wanted a medium dark gray carpet. I found the perfect color, great padding, you have to have good padding. And best of all a great price. \nThe Salesman David was great. Did not try to oversell or push anything on us. He came to our place to measure. \nThe carpet was installed 2 weeks later and it is fabulous. George and his team did a fantastic job on the installation.  Professional and neat. \nShould I need flooring again, this is where I will be going.
