Went here with friends was super excited been waiting to try it since they opened got there line not long the staff however didn't seem to know how to keep the flow of people moving they also called your name when the order was ready but they need a microphone because the music was so loud you could barely hear them . The food was not up to par i spent $14 my friends together spent $31 they ordered milkshakes which they said weren't cold all the way through i had cheese fries barely any cheese on them and they had a weird taste i would prefer Wendy's fries to these the burger was okay nothing special the bun was too small for the patty and was soggy they were also out of grape Fanta which is okay but for what I'm paying i expect to get the drink i wanted one of my friends pointed out they had crap WiFi so if you're going to finish uploading a paper go somewhere else all in all i won't be returning not worth the 25 minute drive or the money spent on the food
