I am Thai and I am picky about my Thai food! I've ordered from here a couple of times and the last time I did a couple of months ago, I was disappointed. My food was super bland. Last night we decided to give it another try because I was being lazy. Well they redeemed themselves! It was all yummy! Pad Se Ew, fried rice, egg rolls and spicy basil were all delicious! So happy I can continue to order from here when I'm feeling lazy!
