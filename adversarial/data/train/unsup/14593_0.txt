Messy and low-staffed! Either there is no staff or the ones you barely find are not helpful! \n\nThere are tons of boxes all around the store that looks like some trucks just unloaded them in the middle of the store without any supervising on how the products inside them should be correctly placed! If something is missing on the shelves, you could go through the boxes and find it! A total mess! And you have to spend another good amount of time to find an employee who is responsible to help you! \n\nThere is no variety of products in this Walmart, or if there is, the shelves are empty. \n\nWill never come back to this branch!
