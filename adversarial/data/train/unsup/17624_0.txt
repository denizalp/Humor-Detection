For martinis, there is not a better place in Arizona! Whenever I am in the mood to indulge in pure vodka concoctions, this is where I go. Be careful, two martinis will knock you on your bottom though. My favorite martini is the grapefruit cosmopolitan! It's so fresh, light and the perfect balance of sweet and tart. I always go here with a girlfriend and usually we split the martinis. Who knew you could ever do this!?!\n\nAs if the martinis aren't enough reason to go, the atmosphere is constantly changing. I love going every quarter or so to see what the decor looks like. I think my favorite was the taxi cab theme, but I also really enjoyed the diamond\/crystal theme. While this may sound funny, you have to check out the bathrooms. The lighting is pink and creates a fun vibe. Be careful though, too many martinis and won't be able to figure out how to open the door.\n\nWhen you go here, be prepared to spend a pretty penny on the martinis, but know you won't have better ones in this state...totally worth it!
