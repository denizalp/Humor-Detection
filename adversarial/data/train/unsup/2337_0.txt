The first time I tried Luke's Lobster was in New York and I absolutely loved it! Once I found Luke's on yelp in Vegas I knew I had to go! I was in Vegas for a total of 3 days and I came to Luke's Lobster 2 out of the 3 days.. LOL. The lobster and crab rolls are just soooo good. They are very generous with their meat portions and the meat taste so fresh. This particular location is extremely small, but the quality of the food is still just as good. It is located right in front of the mall entrance. If you're not walking on the strip, I would suggest parking in Macy's lot and walk through the mall to get here! Ugh its so delicious you won't regret it!
