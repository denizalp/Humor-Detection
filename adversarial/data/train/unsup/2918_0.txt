WHAT TO TRY?!\n\nTheir steaks! They offer lunch menu too so if you want a smaller meal for lunch, you can still get a smaller steak for lunch! \n\nFor appetizers we had garlic shrimp and crab cakes. I thought the garlic shrimp was okay. The menu said chilly garlic shrimp but when it came, it wasn't that chilly hot at all? The crab cakes were good and they used real crab meat instead of the cake crab. The only feedback I have for the crab cake is that it was on the slightly overfried side because it was getting a bit hard side when I was eating the fried batter of the crab cake. \n\nI ordered top sirloin steak with seasonal vegetables. The top sirloin for lunch option is 7 oz. the Steak was alright, done to my request and served with some fried onion rings too. Nothing that I wasn't expecting. \n\nThe dessert I ordered the chocolate soufflé. I thought it was made fresh to order but actually it was not. Cut from a bigger soufflé, this soufflé had whip cream in the Center of the soufflé and it was rather hard for the top layer. Soufflé was mediocre at best. \n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nMake reservations if you're coming for lunch, especially on weekdays because this restaurant fills up qguockly with patrons during work hours or holiday time.
