By far the worst Chick-fil-a I've ever been to. We went through the drive thru today and once again our order was messed up. It was $10 worth of food and shouldn't have been that difficult to get right. This was the second time in a month our order has been wrong.  They are even worse than McDonalds.  They may need to consider given their employees literacy tests before hiring them.
