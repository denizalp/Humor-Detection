I have been a customer for a long time, just about everything in my house is from this store bedroom sets, refrigerator, stove and t.v.s and much more! Recently I had a problem with a mattress, will the mattress guard that I also bought from them disintegrated and stain the mattress the store did not want to replace it so I wrote an email and got it replaced. The new mattress did not have any support on one side, so I had to get exchanged was at the store hoping to talk to a manager since I been having so many problems, but wasn't able to talk to a manager which I find so bizarre. So the movers come and do the exchange and commented we heard about all the mattresses you gone through, kind of made me feel uncomfortable because it wasn't my fault. I will have to find a new furniture store, where a manager isn't afraid to speak with a guest about a problem.
