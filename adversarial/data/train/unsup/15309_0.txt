Firstly, I would have given this location 5 stars if the employee who was serving my friend and I was much more enthused in serving us. I know it's 8pm and you want to go home, but at least be a little more personable. I don't think I saw one smile from him! SMILE, IT'S CONTAGIOUS!\n\nIf it wasn't for the ice cream's creativity, I would have been disappointed, but because the ice cream I got to taste was yummy, I was a HAPPY CAMPER.\n\nI was in the mood for a milk shake, so I decided to try the Thai Tea ice cream and make it a shake! Funny story, they had Thai Tea under \"THIGH Tea\"... Okay I'm a nerd, but it was really really good! I'm craving a Thigh tea milkshake as we speak!\n\nMy friend tried their banana and chocolate chip ice cream on a Strong Man Sundae. The ice cream was definitely a Hit! I'm sure my friend enjoyed hers because she couldn't stop raving about how good it was! So KUDOS!!
