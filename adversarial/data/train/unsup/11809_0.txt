I've been to fabulous Freddy's a few times and I'm never satisfied with the job they do. Half of the time the inside of my car doesn't look like they even wiped it down. The VIP wash isn't a VIP wash! I've said something twice to the manager and they go back through but it still doesn't look as good as it should. I bought a book of washes because they were having buy 8 get 3 free ( or something like that) before I even tried them out. I should have done a test run to see if they were good.  They are right around the corner from my house so it's very convenient. It's very frustrating that the people who work there go through the motions of cleaning it but it's not actually getting clean-- Puzzling to me!!!  I always end up coming home to clean it myself.  At least the outside, windows and vacuuming is done. I have to wipe down the inside every time.
