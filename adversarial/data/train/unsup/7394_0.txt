So being a NYer and Jewish i have to give these guys deserving credit. Spoke to the owner, he sold bagels in NY for 20 yrs. true they are softer, less crispy then NY, but he told me they were when he first opened here but the customers complained so he adjusted to local taste. Easy fix, i got it double toasted and it was great. Nice people working here too. Give it a try.
