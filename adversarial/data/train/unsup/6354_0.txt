Jersey Boys was a knock your stilletos off sensation!  Who knew that 's where, \"We wear short shorts....\" came from.  Phenomenal story, music, and actors.  Hands down the best show I have ever seen.  Cody and I loved every minute without even one yawn.  It was amazing how much of the music we recognized without having known it was The Four Seasons, so many wonderful hits.\n\nA must next time your in Vegas!
