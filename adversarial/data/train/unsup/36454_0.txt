This place is too inconsistent. Last time I got the spicy szechuan chicken, the chicken and the pepper were charred. Completely inedible. And I got it to go, which means I drove 8 miles to get it and only saw the condition of the meal later on. I usually tip them when I get to go meal and they don't even bother looking to at it to see in what condition it is.\nTerribly disappointed.
