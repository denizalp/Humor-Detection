This place is easily the best Vaping store in Las Vegas. I wouldn't even consider going to any other shop out there. Clean-cut expert staff members help out with recommendations all the time and everyone is always so nice! I don't feel like I'm in a smoke shop when I go here. I sincerely hope for the growth of this business and look forward to having one in the northern Vegas area. THANK YOU VAPECO!!!
