One time I threw up in my mouth and thought that was the most disgusting taste I ever had, but then I ate at Texas Roadhouse and I can now stand corrected. Thanks goodness we had a gift card to this place, otherwise I would've paid in toilet paper. The atmosphere is pretty baller. I like the HDTVs and the woody feeling that the place has got going on. Oh, and the service is 5 stars. I've never had so many people say hi to me - I felt as popular as my facebook page. And my water was always filled, so I do appreciate that. But when it comes down to the nitty gritty, the food tasted like boo boo. I had the portabello chicken and I ate half of it. It just tasted like I was swallowing fat and grease. The cesear salad side was pretty tasty, but you aren't coming here for a salad. My girlfriend had the sirloin steak, and that was mediocre at best. I didnt think there was enough taste to the meat. I just thought our food was bland. Only go here if you have a colonoscopy scheduled the next morning - I guarantee you'll be clean to go by morning time.
