Blah. ummmm, yeah NO! Not only do they charge PER beverage (which really ignites my jewish irritation meter), but it's located in the Gold Coast, gh-e-tto!  And the name of the place -ping- just -pang- stresses -pong- me out.\n\nWalk in, smell smoke, see a geriatrics ward of mindless gamblers pawing over their social security check. I felt like strapping a cardboard box to my chest, peruse through asking, \"diapers, cigarettes, change for a nickle.\"\n\nThe food was ok, interesting experience needless to say, but they claim to BE THE BEST IN LAS VEGAS! -big bold lettering.  Maybe, it's the only one?!?  Whatev!\n\nService was crappola, our waitress was oober rude, surfin' the crimson wave apparently!\n\nI won't go back.
