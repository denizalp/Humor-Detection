Hostess put in order incorrectly through postmates app so received order incorrectly prepared. While the manager Gabriel admitted it was an error on their end, it would have to be handled on the postmates app and there was nothing they could do. Disappointing. You're the manager. There are things you can do. I hope that is not your response to a disappointed customer dining in.
