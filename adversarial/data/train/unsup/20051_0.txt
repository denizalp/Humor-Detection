I may update this after tomorrow when I go back there to have them repair the damage they did to my dashboard....but they will certainly need to earn it!\n\nHere's the story...\n\nYesterday I called to have them repair the navigation system in my Lexus is350.  Don, the owner was courteous and was able to get me in the same day I called.  \n\nThis place is 30 minutes away from me (and I'm visiting from out of state) so I drove right over and made special arrangements to get a ride since they needed to keep my car for several hours.  \n\nWhen I picked up my car, they charged me $525 for labor...ok....but then $26.25 for MISC....I have no idea what that was for, plus tax too!  I didn't say anything about the extra charge but when I got in my car I was rather annoyed by them not understanding that you return a car the way you found it.  Had to reset the clock, change my radio station from BLARING RAP back to country, turn off the a\/c seat they had on high (I don't use it), and hunt for my phone charger they took out.  Any one or two of those things is no big deal but I believe in a service industry you leave other people's property at least how you found it!\n\nBut here is the REAL issue....they damaged my dashboard with a huge gash and never said a word!  I'll post a picture.\n\nI called them and then turned right around and returned to the store.  Don was very pleasant and said this happens all the time....SO BE AWARE.  He made arrangements for me to come back on Friday to have it repaired. But he made no other concessions. Now I'm having to take another day out of my five day trip here in Phoenix and pay the gas to drive 30 minutes out of my way and back again in order for them to fix the damage they did to my car!!!!\n\nFAIL!!! :(((((((\n\n****UPDATE!!!! I was unable to go back to  Scottsdale for the repair, as it did not fit into my tight schedule.  Another Yelper messaged me to tell me to \"dispute\" the charge on my credit card so I did.  Don contacted me and, as consistent as he had been, he was pleasant and respectful and eager to resolve the issue even though me and my car were now in the Bay Area.  And to his credit, he did everything right...he never got angry, he arranged with Marin Lexus to remove the navigation system again, he arranged for a reputable repairman to travel from Sacramento to Marin to do the repair and he followed-up with me.  \n\nI understand that things can go wrong in every business.  I also very much appreciate when a business owner handles those problems fairly and kindly.  Five star update!\n\nWIN :)))))
