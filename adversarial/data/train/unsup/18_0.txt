The chips and salsa here are dangerous, many an appetite has been dashed upon their craggy contours, so beware matey.  \n\nArrrr.  I'm a pirate.  \n\nBut yeah, the Salty kitchen in general has been good to me.  No complaints anytime that I've eaten here, but it's been too long for me to conjure up any specific details of what was good beside the chips and salsa.\n\nAs for the margaritas, most of the time I'm already liquored up before I get here, so I'm probably not the most reliable judge.  I just remember that the last time I had one on an empty stomach, (and after drinking earlier) it flat out knocked me on my ass. I woke up the next morning on the bathroom floor next to the toilet bowl! haha.   That hasn't happened to me in a long time my friends.  \n\nSo yes, I'll have to try a margarita at lunch sometime when I'm dead sober and report back. \n\nMoving along, it's no secret that I'm a fan of patios, but be careful here, some of the misters will drip drip drip all over the table.  \n\nThe weekend night crowd is your 20s early 30s meat-market set, nothing particularly special here.  Lunch and dinner is more mixed.\n\nTwo years ago, as far as I could tell this place was shit-hot on the weekends.  These days however, it seems that good portion of their business has been siphoned off by the Dos Gringos that opened up last year further down the road at Baseline & Greenfeld.   Could be the Gilbert Gestapo DUI nazis too, the economy, who knows.  \n\nI did spend Cinco de Mayo here in 2007, had an ok time.  Again I haven't been to the Salty on a weekend night for a while, so I'm not the best reference, anyone else want to weigh in?
