Mellow Mushroom.  I was hoping that the decorations inside would be a little more psilocybin-influenced, but what're ya gonna do?  Outside they have what looks like a picture of an extreme close-up of some fungus and it kind of reminds me of Ren & Stimpy, whenever they do those nauseating close-ups of spit on Stimpy's tongue or whatever.\n\nOverall the food and the drinks that they have here are top notch.  Each time, I've had one of their vegetarian pizzas and they're very, very tasty.  \n\nThe only thing that sort of lags about the place, I'd have to say, is the service.  It's odd because inside, there has to be more waiters and waitresses than I've ever seen in one place.  The inside is swimming with them and it's kind of weird when it takes a really long time to get a drink refilled.  They're not anywhere near rude though, everyone here's been really nice.\n\nI really enjoy having this place around to grab a drink or munch on a slice of pizza.  It could use some work but the place is newly opened and I'm sure they'll work out their kinks.\n\nAlso, Mellow Mushroom has a special place in my heart for the weirdest night of people watching I've ever had in my entire fucking life.  First, paramedics wheeled away an old man too drunk for his own good.  A nice-looking fellow then fell asleep at a bus stop minutes later.  The sluttiest gang of scags in all the land then flirted with the firemen who were on the scene that escorted away Drink McToodrunkerson.  Thing is, those firemen weren't stereotypically hot, either.  I think everyone was wearing beer goggles.
