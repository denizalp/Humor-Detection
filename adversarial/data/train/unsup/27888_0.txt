This was such a fun place to go for brunch! 8 different kinds of mimosas and endless small plates?! The service was great and our waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable. The fresh cut salad was refreshing and the menu items were above just the traditional brunch food. We sat on the patio and over looked the pool. I'd definitely recommend the Border Grill to someone looking for a great brunch spot that's willing to adventure the south part of the strip.
