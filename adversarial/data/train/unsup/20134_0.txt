As much as I love Zara, this location has some of the worst employees I have ever encountered. Most of them refuse to assist and never smile or even bother to say hello. You are at work. A company pays you to service a customer. You are not being compensated to tell people \"I can't help you.\" Or give attitude (during Christmas) when you kindly ask to speak to a manager. The store manager needs to re-evaluate his\/her employees.
