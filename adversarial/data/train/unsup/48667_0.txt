Absolutely LOVE this local place for a quick Korean fix when we don't feel like spending the money or time at our usual AYCE Korean BBQ joints.  The 3 meat combos are enough to feed you for 2 meals and everything is always very tasty.  My favorites are the bulgogi, spicy pork, and BBQ chicken.  The staff is also super friendly and you can get all the banchan you want if you eat in.  If you order to go, you only get 2 choices per entr√©e.
