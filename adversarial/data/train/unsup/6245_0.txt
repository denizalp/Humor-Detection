Before I write this review, I have to mention that Paolo D. said this place was \"legiznit\"\n\nI have to say that I agree with most of the Yelpers, this place is pretty awesome.  I'm not going to go on about the food, because everyone has pretty much summed it up.  But one thing that I am surprised that no one has mentioned are the prices.  I had been complaining a lot lately that I couldn't get a decent sandwich without spending over 10 bucks.  This place is different, you can get one for around 6 bucks, which is great.  And if you're afraid like me that you won't get full, get a decent sized salad or soup for another 3ish bucks.  \n\nBut this is a perfect lunch spot on a work day.  The food is legiznit (did I just say that??)  The portions aren't huge where you're going to be in a food coma, and you're not going to spend your life savings.  What a deal huh?
