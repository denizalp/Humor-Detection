Better than last year, but the $15 admission is not justified. The music venues were in the right spots...so was the performance spots. People should have an option to bypass the market area. I hate being forced through a maze of retailers. One suggestion...spread out the food outlets to other parts of the park. They did have one on the other side of the park, but a little variety would be nice.
