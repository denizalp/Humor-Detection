What do you really need to have fun outdoors?  For most of us, a pair of shoes, or sandals, or rags tied around our feet is about the minimum.  Then, okay I'd like some pants, a shirt, a hat.  Okay, water, then some food.  Beer.  Wait.  SCOTCH!  Yeah, now I'm set.  (I already have a dozen fly rods, but that may not be enough...)\n\nFor the rest of the non-minimalists out in the woods and on the streams and scrambling the rocks \"needs\" and \"wants\" blur, and out comes the VISA and the counter is full of gear.  The Backpacker has nearly all the toys.  Climbing gear.  Camping stuff.  White-water vessels. Warm, cool and cold weather clothing for all ages (including some mutt wear).\n\nThe only reason I went here is for the fly-fishing.  They're an Orvis shop, which normally turns my stomach (I'm snobbishly anti-snob) but they're not \"strictly Orvis\" and have a lot of other great stuff, too.  I just needed long-shank hooks, rubber legs and some other very expensive stuff for my long nights at the tying vise.  Thirty bucks and half-a-pocket-full of stuff later I was done.  The girls, though, found the dozens of discounted clothing racks at the far right side of the store, behind camping.  They are now happy, although I hadn't anticipated that second mortgage.\n\nFriendly and unobtrusive staff, artfully displayed merch, and I take comfort in the location: really out in the middle of nowhere.  Can't wait to go back when I really NEED something.
