Whoever is leaving this place 5 star reviews has either been paid or has literally never had good Thai food to compare it to.\n\nThis place was such a mess. Stopped in last night with some friends after work and we wanted to give it a shot, regardless of the mixed reviews. Should have stuck with my gut and gone to a better praised spot. The server was so cold, not a smile, took so long to come ask us what we wanted to drink (2 of us showed up 5 minutes after the first half of the group). Never asked us how the food was, when obviously it was bad - about 3\/4 of what we left was barely touched. They didn't care. Must be used to people not liking things.\n\nEvery single thing was so piping hot and fast that it was painfully obvious it came out of a microwave. It's so sad that people own entire chef kitchens but use some 100 dollar machine to nuke your dishes. \n\nOur eggrolls tasted like the frozen kind from the Smiths across the street. Egg drop soup had that coagulated jelly all through it - 100% cold and reheated multiple times throughout the day (I know my leftovers). The most offensive part was when we asked for some limes to liven up our bland dishes, the server told me \"we don't have limes, only lemons.\"\n\nSo what you're saying is you are a Thai restaurant, but don't have lime? Why? How do you cook these Thai dishes without lime - a staple Thai ingredient? Please stop.\n\nBiggest slap in the face was our $85 bill for 4. Had my wallet feeling like we just had some AYCE sushi. But we didn't, unfortunately.\n\nHonestly there's so many other spots in the area you're willing to drive 3-5 minutes farther in any direction.
