When you are early for your meet up near Little Italy...and you need somewhere to recharge your electronic devices or use the Wifi or just to hang...I would definitely suggest you hop by Pape\/Danforth Library!\n\nI parked myself right by the window on the 2nd level overlooking Pape...and there are electric outlets right there too!!\n\nZzzzz Zzzzzzz\n\nAnd if you are not into chilling or playing with your electronics... there are some cozy armchairs for you to read magazines.... to kill some time!
