Beautiful church, the interior rivals, if not exceeds, Notre Dame in Paris and an added bonus is Celine Dion was married there. The interior is magnificent with high vaulted ceilings, soft blue lighting that accentuates the reverence of the sanctuary and beautiful wood panels,carvings and architecture that adorn the interior simply defy description. It is will worth the entrance fee and my suggestion is you opt for a guided tour of the entire church as I am sure you will be spellbound and over taken by it's solemnity, architectural beauty and shear grandeur.
