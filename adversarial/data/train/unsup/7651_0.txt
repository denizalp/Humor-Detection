For us, this turned out to be a \"come for the seafood, stay for the ______\" situation.  It seemed counter intuitive to come all the way to Tempe for seafood but it sounded good so we came.\n\nThis was a REALLY cool place...somewhere I'd probably really like to be all the time. I don't know what it looks like in the morning but at night, with the lights and trees, it was enchanting. Just picture a warm, balmy evening, sipping on a beer with a date or, really anyone.  The challenge is not to fall in love right then and there.\n\nEveryone was really nice and friendly.  We spotted a few servers (including ours) sitting down with patrons but service didn't suffer.  We were given the space we needed to relax and enjoy ourselves and the food came out in a timely fashion.\n\nThe fresh oysters hit the spot except they didn't detach the muscle holding the oyster to the shell.  We figure that out pretty quickly when we slurped a mouthful of air\/cocktail sauce on our first round, the bivalve itself still stuck to the shell, sans sauce.\n\nThe clam chowder was too thick for my taste, and husband commented too floury.  There was a good amount of clam chunks in it, though.\n\nEscargot...I get this dish everywhere I go.  Unfortunately, the snails that night were gamey.  REALLY gamey.  The sauce was fantastic but I couldn't get on board with the snails.  I also had a few hard pieces (shell?) in the snails, too.  That was a first for me.\n\nThe oysters rockafeller were pretty good but rich.  I recommend just sharing a half a dozen with someone else...not choke down the dozen hubby and I did.  \n\nFinally, the salad. There was nary a sight of seafood on this thing but it was one of the top two dishes we ordered that night. Everything was fresh and the abundance of cheese made it amazing. I felt bad having mocked hubby for ordering this.  I take it back!\n\nAnyway, we're sure to return on our next trip to spring training.  I'm in love!
