Wow, this place is great! They do ice cream and hot food too. There is also a place at the back of the store where you can fill up you water jugs. I got to try out some of the ice cream the first time I went and it was amazing! They have some of their own flavors.But There are a few things that I want to try out next time I stops by.\n\nThey definitely have the mom and pop shop feel. Everyone was nice and went over the menu with us and gave us recommendations for ice cream since it was our first time. I must say, they truly delivery. The captain crunch ice cream was the best!\n\nThere isn't too much parking in front of the shop but there is plenty of parking in the parking lot.\n\nI would recommend people to try this place out. It was really good and they have a variety menu!
