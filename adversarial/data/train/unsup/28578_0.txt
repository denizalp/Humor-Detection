This was my first time here & I have to say, I was impressed!\n\nIve been to several other salons around town & all of them dont seem to care about the quality of their work like this salon does.\n\nI got the deluxe pedicure & WOW! Definitely worth the money! They do the salt scrub, hot stone massage & mask which all-in-all, is a great relaxing experience.\n\nI also got a fill with a design & the lady who did my nails was able to apply a design that I referenced for her. It was a coffin shape with two different designs & she nailed it!\n\nThe only reason why I gave this place 4 stars is because once people started showing up, I felt a little rushed to get my services done.\n\nOther than that, I will be returning!
