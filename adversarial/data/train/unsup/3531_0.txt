Location \nTrendy clothes\nVisual merchandising\n\nCons: \nSome of the clothing were poorly made to justify the cost\nSome of the brands used cheap fabric \nCx service was frigid, unwelcoming and uninformative. \n\nSummary:\nI had just had a haircut, picked up some local bath salts and cupcakes. I saw the store and thought VOC looked urban and fun. I went to browse the store and asked about the store brand (I've never heard of it before), I had asked the woman working to tell me about the store. She looked at me as if I had spoken another language, and then said some short worded sentence. I asked with more clarity, what is the brand about ie. where do you get the clothes from, etc. ANYTHING really. I just wanted to know about the store; because I have never heard of Voc. Seriously she was so quick to judge. Such a rude person. Maybe it was bad timing, but she didn't ask if I needed anything in particular or even say goodbye and thank you when I left. Just overall, when you're running a business, you need to make your customers feel welcomed and like shopping. It was like this blonde woman hated her life.\n\n\nOverall just an unpleasant woman who I hope is not the owner. Such an unpleasant, unenthusiastic experience. My \"Cons\" list may have been more positive if she had told me a bit about the store like I had asked, instead of one worded answers. This is my initial impression of the store, and it just shows that being rude to your customers has a big effect on business.
