I spent about 30 hours getting a sleeve with Ray and sent my friend to him and my mom as well for tattoos . I booked an appt to finish up my sleeve and add to it as well as touch up . He texted me the day of and said we would need to do it earlier and he couldn't do it at the previously scheduled time any longer . So I missed an appt I had with someone else only to get a text from him a half hour before his rescheduled time to say he could no longer do it at that time and he would keep me posted . Then when I got upset he told me to \"relax\" . Crazy . Then he said let's just cancel today . Nothing else , no offer to reschedule or offer me any kind of credit or compensation . After spending thousands of dollars with him , I'm pretty disappointed as well as appalled at his lack of respect for me or my time as well as my patronage . I am quite baffled as to how one can run a business this way . Shame on you Ray
