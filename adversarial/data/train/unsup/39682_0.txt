We finally did go to Vegas and stayed at The Venetian. I wanted to stay in a 5 diamond resort for once. We are expecting so I wanted to pamper my wife a little. \n\nThe good things about the hotel and they are many - \n\nDecor is beautiful and the theme is very nice. It is an all-suite hotel and we got a free upgrade to a strip view room. Although they called it a strip view room, it was not too much of a strip view. We could see the mirage, TI, Trump and the Pallazzo. We had a very good view of the pool of the venetian. The Canal shoppes had one of the best prices I have seen for a lot of stores. We dined at a Canal side restaurant and found the ambience to be fantastic. Valet parking is free for all hotel guests - ofcourse the tip but its luxurious :). \n\nFew of the bad things - \n\nWe wanted to buy a few hotel toileteries and there was not a single place which sold them. You have to order it through housekeeping and it takes about 7 days to arrive at the hotel. \n\nOne of the other stinks  - pun intended - There was no exhaust in the bathroom and the WC section. The mirrors got completely fogged up if even one door to the bath was closed.
