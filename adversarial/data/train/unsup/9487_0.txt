Hey, it's the Ritz, what can I say? This hotel is five stars all the way with the only sad exception of not having a spa. Not that I have all the money in the world to spend on spa services but there's something comforting about knowing that the option is available should I wake up one morning and decide I'm deserving of a signature spa treatment, agreed? Well work brought me to this hotel (as it so often does) and it was a great experience from the moment I arrived. We held several meetings and lunches in their ballroom spaces and the entire staff made sure our events were a success. The spaces themselves are very nice and I love the furniture and decor of the rooms. \n\nLet's talk about their room service menu. Order the pancakes (crepes) for breakfast. Wanna know why? That. Maple. Syrup. WOW! I don't know about you but syrup can really make or break a pancake and the syrup they use elevates the pancakes to another level. In addition to the syrup, they dress the pancakes with fresh berries. Listen, I've never met a berry I didn't like and something about the berries in Canada makes me want to do a little dance. All the fruits are the right size and flavorful, not like the shit we find in the US that's packed with who knows what and can range from the size of my hand to my head. These are LEGIT berries so I recommend you get down with them.\n\nBathroom products...what they placed in my room (purple labeling) I was not about because it was way too fragrant but no need to fret, they are prepared to offer you other brands that may be more to your liking. I opted for Kiehl's products and I was satisfied. \n\nTOTO Neorest toilets. Enough said.\n\nAll Ritz properties boast the best beds ever. #nolie \n\nFreeeeeeeeeee wifi!\n\nIf you make it to the restaurant attached to the hotel (Maison Boulud), order the first word cocktail and top off your night with the chocolate coulant for dessert.\n\nMerci, Ritz Montreal.
