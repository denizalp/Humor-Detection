Can I give ZERO STARS?\n\nSTAY AS FAR AWAY FROM HERE AS POSSIBLE!\n\nThe hotel is not planned out very well, only (2) entrances and my room was on he very end!\nThe sales people were not very knowledgable on their product.\nWas promised one thing when I signed up and even after I went to the presentation I am still having to argue for my gifts!\n\nI am a timeshare owner of (2) other locations and I am glad i am not an owner of blue green.
