Second day open and we give it 5 stars!  The service was incredible and the food came in the perfect time!  We split the Fig Burger (sooo good) and the Chicken Sliders with optional Mac and cheese balls (per recommendation of our waiter). All incredibly tasty. Glad we took the chance. Beautiful interior as well. We look forward to coming back to Eureka!
