So yum!! Apparently this is what \"traditional Chinese noodles\" are like, not what Americans are used to.. and it's so good! \n\nI'm nervous of spicy food, so I got #41, which was similar to ramen\/udon\/pho in that it has noodles in broth with pieces of meat.  Can't go wrong with that combination!!\n \n\nBut I also got to try #39, which was spicy noodles (without broth) and numbing peppers -maybe a little too much heat for me to eat all by myself, but it was delicious to try!  #24, the BBQ fish cake, was also delicious, but spicier than even the #39, so I couldn't eat very much.. but the plum juice and magic jelly desert helped cool me down \n\nAll in all, I'd definitely recommend this place, and I can't wait to come back and try new items!! Maybe I'll even be brave enough to switch to a spicier option!
