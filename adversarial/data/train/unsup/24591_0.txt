Recall. I once wrote that LVAC had the best smoothies in town. Granted, Greens and Proteins wasn't open at that time. But its smoothies are much, much better (and a few more dollars) than my old favorite. \n\nGreens and Proteins uses the real estate that LVAC fills with frozen yogurt and replaces it with fresh kale, grapes, almond milk, avocado, chia seeds, flax seed, agave nectar and collard greens. Can you imagine what these ingredients do for your bowels, Yelpers? They do magic. That's what they do. Magic.\n\nThe cucumber and lemon infused water washes away any bad feelings I could have had about the price. Other salves related to pricing: $1 check in offer on Yelp; buy 10 smoothies, get one free; the opportunity to earn the Carrot Top badge.\n\nThe flavor of the Green Ginger Limeade juice competes (and almost surpasses) the flavor of the smoothies, yet carries only 129 calories. Again, magic. \n\nAs an aside, the bench seat is unusually soft. I could sit there for hours and work on free wi-fi. \n\nWord to my girls, Blair B. and Jen F., whose reviews attracted me to this lovely spot so close to my--still--favorite gym.
