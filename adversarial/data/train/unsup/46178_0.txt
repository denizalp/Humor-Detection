Hands down - my favorite sushi restaurant of ALL TIME.  Baked Scallop Roll, large portions, friendly staff, fresh ingredients, inexpensive, etc. etc. etc. it's just HEAVEN! There's also a location on Elliott road in the Awhatukee area. Personally I like the atmosphere better at that one - it's a little more lively - but both locations are wonderful.
