I had a great time at this place on Friday! I have heard so much about it, and I have driven down Hudson Drive so many times, and we finally had a chance to go in and check it out. I went with my dad, and when we arrived (it was still a little tricky to find, but there is a sign by the road now which helps - you just literally have to go to the dead end of the road to find it and go around a little cul-de-sac), we were sat right away. The waitress was super helpful because neither one of us are huge beer people. I ended up getting a flight, and I enjoyed all of the beers on it. We also got some food - I got the pulled pork sliders and my dad got the Cuban, and both were fantastic. I can't wait to take my friends there! Thank you for the great experience!
