My mom bought something from this Walmart for my baby cousin, and when she got home, she realized she forgot to pick it up from the cashier! So she went back, and even though it was her fault for forgetting to bring it home, a lovely woman named Anousha helped her out SO much. She looked all over the Walmart for the item, (there was only 1 left) and when she could not find it, she still insisted on helping my mom out in some way. She said that it is not Walmart's responsibility, but just to ensure satisfaction, she gave my mom $5 credit. It might not seem like much but her helping out a customer for something that wasn't even Walmart's doing was so above and beyond, and I wanted to shout her out for that. Love this walmart in general. Great prices, great selection and the best staff! Thanks Anousha
