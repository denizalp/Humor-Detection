I had bookmarked French Grocery awhile back and was in the area and some time to kill, so I pulled up the address on Yelp App and made my over there.\n\nThe French Grocery, is more of a bistro\/wine bar, not really a grocery, but please don't let that stop you from checking it out, because it does have plenty to offer.\n\nWhen I traveled to France the one thing I wanted most was cheese, bread and wine, and now after checking this place out, I see I don't have to wait too long to get it. They have fresh bread, croissants, so many cheeses, French and American, so many to choose from, I just need to invest in a raclette grill and I will be one happy girl!\n\nThey also have some amazing looking desserts, custards, Ã©clairs, beignets, pastries, macarons, tarts. Everything looking equally delish, but I walked away with  1\/2 dozen of macarons, which my house loved, even my 2 year old grandson, who is very picky.\n\nThey have a nice wine selection too, bottles range in price, oh the bistro looks like it would make a cute date night\/lunch spot too. Looking forward to my next trip back.
