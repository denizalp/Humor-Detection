I came here around 4pm on a Tuesday.\n\nIt's a great convenient location with friendly (and pretty cute) staff. Orders come fast and are efficient. The place is often crowded or at least full because of its prime location. There are quite a few seating areas for you to choose from--we tend to find seats pretty easily whenever we come. The place is brightly lit and honestly wouldn't need lights on during the day because of the stream of shaded sunshine from the window.\n\nDrinks are pretty consistent here as with most Starbucks locations. They do matcha well here, in the sense that the matcha powder is well blended with the drink so you don't end up with weird chunks.
