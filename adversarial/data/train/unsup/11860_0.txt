This is probably one of the WORST pizza places around Vegas and there's a lot.  I'm from Jersey, so I KNOW a little something about good pizza! I've ordered from Maestro's many times before and have always gave them the benefit of the doubt, but how could a pizza place really mess up a plain cheese pizza?! I ordered for delivery multiple times and the pizza ALWAYS comes cold, tissue-thin uncooked dough, and the taste is soooo bland! EVERY TIME!! They really like to get more of YOUR bang for your buck by watering down condiments which they charge an arm and a leg for and thinning out the dough so much, all you get is overly-processed cold toppings. I really have had it with this place. They just get more and more worse. NO MORE. BEWARE. Digiorno offers better pizza than this place! Geesh!
