Yelpers have rated Citizens at 3 out of 5 stars.  When that's the aggregate rating out of hundreds of reviews, for me personally I begin to think the establishment might be shitty.   Especially when there is a sprinkling of reviews that are at 1 star with all kinds of jacked up things being written.  \"3\" may be \"A-OK\" according to Yelp, to me it means the place is questionable.  \n\nSo if you don't want to fuck around with Citizens and risk disappointment, here's my advice:  Go to the the takeout counter and order either the Reuben or else the turkey avocado sandwich.  Simple as that.    \n\nThese sandwiches are so good.   The ingredients, the breads, the thinly-sliced soft and moist deli meat... Adds up to an amazing sandwich that I go out of my way for.   Trust me.   \n\nYes, these sandwiches are expensive.   Around $15 for one sandwich to give you some idea.    But damn worth it, and I keep going back for it.  For the times I drive in to Vegas from So Cal, I typically order extra sandwiches to go as a snack later on.   \n\nBut if the price still seems completely outrageous to you, I won't fault you.  Just do it if you're comfortable.   However, to put it in perspective, what did cost you to get a bottle of Grey Goose last night at Hakkasan?   Or even one cocktail at Light... How much did that cost?  How much money did you put out in the casino?   What did you spend on the stripper with your buddies?\n\nExactly.      So shut the hell up and get one of the best sandwiches you'll ever eat!!!
