I've lived in Charlotte since April 2011. I've been waiting for this day! As a man that was born and raised in Brooklyn, Popeyes was a staple for me growing up!\nNO more wack BoJangles undercooked chicken and horrible biscuits! Even though I had to drive all the way to the West side to eat, it was well worth it! I LOVE POPEYES!\n\nWooohooo! We got a Popeyes...yeah, yeah, yeah!
