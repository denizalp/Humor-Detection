Buffets are not my primary preference when going out to eat, but since we had family in town...Filipinos love to get their bang for their buck when it comes to meals, so here we are...\n\nThe first thing that I see when walking in was \"Mongolian BBQ\".......need less to say I got super giddy inside 'cuz I love me some Mongolian bbq! For those of you that need a reminder, Mongolian bbq is when you build your own noodles with meat, veggies and sauces. Seeing that this place has Mongolian bbq, is already is a couple stars in my book! \n\nAs far as food options they have it all: different types of sushi, beef and broccoli, bbq beef ribs, orange chicken, pot stickers...just everything EXCEPT honey walnut prawns, no honey walnut prawns here, *tears! \n\nService is cool, our lady server was pretty attentive for having multiple 5 people tables. Cleanliness? Some parts are questionable, but for the main dining area it's okay.
