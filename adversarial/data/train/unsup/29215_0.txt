Come here every year when I'm in Scottsdale for Spring Training. After a night of drinking and sporting a huge hangover this place saves me every time. The portions are huge  and the service is quick and friendly. Sometimes there's a long wait to get in though. It's a painful walk here from the hotel, but I leave with a skip in my step to Scottsdale Stadium
