I need to preface this review with one fact. Next week they are moving to Ellsworth Ave in Shadyside near Soba. The owner greeted us and explained part of the reason is that there current location lacks air conditioning.He said he was contemplating doing lunch and maybe dinner at their new location. My girlfriend and I came in just a little late for breakfast so we settled for lunch.\n\nWe opted first for the chicken salad  as a salad. It came topped with cranberries but the rest of the items noted on the menu appeared to be missing. The chicken salad had hardly more than a tablespoon full on it so we decided to order something to go with it. Of the quiches they only had one available made with goat cheese so we settled for that one along with an order of their Lynonniase potatoes. The quiche was very good. The potatoes were just so-so. We noticed that their dessert refrigerator was empty because they had run out of food. Our waitress was very helpful and attentive to our needs.\n\nWe are giving benefit of the doubt on this meal because of their imminent move to Shadyside. Whether the business will improve over there remains to be seen. Please be aware of the fact that they will have a new address soon and won't be here after the end of June.
