I might be biased because I love pie; but this place is pretty great! I've tried many of their pie flavors and have honestly enjoyed them all. They also make great coffee\/espresso beverages. It's a little expensive (almond milk latte is almost $6), but worth it in my eyes to support a local business! You'll find me here over Starbucks any day :)
