I checked out Golden Nail Lounge online before booking an appointment.  Their prices \"seemed\" decent, and from what they said, they are very sanitary.  I booked a pedicure with gel polish and a manicure with regular polish.  They did my pedicure first, and the gloves she used were ones that are re-used between clients.  I was grossed out about that.  After my pedicure, she did my manicure with me sitting in the same pedicure chair, so my left arm had to be held across my body to where she was standing on the right side of me the entire time.  My back was in a lot of pain by the time I left.  Then when it came time to pay, the '$25' gel polish they had listed was actually $50.  When I asked about it, they argued and told me they confirmed I wanted a gel polish pedicure.  The problem is the sign does not say $50.  It wasn't about the money...it was the principal of the matter than made me upset.  I will definitely not be returning...even if I'm paying more somewhere else.
