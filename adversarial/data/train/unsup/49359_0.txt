I have got to set the record straight.  All of these posts that are more than a few years old are ridiculously inaccurate. Michael's (named after the owner of the South Point hotel and casino) was moved to the hotel only after Mr. Gaughn bought out the South Point from the Coast casino properties.  That's right, it used to be South Coast casino.  And,Michael's used to be at the Barbary coast casino, until Mr. Gaughn moved it to the new South Point (as he retained the rights to his restaurant when he sold off his interest in coast casinos, and outright bought the south point (formerly South Coast).  Since the South point was less than a couple years old when this occurred, it is impossible that the restaurant \"has not been updated since the 70's\".  In fact, Mr Gaughn paid a considerable amount of money to move a load bearing column because he didn't like the appearance of the restaurant with the column where it was.  This restaurant flies in fresh items (for example the Dover sole), and has impeccable service right down to the bathroom attendants. With the new location, the absolute attention to detail, the finest quality food, and a professional serving staff, I can see no reason that this restaurant could ever be rated as less than the best dining experience one can find in Vegas.
