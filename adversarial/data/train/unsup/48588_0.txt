Love Fern! Have a great selection of my vegan items that changes seasonally. Started with bbq cauliflower that has a sweet, almost tangy flavor. Etoufee was a great choice to follow. Great local beer selection to choose from. Even better on Sundays with their homeade bloody Mary mix they feature.  Will definitely be back!
