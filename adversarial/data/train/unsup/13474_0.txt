When I walked in to Stand Up Live, I was impressed. Finally, a comedy venue here in Phoenix to rival those I have been to in other cities! However, that feeling quickly dissipated when we were seated in uncomfortable chairs at a narrow table, shoulder to shoulder with a group of strangers. When we were being seated, I had asked if we could sit at one of the comfy looking booths but was told that was not possible since their policy is to fill the middle first. Really? Then how did those other people get there? And what exactly is the point of getting there early (as recommended on the website) if you don't get to pick your own seats? At least we did not have to wait in line since it was a Thursday.\n\nWe ordered plenty of food since we had skipped dinner. The three appetizers were all better than expected: wings, bruchetta, and sliders. Those tasty apps are what got them the extra star. The portions were larger than the server had described so we ended up with no room on the table to maneuver comfortably; not to mention the awkwardness that comes with trying to eat wings with someone you don't know literally inches away. And I was extremely disappointed to learn that rather than a two item minimum that included food, we instead had to each order two drinks.  They had a bunch of specialty cocktails on the menu but I am not a vodka fan so I asked if I could get their dirty martini with gin instead of vodka (which really is the proper way to make it). Server happily obliged but I was dismayed to find an $8 upcharge on our bill at the end of the night... add that to my husband's beer and $12 soda (wtf?) and our bill was about a hundred bucks. Considering that we had already paid $40 a ticket, that was just ridiculous. The comedian we saw did make me laugh but that bill sucked all the humor out of my night at the end.\n\nOverall this place was fun, but due to the cost I doubt we will be back.
