Beerbistro should slough off the bistro part and just be called BEER because the food here is mediocre at best.  I met up with a friend from high school for lunch and we nabbed a table in the \"bar area\" for 2.  If you're short, you may want to wait for an actual table in the dining area.  I am 5'7 and the seats were too low for me.  It is also advisable to wait for a table if you plan on ordering food, because the tables are so small it makes you feel like you've entered Alice in Wonderland.  \n\nI decided to splurge a bit and opted for the Lobster Tacos + Salad ($22.50) which came on a hard shell, and was such a disappointment.  For one, the other ingredients used in the lobster taco overpowered the natural sweetness of lobster, and in the end tasted to me like a spiced up egg salad.  The salad was scant, and the dressing tasted like orange cremesicle which I definitely do not fancy with my salad.  \n\nMy DC had the Steak Tartare with Frites ($13.50) which came with a cone full of frites.  He seemed to enjoy it.\n\nV E R D I C T\n\nFor 2 entr√©es and no beer, our lunch rang in to $50 with tax and tip.  I did notice that they have a healthy list of beers, so this is definitely a place for after work drinks as opposed to a lunch or dinner.  Stay for the beer, don't come for the food.  Oh, I should also mention that the service here is virtually non-existent once your orders have been taken.
