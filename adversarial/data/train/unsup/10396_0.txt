Fear not, Yelpers. Bro culture is alive and well in Liberty Village. \n\nThis neighbhourhood, man. It's clean and a faux, like a movie set. Beautiful old brick buildings turned into everything one could need sitting below towers filled with bros, yuppies and young families that crush on the condo scene. There aren't quite enough businesses (yet) to handle the amount of people living here, so everywhere is always smoking busy. Brazen Head is no different.\n\nIt was the first day of American football, so my friend and I who had earned lunch after some aggressive furniture shopping were surrounded by jack asses while we dined. Be smarter than us, and google if it's a heavy sports day before heading into a pub in Liberty Village with TVs. Oy. \n\nThe above being said, this place has a lot of redeeming qualities. A caesar bar where you can decorate your own drink during brunch, huge portions, fresh fries and a nice staff. Try the club of the fried chicken sandwich with side salads if you are hungry and enjoy big pieces of chicken and lettuce with whimsy.
