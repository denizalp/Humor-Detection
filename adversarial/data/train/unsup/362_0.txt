Dr Sharda is a very companionate and caring Doctor.  Standard of Care is nothing more then a term here.  He takes his time, evaluates your situation, discusses options with you and let's you decide the best course of treatment and will give his honest opinion.\n\nMost doctors do not give you options or show compassion they just push you to what makes them the most amount of money.  Dr Sharda will be straight with you and let you know what he can do for you.\n\nIt's been a long road and to find a doctor like Dr Sharda is like finding a diamond in the ruff, he is that diamond.\n\nHis office staff is just as amazing as he is, warm friendly and will do what they can to make you happy.\n\nI highly recommend Dr Sharda if you are in need of a GREAT Oncologist....
