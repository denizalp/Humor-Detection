Hey Yelpers!  What is Benny doing in the Scarbs?  This is my old stomping grounds.  My Hood!  \nSo lets check out couple of places while I am here.  \nIf you have never been to GM, it is the all in one Super Store\/Resto!  They got the groceries in the front, the restaurant in the middle and the Art Store in the back.  Wow and lol. \nSeeing that it was our first trip to a Malaysian Resto, we decided to keep it simple by only ordering a Chicken Seafood Curry Coconut Laksa, the Chicken Satay Sticks\/Mango Salad Combo and the Beef Satay Sticks.  Verdict:  I liked the Laksa but not enough to finish all the soup.  I was all coconutty curried out.  The fish cakes, chicken and laksa noodles were good,,, I guess.  I have nothing to compare it to.  Hence my Laksa Journey begins...lol.  My Seven year old said she really liked the Beef Satay.  She didn't share them with me, even though I asked, so they must have been good.  The Chicken Satay was deep fried.  Are they supposed to be deep fried?   Anywho, they were tasty with the peanut sauce.   Mango Salad was just ok.  I have had better.\nAs you have probably already read in the previous reviews that the resto attempts to sneak in a 10% service charge on your bill.  Well it looks as if they got the message and removed it.  Good for you GM!
