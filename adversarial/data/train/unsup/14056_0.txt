Updated review: zero stars.\n\nDO NOT under any circumstances consider joining this club. I detailed the shoddy state of the facility in my previous review, and finally could not stand working out there any longer. I went in to the club to cancel my membership long before the month I had already paid for (can't do it online or anything, natch!), and Life Time is now attempting to bill me for *another* month.\n\nA gym membership is not like renting an apartment -- there is no need to give a month's notice so they have time to somehow fill the slot that I am vacating. This is an absolutely ridiculous concept, and is nothing short of a fraudulent attempt to pocket additional revenue.\n\nThis nonsense is absolutely astounding. I cannot believe that customers have allowed a company this large to get away with this, and I suspect that many people would think twice about joining if they knew this was the policy. My unequivocal advice is: don't think twice; don't even consider patronizing this disgusting, deceitful business.
