I found this place a couple years ago when we opened our own business in the same strip mall.  I had been to just about every other salon in the valley (ok, a slight exaggeration, but only slight)  - my problems with the others were: They were so slow while cutting my hair (oh, I'm a guy and like to get in and get out, not dawdle); they charged too much (its a haircut - not a dinner and movie); and a lot of them try to have some stupid 'hook' that makes them special.  This place is simply perfect.  They are nice, always smile when I come in, VERY reasonably priced (much better than all those 'pretenders' who SAY they are inexpensive) and quick - oh my gosh, the guy is fantastic!!!  I really can't say enough good things about him.  My only hesitation with giving these folks 5 stars is that I'm afraid they will get too busy - but seriously, if you have been looking for and not finding a great place to get your hair done, make the trip - they are SO worth it!
