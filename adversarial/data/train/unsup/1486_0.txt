How enchanting.\nA brown bag of french fries that before I can whisk them off to my table, has already saturated the bag with grease.\nAnd a double cheeseburger that after only two bites has fallen apart.\n\nI do like the soda dispenser, very unique, almost futuristic in a sense.\n\nIn the end, If I want to spend twenty five bucks for lunch for two of us, I'll go someplace where I'm not ingesting a half bucket of grease in the process. \n\nNote:  \nDon't go here before going to the movies. Your  body's grease-o-meter will be hitting red line, making you think twice about that bag of buttered popcorn.\n\nOr who knows, maybe you like grease.\nNot me.
