Excellent company to deal with.  I was referred to them by a flooring manufacturer to order some very specific replacement parts for my flooring.  \n\nI called and got right through to Vanessa, who was so helpful and patient.  She helped me figure out exactly what I needed and placed the order right away.  She had very good communication skills.\n\nThis company is obviously well ran, and I will return here for future flooring needs as well. \n\nThanks!
