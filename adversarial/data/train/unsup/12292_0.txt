Â¡Que lastima!\n\nAfter ordering this place a multitude of times on Uber Eats, I was extremely excited to DO IT LIVE! Instead it was an extremely disappointing experience full of deception and lies. Normally I would order the beef chimi, but instead changed it up with the PORK BELLY and shrimp tacos. I was absolutely excited as they arrived but noticed one glaring omission... THE PORK BELLY. Instead the kitchen decided to substitute PORK BELLY with a mere strip of bacon. Of course I flagged with the waitress who took the dish back to the kitchen for clarification, and apparently they had run out of PORK BELLY. \n\nBacon is delish, but just the mere fact that no one had told me about a substitution and to serve it like it was normal is just absolutely mind blowing. \"Screw it - let's just serve it like this, they won't notice\" is how I imagined the conversation in the kitchen. Yes, they come from the same animal but everyone knows the two are prepared\/taste very differently. Unfortunately this turned me off to the whole experience and will not be visiting again.
