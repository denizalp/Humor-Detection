I am in Las Vegas this weekend - Friday Feb 9th and Sat Feb 10th. I wanted to book a show and went on Vegas.com.\n\nI did a search on Vegas.com for Feb 9th. A show at The Mirage came up. I booked it. I went to collect the ticket and was told it is on Friday, Feb 23rd. My fault for not checking 100%.\n\nI book hotels and shows on Vegas.com very often. It was less than an hour that I made this silly mistake. I called in and explained my error and was told too bad its unrefundable and not transferable - I must just go to the show in Feb 23rd. I had to explain a few times I am in Las Vegas now. I will be in California where I live on Feb 23rd. She eventually agreed to give me a refund but only after deducting a $25 fee.\n\nMy perception of this situation was that Vegas.com does not appreciate its loyal customers. I did not feel like a valued customer at all.
