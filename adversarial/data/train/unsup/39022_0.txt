My go-to independent chain for books.\n\nBecause I live in the area, the Edward location is the one I go to the most. But I also love their pop-up on Queent St, and the location at Yonge & Eg. Always cheaper than Chapters\/Indigo and World's Biggest Bookstore. Although they may not have the title I'm searching for, I always find that it ends up showing up at some point. So unless I absolutely need to have a specific book, I usually wait and check BMV's selection. \n\nMost books are in great condition and are very reasonably priced. Many are brand new and simply publisher overstocks, otherwise they are gently used. I find they offer a wide selection of books (and this location has an old magazine & large porn movie section too if you're into that). I've also sold some books to BMV; although you don't get a ton of money back, it sure is extra dough in your pocket for books you'll never read again.
