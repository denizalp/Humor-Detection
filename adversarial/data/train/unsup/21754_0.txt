SOOO GOOD!!!\nBut soooo expensive!! ;-;\n\nBasically spent all my money here *cries*, but it was worth it :')\nThe macarons were super good and I loved the matcha green tea brownie cake! They have a very wide range of flavours, so indecisive people, beware. Everything was very delicious and the environment was very relaxing as well.\n\nThere were really little tables though so it's hard to find a spot to sit down if you're with your friends.\n\nA must try!
