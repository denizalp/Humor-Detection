This was my 3rd time here. Another food trip inspired by a restaurant.com $25 gift certificate.\n\nWe arrived at 7pm Friday night and the parking lot was fairly full but once we entered the dining room was empty-everyone was in the bar.\n\nWe asked to sit upstairs in the game room and it was empty to. We had it all to ourselves....or so we thought.\n\nThey have 2 pool tables,fooseball,pinball, racing,hunting and a jukebox plus a big screen with 3 couches to lounge and a 100\"+ projection screen for events,etc.\n\nThere's also a small bar upstairs but the waitresses do have to run up & down the stairs for soft drinks & food.\n\nWe ordered drinks & some cheeseburger sliders for an appetizer. Then we all ordered sandwiches and a steak.\n\nMy son got the Teriyaki Swiss burger with fries, my wife got the Turkey Bacon Club and I got the  Mustang Melt-an 8oz New York with bleu cheese and bacon bits.\n\nBefore the food arrived a group of 10-12 kids and their parents arrived to add some life to the place. The kids were all well-behaved and excitedly enjoying all the games.\n\nThe service was great, the food however was just ok. The hamburger taste like frozen patties flavorless & dry -not at all good. The turkey club was great and the steak was enjoyable but the bleu cheese & bacon wasn't necessary the steak would have been better without it.\n\nI was a little disappointed they didn't have the california-style  tuna melt that used to be on the menu (http:\/\/www.menusearch.net\/lasvegas\/restaurant.php?name=570)\n\nI will buy another GC @ restaurant.com but I will stay away from the burgers and stick to the pork tenderloin.
