I broke my acoustic guitar string early Saturday morning. Called revolver records store and they sent me here for strings. \n\nI rode my bike up here, nice little house, that's the business. Can't miss it, big sign. Cool people greeted me, no douche musician types that don't want to help you. We chatted as they rung me up. They told me they also carry vinyls here as well. Good prices, I'll be back!
