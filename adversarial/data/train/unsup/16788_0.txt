Great quality meals at respectable prices and extremely fast service. My wife and I go here as often as we can (we try not to eat out too much for budget reasons) and the staff are always attentive. The food is high quality and tasty. My personal favorite items is the Pop Eye Scrambler with Avocado: it is eggs scrambled with onion,avocado,baby spinach, and bacon. For two adults with drinks and meals runs us on average about $26 after a 20% tip for the great staff. Highly recommend this place.
