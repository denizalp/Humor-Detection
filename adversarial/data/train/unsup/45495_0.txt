As a non hot dog person I was not super excited to see the menu. However I ordered the vodka slaw and three hot sauces and it was so flavorful I got over the fact that I was eating hazardous animals scraps in the shape of a tube. The tots at first struck me as meh, as in not Orida tots, however the sauces I ordered - again - brought them to a new level of yummy. I got the momocho, Piri Piri, Thai chili and housemate ketchup. Not sure what was what because none of the sauces looked like any of the restaurant or jar versions I've tried before so I just kind of mixed and went with the combined flavor which was spicy and garlicky and yummy. The only reason for the three rating is that I would have loved some wings or another food option and the ability to rate 3.5 vs 3 or 4. Forced choice is not the friend of business establishments. In a nutshell, a definite must try at least once when you decide to cast your health and wellbeing concerns to the winds and dive in.
