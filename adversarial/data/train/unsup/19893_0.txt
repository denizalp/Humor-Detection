Mark's Cafe is my hands down favorite breakfast place in Arizona. I know, kind of a big statement, but every visit here is a joy.\n\nThe food and service is always top notch. Bacon, cooked how you like it (we like it extra crispy) is always magical, and eggs made with perfection and care. \n\nAs a self-professed crazy food obsessed person, I love the variety, with their extensive menu. And trust me when I say - everything is good. I have tried a ton of their offerings from the egg benny's, to chicken and waffles, burgers, and numerous scrambles... There's nothing I have yet to dislike!\n\nMark's is small and warm, and totally has that shop  around the corner, mom n pop feel. Always cooked and staffed by Mark and his family, this is a true definition of an amazing local family business. It's comforting to see the same friendly faces at every visit, honestly something so rare these days. My husband and I are big fans and will happily support Mark's for years to come!
