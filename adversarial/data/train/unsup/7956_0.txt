This place makes me want to drop a deuce every time I walk in and I think I've narrowed it down to the over usage of stale cinnamon potpourri. For some odd reason the smell of hot tamales triggers my bowels; it's a strange phenomenon and I should probably have it checked out.  Besides that personal issue, this store is great for Halloween costumes, sundresses, moo moos, everything wicker, used dentures, 80s bedding, soiled stuffed animals, multiple copies of the same Linda Ronstadt album and many many more previously used and unwanted disposable items.  They even have 50% off days! Shopping spree anyone?
