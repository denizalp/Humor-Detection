This place is awesome. Since moving to Arizona, we have been looking for a place like this. It's more like a bar without alcohol. There's a lot of social interaction and great fun. On Tuesday nights there is movie night, on Wednesday nights it's open mic night and the Thursday, Friday, and Saturday it's karaoke. All but movie night takes place on the front porch & lawn. Everybody is friendly and makes you feel comfortable and welcome. Highly recommend this place.
