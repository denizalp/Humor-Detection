Horrible, horrible, horrible customer service!!! Granted it is not at this particular location, but online ordering, but there is no one there to complain to. I ordered an item the first part of September, they told me delivery by September 26. No problem. Then I get NO emails for status updates, but check online and it tells me now no delivery until October 22. Hmmmmm. So no delivery or emails by then, so I check on November 1 and it tells me delivery by yesterday. Still nothing. I call them this am, they tell me not until mid-January....but oh, when I want to cancel my order, they tell me it will take 4-6 weeks to process my refund. These people are a bunch of LOSERS with way overpriced merchandise that can be purchased elsewhere.
