Tandoori Times is one of the newer Indian restaurants to sprout up in the Valley, and they've decided to be a bit different. Nestled within Old Town Scottsdale, the friendly, affable owner knows that in order to succeed, his restaurant has to be both A) good and B) entertaining. \r\n\r\nThe ambiance of the place is definitely a step up from most Indian joints. He has several booths semi-enclosed by see-through fabric and a full stocked bar. The food is pretty good - the naan is so far the best by miles I've had in the Phoenix metro. However, I noticed that they skimp on the meat & chicken dishes. Not wise, my friend, for your brown patrons DO notice that amidst all the tasty gravy there's like two meat nuggets and not much else. Given that the dishes here are at least a couple more dollars expensive than elsewhere, the skimping is kind of inexcusable.\r\n\r\nBut hey! If you're there on Friday or Saturday nights, there's a belly dancer! Because that's the first thing we all think of when we go eat Indian food: a girl belly dancing to Bollywood soundtracks! Kickass.\r\n\r\nIn all seriousness, Tandoori Times is a good, clean place and a step up from most other Indian restaurants in the Valley. But prepare to shell out more duckets, even though your carnivorous cravings may be lost while swimming through all that gravy.
