This is one my new favorite places to come eat. Everywhere I go I order shrimp fried rice and it was perfect. The food is fresh and tasty. My wife is in love with their orange chicken which contained freshly squeezed orange slices. Best chinese resrtaraunt so far, not only the food but the customer service is fantastic! A+
