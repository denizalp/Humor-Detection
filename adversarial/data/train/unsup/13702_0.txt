This is a little gem.  I didn't know what to expect.  The place is tiny, you place the order at the counter and then they will bring it to you.  They offer free tea (hot), very tasty.  We had the Safiha Balbaki, which is like a flatbread pizza that has ground beef, tomato, onion, garlic, bell pepper, pomegranate molasses and spices.  We also ordered the Labani Chicken, similar flatbread with kefir cheese topped with shredded chicken, avatar, paprika and hot sauce.  Both were delicious and pretty large for the price.  Each was less than $4.  I had an order of hummus, it came with fresh baked pita, so carbilicious!  Will be back to get pictures next time.
