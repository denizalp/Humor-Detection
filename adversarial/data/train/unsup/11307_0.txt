Not what it used to be, takes forever to check in, rooms are hot, AC struggles to keep up,  bathrooms are rotting,  hallways smell like wet cat food, staff is rude,  you can't get drink if you tried,  and they never open a table, when they are all full.   You can't even give them your money when you want,  cause you cant find an open table.   M LIFE? Probably not the life you want to live!  The good?   The buffet was confusingly awesome! Especially the steak! Oh and the showers had awesome water pressure and were hot.
