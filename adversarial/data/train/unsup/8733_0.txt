Can I move here? No one would mind, would they? if an inconspicuous little foodie just crawled into a dark corner and stayed there permanently, only venturing forth when food was needed, which of course would be about thirty times a day. \n\nI can't think of another food-getting place that has this much selection, this much diversity (other than some bloody supermarket, yeah that doesn't count). You can get something as literally bloody as an entire pig head, or you can chose something much finer, like a French macaron. I came here over lunch once; I hadn't realized it, but a market like this is such a Brilliant place for lunch. I got to try out four different places, for the same money as I would have spent at any one normal restaurant. A hunk of falafel, (go to Maha's falafel!) and a couple smaller items. Cake Royal has something like the second best macarons ever. Michael's bakery has about the seventh best macarons and Judy's Oasis has the best spinach and feta cheese pockets things. \n\nI could've gotten many other things: meat, cheese, bratwurst, pasta, gyros, pierogis, coffee, crepes, more pastries. But there was more for me to eat and drink in Cleveland, so I tore myself away from this majestic building and all it's glory. So let this next thought echo across the many avenues of Yelp, so that all who hear it will gain due respect for Cleveland and the West Side Market: If all Cleveland consisted of was the West Side Market, it still would be a city of Great Destination.
