Social offers amazing food and cocktails in a great venue! \n\nFor a starter we ordered the shrimp and chorizo appetizer which was hands down the best appetizer I have ever had. The tomato broth was divine and served with a crusty baguette perfect for sopping it all up.\n\nFor our main courses we enjoyed a burger and a mushroom melt. The foraged mushrooms were served on warm focaccia bread, with perfectly juxtaposed sweet fig jam and bitter arugula. Bit the french fries were the star...crisp, crunchy, and addictive! Dessert was churros with chocolate cookie crumble, salted caramel tequila ice cream, and mango. I did not taste much tequila in the ice cream, but I didn't much care. It was heavenly!\n\nAs for cocktails, the list was creative and exciting. My favorite was the Honeysuckle Mule--literally, Springtime in a glass. Local honeysuckle vodka, ginger beer, lime and basil. So good.\n\nAsk for Heather! She was a killer bartender with wonderful conversation and a strong pour. She was knowledgeable about the menu and made wonderful recommendations. When she found out that we were celebrating our anniversary with a staycation at Le Meridian, she nonchalantly gathered our names and room number, and when we back to our room we were surprised by a gorgeous spread of Prosecco and chocolate strawberries. That kind of service is so rare these days and was such a delight for us! \n\nIf you are in the Charlotte area, and ESPECIALLY if you are staying at Le Meridian or The Sheraton, do not pass up dinner at Social Bar & Kitchen. It was wonderful! Five stars!
