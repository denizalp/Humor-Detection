Ka was the first of the Cirque du Soleil shows I wanted to see.  As life always plays out in dramatic and unexpected fashion, it became the fourth CdS (Cirque du Soleil) show watched.  This one is located at the MGM Grand.  Outside of O, general consensus says this is one of the best.  \n\nRight at the front doors you'll be greeted by slew of ushers talking in a tone reminiscent of a Renaissance Fair except in the world of Ka.  We then took our \"professional\" pictures; one of which was with the ushers.  Bun asked why we took a picture with the usher.  Considering my silly logic, I really thought she was in the actual show for an odd reason.  She was just that convincing.        \n\nWalking into the auditorium, you'll be blown away with the breathtaking size and grandeur of the theatre.  I almost ran into the railing looking straight up and around the theatre setting pieces.  The story of Ka is more a straight forward story than other CdS shows such as Mystere, which is overly abstract at points.  Filled with action packed martial art scenes, acrobatics, and some comedic relief to boot, the story of two siblings is played out with almost no narration.  Everything is shown through movements and facial expressions (if you're sitting close enough).  \n\nThe most glaring positive note I have for Ka is their translatability to the audience.  You can tell everyone just gets it when the characters on stage are conveying a language through movement.  The syncing dance with the backdrops and props will leave you firstly, awestricken from symbolic motion, and secondly, wearing a \"Whoa! How did they do that?\" face on.  \n\nGood versus evil, love story, epic journey, and coming of age can all be categories describing the performance.  Ka has the whole package.  This is my favorite and best CdS so far.  Wild rides of suspense and emotion inducing moments will have you thinking where the last hour and half went.
