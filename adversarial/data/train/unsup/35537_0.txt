This will be a short review because we walked out before we even ordered. My husband and I were put off the second we walked in by how hot it was in there and a weird smell! There was a rack of t-shirts as you walk in the door and then a couple of cardboard boxes below it. Then, I see the Circle K looking cooler containing water bottles and such. It's such a small place and all the clutter as you walk in makes it even smaller. Then the menus are practically on the ceiling. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and grabbed some menus saying they're easier to read! If you know that, then change it! We went to find a seat to go over the menu and noticed a table in the back cluttered with papers and a computer, that was about it for me, so we left.
