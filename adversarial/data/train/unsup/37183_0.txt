9 of my 18 balloons I bought yesterday at 3pm are not even floating at 7am the next morning even after paying the .15 extra per balloon for the \"24hour helium\" needless to say I'm not freaking happy and intend on complaining to the manager VERY EXTREMELY UNHAPPY WITH THE FACT THAT I PAID THAT EXTRA MONEY TO NOT HAVE ALL MY BALLOONS FLOAT NOT EVEN 24hours later!!!!
