I love this convention center. This place is very fancy with beautiful art galleries, luxurious spa's, magnificent restaurants, coffee shops and large conference rooms. \n\nI have been to the convention center several times for conferences. Very spacious conference rooms, excellent wifi connectivity as well as there is free unlimited complementary wifi. \n\nUnlimited free wifi, beautiful art galleries, amazing  convention shows, scrumptious food stores, convenient stores. What else do you need? \n\nI would just stay here for my life! LOL. \n\nOne of the exits goes to the china town, one to the south and to the north of the city. It's a magnificent location.\n\nThe architecture is pretty beautiful and it is a fascinating place. \n\nThis is an ideal convention center for any conference. I have been to the latest Neural information processing systems 2015 which was attended by 3800 attendees and the PyCon 2015 in April attended by 3000 attendees. \n\nLove it! Love it!
