What a pleasant and fun surprise!  The place was packed.  You ordered your food in a long line up, sat down at a shared table in a issakaya style, you acknowledged your location when the staff yelled out your number, then you got to enjoy a tasty meal.  I recommend the soup and wrap combo.   We thought the chicken was better than the lamb.  The soups were hearty and comforting.
