This is a great live music venue with amazing. Acoustics and sound systems.  It has two floors with an upper patio area.  Staff and security are helpful and friendly.  The bathrooms have an attendant, an interesting Scottsdale touch.  Drink prices are spending though.  $8\/beer.  Saw the English beat, great 80s band.  They had two opening bands so it was a while for the headliner but the openers were good as well.  I can't wait to come here again.
