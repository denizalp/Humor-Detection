WOW! \nOk so I never thought I would see something new at a Cirque show. This was a last minute decision to join to join them at this show and it was such the right decision. \nIts like an acid trip but without the drugs! so beautiful, so enchanting, so trippy! Who dreams up this stuff? \nTotally worth every dollar!\nIf I had only one show to see in Vegas while I was here, this would be it!
