It has been over a year since I was introduced to this place by my friend Yer. Ever since then, this place has became my favorite sushi spot in Vegas.I brought many friends here and they all love it as much as I do. \n\nThey have high quality fish. I love their Kamashida toro, o toro, ama ebi, live uni, jikinmedi, king salmon, scallop, kapachi and everything that Eric prepares during omakase. I highly recommend everyone  try omakase in Yummy. \n\nThey are expanding their business and they will have omakase only in the unit next to their current place. I believe the current store will remain the same. I can't wait to see what Eric has in stores for us with their new expansion. Thanks Eric for the high quality sushi and affordable price.
