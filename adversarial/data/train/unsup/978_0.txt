Sur La Table is a really nice store. They have just about everything you could want to cook at home, but you're going to likely pay a premium if you shop there.\n\nMy wife and I stop in more than we really should (as it usually compels us to think that we need another cooking utensil that we probably don't REALLY need) because it's so close to home, but we usually end up using the store as a showroom because we know there's likely a better deal on the same item(s) elsewhere. We typically only buy from the store if we need something and don't feel like driving anywhere to get it.\n\nOther than the prices, I really think the service at this location could use some work. In fact, I'd opt to pay the premium more often if the service warranted it. I've walked out after walking in ready-to-purchase more times than not due to their service. The one guy there is a total jerk, and my wife and I have both commented that we won't even bother if he's there. Seriously...If you don't want to help customers, you're in the wrong business. So drop the attitude and convince me to actually spend the money in your store, and not some faceless online company with cheaper prices and less hassle.\n\nThere's one lady who works there who is actually really nice and helpful, and because of her I bought an expensive knife that I had been eyeing up for a while. I went in to check it out, and ended up checking out with it...all because of her positive attitude and help. I can only imagine how well this store would do if all of the employees there were like her.
