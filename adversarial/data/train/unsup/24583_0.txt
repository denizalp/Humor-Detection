I give bob + paige salon 5 stars for their exceptional service, and I give myself 1 star for being an awful client.  I called bob + paige the day of, requesting for a haircut.  They were extremely busy before the holiday season, but they were gracious enough to fit me in anyway.  \n\nDue to the terrible weather, I arrived 15 mins late for my appointment.  I was afraid that the service that I will be receiving will be rushed, but it wasn't.  My jacket was taken, my purse was hung up in front of my chair and my hair was thoroughly washed.  I was offered a drink and Jenna took her sweet time with my hair.  Jenna is amazing and really didn't try to tell me how my hair should be cut.  She listened to my typical hair routine and offered different options.  I especially liked that she didn't add too many layers to my thick hair, because I like to braid it and I don't like uneven hair sticking out the sides of my braid.\n\nOkay, so after this amazing service, I was again a terrible client.  I forgot my wallet!  Ethan, the receptionist was so flexible he said that I could go home to get it and come back or give him a credit card number over the phone.  After trying to call my bank, I gave in and went with the second option.  \n\nThank you so much for putting up with me, bob + paige.  I highly recommend this place.
