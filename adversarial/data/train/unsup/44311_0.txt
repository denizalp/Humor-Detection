This is an awesome place with great drinks. It is definitely inside a tiny old little house and there are only a few tables. There is also a dj booth inside. The staff is really nice but the service wasn't the fastest. I would love to go back again, but it's probably not somewhere I'd go if I wanted to grab a drink quickly. I had a prickly pear tea and it was totally yum!
