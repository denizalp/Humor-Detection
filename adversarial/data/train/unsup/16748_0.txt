This place is alright. It's not bad, but it's not amazing either. I know this place has a close to 5 stars overall rating on yelp, but this is a 3 star place at best compared to other greek wrap places I've been to (in California!). I ordered a 10\" Gyros wrap and a hummus appetizer (basically a plate of hummus dip with 4 pita bread slices). \n\nThe 10\" wrap was a huge portion, you definitely get your quantity here. The gyros was cooked well and crispy, but the wrap didn't have a good balance between the sauce (hummus) and vegetables. After a while you get tired of eating it because the taste gets monotonous and overpowering. It should be a medley in your mouth, but it's really not.\n\nThe hummus wasn't that amazing either. It's fresh, but in terms of flavor, it could be better.\n\nKudos on their hot fresh pita bread though, at least they nailed that down.
