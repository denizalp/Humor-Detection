We did a Saturday brunch and they charged us 18% gratuity because we were a group bigger than 7 people....but 18% gratuity at a buffet!?\n\nIt's saving graces were that the food was indeed really good and our waitress who fetched our drinks and cleared the table was completely awesome.\n\nMy favorites were the benedict....which was the best one I've ever had and the risotto was wonderful as well.\n\nIf a buffet is on your list of things you have to do in Vegas, then this one is  definitely a good option.\n\nJust a tip though....don't go to a buffet before going out clubbing. It definitely takes away from feeling sexy in your LBD when you're still full from lunch =P
