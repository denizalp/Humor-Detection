We went to Dolce because we had a Groupon.  I enjoyed the \"bread and beans\" - very Italian.  Our appetizer was the stuffed mushrooms - very filling and good enough to be a main entree.  I had the Amatriciana and my boyfriend had the Bolognese.  Both were great and with generous portions.  Unfortunately, we had no room left for dessert.  My two minor complaints were our wait for glasses of water and the distance between tables - conversations were very close.  \nI would definitely go again.
