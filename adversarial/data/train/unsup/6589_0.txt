Located by the waterfront in Old Port, Maison Christian Faure is naturally bound to have a large touristy population swarm in to get their fix of French pastries. While I begrudgingly want to tell most of them that Montr√©al's food culture is distinct from France\/Paris' and that business owners use French food's \"fanciness\" as an excuse to jack up the prices, it's actually not so bad here. Would I say that some of the items are overpriced? Definitely. But there is some sort of quality assurance to be found.\n\nThe first time I was here, I ordered a club sandwich and a raspberry passion fruit tart. Although it cost $16 and came with a ton of kettle-cooked potato chips (not complaining), it tasted really good, and the chefs did a great job at making normally-dry chicken breast retain some moisture??? The tart was absolutely divine and fruity - although I would have liked a less hard crust for me to cut through in order to avoid potential messes. I got a cappuccino to finish the meal, and it was made with illy coffee and tasted nice and strong, just how I like it.\n\nI bought a cake here the second time, and it was a lovingly adorned fruit cake with the toppings arranged pretty meticulously. The ladyfingers surrounding the base was probably one of my favorite parts, and overall it tasted moist and fresh, despite me thinking that $36 for a six-serving cake is quite expensive.\n\nMy French friends have mentioned that you can get better-quality pastries for half the price back in their home country, which I do believe based off of my own excursions there. This will have to do as a substitute in the meantime until I can find a more authentic alternative, I guess.
