This salon was an amazing Experience. The owner opened the salon after hours just for me and my bff to have a spa Bonding experience together. We both got massages, ageless facial with microdermabration scrub, back scrub and unique shower experience. She allowed me and my bff to experience everything together in the same room and even allowed us to bring in are sparkling cider and chocolate to enjoy during the experience. The staff were super nice, they acted like they were family. The enviroment was relaxing. The overall ecperience left us relaxed and feeling like jello. Our experience lasted 3 hours and to our suprise the massage therapist even went over 10 or 20 min which in the massage world is unheard of but a huge bonus for the customer. Those kinds of things nake a customer come back. I would do this over and over again especially the massage and facial. The microdermabration scrub left my face feeling like a baby for a week. Thank you Ageless Day Spa for this experience!!
