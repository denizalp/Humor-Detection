I started with this club a year ago through a groupon. The workouts are great, the trainers are amazing, and results will be seen. But make sure to get everything in writing (contract wise and each communication) and stay on top of the front desk staff with your account. Leaving my contract (due to moving) has been a real pain. The lack of communication is what drops this place 2 stars. It is really frustrating dealing with issues that you thought were resolved.
