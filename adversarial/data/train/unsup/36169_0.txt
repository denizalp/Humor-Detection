Overall we enjoyed this place. The staff was friendly and they definitely explained everything to you if you have never been there yet. The price is affordable for the amount you get, I believe my bowl was $8.99. I got the double beef bowl, stir fry chow noodles as my base. You get to add your own vegetables. As far as flavor, I was able to do a combination of sweet Korean chili along with the fiery schezwan. I would definitely be coming back here again.
