Stop here before you go on the 13-mile scenic route. Trust me, it's worth it. \nAnd definitely a must stop if you have children with you as they can learn about the elements of Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water on the nifty displays. Not to say that adults won't enjoy it 'cause I definitely did!\n\nYou can also refill your water bottles here. Not sure if the fountain is broken or they really just have it running continuously. \n\nClean restrooms were a definite plus!\n\nNote, there is a separate listing for the 13-mile scenic route (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/13-mile-scenic-drive-las-vegas)
