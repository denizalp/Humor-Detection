Although it is the most expensive pho place I have been- it's really good. The broth has so much flavor. I'm not crazy about the meat, but I really enjoyed the shrimp pho. The service is also very good- and the ambiance works too. \n\nIt's very small and cozy- I would probably avoid the place if it were packed, but it never has been when I have visited.\n\nAlso, if you can't find a parking spot- they have additionally parking in a parking lot a couple buildings north of the restaurant.
