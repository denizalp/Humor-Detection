What a gem! Food is unbelievably delicious, drinks are nice and strong (sangria) and the service is out of this world. David was our server, he gave spot on recommendations and so attentive. I'm definitely coming back and look forward to it. Here's a tip: try their black truffle appetizers, it's amazing.
