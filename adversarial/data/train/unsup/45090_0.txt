If I could give Susan more than 5 stars, I would. My fiance and I just bought our first home with Susan's help, and we can honestly say we don't know what we would have done without her. In today's crazy housing market, Susan helped us by recommending only the greatest lenders who were efficient and professional. She was always available and was very quick to respond when we had any questions. Susan went above and beyond when it came to our home purchase. She's truly the best!
