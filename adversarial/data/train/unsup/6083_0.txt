I've had the original pink box donuts bookmarked forever, but since it's completely on the other side of town in an area that I never get to, I waited patiently for them to open a location closer to me. I was walking around Town Square and remembered they had opened here, so I had to stop in. \n\nDecided to do a half dozen to sample. \n\nFat Elvis (x2)\n\nCampfire s'mores \n\nCheesecake \n\nMaple Bacon\n\nKey Lime Pie\n\nAfter my first bite of the Fat Elvis, I was excited for this flavor, then I had a second bite and hit the horrible peanut butter frosting in the middle. It was so artificial tasting. Key Lime Pie, I love anything citrus\/sour, this again was so artificial tasting and it burned going down (not in a spicy way, a not nice sour way). Maple Bacon was beyond my comprehension. The bacon was horrid. \n\nI will save this place for all the donut lovers. Wasn't my thing.
