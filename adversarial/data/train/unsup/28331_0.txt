This was my first time at this threading shop. I was told to come here by my sister in law. I've gone to other shops in the area and although they were great, the prices were a little higher. This shop charges $10 for eyebrows which is low and great!! This is even advertised outside the shop. (There's a parking lot FYI) There's leather chair seating inside at the entrance and there's three chairs to get threaded in. I have about a two minute wait, which is no problem. The girl who did my eyebrows was very attentive. I'm very happy with the results. I would definitely come back here.
