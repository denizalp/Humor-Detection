No chance we'll be returning. From start to finish, our dining experience was terrible. I'll just give some quick highlights-- waited 10 minutes before I finally went inside to get my own menus. No water was given to us on a HOT morning. Our waitress was the least friendly person on the face of the earth. waited 45 minutes for our breakfast. Food was not good. \n\nIt was a very disappointing experience. There are too many brunch places in Scottsdale to return.
