It was a pleasure to do business with Peter.  He and his team are bunch of hard-working all-American dudes.  Not only was Peter accommodating to my schedule and needs (getting my cleanup deposit back from the RV rental company), he provided his services with a friendly smile.  He kept regular communication throughout (before, during, after).  His team did an outstanding job detailing not only my RV but also a friend's who asked for the service last minute.  The RVs looked so good (post-Burning Man) that we didn't want to return them!  His prices are also very reasonable.  Highly recommend STAS, Peter, and his team.
