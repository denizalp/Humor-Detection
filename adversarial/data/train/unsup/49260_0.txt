Looks like an old Taco Bell from the outside, but so glad we came here!  Food is delicious, with a local beer and 2 on tap, besides other choices.  The young man taking orders patiently explains the differences of the burgers and sauces.  \n\nWe had the Kinoko burger and jazz fries.  They were excellent! We met the owner cleaning the tables.  He explained that he tries to source as much as he can from local purveyors. Ladies' room was also nice and clean.  We will definitely be back!
