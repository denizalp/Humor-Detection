Gosh, we stopped by here before the drive back to Phoenix a few years back. Fast forward to now. It was the Fourth of July and omg, they're open? It was time for a long overdue visit.\n\nThey are only open in the mornings til early afternoon, so late risers, you are missing out, but trust me, waking up early for this is most definitely worth it. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu - everyone in our party ordered something different and nobody left feeling dissatisfied. The food is tasty, the ideal hearty breakfast that you need to get you fueled for the day. Portion-sizes are not for the weak either, or a box might be in order, we definitely all needed one. Plus we had the nicest, friendliest waitress.\n\nAmazing food, cozy atmosphere, and great service - that's just the ingredients for the start of a great day!\n\nPS. I wish I could say I was either team banana bread or team pumpkin bread but they're both too good, I still can't decide. Guess that means another trip is in order!
