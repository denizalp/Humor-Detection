FIRST!\n\nPrepping to go to the AT&T store is like prepping to fight a boxing match: I warm up my moves, i review my tactics and  I practice my trash talk. Why? Cause lets face it, AT&T is KNOWN for shitty customer service, and unfortunately my track record at the AT&T stores has not been good: I have yelled, screamed, banged counters, threaten to move to TMobile (and Sprint, Verizon, etc etc), threaten to burn the building down, threaten to sue, etc etc etc.\n\nI swear its not my fault, i'm just not very patient with bad customer service... and I have my anger issues.\n\nSo this time, I prepped once again. I got an iPhone 4 from a friend and I wanted to move my info and get a new microSim card. It was my first smartphone (I know i know, i'm late in joining the revolution) but since I don't have a contract with AT&T I got used to being bullied into signing one every time I went into their store.\n\nLuckily, all the forces of nature were with me on this trip. The store was empty, the reps were in a good mood and at no point in time did they mention my lack-of-contract with them in the 6 years that I've been a customer (I know, I have contract issues, don't judge me). Thomas, my CS rep was quick to get my sim card ready, transfer all my staff and make sure I was getting all the discounts I could capture. Sure, he was a little weird and talked to himself as well as made weird noises- but hey! wouldn't YOU be a little crazy too if you had to work at the AT&T store? \n\nUnfortunately for Thomas, the sim card he gave me was a piece of crap and started failing on the spot. He had to get me a new one and re-do the whole data transfer. The whole transaction took me like 30mins at the store, equally painful for me and him but I left a happy customer- no contracts, slightly higher monthly pay and a new working phone with most of my data transferred. \n\nThis might have been the ONLY positive trip to an AT&T store I have ever had in my entire life. Good job Thomas, good job.
