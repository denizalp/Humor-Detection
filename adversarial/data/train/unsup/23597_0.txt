Nice little brewery tucked away on Freemont street (next to Heart Attack Grill). There is a small sitting area outside, and very clean inside. \n\n     I started off the night with the \"May Flowers,\" which is a Saison that was made with herbs and spices from the owners wife's garden. It was good, but decided to try a few other drinks. The \"PitchFork Peach Cider\" was my choice of the night, and it was pretty dang good. On a hot Vegas night it went down pretty smooth. It had a 6% alcohol level content, so it was just slightly above the average wheat beer.\n\n     They don't actually serve food inside the brewery, but there's an old man sitting outside the seating area cooking up some good bar food!! We had a couple of his French hot dogs, and some other beef snacks that I don't know how to pronounce or spell, but they looked like wontons with slices of sausage inside. They were bomb! He also served warm pretzels with your choice of cheese or mustard.\n\n      I'm glad I came across this hidden gem on Freemont street. We visit this part of town occasionally so you can bet your a** I'll be back!
