Beautiful view on the balcony of the water show that went off every 15 mins once the sun set.  The service was friendly and didn't rush us to take our time.  Their drinks - martinis were amazing- top notch mixology!  And they have an extensive selection of wines and beer.  The appetizers were a enough for 2\/3 people to share and pure deliciousness.  The soups was a great and even in the hot weather we couldn't get enough of it.  The prime rib was made to our liking, juice and full of flavor and it was enough food to share and feel perfectly full after.  It was a special place, busy, but great friendly service.  The decor was stunning and it was very clean.  The kitchen was open to see the chefs hard at work.  And the best part was I was surprised with an engagement ring... It was planned and the waiter treated us with a free desert to celebrate our special moment.  He also brought the champaign right after my Mr. Popped the question.  Perfectly timing and the crowd around us watched with clapping, smiles, and heartfelt congratulations. It was an unforgettable experience.  When in Vegas you must try the Lago experience, you won't be let down!!
