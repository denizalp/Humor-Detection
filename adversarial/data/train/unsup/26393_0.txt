Best dental experience I have had in a long time.   Dr. McDonald was very gentle and understanding.   Explained everything that was needed,  and how soon it was need.  Cheryl did my cleaning and my teeth do feel so much better.   I normally do not look forward to going to the dentist,  but this will definitely be my new office.
