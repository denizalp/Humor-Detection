I am soooo happy we found this place. The flavors were fresh, the colors bold, the plating beautiful. Really its a light happy kind of full. We tried the yellowtail sashimi ceviche, the lima samba roll, the sea bass anticuchos, the pork belly robata, and the mango tres leite. SOOOOOO Happy my favorites were the yellowtail ceviche it had a perfect little bite to it, just the right amount of heat and the lima roll was almost like butter in your mouth.
