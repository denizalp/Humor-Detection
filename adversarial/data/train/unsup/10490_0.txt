I was kinda on the fence about checking this place out because I heard a few bad things from people about their customer service, but I figured I'd check them out anyway. Maybe it was because I was direct and to the point, because I knew what I was doing, because I had a screaming fussy toddler in tow, or because I have boobs, but I was approached really quickly by the shop owner.\n\nI came in dragging my hubs because it was time to buy some bike helmets and he was sulking because he felt wearing one would ruin his rep of being a bad ass on his newly acquired hybrid with attached panniers (yes that's sarcasm). The owner let us all try on a variety of helmets until we found one that suited and fit us as well as let us check out the baby bike seats. We ended up picking up 3 helmets and a Copilot seat (cheapest on the Danforth by $40 including install by the way) and were out of there quickly with no fuss.\n\nUpon returning to the shop to have the seat installed, they asked me to come back an hour later - which I did, to discover that my bike hadn't been touched. The owner took one look at me and my tapping foot and installed it in about 10 minutes (why did you need an hour). To make up for it they also did a few adjustments that I had asked for without charging me.
