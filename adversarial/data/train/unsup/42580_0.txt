A few coworkers and I decided to visit La Palapa for lunch, none of us had been yet, and I couldn't remember the name for the life of me (kept referring to it as \"that place where Thai Me Up used to be\"). After walking for 15 minutes or so on a hot August afternoon to get here, we were pleased to find that they had A\/C, albeit a window unit above the door, but it kept the space cool enough that we were comfortable.\n\nThe first thing we noticed is the change in decor. Everything is brighter, the space feels a lot more open and welcoming. Our waiter was with us immediately, gave us menus, and quickly went down the list of drinks. One of the options was a pitcher of margarita mix, which means that as several other reviews have previously mentioned, they're BYOB and welcoming of your booze. Unfortunately, no margarita pitcher for us since we all had to head back to work before long.\n\nA couple orders for appetizers were put in - the beef empanada, and chips with guac. My first thought was that the chips and guac were a bit on the pricey side. When they came out, though, it was a healthy serving of chips clearly made on-site and a decent amount of guac, both of which tasted great and were worth the expense. The empanada was also good.\n\nFor a meal, I went with a beef quesadilla and chicken quesadilla, which were both delicious though I was partial to the beef. Also, the right amount of food - enough to satisfy, but not make me feel like I was rolling back to the office.\n\nOverall, definitely a nice experience, and we'll be back before long.
