The hotel claimed all the rooms were newly remodeled...not the case!  The bed was so uncomfortable I could not even sleep one minute. There was a slump which forced you in the middle of the bed which gave me a horrible back & neck ache. Also after I received my room key I was given another guests room key who was already occupying that room.  I walked in on her & she was terrified with good reason. The staff did not appear knowledgeable.  The restaurant was even worse.  If I could give this place a 1\/4 star I would!
