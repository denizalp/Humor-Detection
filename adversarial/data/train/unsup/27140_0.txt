One Liner: Good for lots of margaritas and food\n\nFood: (scale of 0-4) 2.2\nYou get a lot of food for very little damage. The salsa is awesome. The hot salsa taste a bit more chemical and it isn't really hotter either. Whatever you order, you get plenty of food. This is a great place for getting full while getting some margaritas. \n\nExtras: (Scale of 0-1)  0.7\n\nService 0.2:\n \nDecor 0.1: \n\nSpeed 0.1: \n\nDessert 0.1: \n\nPrices 0.2: \n\nMy score for this experience is 2.9 stars.
