If you ever go to Heinz Field, don't leave without doing a tour of the stadium, regardless of the team you are rooting for. \n\nYou get to learn about the history, see the locker room, pose for photos, slap the metal plate for good luck as you walk out, and look at the memorabilia. \n\nMost of the catered food including quesadillas, sliders, tacos, and kebabs were too spicy for me. I enjoyed snacking on cheese plates. They also make the best funnel cake fries!
