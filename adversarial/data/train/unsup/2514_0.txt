This spot may very well have one of the best resto names in the city: Lola's Commissary (heretofore known as \"LC\"). Luckily for those Torontonians who consider brunch a sport, they also have one of the best brunches I've ever had.\n\nThanksbeto the TTC, it took nearly an hour to get there (!), so I had plenty of time to work up an appetite. Just north of Charles Street, LC is located in a small strip of restos and shops along Church Street. It's open, airy and inviting ( especially on days that are so cold that you almost fall down from numb legs). There are large windows that allow tons of light to stream in. I was happily greeted straight away. \n\nThe brunch menu had several choices, including mushroom risotto, nutella\/banana\/white chocolate chip French toast (um, yes please!), and, my choice, salsa poached eggs. They also have a \"regular\" menu from which to order brunch that looked equally delish. The only downfall to the specials is that they aren't served with the \"sexy potatoes\", which I really wanted to try, but for which I really didn't want to pay an extra $6.    \n\nLong time readers of my Yelp reviews know that when I brunch, I like to order a little \"something sweet\", usually in the form of a single pancake or piece of french toast. In all the places I've eaten in T.O., I've never been told that I couldn't be accommodated. Until today. I asked if they would do a single piece of French toast, or at least a half order, but was told they \"don't do that here\". Not a huge deal and I respect that, but how hard is it to fix just one piece of toast instead of two? Anyway.\n\nOn to the crowning glory: the eggs! The salsa poached eggs were wicked, wicked good. I nearly cried, they were so good! In fact, I haven't had \"Mexican\"-style eggs this good since I left Texas. Perfectly flavored, they had an appropriate amount of heat and spice. Served in a very hot bowl (!) with avocado slices, black beans, and delicious homemade tortilla chips on the side, the eggs had the perfect amount of \"run\" to them. The spicy tomato broth that the eggs were served in was seriously tasty.  \n\nService was quick and attentive. My bill came to $21 with tip, which I think is a little high for a cup of tea and a poached egg, but price notwithstanding, LC is a definite must-stop spot on the TO brunch circuit. Run, don't walk, and eat there! Hurry!
