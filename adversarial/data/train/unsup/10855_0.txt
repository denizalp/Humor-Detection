Stopped by on a whim and gave it a try. I'm not usually big on vaping and most stores can tell. My old cheap battery had been on its way out to die now for a few months. Most places haven't been really clear on telling me what is what. These guys sat me down and helped me see the differences between the regular battery and tank set ups and some of the new mods. They have great flavors to try and super friendly people working there. He even showed me how all the buttons worked before we left.
