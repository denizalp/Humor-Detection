I had the blue ribbon sandwich and very much enjoyed it!  The sandwich was very tasty and the ingredients were very fresh.  There are some great honey sauces that are offered at the restaurant that go great with the chicken. The staff was impeccable especially for this style restaurant.  I would definitely go back!
