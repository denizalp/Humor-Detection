Great food.  We were there on a Saturday evening and it was very busy. However, we were able to get a table four 4 adults and 2 children.  Ordered the chicken wings with the house sauce, outstanding for the appetizer.  Just enough to take off the hunger edge.  My daughter in low ordered the Lemongrass chicken, she said it was very good.m Son ordered the shrimp dinner with rice and pho soup and salad, hubby had the BBQ Pork, shrimp and sausage fried rich, outstanding he said!  Ii had the shrimp stir fry, also outstanding.  We enjoyed it so much and would order the same except we all want to try a different entree when we come back.\n\nSuggest the Lemon Soda as a drink, our grandson had it and it was very tasty.  It was made from scratch with real lemons.  Great place to go in the Northwest Phoenix Valley.
