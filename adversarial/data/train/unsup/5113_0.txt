***This pharmacy gets busy, but it is good to have a shop like this on The Strip, which allows you to pick up a needed toiletry or other item (that is probably much cheaper than what you will find at casino gift shops)***\n\nLocated in between Monte Carlo and City Center, this CVS is pretty big and has a lot of stuff that travelers may need (it was sunscreen for me).\n\nEven though this CVS is probably more expensive than your local CVS, this Vegas option is a convenient shop when you forget something or need to replenish.  It should also provide a big savings over the expensive casino gift shops.
