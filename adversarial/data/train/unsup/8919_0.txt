I can't believe I didn't give this location a chance earlier based on reading the low ratings.  I love Chipotle and up until yesterday my favourite location was Don Mills and as of today, tadaaaa, it's this location. \n\nI can't say enough great things about this location.  My husband got take out for us and the gentleman serving him was very friendly and personable, which we really appreciate especially in a fast-food type environment.  We ordered two chicken salad plus rice bowls and the portions were very generous, chicken was very flavourful in consistent with other locations, lettuce, rice, beans, corn and guacamole were very fresh.  \n\nI urge readers to not let the other low rating reviews discourage you from going like it did to me.  I'm so happy that we gave it a chance and it's only 10 minutes away from home!  Husband and I are making it a weekly thing to order this every Friday.
