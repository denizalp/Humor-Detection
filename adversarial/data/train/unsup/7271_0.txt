Coworkers during this past weekend drug me here for lunch as some were in the mood for wings. I mean let's face it, aren't we all in the mood for wings from time to time? Save those evil Vegans, of course. Nevertheless, beins' I'm from out of town and never heard of this joint I agreed, and I was pleased! \n\nMind you, I opted out of the wing mode and opted in to a sandwich. I know, sacrilegious right? I chose JD Salinger's sandwich, Turkey in the Rye - Grilled marble rye bread, stacked with chopped turkey, Swiss cheese, tangy coleslaw, and honey mustard dressing. It rocked! And I did not regret my choice one bit! \n\nWe sat in the bar with so many TV screens to look at I was confused as to where I should focus! It was nice, though, good service from Amber, and a good vibe all around. \n\n\"I ordered a Scotch and soda, and told him not to mix it--I said it fast as hell, because if you hem and haw, they think you're under twenty-one and won't sell you any intoxicating liquor. I had trouble with him anyway, though. \"I'm sorry, sir,\" he said, \"but do you have some verification of your age? Your driver's license, perhaps?\" I gave him this very cold stare, like he'd insulted the hell out of me, and asked him, \"Do I look like I'm under twenty-one?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir, but we have our--\"\n\nNo, unlike Holden Caulfield's attempt at ordering alcohol, we were in uniform, so I settled for an Arnold Palmer. However, if it were evening hours I think this place would satiate anyone's thirst. And for full disclosure, I did try one of my friend's wings, and it was pretty good! So next time around, I think I might dive in and try a plate full of some honey hot wings, and so should you!
