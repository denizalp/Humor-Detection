Be very careful of this company as they are extremely money hungry.  If you are unable to fulfill your contract they will make you pay every last penny and aren't willing to let you out of the contract even if you're hurt and can't train.  They obviously only care about money and have very little regard for your circumstances or well being.  It's simply, \"you signed the contact so pay us our money no matter what\".   Go elsewhere, avoid this place.
