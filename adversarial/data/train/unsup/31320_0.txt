The food is absolutely delicious! I am a huge fan of the garlic shrimp pizza. For the appetizer I loved the chicken quesadilla which I happily took leftovers home. Most of the reviews complain about customer service, but from what I noted and saw you need to get your lazy butt up to ask. As we had zero problems getting items and refills as needed. It has a comfort home vibe, but steered to all age groups. I am sure the older generations are use to be waited on, but that doesn't seem to be how this place functions. Definitely recommend giving it a shot before quick judgment and observe how the place works as it is more cafe style like hanging out at a coffee shop or bar.
