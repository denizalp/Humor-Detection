I have to give it up to Misti Y. TSNH is the realness!! I have been looking for some good Thai food, so I decided I would try this place out after reading a lot of the stellar reviews on it. \n\nI will dare say that this place is the next best thing to eating in Thailand, & I know because I have been there more than a few times ;) \n\nI had the chicken noodle soup with a combo of flat & egg noodles, which is just as good as you can get from the best street vendors in Thailand! The broth was definitely very flavorful & they give you all the great condiments to go with it. The sliced peppers in vinegar are awesome! However, it could have used a little more sprouts, cilantro & green onions in the soup. That would be my only request :) \n\nThat is the best part about the street vendors, everything on their carts are fresh & plentiful & you can add as much & whatever you like & as many noodle combinations as you want in your soup. \n\nMy date du jour had the pineapple fried rice & from the look on her face & her comments, she really enjoyed it. After we finished the main course, we decided to split the fried bananas with ice cream & drizzled with honey. WOW!! That delicious little dish is what earned that 5th star :D \n\nI also ordered some pork chow mein to take home with me, cuz I gots to have my noodles! I F**K's with them noodles! I F**K's with them hard!! I have to say, it wasn't bad. \n\nOverall, I would totally recommend this place. The seating is pretty limited & close enough quarters that you can hear every ones conversations :P The decor is almost nonexistent, but who cares, it's a great little spot to enjoy some great food. The wait staff is outstanding in my opinion, very pleasant & helpful. I will definitely be a regular at this place & will not mind the 15-20 minute drive whatsoever ;)
