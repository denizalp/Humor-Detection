It's all about the patio....and the wine! I've also been coming here since I was a kid. I grew up here, and it was a treat to get to come down here for sandwiches.\n\nNow that I am an adult (almost), I love coming here and just enjoying a leisurely meal on the patio. Of course, it is better when the weather is cooler. I can enjoy a nice lunch with my mom here after we have been out on one of our shopping excursions. \n\nI also came here a few months ago with a childhood friend who was in town with her 16 month old daughter. The patio was great because we could eat and talk, and her daughter was amused by everything going on there. She could walk around a little, and try to eat leaves off the ground, which kept her happy and amused while we caught up. Of course we didn't let her actually eat the leaves. ;)\n\nI have never had a bad sandwich here, and they have a wine bar. What else could you ask for? Well, I do wish it was closer to home so I could go more often, but other than that, I love it!
