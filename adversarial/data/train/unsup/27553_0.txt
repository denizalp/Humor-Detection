We were strolling the streets of Fremont and ended up on this row of bars. We were walking by to see which place spoke to us. As we got to the end of this one block we came across Eureka! and it seemed to look fun and inviting. Not to mention it was filled w\/ people, unlike some of the other places we passed by. Typically if a place is busy, it's gotta be good right? \n\nWe walked in and the hostess let us know the wait time. We asked if food could be served at the bar. Once we found out it could be, we attempted to find a place at the bar. As I looked around one of the bartender's, Ashley, raised her hand to get my attention. Once I saw this, she pointed to 2 open seats. As we sat down Ashley greeted us w\/ a smile. She asked if it was our first time. When she found out it was our first time she welcomed us and thank us for coming in. That felt really nice because not many places instill that in hospitality staff now a days. \n\nWhen she asked if we wanted to drink, we both had no clue. I told Ashley I wasn't much of a beer drinker, so I didn't know more than half that was on the list. I saw that their whiskey list was more my speed, but again there were some on there that I didn't know either. When we asked Ashley what a beer or whiskey tasted like, she was kind enough to take the time to drop some knowledge on us. \n\nIn the end I said this is the type of beers and whiskeys I drink. Ashley said, I recommend these. She was spot on w\/ her suggestions. We didn't end up eating here due change of plans, but we def would like to come back based off of how friendly Ashley was w\/ our first time being there and newbies to so many of the drink options. That left a lasting impression on us.
