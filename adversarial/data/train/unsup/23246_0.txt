Decent selection of fresh-baked Asian pastries and a few cakes thrown in for good measures- majority of selection is buns (coconut, red bean, taro, egg, pork) and some breakfast foods (ham and cheese, scallion and ham, hotdog). Most treats are priced at either $1.25 or $1.75, with a $10 card minimum, so take cash unless you're feeding an army.\nEverything is made fresh daily, in house, and wrapped in individual cellophane wrappers before being put out for sale. If you want something specific, best to get there early- by lunch they're usually out of a few things. There's a cooler of drinks (including chilled Starbucks) towards the back and only one or two small tables to dine-in.
