We used the Door Dash app to order from Cantina Laredo. I am pregnant and was really craving some Mexican food. I have to say I was pretty disappointed :( my husband ordered the chicken enchiladas, with no description we assumed we were getting normal chicken enchiladas but they came with a sour cream sauce, which he's not a fan of so he didn't really get to eat. I ordered one of the combinations. The Cozumel. The Chili Relleno was not cooked as a normal one would be, the chicken enchalada was ok.. and the ground beef enchalada with chili was just weird. The rice was good, but the beans.. ugh how do you screw up refried beans?!?! So much bacon, YUCK! \n\nAbout the only thing I would go back for is there chips and salsa.. \n\nProbably not a place I will go back to.. \n\nAlso, if your going use an app like Door Dash I highly recommend the restaurant add a good description!
