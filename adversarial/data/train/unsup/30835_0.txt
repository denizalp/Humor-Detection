Desserts were yummy & decently priced. It is worth checking out just so you know what all the hype is about. But beware the candy by the pound, it is way over priced... And $20 bling lollipops... Seriously? We had a meal here once, it was ok, but definitely not worth coming back for especially for the price. This is more a one time thing, just so you can say I've been there, done that.
