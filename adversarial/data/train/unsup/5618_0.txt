One of my good friends treated me out for a belated birthday dinner, and I really wish I picked somewhere else. I'm not sure if this is another Tofu Hut or is it owned by Doh? I don't like Tofu Hut, but if you're a fan then this might be a good spot for you because this is what their quality of meat reminded me of. For 20 dollars per person I would rather go to Hwaro. To begin, my friend and I ordered beef brisket, pork belly, and two steamed eggs. We got the brisket first, but turns out it wasn't brisket... it was beef tongue.. GROSS. I hate beef tongue and so does my friend.  The taste of beef tongue haunted me the rest of the night. They tried covering their mistake by saying it was brisket but we could taste it wasn't, which was really annoying. We had to remind our server to give us our pork belly, and half way through our meal we finally got our steamed eggs but we had to remind him. Our server was extremely forgetful, and it was truly a bothersome to remind him about every single thing. The interior is nice though, it reminds me of Korea but that is about the only good thing about this restaurant.
