I have no idea how I have managed to avoid this place for so long. I worked RIGHT across the street from Greek Wraps for 6 years and never made my way over. This will be one of my greatest regrets in life because this is some of the freshest, friendliest, most delicious food I have had here on the Westside! The staff was super friendly and helpful. I am not super familiar with Greek food so they pointed me in the right direction. I knew one thing, I wanted a \"gyro,\" and one of the best decisions I made was to listen to the guy at the counter when he said \"I recommend the 'wrap' instead of the pita\" He said the wrap was made fresh, they take the doe, put it on the hot plate, cook it, then wrap your food in it. It was SO GOOD! I ended up with the Steak Shawarma. The lettuce, tomatoes, onions, steak, and of course the wrap were so fresh. The meat was crazy flavorful and not grisly at all. There was just the right amount of hummus and garlic sauce. The portion was huge. I ended up taking 1\/2 home, as they said I would. I also gave the Falafel with Hummus Dip a try. The Hummus was velvety smooth, not lumpy or grainy. The Falafel was fresh, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was the perfect way to start my meal. \n\nI am pretty sure this is going to be my go to spot for a fast, good, very affordable, fresh meal from now on. This will be where I try all the Greek food I can for the first time. I cant wait to show my family this place and keep trying new foods. I am really disappointed in myself for not giving this place a try sooner. I have been missing out for sure. Not any more!
