Churn is a cute little gourmet ice cream shop in central Phoenix. They are located on Central Avenue near Camelback. The location has very limited parking and a difficult street access.\n\nIf you make it inside prepare for a long wait. The shop resembles an old fashioned ice cream parlor with a modern twist. Those that brave the parking and line will be rewarded with a good selection of fresh and delicious ice cream. Churn has the standard flavors and a selection of rotating specialties. Coffee and candy are also available.\n\nI chose the butter pecan in a pretzel cone. The pretzel cone costs extra but is a perfect salty addition to the butter pecan and similar flavors. It has a plastic sleeve to help keep things clean.\n\nChurn is really 4.5 stars losing a bit for minor hassles and a slightly grainy ice cream base, but this is still an excellent ice cream option in Phoenix and should be part of anyone's list.
