Every time I walk into Tasty Joe's, I feel as though I am in a chain restaurant.  The place is laid out like it is ready for franchising:   The menu is posted on the wall and is very limited.  You walk up to a cashier and place your order.   The table layout is very predictable.  Very neutral decor (lacks ethnic flair).  Again, very chain-like.  \n\nHowever, the food is very fresh - everything is made to order. I've tried five different dishes and have generally been pleased.  The only thing that keeps me from giving a higher rating is that something is missing from each dish.  Some basic seasoning, whether it be salt, soy sauce, or pepper needs to be added.  Another way of syaing it would to that there is no \"pop\" to the food.\n\nPortions are generous and prices are very reasonable.  All-in-all, Tasty Joe's is going to stay on my list of places to go.
