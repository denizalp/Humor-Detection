Saw Ed Sheehan last night and it was amazing! The T-Mobile arena is centrally located on the Strip, but this is both a blessing and a curse because the traffic getting in and out is a nightmare. My fix to this is to valet somewhere and then grab a bite to eat afterwards at the same property I valet at. The venue had great sound\/acoustics, and the drinks were strong. As a side plug- the concert was AMAZING and if you get a chance to, go see Ed Sheeran. He is a true musician and builds every song from scratch right in front of you! Anyways, back to T-Mobile- the food options were between than what you find at other large venues in Vegas, and while the prices were a bit high, the portions were reflective of that. I would definitely see something at this venue again!
