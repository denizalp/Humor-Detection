This is a really nice restaurant and we will be back. The restaurant is very nice almost contemporarily formal inside with a great outdoor porch. The menu is diverse with beef, fish, and chicken dishes as well as salads and sandwiches.  The service was amazingly fast. The reason that it only warrants 3 stars is that for the high end prices, the portions are on the modest side and all of our dishes were cooked just a little off. The deviled eggs were salty, the chicken was dry, the beef was tough, the mac and cheese was rubbery. Not inedible, just not great. We will return, this was a fun place, but I wanted to provide you with both sides of the meal. Fun place, just ok food.
