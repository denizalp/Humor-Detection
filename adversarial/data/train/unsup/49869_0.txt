I've been seeing this place as I walk Bloor street. It wasn't too busy when I walked in on a hot day to get a cone. The flavour choices were very minimal but that's how I like it to be. When there's too many to choose from it takes me forever. I chose to give Earl Grey a try. I was not regretful at all. The flavour is so rich and delicious. A single scoop of this got me a long way. I highly recommend this place.
