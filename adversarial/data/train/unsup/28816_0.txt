I had a great first experience here. I have never been to the chiropractor before and really needed an adjustment for my neck because I can't crack it myself and it's been giving me a lot of headache. Since I was a first timer it was only $19 for my first visit. I was super scared but the older gentlemen talked me through it and did amazing. It felt amazing and he made me feel very comfortable. I will definitely be going back. Next visit is $29 but they seem to have a lot of good plans to save you some money.
