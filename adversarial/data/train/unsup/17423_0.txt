At home in the Bay, my shop is Fresh Cuts and my barber is Josh.\n\nWhile in Vegas this week, I needed a beard trim and purely by accident, found this Fresh Cuts. My appointment, made through an app I've never heard of nor do I remember, I was dispatched to this location by accident. Long story short, I was supposed to be across town, but these guys made time for me. The barber that helped me out was Josh. Cue the X Files music.\n\nJosh was super cool and very thorough, asking a lot of questions to make sure my goatee was trimmed just the way I wanted it. He took his time and did a great job. He trimmed it, shaped it and finished it with the straight edge razor. I looked at it in the mirror and was really impressed with the new look and he did a long look again and noticed a few areas that needed some more trimming and kept working on it. I am a really big fan of perfectionists and Josh is definitely a perfectionist. He wanted to make sure I was looking prime and proper for my last day in Vegas and when I left the shop, I felt like a regular customer and that's definitely what out of towners are looking for.
