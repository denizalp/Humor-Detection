Great food!  Don't let other reviews sway you with the words \"authentic\".  It is Americanized Asian food.  I hate it when people try to call things like sweet and sour chicken \"authentic\".  That being said it is amazingly good at non authentic Asian! \n\nPros - Great taste, portions are just right.\n\nCons - They don't take reservations and the wait can be lengthy at times.  Also, I've been there 5 times now over 3 years and the service is ALWAYS slow.  It's tough to get a refill on anything.  \n\nNote- i'm knocking them down a star due to my recent visit.  They had a magician entertaining a table of girls.  Every time the guy did a trick the girls would literally scream and laugh at the top of their lungs.  It was very distracting.  I know it's vegas and I know it's a Casino but it was excessive and clearly many people thought it distracting as well.
