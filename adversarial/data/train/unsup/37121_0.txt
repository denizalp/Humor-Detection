The view is very pretty if you sent out on the patio. It's right by the Wynn's pool and I guess it could be kind of awkward watching people swim as you eat, but hey the view of the pool is pretty! The only bad thing is that there are these black birds flying over you and picking off the food leftover on the table. \n\nWhat we got:\nBenedict Trio ($24): it was your choice of either pulled pork, lobster, and traditional. You could pick one of each or pick whatever of the 3 you wanted. I ended up getting one of each just so I could try them all. Eggs were cooked perfectly for each of them, once you cut into them, the yolk started flowing out. For the pulled pork...pork was kind of hard and chewy which made it hard to cut. Lobster was pretty good, but left a bad aftertaste. The traditional was bland and didn't have much flavor to it. The hollandaise sauce on it tasted bland too and didn't do the dish any justice.\n\nFried Chicken and Waffle ($20): I would have rather gotten this dish than any of the Benedicts. It came with a spicy maple syrup so it gave the waffle a nice kick to it with it being sweet and spicy. The chicken was perfectly fried and crunchy. I would totally get this dish again if I ever came back.\n\nService:\nI forgot our servers name, but she was nice. She didn't come all that often and there were other people taking care of us and getting us things that we needed.
