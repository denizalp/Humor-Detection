Wish I could give negative stars! The applicants that are here are bright shiny, well prepped and professional. The woman from Abercrombie was lovely. But....the organizers today are well into their 80's with mobility and diction struggles. I feel so bad for them! They really don't know what to do. They don't know how to use the iPad they are checking candidates In on (hunt peck struggle get confused then say \"this thing is acting up\") I asked why the companies listed on the career site website aren't here? The 2 employees have never seen their companies web site. They thought I could contact their company to help them.....\nMany talented Chicago professionals looking for jobs, only to be shocked by this ho hum dismal event!
