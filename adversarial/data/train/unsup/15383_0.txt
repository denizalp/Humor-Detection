If I was just reviewing the product and prices, it would get 5 stars. This place has unbelievable specials. They were running a Sunday special for $7.77 a gram plus tax. The set up and service is the thing that is lacking. There was a 3 hour wait just to get in the back. Once you pick out your meds? You go to a small room and wait for your product to be weighed. The problem is there is no system for the order once you are in the room. Patients were bickering about who was next. Once I did get to my turn, I had to wait for each strain to be weighed and packages individually. Not having prepackaged good is a blessing and a curse. The girls behind the counter were obviously stressed out and people waiting their turn were complaining about how long it was taking me as I was trying each strain. All together, the visit took about 4 hours. I have to say it was worth it because of the price. They can't help that the patients are low class and look to be homeless. Prices are great and selection is awesome. Just make sure you have free time if you are there on a busy day
