I saw the bad review posted here and was quite concerned as it may have reflected the rare bad day we are all subject to once in a while. We have taken our little poodle  to Dr.  McComb for about 9 years.  Dr. McComb just operated on our dog's orthopedic issues in his neck. Everything went very very well, our little guy was treated in the best possible way . (The doctor even let me go in the recovery room to comfort my dog.) It was serous surgery but our dog is doing GREAT now.\nWe do have to see Dr. Mc Comb  fairly often as our dog  has several issues that require frequent visits. Dr. McComb is an excellent diagnostician and a very skilled surgeon . We send many people there with confidence.  Everyone we have sent there has had nothing but very good things to say. If you get the right Vet ..you save money because the malady is identified  and treated sooner and the animal suffers alot less.  Our experience at Crossroads Clinic has been very good and very consistent . \nPlease give another chance to someone who might have had a bad day or maybe is not feeling well on that day. At least do it for your pet.
