Probably going to be one of my new brunch spots when I am in town.  The restaurant is nice, but the patio is beautiful.  I imagine once the weather cools down it will be packed!  \n\nI was attracted by the brunch drink specials that they have.  I was looking for something other than bottomless mimosas and found it.  They offer $4 margaritas, mimosas, sangrias, bloody maries and micheladas.  They had a blended sangria that day that was delicious!  I hope they keep it on the menu. My favorite was the margarita, though.  \n\nWe ordered the El Americano, the Steak Ranchero and the Barbacoa Hash. All good.  I look forward to trying more of their dishes.\n\nThe service was top notch!  Service with a smile!
