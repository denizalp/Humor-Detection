We came in on a busy Friday night and lucked out with two seats at the bar. \n\nWe ordered the white sangria and bacon wrapped dates as happy hour was about to end. The dates were SO good. White sangria was kind of odd... But not bad.\n\nWe split a Caesar salad and the bone in rib eye. They were very accommodating about splitting the food and everything was split prior to us receiving it. \n\nThe rib eye was cooked a smidge under medium but it was so good, it didn't even matter. The potatoes were very crunchy and yummy too!\n\nOur bartender was a very friendly man as well, and he made the experience even better!\n\nMy boyfriend is not much of a foodie, but he absolutely loved this place. So that's saying a lot!
