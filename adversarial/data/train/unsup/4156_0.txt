I have been frequenting T'cooks bar for 6 years now.  The core of the staff has remained the same, which is quite uncommon in the food and beverage world.  There is a bartender \/ bar manager \/ all around good guy, by the name of Jason, that u must ask for....don't tell him I sent ya ;-)  Jeremy and Eric back him up on busy evenings and his nights off.  The food at this joint is at first glance small portions but I assure you, hungry will not be in your vocab upon completion of any entree.  My favorite, and it is back on the menu, is the lobster tortilini.  It is not cheap but it is so friggin' worth it!  paired with a nice white wine or if you've got some more hair on yur b@!!s than I do, maybe something stronger.  They've got every brand and make of gasoline you could ever hope for.  When finished be sure to have some cream cheese brulee with an espresso martini.  Talk about a little jolt of a libation...this will get your eyes poppin' for sure...\n\nT'Cooks is the top notch eating outlet in the Royal Palms Resort.  And if you have not already heard about the architecture and landscaping on the resorts 9 acres...be sure to take a little stroll.\n\nIf your with a date, this place is a sure fire closer!  If you can't close here...just go home and stop dating altogether.
