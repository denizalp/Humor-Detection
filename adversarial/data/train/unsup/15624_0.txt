Besides the sports book, I hardly ever feel the need to gamble in Vegas.  It's probably not for the best that I've become entirely enamored with the dealers at Hard Rock.  Even if I'm loosing money, it think it might be worth hanging out at the poker tables just to banter with them.  If someone would like to bankroll this habit or let me accessorize them while they play, I'd be more than happy to be your good luck charm.
