A friend took me here exclaiming \"this place is f ' n awesome \".  Although very good, wouldn't say \"awesome\". I had the Kung pao chicken, chow fun, and Chinese broccoli, all were good, but nothing really stood out. I do wish the Kung pao was spicer, but I did ask for it spicy, I assumed it would be. \nThe place is a hole in the wall in Chinatown (I didn't even know Vegas had one).  Easy parking, very reasonable prices (CASH ONLY).  Good eats though.
