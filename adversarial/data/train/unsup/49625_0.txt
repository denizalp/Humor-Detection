I have never lived in a more accommodating complex. This place and there management is on top of it. Things are fixed in a timely manner and done so by a professional maintenance crew. It is affordable, clean and the location is amazing. I have great neighbors with no drama. I highly recommend this complex.  Thank you James and staff for a great two years here.
