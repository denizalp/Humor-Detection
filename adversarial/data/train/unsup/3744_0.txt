If you want to see a Soprano's type of restaurant this IS THE PLACE!!!\n    we had a 6:30 reso which was great cuz we got to see everyone coming in. I felt like I was in New Jersey~ \n   We started with cocktails martini's, manhattans, bourbon on the rocks. We all thought ours was the best  with cocktails we had fried calamari. Lightly deep fried & plentiful for 5 people.\n    Spaghetti Bolonese, pork tenderloin, spaghetti carbonara, also with meat balls & sausage and lastly the sole Parmesan. All COMPLETELY DEEEEELISH! Not one comment about this could have better if this or that......\n     EVERYTHING was SPOT ON!!!! Our server Rene, a great addition to our evening. Playful & professional, recommendations well received and not overly UPSELLING! (GOD, I HATE that!!!!!) out food runner was fun too and the busser, Juan joined the fun too.\n   This was a casual night that turned out to be a blast. While if you in your 20's it might not be your style however we 50+ had a ball and the band was a supreme delight.  Imagine music during dinner where you could enjoy your food, talk & listen without shouting or getting a headache.\n   Nice memorabiliaon the walls and it doesn't have that old musty feeling. Myself and another gal walked outside first while the guys were still inside and the valet actually walked us to our car about 8 ft away and he wasn't even creepy....yet ANOTHER nice touch.\n    This is a real find, GO GO GO!! Call ahead I think their hours are Thurs - Sun?? The BEST ITALIAN  FOOD I have had some coming to the valley. Such a great night
