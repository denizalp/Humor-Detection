I LOVE seafood so I was super excited to come here using my Buffet of Buffet passes ($10 extra). I think it was definitely worth the $10 especially if you love lobster, oysters, and crawfish. Those were the three main things I stuffed my belly with at this buffet. Yes, there is a short line for the lobster, but it goes by quick and they refill the lobster trays very quickly. I didn't bother with the crab legs since I figured every other buffet in Vegas has crab legs, but my mom had them and said they were good. Definitely come here for dinner and take your time eating. You won't be disappointed if you love seafood :)
