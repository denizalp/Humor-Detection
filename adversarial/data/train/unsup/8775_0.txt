For the most part, a decent show - this isn't big money, big theatre, and we knew that going in  - we just wanted something lowkey to enjoy.  Most of the acts, host included, delivered that.\n\nMost, I say, because one thought it would be funny to make light of his \"new foreign friends\" in the audience - and by that, I mean the dozen of us that were there to celebrate my mom's birthday.  When trying to give instructions, they couldn't hear - not couldn't understand.  So what a sour taste to leave in our mouths, and what a disappointment to get a person who would joke on race just to get a laugh.\n\nI would recommend this show if he's not there.
