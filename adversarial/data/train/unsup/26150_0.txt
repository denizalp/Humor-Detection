My feelings on this restaurant are a little split...so let's just get into it. \n\nBeing in Surprise I understand that prices are going to be on the higher side. So, that is a downfall. \n\nThe food was good, just good. Not fantastic or anything I would be craving for. I ordered the small bowl of pho dac biet which was okay but lacking the real depth of the beef flavor. Hubby order the firecracker shrimp with garlic noodles (which I do recommend) \n\nI noticed that there wasn't traditional Vietnamese fare such as banh xeo, soybean milk, and the rice plates did not offered shredded pork or meatloaf. \n\nAll in all, food was good. If you're looking to try some ethnic food that is a little easier on the western palate this is the place to try. However,  if you want traditional \"straight out of mama's kitchen\" type food I would definitely make the drive the 17th Ave and Camelback to Pho Thanh.
