this company seemed great  the quoted  me 150 dollars less a month than other companie so i switched over ,i have quite a few cars so i now pay $800 with progressive , all was good until 5 months later when i get into a small accident on my jetski in a lake ,i damaged the bottom of my ski and it took on a little  water , no big  deal right? i called them and filed a claim   (keep in mind i have this ski  insured under my policy  and its under my name)  at first they were happy to help  then i get assigned an adjuster  some asian dude named  CHUNG Y YAN , but goes by EDWIN for some reason , anyways this guy starts being rude and condescending and treats me like im a criminal , asking  all sorts of weird questions , and demands, i give them all sorts of information , he calls 2 of my buddies that were at the lake with me  and harasses them asking millions of questions about what happened that day at the lake ,  they tell him exactly what happened , they even asked them what we had for lunch   (what the heck does that even matter ) now almost a month  has  gone by and my ski is still at the boat  shop collecting dust  and storage fee s this company keeps giving me the run around and is not going to cover my damages to the ski that i pay for them to insure  so im going to have to pay $7500 out of pocket to get the ski fixed  and who knows how much those storage fees are gonna be ,    DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY
