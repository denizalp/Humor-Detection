I always come to this theater. It's always clean and the staff is friendly and sociable.  Tuesday's are only $5 all day.  The snacks are always fresh.  It's been a couple of months since I've been in here and I see they have updated theaters 1-8. Cushy reclining seats .  Seems like theaters 9-16 are under current renovation since that wing is blocked off.  In my opinion this is the best theater in NE Ohio.
