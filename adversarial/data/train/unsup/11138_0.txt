Obstructed view, uncomfortable seating on balcony; metal barstools about 7\" around with no back. Not good for my daughter who is disabled. Or my Dads girlfriend who is a senior. Combine the fact that they call a barstool they pulled out from the bar a seat, the obstructed view, annoying female host, poor storyline and the lack of men removing clothes, they don't dance anything like magic mike the movie, they don't come up to the balcony and drinks are over priced 2 for $55. \n\nIf you want Chippendales or Thunder Down Under type of experience this is NOT it. If your taking your daughter or anyone to their first male revue count this out. It's a tacky boring overpriced show with little regard for the comfort of guests. I'm absolutely so frustrated with the experience I'm filing complaint with Hard Rock Hotel to try and be reimbursed as my daughter was in so much pain from the seating that we left early. She's still injured.
