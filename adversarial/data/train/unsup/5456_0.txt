Taco Guild is not my type of church. Yea, the theme and the concept is kinda cool, but the layout was off and it was so loud during lunch that I couldn't even hear the person next to me. It got really busy and there was a group that wasn't attended to at the host stand so they were just looking for a table to sit - which they decided to sit at one of the long tables where two people were already dining at. Very unorganized. Service was mediocre. Food was not that great. I had guacamole and chips, the Mexican corn and the taco trio plate: duck, shrimp and Ono.I took one bite of each of the tacos and corn and only could consume all of the shrimp taco. Corn was drenched with mayo and the Ono and duck taco were bland. Guacamole was ok, salsa I liked. Overall, I probably will not be going to this church anymore.
