18 months ago I had not run further than the distance between the couch and the fridge in 15 years.\n\nAfter a fairly significant weight loss start, A friend (??) convinced me to do a triathlon, for which I needed to run, imagine that.\n\nI decided to take a Learn to Run course at the Running Room and I was hooked.\n\nThe staff is great, the runners are friendly, and they have a water cooler. What more do you need.\n\nNow, 18 months later I have taken a Learn to Run, a 5k Clinic, been a group leader countless times, and now am one of the 5k Clinic Instructors.\n\nRina (Manager) and Joanne (Assistant Manager) are great. If you ever have any questions they are always approachable and helpful.\n\nLove it.\n\nPlus I get to get out and away from my kids 3 times a week to go down running. Sweet. sweet break.
