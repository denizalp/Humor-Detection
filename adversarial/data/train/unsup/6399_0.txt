With its scarred wood tables, friendly staff, blaring sports games, and dim lighting, Murphy's is a local institution.  It's also where history graduate students tend to congregate once a week, huzzah.  The beer\/food specials are generally fantastic, and the grimy feel of the bar is palatable after a drink or two.  One caveat: they have the nastiest--nastiest bathroom.  It's hideous.  Ugh.
