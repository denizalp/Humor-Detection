This is by far the worst library I've ever been to. We came in around 4 or 5 on a weekday afternoon and we immediately noticed there was no seating. We had to wait for someone to leave just so we could sit down and do some work. The second thing we noticed was the sound. There were literally kids screaming and running around. I will bet that ANY Mcdonalds play place is quieter than here. The architecture of the building makes things echo so when people were conversing it sounded like the inside of a middle school cafeteria. It was impossible to focus and we ended up driving 10 minutes away to the Mesa red mountain library. My other complaint is that they do not offer guest passes on their computers but that wasn't a huge deal. I only gave it two stars because it is pretty big so I'm guessing they have a good assortment of books, and the lake front view was nice ( too bad there were no seats next to it). So if you only need to grab a book and leave this library will suit you. I am never coming back here and would highly not recommend this library for someone to do work at. You're way better off working at a Starbucks or even a Mcdonalds play pen.
