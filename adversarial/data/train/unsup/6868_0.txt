One of the best burgers I've ever had!\n\nWe were in Beachwood Ohio one Saturday afternoon and decided to hop over to nearby Woodmere, Ohio to check out B Spot.\n\nI had the New Jack City burger which comes with chorizo sausage, avocado, salsa verde, roasted red peppers, red onion and pepperjack cheese. It was simply spectacular! My wife had the Fat Doug burger which comes with coleslaw, pastrami, Swiss cheese and mustard. She loved hers also. Our daughter had the Bacon Cheeseburger which comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, bacon and your choice of cheese. She loved hers as well. We eventually each passed our burgers around to get a bite of the different burgers and to sample what each other got. The quality of not only the meat but, also the ingredients in the burgers make them worth the $9.00 price tag. There is a free pepper and olive bar in the middle out the room to add some zing to your meal if you so desire.\n\nWe also got a order of chili cheese fries which are a la carte but were big enough for the three of us to share. For drinks my wife and I got Arnold Palmers (1\/2 tea and 1\/2 lemonade) and our daughter got pop. FYI, they charge for refills on the teas at least.\n\nOur server Kelly S was very good as she took good care of us. This location is in a small upscale shopping mall so if there is a wait you can window shop while you wait. \n\nP.S. make sure you know the below Symon Says before you visit:\n\n\n\nSymon Says...\n \n\n1. Welcome to B Spot! Help us help you!\n\n2. No Whining! We will do our very best to make everyone happy. Just like line jumpers at an amusement park, whiners will be prosecuted & removed from the establishment. Life is short, have fun & enjoy the moment.\n\n3. Due to the fact that we do not take reservations.... we need your cooperation and patience. We already assume that you know Michael, Liz, Doug, the Mayor, President Obama, etc... We will seat everyone in the order in which they arrive & only seat complete parties. We will do our very best to quote wait times correctly. Occasionally we may be a little off. Please refer to rule #2 if you are feeling any strange urges.\n\n4. All food will come to the table together. This way we'll keep everything running ship shape & keep waits to a minimum. If you're interested in courses...ask your caddie.\n\n5. We have a burger for every taste (even vegetarians)!! If there is something you do NOT want on your burger, let us know and we will take it off. Due to the many choices & thought put into their composition, we ask that you do not substitute or add items.\n\n6. How our temperatures work...\n\nRare:\nblood red, cold\/cool in center\n\nMid Rare:\nreddish, cool in the center\n\nMedium:\nreddish\/pink, warm center\n\nMid Well:\nbarely pink, warm center\n\nWell:\nno pink, very sad, hot center\n\n7. If you're reading these, making funny faces & squinching your nose...you're too uptight! You should immediately consume bourbon, beer or your beverage of choice & relax a little!\n\nMuch Love,\nMichael
