It's purely about the cheap yet delicious food at Congee Queen where they serve up all manner of congee (stew-y rice) and countless other mouth watering Chinese culinary hits in abundant proportions.\n\nBest bets \n\n House super bowl Congee  a seafood lover's dream.\nSpice and pepper salt squid, like Calamari yet Sino-fied and so much better.  Fried chili turnip patties nice and spicy.  Crispy chicken with secret sauce (the secret is there is no sauce just shrimp crackers)\n Minced beef rice, actually most of the fried rice is actually quite good and to top it off Diced sirloin with Black chili pepper in Golden Bowl, who doesn't like saucy beef in a crisp wonton bowl?\n\nA feast for me plus my best girlfriends (and trust we can pack it back!) equals $45 with taxes I-N-S-A-N-E, and there's still  enough for leftovers!!\n\nDon't come here expecting swish surroundings or stellar service.\nService here is more akin to something you'd get from a diner and English is spoken yet sometimes it's incomprehensible, me being half-deaf doesn't help. Dunno why, but we always get the same bucktoothed server,  I tip well so he can save up perhaps for dental care.\n\nOdd tip: Do not wear good clothes when you dine here as it will literally soak up the funk of oil and oyster sauce, whaaa my poor faux fur vest.\n\nIf you love Chinese Authentic food that's served fast and delicious and love having a vast menu to choose from then by all means let Congee Queen feed you like royalty!
