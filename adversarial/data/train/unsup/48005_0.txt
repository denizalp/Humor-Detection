Joe has been servicing our property for 4 years.  He does it all - mowing, lawn chemicals, and landscaping.  He is consistent with his schedule, professional, and extremely knowledgeable.  He goes above and beyond the call of duty with a quick response to our needs.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to friends, family, or co-workers.  Very high quality work at a reasonable price.
