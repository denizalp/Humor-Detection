the spot is no doubt picturesque and it's a lovely place to relax. \n\nthe food, drinks, service and value aren't great though. \n\neven all this is forgivable given the island location, but i've concerns about food safety. there are flies swarming about the fruit, blenders and garbage. seems like a disaster waiting to happen.
