first, the front desk girls definitely need some serious social skills makeover. Not a very a happy bunch. Had a party of 8 and had loads of entrees and drinks. Food took almost 1.5 hrs to get to the table. A few items were a miss, 2 steaks were not cooked properly to desired temp and had to be sent back. I ordered the foie gras since we couldnt get it in CA. IT NEVER CAME.Would i ever come back? Not so sure anymore just with the service details, food mishaps, and overall ambience of my experience was hampered from the very start as i checked in. I walked out having to pay the MANDATORY 20% tip even feeling jipped. An expensive meal experience that does not deliver on value. Sorry guys.
