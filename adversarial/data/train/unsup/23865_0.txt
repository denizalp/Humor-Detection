Bacon Jam, Bacon Jam, BACON JAM\n\nI do not know whats it in it besides bacon and magic. I had the Sinful Tots since I can't do eggs, and they were worth every calorie. \n\nDad had the French Toast w\/regular maple syrup. He butters everything, I made him try it without the butter and he liked it! Said it was delicious and the portion size seemed huge. Side order of bacon which was thick cut and crispy. \n\nI love this place, I want to go back for the Not Your Mama's Grilled Cheese and about 10 other things on the menu...
