Attended the NHRA Full Throttle Drags. The drag racing facility is first class. Lots of parking available. Toilets and port a potties are all around.\n\n   The seating are benches best to bring a cushion. We've sat in different areas and let me tell you there are no bad seats here. Perfect view where ever you choose.\n\n  We bought our tickets online which was a painless process there is also a ticket booth.
