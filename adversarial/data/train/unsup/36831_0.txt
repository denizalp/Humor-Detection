Stay away from this place unless you want your credit card number stolen.  Didn't use my credit card for weeks and went into their store to get a couple of 4TB drives.  Used my Visa.  A few days later I checked my credit card and sure enough there is some weird charge from a company I never heard of made on that same day.  I told my bank that unless I am Bruce Jenner I have no need to buy women's clothing.  They're sending me a new card.  Stay away from Fry's.
