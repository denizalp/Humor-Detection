More than 1550 reviews, and a line that feels like someone is pulling out your upper leg hairs (nearest your junk) individually = Excellent pizza, terrible name.  I can see why they would originally name this place Secret Pizza (the lack of signs, location, etc), but there was no way they could keep this place a secret for more than ten minutes after their grand opening.  The pizza is ridiculously good.\n\nI loved NY pizza so much, that I literally had a slice (or three) of it every single day I lived there.  There have only been a couple pizza places outside of NY that I would even consider eating daily, and this has to be one of them.  I'm hoping they change their name to Deliver Anywhere In The World Pizza, or Now Open in Southern California Pizza, ASAP...  If they do, I will be the first customer to sign up for their auto debit and delivery program (which isn't even real).\n\nThere really is no need to go over prices, or describe their pizza in detail.  Just know that if you are in Vegas, you need to try Secret Pizza.
