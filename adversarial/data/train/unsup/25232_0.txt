We are escape room veterans from Cali and decided to do these rooms because of Groupon. Best decision ever. \n\nWe did all four rooms at this location. Here is the break down. \n\nWhimsical Library - \n\nIt was my girlfriend, another person and I. The room was decorated all and the theme was great. Puzzles were linear and wasn't overly complicated but some required extra thought. We made it out in around 42 minutes. \n\nFortune Teller -\n\nThe second hardest room. Great theme, great puzzles. We were paired with a group of 6 that were first timers. They seemed to pick up on things pretty quickly. We had to use all 3 clues but after that we were flying. We got out at around 46 minutes. \n\nTop Dog -\n\nEasiest room at the place. I would recommend to start at this room. While not overly hard, it would still be a tough room for beginners. We have done plenty of rooms in the past, so we picked up on how things were going to be laid out. It was still a blast. We got out in around 48 minutes. \n\nBlood Thirst - \n\nThe hardest room at this location. The room is MASSIVE. The biggest room I have ever been in. I would recommend at least a party of 4. The theme is amazing and the puzzles are great. We got hung up on a couple things where a clue would not have helped us cause we were looking at things wrong. Our group was 2 steps away from escaping. While we did not escape, this room was our favorite. \n\nStaff - \n\nThe best thing about this place is the staff. They are very helpful and very enthusiastic about the experience. They even recommended other escape rooms to try after we had completed their rooms. They go deeply into the story and help you along the way of you a stuck. I highly recommend this place.
