Truly, the kindest, most gentle vets I have ever met! We recently moved to Pittsburgh, and one of my cats was dealing with an ongoing sickness. We went to VCA Fox Chapel, and I was pleasantly surprised by how kind, caring, and gentle the doctors were. We worked with Dr. Miggins and Dr. Resek. In the end, we ended up having to put our cat to sleep. Even then, Dr. Resek was amazingly patient and kind, and gave us the time and space we needed. Yes, they are expensive. But you are getting great care and more than that, you can rest assured that they truly have your pets' best interest in mind.
