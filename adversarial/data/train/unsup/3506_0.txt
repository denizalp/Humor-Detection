AMBIANCE: 5 stars\nI came here for a company anniversary dinner and we were lucky enough to be seated in the private room on the 2nd floor. This room overlooked the balcony and the Venetian lake \/ bridge \/ cobble-stoned floor. The restaurant set up was beautiful and extremely classy. Perfect for a date night!\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: 5 stars\n- I felt like a princess! They were like little ninjas, weaving in and out between the diners, cleaning up and serving without any disruption!\n- They were the most gracious, the most polite, and the most attentive waiters EVER. \n- We had a team of around 7 waiters constantly going around, checking up on everyone, refilling water, folding napkins, etc.\n- They cleaned up every every single course and it was refreshing to not have to flag people down in the middle of your conversations.\n\nFOOD: 4 stars\n- It was pretty dericious. I apologize to my fellow Yelpers out there for forgetting which course I chose from the menu (our group had a preset course menu), but I know I ordered the salad (which was very well seasoned and very flavorful) and ordered the steak which unfortunately was a little on the dry side (I asked for Medium Rare).\n\nOVERALL: \n\nThis is a lovely date area (def. romantic), great for people watching especially if you sit outside (also great for making passerbys jealous of your food), and if you're a stickler for customer service like me.. this is definitely the place to go.
