So disappointed. After being loyal to RC Willey for 10+ years, they don't even try to make things right. We purchased two 84\" bookcases and one smaller bookcase. We wanted the taller bookcases quickly and picked them up from the warehouse. They were complete garbage. **See my review for the distribution center** \nI called the salesman and he said, \"When there are only a couple left, this often happens.\" REALLY???? And why were you so eager to sell them to us? You thought I wouldn't notice??? He did not care nor did he try to make things right. So we cancelled the smaller bookcase JUST BECAUSE of his apathy.  We had to take the bookcases back to the warehouse. What a complete WASTE of TIME! I'm staying away from RC Willey for awhile. I still need bookcases .... Sorry Dave, you did lose our business.
