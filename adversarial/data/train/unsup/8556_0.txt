Not worth it unless you have a coupon from one of those deal sites i.e. Groupon, Teambuy, etc. They boast a $80 experience; it really isnt. Here's why:\n\n1. The cruise boat isn't the fanciest. It's a very plain double decker boat, with a bar on the top and seating on the bottom. \n\n2. Drinks are extra at the bar and quite pricey. And the bartenders aren't the best. Mine fumbled to make a Margarita, and Grandpa failed to make a proper Amaretto Sour for my boyfriend. I call him grandpa because he was surely atleast 70 years old. \n\n3. The food is fairly good... not a buffet like the cruise boasts. A piece of chicken, two mini cannelloni, caesar salad, two baked potatoes, vegetables (I only got sloppy pepper), and bun. Out of the selection, the Caesar Salad was absolutely amazing, as were the Baked Potatoes. I went back for more... but the cruise staff pretty much plated themselves whatever was leftover. From the guest buffet. I am not sure if that screams professionalism. \n\nCons apart, the boat cruise is actually a pretty fun summer experience. The DJ played a mix of popular music and latin dance music and everybody went up to dance. Food, dance, lake breeze... for a $36 deal and I'd go again! But definitely never paying $80 for this experience.
