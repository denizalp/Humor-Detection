Probably one of the best ramen places in charlotte. The food here is exactly what you would expect, and the smells are heavenly. All the food in the soup  is warm and salty and amazing. The people here are so understanding and kind, and the ramen is also good as leftovers, just so you can stretch out the joy of eating here.
