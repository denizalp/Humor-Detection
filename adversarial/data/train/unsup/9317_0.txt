Used to be a great place 5 yrs ago or so.....they got cheap on the drink quality,less liquor and crappy mixers...,hard to find a server to even order most times. Very limited food menu....they have an attitude when you enter and staff seems pretty uncaring and rude most times (some are still great though)....happy hour is really no great deal at half price,you are getting half price off of the overpriced insane regular drink price!\n\nGood if you never been there and you want to try to \"hook up\", but much better places to go these days in Vegas.
