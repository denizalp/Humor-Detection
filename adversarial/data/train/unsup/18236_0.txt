Positive first\n\nI love the reason for the venue, to give performing artists a place to play and have a nice crowd, sound system and refreshments all in one. \n\nI get that ...BUT..\n\nThe cafe does not serve beer or wine before the show starts. Both times i have been there the cafe is out of coke and all they had was diet or Sprite, yet inside the stage room the bartender had a crap load of coke available. Lame\n\nThe first time there the entrance to the stage was a cluster F. The second time it went much better. Partly because I bitch a little to the host. Squeaky wheel.. you know. \n\nThe Stage room was set up properly the second time and the show went well. They do serve beer and wine and appear to serve local flavors. \n\nI would suggest better seating in the lobby, perhaps better refreshments there too.
