The Cajun Steak is a lot like losing your virginity, you spend more time mourning the fact it didn't last as long as you had hoped than you do the actual main course. What's to say about this place besides the fact I'm not convinced they allow farting in the bathroom. It's one of those places I'm just glad I made it out of before I broke anything, amazing food and service. Here's an extra star to place on someone else's review because clearly they're old, grumpy, and ungrateful.
