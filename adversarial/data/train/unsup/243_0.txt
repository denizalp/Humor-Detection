If there's any local business worthy of an OMG, it's Snow Ono. Holy crap! I've been wanting to try them for the longest time. I'm so glad I finally made the trek down to the Fresh52 Farmer's Market on Sunday. It worked out perfectly because Sloppi Jo's was also there.\n\nSnow Ono has so many flavors, it's overwhelming. I decided to entrust my order to Marianne. Her current favorite flavor combo is Melona, Lilikoi, and Lychee, with condensed milk drizzled over the top. Let me tell you. Snow Ono Shave Ice is REDONKULOUS! There really is nothing like it. Maybe I'm just not familiar with real Hawaiian shave ice, but this is as good as it gets IMHO.\n\nMy recurring sore throat had me ordering a small, but I can totally see myself scarfing down a large when the Vegas heat gets here. But I wouldn't wait if I were you. Track down Marianne and Roxanne and their magical snow bus and get some Snow Ono ASAP!
