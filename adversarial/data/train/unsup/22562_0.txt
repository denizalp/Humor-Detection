Bookmarked this place and was so stoked to try it.  Got there and they didn't have Lucozade, didn't have soup and didn't have a lot of food on hand in the case it seemed.  The side of curry (which I paid extra for) was literally cold.  Right out of the refrigerator cold.  I was told 15 for a Scotch egg and 10 minutes for a steak pie.  Seems like everything here is just kept in an icebox and just heated up when you order it.  Just seems like they aren't even trying.  Chips were overdone and the delicious COLD curry sauce didn't help.  In the UK chip shops are fast -in-and-out places you can stop for a quick (hot) bite and keep on seeing the sights.  If I wanted to sit and wait around I would go to a sit-down type place.  Steak pie was good but yet again the cup of gravy was cold.  All the while we were waiting for our food and sipping on a Yards we hear the manager chick talking shit about Ohio people.  Those Ohio people might be the same ones that write reviews on places they eat.  Stick to heating up cold food and maybe lower the volume, sister...
