The location,apartment and grounds were nice.\nThe rent was a bit on the high side for what you get.\nThe a\/c was questionable and not fully tennant controlled,which can be scary in the summer.\nWhen we went to look at an apartment,the rental guy was sitting at his desk discussing the terms of eviction with a soon to be no more tennant.\nThis conversation held in a very public open space was awkward to be a party to.\nWe thought about leaving right then,but my friend who was on limited time availability to look for apartments really wanted to see this one.\nWell,it seemed Miss evictee was pretty much done trying to avoid eviction when she turned and saw us waiting,then she sat back down to ask her same questions again!\nI think she was trying to get us to leave.\nSo,at that point we were going to wait.\nShe finally got up and glared at us,my friend called her a deadbeat,and Mr.Rental guy showed us an apartment.\nNice.\nWell laid out,would probably be do-able.\nUntil...\nThe fucking \"fees\"...\nA fee for filling out the application form.\nA fee for the background check.\nA fee to hold the apartment.\nA fee for cleaning.\nA fee for security..\nHere a fee,there a fee.\nEverywhere a fee fee.\nOld Mc Broadstone had a fee,Fee eye fee eye ohhh.\nEverybody sing!\nThen...\nThe zinger that made it a no go.\nOn top of everything else,\nThey demanded tenants have renters insurance.\nNot suggested.\nNot strongly advised.\nYou had to prove that you had renters insurance for them to rent to you!\nHey lookie!!!!!\nANOTHER FEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nno mas los fees.\nHasta la bye bye.
