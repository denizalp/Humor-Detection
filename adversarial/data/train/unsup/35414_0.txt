After many trips to Vegas and eating at nearly all the major buffets multiple times we still had not experienced the buffet at Bellagio. This is a review on the weekday brunch. It was $30. I knew as soon as I walked in that it was a mistake. Dark and dated upon first view. And the real upset was the self serve beverage stations. Seriously??? If you did come for the gourmet dinner at $40-45 I would be pretty choked that I had to get my own water and coffee. \nThey really should just leave a bussing cart on the floor for people to leave their empty plates on their way to the buffet as the servers who aren't busy getting you beverages can't even be bothered to remove your empty plates. And having to listen to the snickering and comments from the servers to each other when paying customers leave and don't leave enough of a tip or none at all ( I didn't see what was left). So rude. Keep your comments to yourself until you are in the back with your coworkers. \nAfter hearing so much about the buffet I am utterly disappointed and will not return to this buffet. I won't even get into the basic food options I can find at any other standard buffet. Should not be on the top 5 list at all. \n\nIf you want to spend $30 on brunch then I highly recommend going to the Wynn or Aria. Better selection and quality and a cleaner brighter atmosphere. The servers actually serve you and justify leaving a few bucks behind for their efforts.
