Great atmosphere, not too big like a lot of other Vegas places. I sat at the bar for dinner. Happy hour has great deals, and I found their menu a little less expensive than some of the other sushi places around. The bartenders were super friendly and gave great recommendations to fit my taste. I will definitely be back.
