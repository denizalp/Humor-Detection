Thieves, in this club. be aware. \nif I can give no star. that would be nice. \nWas wearing my clutch bag on side and was looking away for 30 seconds. \nMy cellphone was gone.\nThere were 2 other girls in the club with the same problem. some one took their cell phones from the bag they were \"holding\". \n\nI only know that it was a guy, about 5''6. didn't see his race. \n\nI called the day after asking if there is a phone in lost and found, just in case. \nThe club management never ever returned to me. So, here it is. Be aware. Don't go to this club knowing, your belongings won't be safe.
