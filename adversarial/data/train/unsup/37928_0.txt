It is not often that you get all three right - quality in food, service and atmosphere anf the fourth thing: price!  Oh - here is another thing - cleanliness! I would give this place more stars if it were possible.  The gyro sandwich is large enough to share w another person. Their greek salad is just perfect. It is no wonder that there is often no place to sit!  I will be back again and again!
