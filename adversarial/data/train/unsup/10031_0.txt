First off, the male cashier here was so rude. When I asked him what the most popular burger there was, and he said \"Uh, I dunno\" and gave me a \"I-don't-give-an-F\" look. I also asked him if they had any more lox cream cheese left in stock because there weren't any on display. He said \"yeah.\" Silence. So..? Are you going to give them to me or just answer my question? Turns out they didn't have any left. (Last time I came when there was no more left, the nice lady just whipped up a new tub for me on the spot.) He was just flat out a jerk who ALSO overcharged me a dollar and had to refund it in cash after I swiped my card.\n\nSecondly, the lox sandwich here was just sad. I paid $7.99+tax for the lox bagel. It literally contained a bagel, lox, 3 pieces of diced tomato, and 5 sad little pieces of capers (will upload picture). I went up to the man who made my order and told him that this is not what I remember ordering. Last time I had the lox sandwich, it contained red onions and whole slices of tomato. He just simply replied, \"we're out of onions and tomatoes. Sorry.\"\nWell you couldn't have told me that when I was ordering? I could have just gotten a bagel with lox cream cheese which would have been only $3.\n\nWell overall, thanks to the rude cashier and the sad little lox bagel, my night was made.
