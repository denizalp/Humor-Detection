Typical Hampton Inn with comfortable beds and all the amenities you expect from this Hilton chain.  I found the staff to be extremely friendly and cooperative.  This location is exceptional with many restaurants and shopping options in the immediate vicinity. Two good restaurants next door even offer in-room food delivery.  In the mornings, the hotel makes up breakfast to go bags for hurried guests to grab on their way out. I found my 8-night stay here to be pleasant and issue free. The shuttles offered to the Barrett-Jackson auction at Westworld were an added benefit for my wife, giving her the flexibility to come and go as she pleased.
