Came here for the Hockey Hall of Fame and skating near city hall. This is an affordable hotel in an amazing location, near Air Canada Centre as well. It is a boutique type hotel, smallish rooms, but it's all modern and has what we needed, especially since we were out and about most of the time. The staff is super nice and helpful as well... just know there is no parking, however they do suggest pay garages around the corner - choose the parking in the Commerce building, best rate.
