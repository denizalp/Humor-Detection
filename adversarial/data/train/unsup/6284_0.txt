As I sit here at the DMV for the last 97 mins, several things come to mind; I've never seen any of these people anywhere in my town, where did they come from?  The DMV system needs an overhaul, why does everyone here including the clerks look clueless on what paperwork they need and what line to stand in?  Does that guy in his hover round cart need a license for that thing? Why are these chairs so uncomfortable?  Are there any of those hand sanitizer stations around here? Wonder if the dude next to me at least considered showering before you ventured to the DMV?  Why do the clerks seem so jaded and lifeless? \n\nI don't consider myself an elitist in any way, but come on DMV.... Really!?
