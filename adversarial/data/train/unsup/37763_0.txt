3 stars...\nMy wife found this joint, and I've never shied away from southern fare.\nWe started with the wedge salad. My only complaint was the minimal dressing applied, otherwise all was as expected.\nWe split the chicken and waffles which is their claimed specialty. Perfectly crispy seasoned chicken and cheese waffles. Bourbon maple syrup was the perfect compliment! My only food complaint with this dish was that the waffles were not crispy. Served with creamy cheesy mac & cheese and marinated watermelon cubes..both tasty!\nAmbiance was barn bistro counter(complete with hard on your booty metal stools), prices were above expectation($36 for chicken & waffles?!? This is peasant food peeps!) service was spotty though we sat at the bar, so we had higher expectations.\n\nOverall the food was good, but this joint just didn't knock my socks off for the cost of the evening. Unfortunately this joint does not make the list...
