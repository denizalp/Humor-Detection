This is a great place to come have a few beers and watch some games.  There's tons of TV's, tons of seating, and ton's of beers on tap.\n\nWe ordered the stuffed jalapeno's for an appetizer. When I bit into one, hot cream cheese spewed out and burned my lip. Those things are dangerous! Tasty though ...\n\nThe entree food fell flat. My summer salad was drenched in dressing. My friends shrimp scampi was super bland, and my BF's salad looked wilted and just not good.\n\nCome for beer or sports, not food.\n\nProps for having Oregon's \"dead guy ale\" on tap.
