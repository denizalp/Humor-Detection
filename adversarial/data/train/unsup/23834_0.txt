I enjoy staying at Residence Inns since it reminds me of a large comfortable studio apartment instead of a typical hotel room.  I've been to Residence Inns in Houston, Beverly Hills, and Midtown Manhattan.\n\nThis particular Residence Inn in Paradise Alley is ideal location-wise.  Its located alongside Scottsdale Road and close to everything - all the restaurants we booked were easily within 10-15 minutes and you're only 20-30 minutes from awesome hiking.  Huge parking lot.\n\nThe hotel however, has some gaps compared to other branches I've been to:\n\n1. The gym has dumbbells and three machines in one very cramped room, but no bench and not even yoga mats!\n\n2. Bathroom shower was very powerful but the toilet has a weak flush.  No body lotion nor shower cap provided.\n\n3. Charging for bottled water?  No thanks - I will refill at the gym's water fountain.\n\nOn the plus side, the hotel does have outdoor pool, jacuzzi, and half court basketball court.
