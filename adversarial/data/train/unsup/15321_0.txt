I just recieved a phone call from the FSY staff that they are going to start a policy of a $10 charge per class that you don't cancel two hours before.  Life is not always predictable especially when you have children and a busy work schedule.  Even if someone is single without children, things come up that are out of their control.  It just appears that the owners are trying to nickel and dime loyal customers with no consideration.  I have only seen a full class once of twice in many months of going to FSY.  Just a few months ago they stopped offering towels and now have to be rented per towel at the front desk.  This $10 charge policy is unnecessary and going to cost them business.  I will be doing research for a new spin and fitness studio because this policy is unacceptable.  If anyone has recommendations, I'd like to hear them as I'm leaving this studio soonest.  Potential customers, look elsewhere if you would like to avoid being charged unfairly.
