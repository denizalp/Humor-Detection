I had been threatening to make it to Nighttown since our return to the area seven years ago.  Last night, thanks to Bill Frisell, I ran out of excuses.\n\nWhat a great place for music.  Feels like you're sitting in a huge living room in Dublin, and your host and hostess keep your dinner plate and Scotch glass full throughout the evening.  The bar is pretty tiny, and I was tempted after the early show to sit there and listen through the doorway to Frisell's second set.  But some people have to \"work\" in the \"morning\" so I had to leave.\n\nThe main room is shaped like a giant letter \"T\" with wings flaring out from the stage.  Instead of the usual tiny cocktail tables, Nighttown provides real dining tables, and also enough room between aisle and table so you're not elbowing your fellow audience member.  Had to try the house specialty, The Dublin Lawyer which, while very tasty was presented \"cafeteria style,\" that is, dumped onto the plate.  The stuffed eggplant marinara was light and still filling, and fried goat cheese with balsamic dates and prosciutto was the smash hit of the meal.\n\nAs this isn't a music review, I'll just say that Frisell is a wonder to behold.  The sound system is pretty basic, but the room has a \"warm\" sound; the stage is really just a small fraction of the dining room floor, with tables removed.  What a sheer delight, though, to be in an audience that listens to the music.  (Except that guy RIGHT in front of me, who seemed to be coming in and out of consciousness, who at one point stood up and shouted:  \"Queensryche!\" then passed out onto the house photographer.)\n\nRan into a few local musicians, there to witness this guitarist who just plays on a whole 'nutha level.  Hard to believe the acts that pack the giant stadia throughout the land, and guys like Frisell are playing small rooms.  Ah, well.  Two guys were walking down the street; one was a musician, and the other one didn't have any money, either.\n\n\"By and large, jazz has always been like the kind of a man you wouldn't want your daughter to associate with.\"  -  Duke Ellington
