Was very disappointed with this location. Stopped here during a layover at Charlotte and was excited to have a Jamaican Jerk Chicken sandwich with some seasoned fries.  \n\nThe tomato had more flavor that the chicken and the kick was there was no JAMAICAN JERK taste to the sandwich. The fries were mostly just regular fries with a few of them dripped in seasoning.\n\nThe environment was great, love the music (Caribbean\/beach like) and big open area.  No one is over one another.  Just disappointed in the food.
