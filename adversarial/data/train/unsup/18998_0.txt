Located in the new Cystals shopping area of the City Center.\n\nGo see Lorenzo if Cartier tickles your pickle. He's professional, has manners, is not pushy or fake, and he has a classy swagger feel. I've been meaning to replace my old wallet from here that I got as a gift a long time ago. I cruised into Cartier with the mindset to just window shop.\n\nLorenzo saw me browsing around and that I had some questions. Without any fuss or rolling of the eyes, he patiently showed me the different products and gave me feedback about each item. This guy really knew his stuff and above all else, he's polite and isn't like one of those rude car salesman. I just couldn't walk out of there without buying some goodies from him.\n\nUnlike some Cartiers in LV, this one has more than just jewelry. So if you're in the market for a wallet, some shades or bags, and so on, then stop on by. I had a great experience here and would definitely come back in the future.\n\n\"This is my house and you are my guest.\" - Lorenzo
