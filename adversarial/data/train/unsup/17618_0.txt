My Kind Of Pig!\n\nSo here is the thing, I consider myself a foodie for sure. I am in the food business and I love to eat good food.. I love to eat semi good food, I enjoy food - overall. \n\nHoney Pig wasn't my first experience with Korean food, Korean BBQ or Koreans :) That being said, I never really know what to order because I don't have alot of experience dining in such an establishment. I love the flavors, the style of the service and the concept altogether, but I just never had the chance to really enjoy a full Korean style meal until earlier this year. \n\nALL of that into consideration.. I dug \"Honey Pig\". It's casual, good quality and delicious. At around $99 for 4 people with beers and much grub, it was also a nice deal. Im a big eater, all my foodie friends are - and we all were quite full at the end of our meal. \n\nWould I go again? Yes! Am I looking forward to more Korean-style cuisine... absolutely! \n\nUntil next time!
