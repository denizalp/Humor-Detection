Cozy spot for stewed Persian dishes! Came by on a weekday with a reservation for two at 6:30pm and was easily seated but the place filled up really quickly by 7. We shared the Spinach Borani ($4.50) which was a good companion to the complimentary bread. We liked the dip so much that we got extra bread to really clean off the dish. I had the Mirza Qasemi ($11) - eggplant in a garlicky tomato stew with salad - and I upgraded the rice to Baqali Polo (fava beans and dill) which was a nice, filling addition. Overall the dish was comfy, flavourful and light!\n\nThe service was friendly but it was pretty hard to get the attention of the staff since two of them had to watch over the whole restaurant. Would love to come back and try more though!
