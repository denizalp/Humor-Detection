Paninis, soups, and salads, oh my! Follow the Fresh Million Road (Well, Chandler Blvd actually) to this little restaurant that offers healthier alternatives to burgers and fries. Everything is fresh and made on the spot for you, for reasonable prices.\n\nI had a chicken tikka masala panini ($6) with a Caesar side salad ($1.80). I got the order to go, and it didn't take too long to be made. I was out the door in no time.\n\nThe sandwich had a crisp outer grilled crust, with fluffy, light tasting bread. There were big chunks of chicken breast in it, and the sauce was like the memory of chicken tikka masala sauce, a milder version rather than the bold spicy tomato-y cream sauce I'm typically used to. The salad was refreshing and crisp, and the dressing was flavorful.\n\nService was friendly. I'll come here again for tasty and quick meals if I'm in the area.
