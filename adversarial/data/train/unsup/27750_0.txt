Great meal.  Stem to stern.  I would never venture to a hidden place like this but a high roller friend was visiting from out of town and had  some comps.\n\nI had the Chateaubriand with the lobster appetizer.  Very well prepared and many servers to bring the drinks and eats along the journey.  Finished up with Grand Marnier Chocolate cake & coffee.\n\nTaste buds never felt so good!
