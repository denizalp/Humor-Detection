I really wanted to love this place, but sadly it fell short of my expectations. The store is absolutely adorable and cheerfully decorated, and the service matched. The girl working the counter was just as sweet as those cupcakes she serves and the box they package your cupcake in is SO cute!! It was the end of day on a Saturday and they barely had anything left to choose from. I was reallllly craving chocolate and all they had left was gluten free, so I went with that. Blechhh! Idk if it was old but the top was as hard as a rock and the inside was so mushy like it was barely cooked. I threw it in the trash :(
