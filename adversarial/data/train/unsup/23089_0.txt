I drive 30 minutes to Freebirds just so I can get a real American meal. The food is great, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is awesome. It's exactly what you could want from a Family restaurant. The owner is a solid guy who will check on you to make sure you're completely satisfied with your visit. They have affordable specials and the food is always on point. Indoor and outdoor seating is available and the parking lot has plenty of wide open spaces even during the busiest times. Definitely one of my favorites in the area. Check it out.
