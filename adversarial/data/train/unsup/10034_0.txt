So sad to give 3 stars but I must.\nLoved the menu and had such high hopes. Let me start by saying our breakfast for two ran $50..and we had smoothies not liquor.\nSo it's not cheap but I don't care if it's the whole package.\nIt's the service that killed it-clearly understaffed and not running the kitchen well.\nWe waited over 50 minutes for our food and when it came they forgot half the accompaniments. The manager did come out and apologize but they didn't offer anything (like the smoothies we sucked on for 50 minutes) complimentary as a gesture.\nThe food had promise...hell the whole place did...but it was a let down.  Also it wasn't busy, not even half the tables were full.\nMay give it one more try but they've got to know normally you've got one shot to get it right. Spend the extra $8 an hour and hire a couple of servers-and take a double check on whose running the kitchen.
