A rather disappointing day in the history of fast food. Usually I am not one to complain about fast food...if you choose to eat something cooked in less then 30 seconds with absolutely no tender loving care you should naturally expect it to taste like muddy cardboard.  However, the monstrosity that I experienced a few days ago was absolutely unacceptable. I would probably hold it up in the same category as the weird milky, jello, orange peel concoction my 94 year old great grandmother used to force feed my siblings and I whenever we visited. \nAfter trekking through the rough, bitter cold,  snow ridden terrain of Yorkville, I found myself ordering my usual Mesquite Chicken sandwich from Quiznos...Extra jalape√±os and banana peppers on the side (One of gods many great gifts to man). Normally I would finish eating and then go back to my daily routine; babe watching out my window, eating gold fish crackers and playing hang man. However, this time I found myself laying on the cold stone office floor, wincing in pain with cold clammy hands, imaging I was feeling similar to someone dying of a horrible disease  like scurvy. After spending the latter part of my day running back and forth between my garbage can and bathroom, I decided to call Quiznos in hopes of possibly saving the next poor unfortunate soul who stumbled upon them, the same fate as me.\n After spending a good ten minutes speaking to the employee (no apology, no assurance the rest of the chicken would be checked, & no compensation) I frustratedly hung up the phone. Quiznos, you have lost a great customer. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless, you are looking for a quick and easy way of offing your annoying significant other without having to worry about evidence being linked back to you.
