Went there Satarday 11:45 AM with my girlfriend and we sat in a booth in the bar section. Nobody said one word to us. Sat there for 10 minutes eating stale peanuts (they seemed moist). At least 6 or 7 staff members walked past us several times. Didn't seem to notice us at all. Got up and left and nobody said goodbye or anything and I'm a handsome man! WTF?
