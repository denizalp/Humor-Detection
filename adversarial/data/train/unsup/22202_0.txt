This was the first time my boyfriend and I had visited this pet store and we won't be coming back. The staff seem like they could care less. Every time I went to ask one of them a question about the puppies they would shortly answer and turn around and walk away fast as if there were a million people in the store when it wasn't even busy. You would think they'd be eager to help find a puppy a good home but no.
