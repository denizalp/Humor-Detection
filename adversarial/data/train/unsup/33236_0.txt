I was staying at our vacation home in PHX in May of 2013.  Unfortunately I pulled my back during a weight-lifting workout routine at our Condo.  I could barely walk back to our unit as I experienced extreme back spasms.  Things were not good.  My wife (of whose yelp acct I'm using) kindly went online and searched out a Chiropractor in our area, but more importantly one that would be familiar and involved with sports injuries.  \n\nThankfully she landed upon Dr. Dominic Pisaro at Arcadia Health and Wellness Chiropractic.  I called and was able to get in right away.  I slowly made my way through the front doors and Dr. Pisaro recognized I was in rought shape right away.  I had a bulging disc.  \n\nDuring my assessment and subsequent 3 more treatment visits, Dr. Pisaro explained every proceedure to me and what I might expect.  He continuously assured me to take my time in moving into the positions that he required of me for treatment.  I was given and correctly shown (by his Assistant)  home exercises to complete and work on. Dr. Pisaro and his staff were able to get me in good enough shape to fly back to Canada as scheduled.  \n\nWithout hesitation, I would recommend Dr. Pisaro and his staff for any Chiropractic needs that  are needed.
