Excellent meal with Italian wedding soup and the Mahi special.  What was really over the top was the extraordinary service by Vickie R.   I am traveling on business and forgot my phone charger.  I asked Vickie if she could assist and Vickie got my phone charged!   That is the kind of support all companies in the service sector should consider.  Stock phone chargers for Apple and Samsung and you will make most people happy.  Kudos to Bravo and also to Vickie R.
