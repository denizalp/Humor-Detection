This is my first time back to Avenue Club after renovations, and I really like the feel of the new dining area and bubble up bar. \n\nThe old neon sign belies the modern connected interior with neutral tones and thoughtfully arranged seating.  Whether you're at the long wavy bar, a cocktail table, or in one of the many cozy U-shaped booths, you'll get to enjoy an intimate but open atmosphere. The bar snacks were great to munch on, definitely don't underestimate the chips and onion dip, and I was impressed with their cocktail list. \n\nI saw creme de violette and green chartreuse, variations of the good old fashioned (I love that I can make mine less sweet), with a handful of ice cream drinks to boot. The amaretto sour \"gone south\" was surprisingly smoky and sophisticated, and the cava colada is a refreshing, ticklish take on the pi√±a version. If you're looking for dinner & drinks, after dinner drinks, or dessert drinks, the bubble up bar has something for everyone. \n\nFor a neutral, clean space to gather a wide range of friends, I'd put Avenue Club's Bubble Up Bar near the top of my list.
