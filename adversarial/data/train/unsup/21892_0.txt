Elizabeth Avenue has become quite the foodie destination. It pretty much has it all now, including homemade ice cream.\n\nSidenote: I wrote a cold treats Weekly Yelp back in July. My original goal was just an ice cream issue (simply for the fact that I wanted to call it \"Game of Cones\"), but the Charlotte area didn't boast enough local scoop shops to make it happen. How tragic is all of this? Especially depriving all of you an email entitled \"Game of Cones.\"\n\nAnyways, back to Elizabeth Creamery. It's tucked on the side street behind Carpe Diem. You open the door and are immediately hit by the smell of baking waffle cones. In other words, you are hit with a cloud of amazing. How can I convince my roommate to take up waffle cone making and practice in our house every night? I don't have a favorite flavor here. I'm an equal opportunity ice cream lover. Green tea and mint Oreo are my two current crushes. Debating what to get? Ask them for a sample. \n\nIt's a small space inside, but that's all you need. I like to take mine outside and eat on the bench. People watch all the happenings on Elizabeth Ave. Welcome back Elizabeth Creamery! Please don't ever leave us again.
