If you want Nachos and like to bowl.  Done.\n\nMadison Square lanes is your typical \"in the city\" old school Lakewood joint.  It smells a little smokey, but the PBR is cheap and there are plenty of cheap fried foods for you to consider buying on the menu (hint: after a few of those PBRs, the food sounds a lot better!).\n\nMadison has one of the better lanes in Lwood and automatic scoring.  Their shoes are old and their balls are old...but what else do you expect from a place that hasn't remodeled since the 70's?  They have leagues on some nights, so it may be worth a call to make sure there are free lanes open.   Well...there usually are though, so you'll be fine.  \n\nSo shine up that ball, throw on a pair of shoes and knock down those pins.
