First time eating here, was out in the area to go to Castle Noel. I went with 2 other friends, we ordered the wings, Lager Melt, pork rinds, and pickled eggs appetizer. Everything was amazing! We also tried the Lager head beer which was also good, if you don't want the Lager head beer they also have other brewery's on tap. The service was also good for the size group we had. Only thing that sucks about the place is it's a 35min drive from my house or I would go all the time.
