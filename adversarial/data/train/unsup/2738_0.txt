Electronics stores in general seem to be shifting away from Brick & Mortar even faster than other types of retailers. In that sense, Fry's Electronics feels like something out of the early 2000s--a warehouse with more product than you can browse in one day, all with the aesthetic of some cheesy movie set. \n\nI can't imagine NOT being able to find something here. Whether you're building a PC, setting up home entertainment, or just in want of some shiny new gadgets, they've got you covered. \n\nUnlike the competition, which caters to casuals, I can enjoy my experience since I'm not going to be swarmed by an army of blue shirts trying to pressure me. Workers here are for the most part hands-off, but still incredibly helpful whenever I have questions. \n\nAnd yes, I know...more of the high-information purchasers are probably going online for their wares. But Fry's price matches! I love getting what I want, same-day at the best price I can find. I've never left disappointed.
