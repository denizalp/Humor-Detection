I would give this place 3.5 stars. Not quite a 4, but not a 3 in my book (obviously since I wish I could give it a 3.5 on the scoring. It has bands from time to time, which is what makes it a 4. Not many places have an area that converts from a stage at night to tables during the day. I would give it a 3 for food. It's just your typical, everyday bar food. Nothing to write home about, but it's not necessarily bad. Just average. I've been here a couple of times, and I have always enjoyed myself. The service is also fantastic, which also helps its rating. I would recommend you stop at least once to try it out, especially if there is a band.
