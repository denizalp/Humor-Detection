Alrighty, this review is going to be quick and gritty. It's a cafe in a casino....a cafe in a casino next to Sun City. The food is typical cafe food but because of their target market restricted low salt diet be prepared to add your own seasoning. Other than it being bland it's what you expect from a cafe in a casino. The place is located where the original pancake house was, I miss that place :-( 49er flap jacks....sigh....okay it's gone move on......\n\nLet's talk about the saving grace of this cafe, the service!! Oh My G-O-S-H those employees should be cloned and sent across the valley!! I was debating on giving this place 4 stars just because the service was that good. My server Gurgen was great! He was attentive not just to me but my little girl. He caught me using Lily name and started calling her directly by her name the whole meal...that's the kind of stuff I love! \n\nBut good service only gets you so far, will I return? Maybe, I do have a little nugget and that place is super child friendly. Would I return without the nugget in tow? Nope
