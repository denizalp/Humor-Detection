What could I possibly add in the way of one lonely review? this hotel\/casino has 428 reviews already! Well here goes review #429. \n\n\nPros, \n\nAlways a great deal (suite price promotions or better yet, room comps) \n\nRooms are well appointed and all rooms are suites. \n\nLarger than normal bathrooms, love love love that. \n\nOne of the better hotel\/casinos on the strip. \n\nLovely interior. \n\nGrand Canal Shops are in this hotel. \n\nTao is here and is supposedly a hot spot. (haven't tried it personally) \n\nStaff are very nice and accommodating. \n\nWhen I've stayed here, the rooms always seem pretty clean (very important) \n\n\nCons, \n\nEasy to get lost. (this place is huge) \n\nI know they have to cater to smokers but it's hard to tolerate the smoke. \n\nI consider this property to be more upscale but seeing the crowds after a night spent at Tao is well.... interesting, but hey.....\"what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\"
