I really like Melt, but I still like the Lockview in Akron better. Too many of Melt's sandwiches aren't grilled cheese, most of them have some slab of meat on them. I wish they had more creative cheese only options. That being said, I really like the Parma, Italy (basically a chicken parmesan sandwich).\n\nResponse to Bob's comment: That's the thing though, I don't want to make my own. I want to be provided specific options. I don't want to be given the ingredients to make my own meal, I would prefer that the chef does the work to make the creation. That's what I like about Lockview, they have a number of different grilled cheese options that have unique ingredients that compliment each other. Opposed to Melt, where I see it as more of a \"here is what we got, make your own creation!\" but I don't know what combination tastes good, I'm not the chef. Just my own thoughts.
