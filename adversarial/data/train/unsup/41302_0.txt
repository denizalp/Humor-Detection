It was my first Vegas show (if you don't count String Cheese Incident at the Aladdin . . . ) and also my first Cirque de Soleil experience.\n\nIt was extremely cool.  I'm a big fan of Beatles music, so that helped a lot.  But the surrealistic choreography, stunts, costumes, and use of space by the characters and props created a very impressive, absorbing event.  The sound quality and visuals are crisp.  \n\nA long list of songs unfolds as a story, and if I hadn't consumed a lot of vodka and some gin on a relatively empty stomach in the hours leading up to the show, I probably would have followed all of the symbolism more effortlessly.  \n\nI recommend it highly!
