Visited Dr Gombert's dental office for the first time today and I was so pleased with the entire appointment. They were on time with my appointment and the girls working the front desk were very friendly and cheerful. They offer complimentary bottles of water and coffee in the waiting room (yes coffee at a dentist office). The office is nicely decorated and looks like it was recently renovated. Didn't have to wait in the room for 10+ minutes to see Dr Gombert, he was there in about 2 minutes which is rare at a dentist office. They were all very helpful, thorough, and explained everything to me. Very happy and will be returning again for all of my dental work and will be referring all of my friends and family!
