New owner (for a few years) has really made a difference in this place! \n\nThe decor is much cleaner and nicer, the food is even better than it was, and now it has wings!  Our family favorite!  They are delicious also!  \n\nSandwich's are still fantastic, and the pizza has been upgraded in a big way! \n\nLove this place to come with the family and just have a great time!
