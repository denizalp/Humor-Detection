Very disappointing. Ordered a thin crust and specifically asked for a thin crust, well done and crispy pizza. The crust could not be more soggy. The response from the location was atrocious when I called to even just ask for a credit or refund. I am stunned. I used to order from this location for years and was back in town visiting. I will never order from them again. I was willing to pay the steep price as I had remembered high quality pizza. The prices have gone up while quality and service have gone down. Done.
