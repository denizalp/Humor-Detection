I'm still thinking about the mac and cheese months after eating here. It's that good. I was very skeptical after hearing that it was sweet, which frankly sounded disgusting to me, but how could so many Yelpers be wrong? Well, the maple sweetness is actually offset quite nicely by the crunchy Himalayan salt and the smoky earthiness of the truffle oil. Truly a beautiful synthesis. \n\nWe also had the pork belly, which was delicious and enormous. I am no wilting flower but it was honestly too rich for me. Actually, it was the richest thing I've probably ever eaten, and that's saying a lot! I would have been happy to split the dish between, say, four or five people. \n\nWe got there 30 minutes before they opened and were first in line. The place is pretty unassuming so I thought we were at the wrong restaurant at first. I'm very glad we arrived early because a line developed that went all the way to the end of the block by the time we were allowed in. Folks who didn't make the first seating had to wait another hour. Almost everyone we overheard was a tourist.\n\nDÃ©cor was nothing special and did not align with the price point. Dining chairs were metal patio furniture. The room itself was awkwardly laid out and a bit cramped. \n\nService was very friendly but very efficient. This is a well oiled machine and I would not say the overall dining experience was particularly relaxing, it was akin to being on a conveyor belt. After tasting the mac and cheese, I didn't care about any of these negative factors, though, and would have happily dined in a gas station to get my hands on it.
