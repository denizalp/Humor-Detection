This is conveniently located inside Longo's, which is great. They don't have a scanner to take mobile payment at this location, but can manually enter your card number. \n\nFriendly enough service, but they did give me the wrong coffee, luckily it was a flavour I liked or I'd have to wait for another to be made. \n\nThese minor inconveniences in a trip that's supposed to be more convenient slows the process and makes a quick trip to the store for a few things feel like a real errand.
