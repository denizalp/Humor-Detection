Food Lion was always just okay for me. Not really my go to store but for some reason we ended up coming here and they made some major changes in the store.\n\nThe store itself is more clean, they have these register signs which make it easy to find what kind of lane you are looking for. \n\nThe produce they stock now is amazing. Fresh and lots of choices. And the meat they carry is good quality. They carry the all natural fresh line of meat now which is amazing. I like eating my meat without additives and hormones. I have also been able to find sausages without any added sugar, soy or anything weird. And with eating paleo and whole 30 now - this is everything to me. \n\nI love that they have a little badia section of dried herbs too. Since I have started making my own dressing - this has become a go to for me. These little packets of dried herbs pack a big punch.\n\nOn my last visit - I needed help finding some product and the guy couldn't help me but he got on his little ear piece and found the person that could. Amazing. Customer Service at it's best.\n\nI originally started this review as a 3 star but just thinking of how much better food lion is now - I had to bump up to 4.
