Although this location is now closed, it's still worthy of a review! \n\nD = Directly on the strip, attached to the Monte Carlo! Easy to access \n       from the street or the hotel!\nI = Insane drink specials! Happy hour is offered all day, coupons are \n      handed to guests outside, and if you check in on yelp, buy one get on \n      free drinks!\nA = Awesome staff. No seriously. Our server was insanely friendly, nice \n      and gave us ample time to look through the menu and made a few \n     great suggestions! \nB = Big portions! Because we were massively hungover (come on, it's \n      Vegas) we opted to split a meal - the fajitas to be exact. We chose the   \n    \"combo\", as it featured both steak and chicken. Despite splitting our \n     meal, we couldn't even finish it! \nL = Loud Music! The restaurant boasts a bit of a club\/trendy\/party \n      atmosphere, creating a fun space, perfect for Vegas.\n O = Outstanding selection of eats!The menu is extensive and I've \n     heard their nachos are outstanding, although we didn't partake in \n     them! The chips and salsa are complimentary, full of flavor and \n     constantly refilled!\n\nGlad I was able to try this gem before they closed!
