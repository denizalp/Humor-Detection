Don't have to wait for a carnival, fair or wonderland to get me some funnel cake.\n\nThis is the hot spot during the spring, summer and fall seasons along the Lakeshore. The line ups are ridiculous but definitely worth the wait. And I would suggest walking to this place from the plaza just west of it that has the shoppers drug mart, b\/c the area they have for parking is tiny and it gets packed really quickly.\n\nIt's pretty simple dessert at its best, but what separates it from every other dessert place is the FUNNEL CAKE. You don't have to spend $30 to go to Wonderland just to get a $10 funnel cake anymore. You can get it cheaper and it taste way better than the one at any Fair, Carnival or Amusement Park. As well the fruits that they use is so so fresh. Besides the funnel cake you can get Ice Cream, Banana Splits, and a Slushie to cool you off during our ridiculously hot summer. \n\nIf you do end up going make sure you bring cash b\/c there is no debit but there is an ATM but do you really wanna pay for the extra fee of $2, when that two dollars could go towards an ice cream or even better yet stay in your bank account?\n\nItems to definitely get:\n\n- funnel cake with strawberries and vanilla ice cream
