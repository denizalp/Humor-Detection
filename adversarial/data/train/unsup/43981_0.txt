I stop here often for freshly brewed decaf coffee. It's always on pour-over so I have to wait a few minutes, but, hey, it's fresh. Sometimes I splurge on a seasonal latte or a flat white, but generally speaking, it's the best tasting coffee within walking distance to my house, so they get my business. This place is always busy, but they make sure to take care of you. It's much appreciated.
