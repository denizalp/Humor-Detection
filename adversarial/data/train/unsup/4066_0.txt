I remember being in love with this store in college back in San Diego so when I saw that we had one in Arizona, I made the 30 minute drive all the way out to Chandler just to see if it was as great as it was 8 years ago!\n\nIt kind of reminds me of a cheaper version of American Apparel - but it is actually Australian Apparel. I was thoroughly disappointed because not only was the store SO tiny (about a quarter of what I remember), the quality seemed super cheap and the prices had gone up. I totally understand cheap clothing, but then have prices to match the quality like Forever 21 or similar concepts. They have mostly plain T's, jeans, etc. and since it is winter, they had a lot of sweaters and jackets. Their sale items were priced well but none of them caught my eye. I did try on one black sweater with bell sleeves but there was a snag right in the front - so the perfectionist in me couldn't spend $30 for a damaged sweater. \n\nSadly, the 30 minute drive (hour round trip) was a waste of my time but I did get a 30 minute chair massage next door!
