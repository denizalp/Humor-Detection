I have given this location way too many chances and they always disappoint me. The drive thru takes absolutely forever even if you're the next person in line. Having changes such as \"no whipped cream\" are made correctly about 50% of the time. Multiple times I've pulled up to the window and workers are gabbing and laughing. Of course people should have fun at work, I support that, but you need to pay attention to what you're doing. Messing up orders repeatedly and making customers wait 10 minutes for a milkshake is nuts.
