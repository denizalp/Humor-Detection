It seems that they could've used another employee since it took a while to get through the line of customers. I had the pork carnitas. It wasn't bad but every time I have tacos I'm reminded of the food truck tacos my friend takes me to in LA and sadly, nothing I've had since compares. Also, those tacos are $1.50 each and getting 3 will not cost me anywhere close to $10
