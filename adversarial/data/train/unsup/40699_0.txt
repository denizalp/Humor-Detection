I have been taking my cars to Sears Auto Center at Metro Center mall for years.  I will continue to and would never hesitate to refer anyone to them.  They are always quick to help any time I stop by, even putting in my new air filter or checking my tires.  Becky, Jerry and Stan are the best, very friendly and professional.  They won't do work that doesn't need to be done either, Becky has turned my mom away for an oil change when it didn't need to be done.  Stan is always there when I roll in needing help.  \nThank you, Sears Auto and friends!  I truly appreciate you more than you know!
