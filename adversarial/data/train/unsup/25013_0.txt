OMG! My new fave! The first time I was here, I honestly wasn't impressed. It was may be a week or two after they opened so they may have been still working out the kinks. During my first visit I thought the gelato was way too sweet and dense. \nHOWEVER, after grabbing some food in the area my chubby soul craved something sweet and gelato is typically one of my go-to's. Now this time, it was perfect! Smooth, creamy, with the right amount of sweetness. I mean, so freaking good!\nAs other reviews may have mentioned, tons of flavors with specials changing all the time.
