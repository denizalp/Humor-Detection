I felt downright pampered with the service I received from Arthur!\n\nGuys, this is a great barber experience and a great value!  I got the haircut, trimmed and shaped the beard, shave with hot lather, face massage with a hot towel...with that kind of treatment I'll be getting a haircut more often!\n\nOh, Arthur moved here from Queens.  Whenever I stumble on a fellow east coast transplant I have some feelings of solidarity that bring me back.\n\nArthur also runs a barber school and there is a salon for women on site as well.
