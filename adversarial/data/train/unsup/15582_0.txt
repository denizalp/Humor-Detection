This was our second time coming here. It is a bit unique as everyone knows that the wait staff wears pajamas. Okay, that is cute. The upside down umbrellas hanging from the ceiling are cute and colorful. \n\nWe decided to split a Steak and Chorizo burrito and Corned Beef Hash. Our waitress was really nice, and brought waters to the table before we even placed our order. \n\nThe burrito was huge and looked amazing. We cut into it and began eating. The steak was perfectly cooked at medium-rare. The more we ate though, we did not find any chorizo. There were eggs, but no chorizo. We figured that maybe we got the wrong order, but I didn't see any other steak breakfast burrito on the menu. So that was a bummer. it was still tasty, but not what we were looking forward to having. The Corned Beef Hash was good. It was seasoned differently than any other we have had up to this point, and because of this it kind of threw us off somehow. \n\nIt was very loud in here for breakfast. The entrance is very awkward and cramped as well. Immediately inside the door there are benches on either side. There is nowhere to stand, only to sit. While paying, people are coming in and being led to their seats. I went to wait outside because I was constantly having to move out the way of incoming customers and the wait staff. Behind the register is the door that leads out to the patio. It is just a very small area, with a lot going on all at once.\n\nAlthough the food was decent, the experience itself was just okay.
