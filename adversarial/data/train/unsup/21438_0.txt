Great, flavor, Great Value, Great selection with an interesting format.\n\nGo up to the water cooler, grab a cup of water and a sushi style menu and pick out some chatt. Don't forget to look at the specials board or you may have regrests like I did.\n\nWe had a mixed chatt, which was a little of everything in salty, sour, crunchy, starchy, creamy, spicy flavor firecracker mix. all for $3.49\n\nI could not resist the Chole Baturah, fired bread with garbanzo beans in a masala sauce and fresh onion. The bread was soft and crisp with out being greasy. And again the flavors were extremely vibrant. \n\nWe also had bada paav which is served like a burger, but it is an Indian flavored poto kanish in bread, paleo dieters be ware.\n\nThis is not the best 1st date place, but a great place to show your local knowledge and adventure as you are sitting in the aisles of a grocery store and may have some one picking out items over you table. Not to worry every one is very friendly.\n\nEverything here is vegetarian and it is not hard to even be vegan.
