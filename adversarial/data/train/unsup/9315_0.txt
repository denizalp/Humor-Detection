Lakesiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide! \n\nBumping these fine folks up a star because they carry an assortment of Lazy Janes scones. (Need I say more!) They also have free WIFI and take credit cards, not the case and my fave scone hang on Willy, so IMO they're sort of like a Lazy Janes on crack. They have all the charm with a few less food options, but everyone's pref for pastry! \n\nIt's also lovely to sit outside on the deck this time of year and the internet extends out there!
