Damn, what happened Cultures?? You guys had a GREAT Asian salad a few years ago. Huge bowl, lots of green leaves, plenty of ingredients, on-point dressing.... what I got was basically what we tend to get from franchises who cut corners just to increase profits.\n\n- Bowl is about half as big now but the price is actually more expensive.\n- Ingredient quality is simply not as good, not as fresh. \n- Amount of ingredients are less generous.\n- What happened to the awesome dressing? Tasted fake.\n\nHonestly, it's not every day I go for a health option but I'd be damned if I'd pay for an overpriced mediocre salad.\n\nSad.
