Down shifting this place to a 2 star after my recent return to visit the KING...\n\nPfffttt King of MSG to be exact. Dear lord!\n\nI never have adverse reactions to MSG but I woke up totally dehydrated, fingers and face swollen and on the verge of being sick the morning after. \n\nMSG = Mounds of Salty Garbage.\n\nI think it's safe to avoid this place now, even if you've got the munchies, the aftermath on your system is far too great.\n\nStill feeling sick 3 days later.... wont be back
