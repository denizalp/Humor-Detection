Aquatic Treasures and its staff and friendly, knowledgeable, and extremely helpful with their advice and recommendations for sustaining my fish tank.  I was extremely pleased with the great pricing, which is substantially less than other places here in town.  I was very impressed with the time that the owner took with me in helping me select my tank, equipment, and live stock, and will be telling all of friends to start coming to Aquatic Treasures.
