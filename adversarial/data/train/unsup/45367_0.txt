Calling all vegans and others with dietary restrictions! The owner is an absolute dear and will make any food to your specifications. This is one of my family's favorite restaurants. The owner made me a vegetable soup which was delightful. For my lunch today I ended up getting spicy vegetables and tofu. The sauce itself wasn't very spicy, but the chili peppers in it perked it right up.
