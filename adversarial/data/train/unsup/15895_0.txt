We jumped off the plane, got in our limo, arrived at the Bellagio and our room wasn't ready yet, so we headed here for lunch. We were there for my bachelorette party and I did have a penis headband with a condom veil, but hey it's Vegas! So the weird looks and parents getting upset was sort of strange. I understand Bellagio is supposed to be a little more \"high class\" but really? Oh well, the food was great! It's total cafe food, sandwiches and salads, french fries ect, nothing too special. They did have a small drink menu with wine, champagne, and a few wine cocktails. \n\nIf you're staying in the Bellagio and you just want a nice bite to eat that isn't too fancy I would recommend this place. If you're not staying in the Bellagio and want a bite to eat that isn't too fancy I wouldn't recommend this place. It is a bit pricey for what it is and really it's only convient if you're staying at the hotel. Basically this Cafe will deliever exactly what any other hotel cafe on the strip can provide.
