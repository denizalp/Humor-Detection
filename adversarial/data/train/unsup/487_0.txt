If someone asked me what I thought of Chili's, I'd say\n\n\"Chili's reminds me of my childhood. Walking on Jumierah Beach, we'd go here after for the unlimited chips and salsa...and for every occasion we had to have the molten Lava Cake...\n\nSeriously though, Chili's was my favourite place growing up in Dubai. It's everyone's . We love it there. (Too bad they don't serv the alchz there)\n\nSo when I heard that they opened up here in Canada, I got mad teary eyed and grabbed all my friends from Dubai and we headed over here.\n\nThe menu was almost the same,  I was so happy.\n\nSo we got the trio appz to start (called The Triple Play)  which was the texmex egg rolls, wings and chicken crispers)\n\nFirstly, In Dubai you get wings, the egg rolls and the dip. WTF with the crispers. \n\nThey were okay. Definitely not what I remembered.\n\n\nTo eat, I got the Chicken Crispers meal with the Corn on cob, mashed potatoes, and Chicken Gravy.\n\nThe Chicken was maaaad salty. The Gravy tasted like despair. But I think that's just how I feel abut chicken gravy anyways.\n\nMy friend got th fajitas, which were relaly good.\n\nAnd ofcourse, we had to have the piece du resistance, the MCLC (Molten Choco Lava Cake)\n\nIt was a tad bit burnt, but otherwise...just like we remembered it.\n\n\nWe've been back a few times...mostly for the MCLC.\n\nAnd the Sangria in the summer.\nI drank like three pitchers of that in one sitting.\nAlso, the friend I was with at that time didn't drink.\nI'm not an alcoholic.
