I have to wonder who are these sheeple who think that garbage, as long as it's famous garbage, is actually good food.  Sure, Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate was all over the Food Network and perky little Rachel Ray slathered it all over her body or something like that.  But let's get down to brass tacks: it's CRAP! absolutely friggin' CRAP!!  For $11.89 (with tax) you get Swiss Miss, ice, and milk thrown into a blender with a little whipped cream on top.  If you think that Swiss Miss, ice, and milk could possibly amount to anything worth that kind of money, not to mention the sugar-packed empty calories, then you're a sheep, an idiot lobotomized sheep who oohs and aahs over anything featured on the Food Network.  Enjoy your 12 bucks of crap.
