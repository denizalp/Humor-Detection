OK folks I'm seriously getting irritated with the one and 2 stars because this location doesn't have the full menu. \n\nAll of the low reviews because of what they don't have is going to seriously detour an investor from putting up the 2 million plus that it takes to open a full service Steak and Shake in Arizona! Yes SNS Fans it costs an investor a minimum of 2 million CASH to open a full menu SNS. While it costs just over 250,000 to open the new \"Signature\" location option. Biglari Holdings took over SNS in 2008 and in the last few years began offering the Signature option to attract franchisees. If this location does well a full SNS will be in sight for the future. They are getting their feet wet in the AZ market. \n\nI'm from Illinois where Steak and Shake originated; and yes I am highly disappointed that I cannot get a Chili Mac or a Chili 5 way or my beloved Hot fudge milkshake here. \n\nHowever I am delighted that I can at least still get a stellar Original Double Steakburger, Fries and a Chocolate shake. THANK YOU TO THE OWNERS FOR BRINGING THOSE! I APPRECIATE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nFor those of you who are saying the burger is not the same, you are wrong! \n\nYou have to order the ORIGINAL STEAKBURGER! It is listed on the menu as the Original also. Not the organic burger or the signature burger they are bigger burgers.\n\nOrder the ORIGINAL FRIES and you wont get black pepper or cheese or vinegar. \n\nAlso Steak and Shake isn't like Freddy's Frozen custard; Freddy's Frozen custard is a knock off of Steak and Shake! Steak and Shake was founded in 1934, Freddy's 2002! NUFF SAID!\n\nI've taken 3 or 4 people here and they loved it!
