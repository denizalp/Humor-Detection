This is the second issue I've had with this delivery service.  Instead of  leaving it  in our mailbox or (heaven forbid!) walking my package to my front door, the driver left it sitting on top of what used to be a pole for a mailbox.  In full view on the street.  Anyone could have picked it up.  I issued a complaint with them and also the company who used them.  They are the WORST.
