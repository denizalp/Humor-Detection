Indo-Euro Foods (subtitled \"Indian & British Groceries\") really deserves 2 Stars since it's one of the smaller and more expensive Indian stores in the Valley with no chaat stand in the back where you could get your snack on, BUT it gets an extra star simply because I can go in and easily get:\n\nA) Smarties - The better British version of M&M's\nB) Bounty - The better British version of Mounds and\nC) Wine Gums - Semi-tart gummy candy which really has no American equivalent\n\nYes, again, the candy's more expensive since it's all imported, which is A-ok for me - it'll keep me from buying it in bulk. *RESTRAINT* is a key word in my current vocabulary.\n\nIndo-Euro's Bollywood video and CD collection isn't all that great, but it's not as if I'm meandering around north Phoenix trying to watch a sari-clad girl dancing in the rain and playing peek-a-boo behind a tree with her disco-dancing boyfriend while singing in high-pitch shrill in the first place.
