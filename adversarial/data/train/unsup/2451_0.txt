Save your money. I paid Walker Furniture $400.00 for nothing. I bought a chair that was \"50%\" off and it turned out it was only a few hundred off retail.  I found this out after I had the chair delivered to my home and the chair was to hard to sit on. I would have exchanged it until I did some internet shopping and found the same chair was less expensive and free shipping. Walker has charged a 85 year old women $275.00 to return the chair and I had to pay $75.00 delivery fee on top of it all. I may never get a lift chair, It will take me a year to pay the $375.00. Thanks Walker for adding to my pain, both with my arthritis and my bank account.\n\nUpdate: I paid a total of $1594.46 for the chair, delivery was $75.00 Tax $119.47 so the chair \" on sale of 50% off\" $1399.99. Just so there's no misunderstanding.
