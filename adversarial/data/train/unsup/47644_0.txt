What a great restaurant. Food Fight really nailed this one. I have been there 2 times and can't wait to go back. The staff was friendly and welcoming. Food was excellent! I would go for the short rib stroganoff. My husband had the cod sandwich -- both were very tasty. Definitely going back and letting my friends know about this!
