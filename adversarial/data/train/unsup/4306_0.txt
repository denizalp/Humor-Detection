My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner with high expectations and they did not disappoint. Whatsoever. It's honestly difficult to find something that's not exceptional on this menu. I ordered the clam spago that was on special and was absolutely mind blown, whereas he ordered the Halibut that I tried and the only word he had to describe it was \"phenomenal\". \n\nAwesome service, great ambience and awesome views of Camelback. \n\n10\/10 would recommend
