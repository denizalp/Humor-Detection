Stopped here for lunch. Soup and salad was included w\/lunch. Entrees took a long time to come out. A large group had showed up just before us so I'm not sure if that's why it took so long. All the food was very fresh and flavorful. I would recommend if your in the area and have the time to stop by and grab a bite.
