Could not be happier with Olympian Auto Care. They have integrity. They actually know how to diagnose and work on BMW's. I went to two other mechanic shops and they completely misdiagnosed the real issue I needed fixed. I would have spend thousands of dollars if I had trusted their judgement and let them do the job they thought needed to be done. I went here and they not only figured out the real issue, out the door it was less than $200! Highly recommend this place. I can only speak to their work on a Beemer but if they can work on a Beemer with ease they can probably work on anything else like a breeze.
