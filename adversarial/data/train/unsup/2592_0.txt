I like trying new places for my birthday, but unfortunately my birthday was on a Sunday this year, and lots of great restaurants are closed on a Sunday.  Jerks.  So after my third or fourth try (after Lulu, Good Food, and something else I can't remember were closed), I came across Georges.  I've been to Del Frisco's in Piedmont Row (delicious) and Brio (eh), but I like good French food, so Georges it was.  The weather was absolutely gorgeous, so we sat outside and had just a lovely meal.  It started out with a cheese plate (chef's choice, and he chose well!) that had a couple of special kinds of cheddars I'm going to hunt down, then I ended up with the Grouper special, which was really delicious with a delicate smoked tomato sauce.  The creme on this dinner was a creme brulee (with Happy Birthday printed on edible dark chocolate...come on!) that was so thick and creamy.  All in all, a light, fresh, perfect meal.\n\nA special shout-out (I feel like I'm on Total Request Live right now, which is an incredibly dated reference) to our waiter Ryan, who was just wonderful.  Right there when we needed him, charming, and helpful.  And he comped my creme brulee, which makes him (and Georges) even better!
