Let's have a quick test, shall we? Pop quiz as it were...\n\nScenario: Let's say you own a restaurant. Let's say someone calls your restaurant asking if it's possible for you to accommodate 60+ people, and they want to know about the catering options that you have available. \n\nWhat will you do? Choose the appropriate response:\n\n(a) Explain the various options available because you're about to make $1,000+ for food and services provided. Then provide adequate customer service and yummy food with the awareness that you're not only going to make money (a good thing), but maybe a few fans in the process (also a good thing).\n(b) Refuse to honor the prices shown on your website stating instead that those prices are wrong. Only give in when you realize that the $1,000+ that was within your grasp is now slipping away.\n(c) Offer absolutely nothing additional because you're an anus who strives to fit every cheap, stingy, chintzy stereotype associated with people from the country of India (I'm Indian, I can say this).\n(d) Present your paying customers with food in small amounts so that your paying customer has to keep requesting that more food is brought out for all of the guests.\n(e) State that to-go boxes aren't allowed for the people that were supposed to come but couldn't get to the restaurant in time before closing, even though there's still food leftover that will go to waste.\n(f) All of the above except (a).\n\nThere's a correct response to this question. Salt & Pepper did not choose the correct response. They chose the incorrect response. They chose most every incorrect response possible. Like a bored student who couldn't be bothered to prep for his test, so he instead starts filling in the Scantron bubbles to spell out his name because why not, It's only a standardized test that determines the rest of your life (I had to follow through on my metaphor). On that note, what's the Canadian equivalent to the SATs or ACTs? I could Google it, but whatever...\n\nIn case there was any confusion: Salt & Pepper was disappointing. Not the condiments. Those are great. I'm a big fan of pepper. Salt & Pepper the restaurant was meh. There are significantly better Hakka options in the GTA.
