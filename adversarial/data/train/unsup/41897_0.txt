ive always had a great shawarma large and small. what kind of retard goes to a shawerma shop to order seafood or hippie food? obviously the less popular items would be out of stock and they would rather take normal orders of normal people than wait around for you to make up your mind. chicken, beef or lamb?\n\nive never seen staff without transparent plastic gloves so hygene is paramount.
