My wife and I went to dinner with another couple.we had a reservation and were seated promptly. The waiter came quickly and was followed by a young lady trainee. The drinks came fine it once the entrees arrived we had never received our bread. Once we asked for the bread they apologized and TEN minutes later it arrived. That aside, the pizza, manicotti and lasagne were very good. Other than a little service hiccup this was a good spot.
