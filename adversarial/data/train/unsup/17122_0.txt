We were robbed while my husband and two little girls were SLEEPING!!!  The person stole $1000 in cash and do you know what Excalibur did for us? A breakfast buffet for four (worth $60) which we were told we had to use it at the Luxor because they didn't have a buffet.  This ended up not being true, they did have a buffet. The management was less than sympathetic and said there was nothing they could do about it.  NEVER STAYING THERE AGAIN.  This is a sorry excuse for a hotel.  Very disappointed in the management and their lack of empathy and the way they handled our situation.\nTELL YOUR FRIENDS!!
