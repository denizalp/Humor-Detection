If I am shopping all day at the square I will stop here for sushi especially when it's happy hour. I have probably been here too many times but the sushi has never made me ill, I think that says a whole lot. The Ikura (Salmon Roe) is always fresh here, green mussels are always good here. I like that if I have my brat w me she can have pizza if she doesn't feel like sushi. I agree I probably wont go out of my way to eat here but if I am in the square I cant say no to sushi. It's not the best but its consistently pretty good! The service can be hit or miss but I have had some awesome Mojitos here they never skimp on the mint yummmm!
