So for those of you considering a thread lift from Charles. AMAZING! Gravity does take its toll on our faces, dears. I want to look happy, energetic and uplifted. Now, I do! What a difference this minimally invasive procedure has made - especially for my neck and \"jowls\". If you want to start slow, try Kybella or Forma. Charles will help you determine the best route for you. There is a slight bit of discomfort with the thread lift. It is more than worth it for the outcome!\n\n\nThe best! Charles is THE master of aesthetics. He's practical, experienced and a darling to work with. He knows how to respect your budget and always offers reasonable solutions. His team is competent and caring.
