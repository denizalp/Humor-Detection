We found this place looking for a nice spot to have a date night.  Happily for us they happened to have a Wednesday night couple's special.  For about $25 each we got an app, main, and dessert.  It sounded like it would be an ongoing deal for a while at least.\n\nThe food and atmosphere were great.  The grilled ceasar salad was a new taste for me.  The lettuce is grilled before it's added to the salad.  The pasta dish and pizza we got were both excellent.  \n\nThe restaurant is tastefully decorated, has fitting music playing, and cloth napkins.  It's a nice place to dress up a bit to go to and you can definitely invite company that's looking for a fancier evening.  It was fairly empty, there was one other group while we were there, which made for a very relaxed and attentive waitress, but I hope it fills a bit more soon.  It's an Italian gem in the neighbourhood.
