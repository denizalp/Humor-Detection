As a female I'm very worried when I go to car part stores as I feel they're going to take advantage of my lack of knowledge and my wallet. I went due to a dead battery, and while the manager (didn't get his name) wasn't the friendliest person, he helped me out promptly. Arturo was the person who changed my battery for me for free and it was done in under 5 minutes. I'm very pleased and happy with how helpful the staff was. They aren't the friendliest people, but they definitely aren't rude by any means. They got me in and out in way less time than  I thought.
