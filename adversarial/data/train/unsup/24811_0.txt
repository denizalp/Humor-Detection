COFFEE & NUTELLA rolled ice cream!!\n.\n**2017 Yelp 100 Challenge #14 **\n.\nThis place is so fun!! The staff is really nice & we first came in when they did their soft opening so it was quiet but we got the full experience. Then we went a couple more times after and it was still the same experience except there was a HUGE line which for me I don't mind waiting since I know I am getting the good hahahaha.\n\nThe ice creams are made right before your eyes & it is just like the next level UP from cold stones since they are creating the ice cream from liquid stage. \n\nI love to get the NUTELLA COFFEE ice cream in a LARGE size which is awsome!!! Add a little bit of almonds & gives that perfect little crunch that you need. \n\nOne thing that kind of bothered me was the inconsistency in size as some of my visits I get smaller amounts from certain creators when I look around and see that other people got more when they ordered the same size.
