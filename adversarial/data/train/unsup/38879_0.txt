The best American Chinese food in Charlotte! GIANT portions and delicious food all around!! Highly recommend!\n\nStarted with the chicken wings appetizer which were perfectly crunch and seasoned, and a bowl of egg drop wonton soup which was good. Had the seafood delight with an egg roll and it was so so good with large portions of shrimp and scallops. Definitely will be back!!
