Despite years of pestering from the big wigs at Restaurant Makeover, longtime owner and super duper swell guy, Dharam, remains adamant: Long live Stratengers!\n\n\"Why fix it if ain't broken\" is Dharam's response to the gentrify or die crowd. \"If I let them come in they'll change my menu and increase the prices and I'll loose my customers.\"\n\nAbove all, it's his customers that Dharam cares about. Take it from me who begged him two years ago to put in WIFI so I could work and eat, which he happily obliged to do and now sees me at least once a week.\n\nYes the interior is gaudy and some of his older customers give me the heebie jeebies. But the food is excellent for the price.\n\nBe sure to try their creamy butter chicken and garlic naan, their sizzling fajitas (2 can share) or any of their stone-oven pizzas. \n\nAnd now that it's summertime, they've rolled out a sweet selection of cocktails, including a yummy strawberry daiquiri.\n\nAll in all I love this place. It's my haunt, my dive-bar. Long live Stratengers!
