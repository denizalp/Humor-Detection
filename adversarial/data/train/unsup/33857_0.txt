We were very impressed with Mark our salesperson. He answered all our questions and didn't pressure us at all.\nWhen we walked in the door there were several employees standing around and nobody asked if we needed help. We almost turned right back around and left.\nThankfully Mark made up for there short commings. The delivery people were AWESOME! Didn't force anything thru the door and cleaned up after themselves.\nAll in all it was a good experience and we would go back again.\nThe only reason were not putting a 5 is because of the people right at the front entrance. First impressions!!
