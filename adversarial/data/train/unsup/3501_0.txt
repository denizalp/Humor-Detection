NO I WILL NOT BE GIVING YOU MORE MONEY.\n\nI plan events for a living and when I go to a website, I expect for the website to be completely up-to-date with ACCURATE information.\n\nIt is very important, especially for those who are looking for venues to hold private parties to give every last DETAIL online. So naturally, when a website says \"Now there is NO ROOM fees to book one of our private barns or VIP rooms\" - I do not expect someone on the other line to tell me they are $75\/hour or $200 an hour depending on which room we reserve.\n\nNot only did I waste 20 minutes of my time today, but I will not be planning an event at Toby Keith's...ever.
