Dirt parking lots, long walk, crappy food, and even more crappy bench seats.  It's difficult to be too harsh on the Sam Boyd Stadium.  They did host U2, and it was the best concert of my life (and I've been to many many many concerts).\n\nThe Good:\n1.  Free parking\n2.  Best concert EVER (U2\/Black Eyed Peas, 2012)\n\nThe Bad:\n1.  Hard metal seating kills the buttocks\n2.  Feels like high school\n3.  Rinky dink food stands
