This is one review I have been Dying to write!! \nHorrible, horrible experience here!! I went for a day of pampering here...thought since it was a spa it would be relaxing. WELL! the owner's 2 year old daughter was running around the place and constantly talking to the girl who was doing my hair while the owner was off doing other things..the girl was huffing and feeling resentful that she was having to babysit while she was working and I was resenting the fact that I couldn't keep my stylist's attention on my hair because she was being distracted constantly by this unruly, unsupervised toddler! It was so very bad...I was there to have my hair highlighted and a massage..I left there so annoyed and stressed out from this kid that I am actually surprised she is  still in business, as I went by the other day and the kid was still running around in there. For goodness sake, get daycare!! I go to a spa to escape the craziness of kids and relax, this is a joke!! \nAs far as the services..well, I am a former colorist and hairstylist and I ended up telling this girl how to do my hair! She did it the way I wanted and was so excited at the end she kept saying \"I can't believe I did that, it looks great!\" Well, actually, I did it as I walked her through it step by step saying, please just trust me on this...so overall, the whole thing cost me over $200 and I did the thinking and instructing and I had to put up with a little kid who's mother is clueless as to her existence and annoyance she is causing her clients.\nSo, I say, if you are looking to treat yourself and relax, go look somewhere that doesn't double as a daycare and where they hire stylists who are experts and know what they are doing. This is NOT the place. Never again!
