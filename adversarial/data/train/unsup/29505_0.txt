We went to Kaya for brunch a few weekends ago and the chicken & waffles BLEW MY MIND. Seriously. I've tried chicken & waffles at dozens of restaurants (in Pgh and outside), and so far Kaya has served the absolute best version of it I've ever eaten. Also, the bloody mary with cilantro vodka? On point.
