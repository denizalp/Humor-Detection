My original review didn't post after the opening last month! Awww nuts, well here it is again! My son plays football here and I am so glad his practice and games got switched here. This is a great addition to Queen Creek! This park has so much more to offer than any of the other parks. They have a large splash pad, a huge playground area which includes a ton of slides, swings, seesaw, pretty much everything. They have a dinosaur sand area for the little ones and they have a posted workout section. The pond is a decent size, stocked with fish and is lower than the play area so you are able to look over the lake from the top; which creates a really nice view. Down by the pond there are grills, tables and benches. The park is well lit at night and has great coverage during the day to help keep the equipment cool. The park also has large grass fields for sports and in the back are the baseball\/softball fields. Last but not least they have plenty of basketball courts, a few sand volleyball areas and the skate park! Town of QC thought of it all!
