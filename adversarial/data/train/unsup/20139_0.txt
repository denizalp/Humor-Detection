Overpriced drinks. Shitty parking options now that Phoenix downtown charges for parking meters till 10PM. Ended up parking in some sketchy \"Public Parking\" place that charges 5 bucks that was being run by some guy that looked like he was railing the white lady all night long. VIP seating facing 90 degress from the stage on some motherfornicating uncomfortable crappy seats you'd put your arse on at a place like the Motor Vehicle Division for 150 freaking big ones? Really? Blow me, motherflowers! At least there is a lot of standing room. Blinding lights in your face if you stand next to the stage though. I tolerated this to attend a packed show for RCPM last Saturday. Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers, that is. No - not a big fan. I have a friend who is and I figured I'd see them for the first time that night. Place needs a lot of work though. Bathrooms right near the entrance was another interesting clusterfarkle. I'd come again if there was someone playing that I actually gave a rat's derriere about.
