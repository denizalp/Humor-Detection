Friends and I stopped by Wendy's Noodle Cafe after a night of karaoking in the chinatown area just 10 minutes away from the strip. We were just looking to pick up some noodles to go and were greeted by a couple friend and polite staff members. Their selection includes much more than noodles. They have ramen, chow mien and many other Chinese dishes if you aren't in the mood for soup. I ordered their rice noodles with seafood and added in wantons. This totaled to around $10.50. My friends ordered their pan fried egg noodles and chicken ramen. Our food was ready and well-packaged in about 15 minutes. Keep in mind that they require a $15 minimum for credit\/debit cards. \n\nThe soup base was pretty bland but had potential. Had I been given some flavorful and spicy sauces to throw in it it could've been alright. The rice noodles were well cooked and the wantons were alright too. I was over it in about 10 minutes and ended up passing on the rest to a friend. I hadn't eaten much that day and was starving so the fact that I didn't even finish it should tell you something. I noticed my friends didn't finish their meals either. \n\nThis place wasn't necessarily bad, just very mediocre. I wouldn't go out of my way to return, especially with the million other Chinese food and ramen places in the area.
