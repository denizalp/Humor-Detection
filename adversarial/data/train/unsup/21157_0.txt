It's hard to really judge a boba place off of just one visit and one drink, but I am definitely a fan and wish I was a local so I could try more! The branding alone is amazing; I pretty much lost my shit when I walked by and saw all the boba characters. I feel like more gimmicky places like this tend to suffer on quality, but it was surprisingly good! I got the matcha milk tea with boba and it was better than the matcha drink at Boba Guys in SF (which is overrated imho). It's not too sweet but still flavorful and the boba is larger and softer than what I'm used to--it tasted very fresh. I want more!!
