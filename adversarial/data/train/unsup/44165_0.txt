Best hot dog place in CLE! The set amount for one hot dog is $5 . But there are so many toppings and sauces you can put on your hotdog! And the tater tots ate so good! Nice and crispy! Service was nice,easy and quick! Only downside was that you had to pay with cash if you wanted to get your hotdog..if you want to use credit you had to buy a drink (or something like that)
