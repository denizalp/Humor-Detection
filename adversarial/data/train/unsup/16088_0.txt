EOS Fitness - Pecos\/Russell\n\nFirst off, I have not had a session at this gym during peak hours.  My workouts have been either prior to 7:30 AM or during a weekend night.  That being said, I really like this gym because it's clean, quiet, spacious and there's a ton of equipment.  This is the newest EOS Fitness in Las Vegas.  Everything is brand new and like the other EOS gyms in our city, this one also has a pool, basketball court, and cardio theater. Located in a separate room is 3 power racks, 1 squat rack, a hack squat, and a couple of plate-loaded leg press machines.  This gym is equipped with round plates, not those octagonal plates that bite back when you do deadlifts off the floor.  If I had one wish, I wish that this gym would transfer some of their older plates from the Lake Mead, Stephanie, or Eastern locations.  It's just my preference.  I love the older plates.  The dumbbell area is stacked.  You will not have a problem finding a weight that suits you.  Their DB's range from 5 lbs. to 140 lbs.  Even better, this gym has 4 sets of 100 lb. DB's.  As for their cardio equipment, there's a lot of that stuff too.  Their recumbent bikes, stationary bikes, treadmills, ellipticals, and stair-monsters all have a good view of the TV's. Some even have their own screen.  Overall, I am a fan of this gym and look forward to my next workout here.
