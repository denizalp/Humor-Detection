We have been eating lunches here for several years and always found it to be a good experience with decent food and friendly smiling pleasant staff. \nUNTIL TODAY.\nWhen paying the bill at the register, our \"waitress\" was handing me my change and said \"Where's mine?\" \nI told her that her tip was on the table which is where we always leave it. She looked past me to the table and said \"No it's not.\"\nI replied that whoever cleared the table must have taken it.  She replied that no one took it and stuck her hand out and looked really angry. When I declined to give her any of my $3 change, she took off in the direction of the table which was cleaned off.  I wish I had stayed to see what happened next.  \nI have never seen her there before, and don't look forward to seeing her again.  She is a very unprofessional, rude and angry young lady and would not work in my business.\n\nBased on todays visit we'll probably not be coming back here to eat.
