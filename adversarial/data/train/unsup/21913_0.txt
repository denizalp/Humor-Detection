This review has been in the works since June 2011... I visited this place four times in the Summer of 2011 and chose not to write a review!  I tasted one of each and every item they had, which included ever truffle, every flavor! \n\nJanuary  2013  I see I'm still the only person on yelp who was not stunned by this place!  So I checked them out to see if something was temporarily wrong with my taste buds or, or... - _ _  and it seems they are improving...My Taste Buds, the Chocolate or maybe Both!\n\nThe Husband and Wife Team are very sweet and are the reason I gave them so many tastes before writing my final word and rating...They say the Chocolate is Tempered and that they do not use WAX  and it seems they do not, the Chocolate melts in your mouth or hands if you hold it that long (I do NOT)... This is a good sign!\n\n3-20-2013 Blueberry Chocolate Bark and the Banana Chocolate Bark were my Favorites of EVERYTHING I have eaten here!!!  Compared to Cheap \"Chocolates\" these are good!  NOT Very Good, just good!  Compared to comparably Priced Chocolate these are not quite 3 yelp stars, rounded UP to Three stars since a fractional rating does not display!
