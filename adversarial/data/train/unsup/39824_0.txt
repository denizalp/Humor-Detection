We were out of towners looking for a good place to dine out and eat dinner, we stumbled upon this place called Brio Tuscan Grill, the place looks great the atmosphere seem lively and comfortable, and so we wanted to try their food.\n\nThe service was a bit slow, the menu was pricey like most Itialian restaurants, and their food was no impressive. We had ordered a pizza for our kids off the kids menu, and the pizza had no tomato sauce on the pizza which was strange when the menu said it comes  the pizza was  made with house tomato sauce along with cheese and your choice of topping. The manger took off the price of the pizza on our bill which was good customer service move because it was only $6. My meal was very tasty I had beef tenderlion with some mash potatoes and spinach salad their portion size was small not enough to share and the prices were high. We won't be returning to the Bro if we ever had to visit Cleveland Ohio again.
