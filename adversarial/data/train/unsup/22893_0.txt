I feel as though I have written a review of Trim Time before - but I guess not. Better late than never.\n\nJennifer rocks. No, really. She, and the rest of her staff at Trim Time are awesome. \n\nI like my dogs groomed a certain way - instructions for which I gave Jennifer on our very first visit when the pups were mere weeks old. They are now three years old, and they are always groomed impeccably on every visit, with no reminders of my expectations. (Apparently, Jennifer is either a genius memory savant, or they write it down... I think it is probably the former.)  My husband can take the dogs in and not worry that I won't be happy with the results. \n\nNot only is Trim Time awesome, but they give back too. Jennifer has an animal rights blog, and at least twice over the time we have been going there has had charity events (One is coming up on Friday July 3rd!)\n\nIf you are looking for a groomer, and you live in the greater Southwestern United States, Jennifer is your woman. I think I would take the dogs to her even if I lived in San Diego. Seriously, she is that good.
