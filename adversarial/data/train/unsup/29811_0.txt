I can't complain at all about this swiss chalet location. Everything goes as you would expect from a swiss chalet chain. Friendly staff, good service and decent food. Nothing bad, nothing wrong, but like a lot of other chain restaurants... there is nothing that stands out.\n\nYou know exactly what your getting from swiss chalet and this place does just that.
