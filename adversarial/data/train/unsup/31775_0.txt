The food lands a 5 star on every aspect in my book. The presentation, freshness, and taste all are perfect. I ordered the hangover soup and added bulgolgi beef to it. I have enough food left over for dinner and lunch tomorrow. I highly recommend trying this place.\n\n**please add on some yummy Korean desserts soon! :)
