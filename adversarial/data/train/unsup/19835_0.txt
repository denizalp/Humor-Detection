Greed isn't pretty, but it's reality for this restaurant. We made an open table reservation for Valentines day.  One of us can't have any sugar, and also prefers a nice fish selection whenever possible. We thought this would be an easy place to meet our preferences. \n\nWell these guys decided that guests dining on this day can ONLY order their $59 per person prix fix meal, with few entree choices and a dessert included for each person. None of this was noted at the time of the reservation. They basically took their regular pricing for a small appetizer, entree, and dessert and bundled it all together as a mandatory packaged deal, but then RAISED the price compared to regular menu prices. \n\nSo not only do you need to order\/purchase more food than you want, with a limited selection (1 fish choice), but you have to pay extra for the pleasure of dining there.  Rude!  Why not offer the special holiday menu as an extra option for those who prefer prix fix, and not as the only menu available to order from??  Greed, that's why?!\n\nYou gouged me, so I will not be going back.
