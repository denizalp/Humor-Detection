Dear H&M,\n\nThank you so much for being in Las Vegas! I love your service so much! No matter how's others think, but I think you guys are so great! I get my blue dress the next day.... call me in the morning, pick up at night and the dress still there! Also, I love your guys lingeries section, variety style, especially in purple color :) \n\nJust one thing.... I spend tooooooo much in your store cuz I love pretty much allllllll your clothing! lol...
