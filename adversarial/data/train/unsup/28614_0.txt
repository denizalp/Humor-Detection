I just have to say that although I do have some lush products I've never actually went into a store, someone always just usually buys it for me. That being said I went into a lush store for my first time on the 11th of march and Azelyn took real good care of me! She approached me as soon as I walked in and asked if I have ever been to a lush location I advised her I hadn't and that it was my first time then proceeded to ask if I was looking for anything in particular. I did advise Azelyn that I was looking for face scrubs and she asked me what purpose I wanted it to have for myself as soon as I told her exactly what I was looking for she recommended a couple to try grabbed some and started testing them on my hand in the bowl of nice warm water(my favorite part after walking the strip for so long, great relaxation!) it was like a four step process with everything she had recommended. After she had rinsed it all off, my skin felt unbelievably soft! I loved everything and decided to buy the oatifix and let the good times roll face scrubs and the charity pot hand and body lotion as a last minute purchase. After a long day in vegas that was a good way to end my day of shopping and I honestly want to thank Azelyn who did such an amazing job on her recommendations that I love and for being a down to earth pleasant person to talk to I could tell you weren't just trying to make a sale like other places but it was about the connection you had with the customer as well. Thank you again for the wonderful customer service!
