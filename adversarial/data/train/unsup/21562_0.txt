I asked if there was a lunch special that was vegetarian. She said yes, but then charged more than the lunch specials and charged for the normal menu item. It's not a special. A rip off. $15 for an overly greasy \"veggie\" gyro that is more like a mushroom cheese steak (thanks for telling me it had cheese on it when I ordered it, I would have not gotten it had I known). No authentic greek flavors on it. \n\nSalad was awful. Tastes like italian dressing, nothing like greek dressing.\n\nI truly do not understand the reason for almost five stars. Out of all the greek food I've had, this has been the least favorite. Not healthy by any means. So greasy it soaked through the bag.
