I've been going here for about 2 months now and I can't complain. I'd feel weird giving a gym 5 stars unless they offered something ridiculous like free massages, personal training, and fat shaming... well maybe not the last one. But Independence Gym is still a great gym. Loads of people that are serious about their health, plenty of room and equipment and friendly staff. Likewise after having eavesdropped on a few of their personal training sessions I can conclude that these guys really know their stuff. I don't see anybody doing silly exercises that look like some exotic bird's mating ritual, it's all useful and effective exercises with great coaching.\n\nAll in all a great place.
