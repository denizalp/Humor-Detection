Walking down the street looking for a breakfast place on a sunday morning and happen across a sidewalk sign that says - everyone of all beliefs are welcome. If you are not hungry come in and get a hug.\n\nHoney, we're going in....\n\nQuickly, after sitting down a cheerful young woman waited on us. \n\nI ordered the big green chili burrito and my\nEsposa (see what i did there to emphasize the Latino influence) ordered the banana french toast. \n\nWhile waiting for our food we asked each other trivial pursuit questions from the cards on the table. The coffee is strong and tasty. \n\nThe food was served quickly on a paper plate with plastic cutlery. Don't let the informal setting fool you. The food was excellent. Once i gobbled down my burrito I made the excess french toast my wife left behind go away.\n\nAfter paying our very reasonable check i asked for and received a hug from Randy the owner. Hey, get over it, I'm secure in my sexuality.\n\nSo yah, I like the place and I think you will too.
