Possibly the worst meal I have had in Vegas\n\nDon't have the Lamb they have no clue how to cook it. Tough and cold\n\nService was average I hate places that add 18% to the bill for a table of 6 as the patron has no way of expressing his displeasure\nThe view is simply not worth it go to the Rio instead
