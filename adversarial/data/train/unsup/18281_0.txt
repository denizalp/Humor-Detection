I won a bid at silent auction for a $150 gift certificate to this place.  Located in Tempe and buried on the ASU Campus, this was not a restaurant that we'd normally stumble upon.  However, I am very happy that I bid on this even though I knew nothing about it...why?  Because the food here is fantastic!  Here's what we ordered:\n\nKorean Style Baby Back Ribs, $14\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=WDPYIOgCMIM-dJnKrKaMZA#WDPYIOgCMIM-dJnKrKaMZA\n\nYukon Gold Potato Gnocchi, King Mushroom, $23\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=2MsbjsZvu2hO1yeon7slaQ#2MsbjsZvu2hO1yeon7slaQ\n\nGrilled Filet w\/Smoked Cheddar Bits, Asparagus, Cabernet Sauce, Crispy Onions, $36\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=LoIz5HIBcKYZcdOsoL2CAQ#LoIz5HIBcKYZcdOsoL2CAQ\n\nGrand Marnier Creme Brulee, $6.50\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=exAY1Qtwhzc2LmQNZZxjFQ#exAY1Qtwhzc2LmQNZZxjFQ\n\nDouble Chocolate Bacon Cake w\/White Chocolate Butter Cream & Candied Bacon, $6.50\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=DquWbL5b-Xb625mfyM95SA#DquWbL5b-Xb625mfyM95SA\n\nThe Korean Style Baby Back Ribs were simply amazing!  The BBQ Sauce was sweet & tangy with just the right amount of Ginger.  Yum!\n\nAs everyone who knows me knows that I love Gnocchi....the Gnocchi here is delish.  The Grilled Filet was very good as well.  But the best part of dinner was the Dessert....\n\nThe Better Half had the Grand Marnier Creme Brulee, which I sampled and was very good.  However, the best of the best was the Double Chocolate Bacon Cake w\/White Chocolate Butter Cream & Candied Bacon....yes, that's right Bacon lovers!  This Dessert delivers the goods on all levels.....it's Chocolatey, Sweet, and the Bacon adds a little salty\/meaty goodness that causes your palette to jump for joy....my mouth is watering right now.\n\nThere were 3 things that kept me from giving this place 5 Stars:\n\n1 - Parking.  It sucks.  Jockeying for position against ASU student parking plus the customers for this place and area businesses is not fun.  They should offer a valet service up front just for customers....I'd pay $5-$10 just to avoid the nonsense.\n\n2 - Seating.  We were seated outside....not our preference, but the size of the interior of the restaurant is tiny and we were told the wait was long to sit inside.  They have a huge outdoor seating area with giant trees.  We were sat at a table for 2, the table was very small and the servers had trouble with space when we had a bottle of Wine, Appetizers, and Bread.  When then entrees came out, it was a circle jerk to rotate old plate off, etc.  The furniture is patio furniture and the pads of the seats are left out overnight, dusty.  There was a lot of bird shit on the wall next to where we were seated and fallen leaves all around us.....I was constantly worried about something dropping onto my food.  It was our decision to accept sitting outside, so it's on me.  If I come back, will definitely not sit outside, don't care how nice the weather is.  \n\n3 - Service.  It was so\/so.  We had to flag our waiter down when we were ready to order Wine....a huge pet peeve of mine.  Also, had to flag him down to order our food and refill Wine and Water glasses.  I think the majority of the wait staff here are ASU students.....they look young and don't know how to provide proper service.  When we walked up, we didn't know where to go because the hostess stand is outside and isn't obvious....2 hostesses looked at us and didn't say \"Hi, how can we help you\" or anything at all.  It was only when we started to wander around the patio area that they said \"are you looking for someone?\"....LMAO, yes I'm trying to get seated in your restaurant!  Too bad because the food is outstanding.\n\nI will give it another try and see how it goes now that I know about the things to avoid.\n\nReturn Factor - 75%
