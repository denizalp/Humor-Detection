Giving this place a better rating than this would be an insult to this place. \n\nI spent some time here a while back. It was my spot for two years. Dark times...  \n\nAs others have said, it is not for the faint at heart. Do not go here expecting an enlightening cultural experience. You remember that episode of No Reservations when Bourdain was here and he looked scared? He probably really was, and he was probably a little sad too. It's hard to enter this place and not feel the bitter tinge of sadness at what humanity has become and what it can stoop to at any moment. \n\nMy experiences here range from waiting for a six foot blond who introduced herself as the \"Paris Hilton of Salt Lake City\"  to finish her lines on the counter in the mens bathroom so I could wash up (why wash, really?), to watching Freddy Krueger officiate a fat and drunken wedding on stage, to meeting my future wife for a pre-date drink. \n\nThis place is the diviest dive bar to ever have dared to dive. \n\nIt's filthy, decrepit, and full of losers and wannabes. \n\nDefinitely a must see.  \n\nAnd the Ass Juice? Just don't. I don't care what kind of peer pressure you're under. \n\nTrust me, you don't want to fit in here anyway.
