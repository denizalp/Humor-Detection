Falcon Landscapes just wrapped up my landscaping project about an hour ago. When Joe gave me an estimate, it was reasonable and very detailed, outlining exactly what we had discussed during our meeting. He and his staff worked very efficiently to turn my sad, barren backyard into an easy-to-manage, aesthetically pleasing area.\n\nI'm the kind of girl who asks a LOT of questions... like a LOT... and he was very patient and had real answers for me. His team made sure that every new plant has its own irrigation drip(s) and that the system was set up so that I have no worries about the maintenance and hydration of my new yard. They even placed the new plants so that they can grow for a good amount of time between trimmings. I wanted a simple, easy to maintain desert landscape, which to many landscapers just means to throw rocks over the whole yard. Joe had a great suggestion to put a shade-bearing tree as a focal point in the middle of the yard and create a decorative border using pavers, and it worked out beautifully! They exceeded my expectations.\n\nI truly believe that Joe and his team have a great customer focus and are a great value for the service and reliability they provide. I'll be using Falcon Landscapes for any future landscaping projects I have here in the valley.
