They take BCBS which is why I chose them.\nI spent a lot of time here yesterday since I was getting an eye exam, contacts, and choosing glasses. I was always addressed politely and due to the staff I actually had fun the whole time, especially while learning how to use contacts (time consuming and frustrating). The staff is very personable and the Doctor is young, but very competent and friendly.
