Hotel - My husband and I both enjoy staying here.  It's clean and the air here is much fresher than at other casinos\/hotels on the strip.  The rooms are lovely and the panoramic view we had of the strip was spectacular.  I enjoyed having a good soak in the deep tub they had and the robes they provided were great.  We are looking forward to either staying there again on our next trip or their sister hotel the Encore.  \n\nCasino - the slots were a lot tighter then they were on our prior trip but the table games were still fun with plenty of other players.  \n\nBuffet - It's one of our favorites, with a great selection and atmosphere. \n\nCafe - There's a little \"cafe\" near the guest elevators that's open 24 hrs with food and drinks you can order if you're looking for a quick meal or snack.  The food isn't very good considering the cost but I really did enjoy my frozen caramel drink with the extra shot of espresso.\n\nParking - FREE.  I love that they aren't trying to charge their guests for parking like so many of the other casinos on the strip.  We love knowing that the Wynn & Encore have refused to follow suit with the likes of M-Life casinos and others who have put greed above their guest by trying to squeeze out a few extra bucks.  One of my main reasons for coming to Vegas is to get my gamble on.  I budget for my losses and know that lady luck isn't always on my side so if I'm not winning it's not great but having to pay for parking on the way out feels like rubbing salt in the wound.
