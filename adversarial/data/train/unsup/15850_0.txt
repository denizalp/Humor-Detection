I would love to give this place a full 5 star if they could have chosen more comfortable and better designed high-chairs for shorter persons.  I am 5'4\" but I had both my feet landed on nothing the whole time during my meal.  My legs were numb when I left my seat.  I love those high-tables and high-chairs setting at the covered balcony level next to the patio.  However, I wish I were at least 2 inches taller lol.\n\nAlright, other than the high-chairs, everything was perfect for me.  The service was very friendly and attentive since we entered the restaurant.  I enjoyed my Mojito.  We ordered food to share.  We had Chicken Samosas to start with (it tasted good but the pastry was a bit too dry), Garlic Naan (yum...), Beef Biryani and Lime Lamb (heavy but yummy).  There were basically too much food for two persons.  We ended up packed home half of the beef biryani and lime lamb.\n\nThe restaurant is located just opposite to the Square on Unionville Main Street.  Their patio is certainly a nice spot to have some food and drinks while enjoying a festival performance at the Square, if any.
