What an amazing gas station. Most unusual, unique, clean, special gas station I've ever been in. Found it by accident while at the Arizona Bike Week. It is well worth a visit.I would pay more just to go there but no need because their prices are in line, their food is delicious the items that they have in the store for sale are unique and special and no I don't work for Tom Thumbs I just want to say it is an amazing place.
