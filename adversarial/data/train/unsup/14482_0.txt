In the heart of all the square1 hoopla, there lived a not-so-little- library that could! \n\nThis place is practically a historical piece of Mississauga. It's been around for ages and is constantly undergoing new changes. I wouldn't call all the changes improved (paid parking - where is your loyalty Mississauga???)\n\nFor the most part there is room for the entire student population in the neighbourhood. This library is the largest of all the community libraries (with the exception of UFT in Mississauga). \n\nThe lineups for checking out and in are usually pretty quick, with the exception of closing time line up. \n\nseparated by floor for each subject, there tends to be more organization at this location than most community libraries. Every floor has it's own bathroom, with the exception of the 2nd. There is a central escalator that is wrapped around with a circular staircase , for the more agile populace. The feature I appreciate the most is how wide the staircase portion is. This helps me matrix dodge the teenagers logging around or the slow walkers. \n\nThe computers with free Internet feature is pretty much as abused as you can imagine. Buddy a few seats down thinks he is at home, or at least at some guarded section , or in a crowd of blind people (you get the picture). Least favourite feature is how close I have to sit to witness this. \n\nI do like that in every corner there is a table chair set that provides seating for all. From large \"study\" groups to book strollers( yours truly). \n\nI do wish that the foreign section was larger or at the least - current! I don't really want to see foreign magazines from 1982. It sort of defeats the purpose of self updating. Also, some more mining in the oriental section would be nice. \n\nThe help desk ladies are not the friendliest but they get you what you need so I opted not to order a free McDonald's smile out of them.\n\nEven with all the questionable and slightly concerning creaks, paid parking,  colourful gum art underneath chair seats and my overdue fines - I still like visiting this Library. I like that I can stroll any random section without anyone annoying me or offering me 34% off coupons.  \n\nLong Live Free Book Places That I Can Roam About Freely (a.k.a Libraries)\n\nxoxo\nM.
