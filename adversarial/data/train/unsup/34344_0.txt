I've been hearing good things about this coffee house in Cave Creek so when Big Pete Pearson was playing there I decided to go. The show was excellent and Big Pete Pearson is wonderful person the service was attentive, and the food was good. Comfortable place to just hang out with your date. It would be nice to see more of the outdoor entertainment like this.
