Meh. Kind of generic. Service was, however, fast, informative, and friendly. All the ingredients were fresh, aside from pico de gallo and corn salsa, but they really lacked flavor. The pico was waterlogged and lacking cilantro, while the corn relish was full of cheap frozen corn that was overcooked with no taste to the salsa or existence of other ingredients. It's \"shrimp season\" so the shrimp is a choice ingredient for tacos, burritos, bowls, etc. but it's TINY shrimp (one step above salad shrimp) and they are also lacking in flavor or seasoning. With all this being said, Hothead does offer about 10 sauces to squirt on your taco, burrito, bowl, etc. but they don't make up for the lack of taste in everything else. The chips that accompany a meal are stale, generic, and heavily salted. They are definitely bulk chips and not house-made. I probably would visit one more time for a second chance but not a huge fan just yet.
