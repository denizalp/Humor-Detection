This was a great find!!  In town for the weekend and didn't want to deal with the crowds.  We were looking for great sushi and we found it!  The place was easy to find, quiet and the food was absolutely amazing.  If you are looking for the normal rolls, they have a few, but their off the beaten path combinations of flavors in all of their outside the norm dishes will knock your socks off.  Don't be afraid to try something new.  The wait staff was phenomenal...so friendly and informative.  And do NOT forget to save room for dessert.... Such amazing taste combinations!!!  One thing to note... If you're a big eater and looking for big portions, this is not the place.  The food presentation is beautiful as well.  Give them a try... You will not be disappointed!!
