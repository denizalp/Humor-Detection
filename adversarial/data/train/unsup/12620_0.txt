3.5 stars \n\nWe had a much better experience with take out last night. I called in around 9:30 for some spicy chicken kee mow. They said it would be ready in 10 mins. We got there around 9:55p (10p closing time) for pick up. \n\nAll the servers and cooks had stopped working at this time to have a meal of their own. They were sitting down feasting before closing time, not the best business approach. They were clearly not happy about my bf and me walking in as they thought we were here for a sit down meal. The attitude changed when I told them I was here for pick up. \n\nI paid about $11-12 for a generously portioned pad kee mow. The portion and flavor was much better than what we experienced during our last sit down visit. Not sure how that works, but I will be ordering take out at the last minute from now on.
