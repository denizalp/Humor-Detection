Fun tapas experience in a cool little spot on Butler Street.  Cure is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh, and even though Morcilla is from the same team, I probably should have tempered my expectations given that Morcilla is a completely different dining experience than your typical sit down meal.   Everything was good, don't get me wrong, but none of the plates (which looked beautiful by the way) were out of this world amazing.    Definitely an ambitious restaurant (for Pittsburgh) that I appreciate and am happy to see is doing well.  Even though I wasn't too high on any of the plates, I know how talented Chef Severino and his team are, and I 100%  plan on visiting again.
