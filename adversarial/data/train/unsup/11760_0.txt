Great service at this place! Wow, just talk loud enough to be heard over the din of over-dressed people sweating it out finding the best of a specific size skate or length of snowboard or ski. This should be your first stop if you would like to experiment with any kind of sport since the staff is knowledgeable and used to dealing with first timers. Silly questions won't bother them, they are accustomed to it. Prices are very reasonable and they take trade-ins of your old gear. At least they will take their used gear back the next day or the next season if you want to trade up or get a different size. Then you will only pay the difference and help support the store with renewed stock, a very cool idea! So there you go - no excuses when someone says, 'Let's go skating!'
