First time at the DM, in town for a meeting. Smallish but dark and cozy. Sat at the bar and had a couple local brews. Once I got used to the sweet sauce, the lamb lollipops were excellent. Sidy was the most courteous, conscientious bartender I've met in a while. Good food, good drink, great service. Will be back.\n\nFinishing the review a couple days on. Still have positive things to say. Enjoyed the food, the bartender was great. Small-ish and dark, but in a good way. Felt comfortable. Would go back for the lamb alone.
