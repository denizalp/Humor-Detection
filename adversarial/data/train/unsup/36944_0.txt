We've been going to Echo sushi for almost 8 years now, it's our favourite place. We used to get a lot of \"all you can eat\" deals, which are always great, and a good value for your money. Now we're less greedy and still enjoy their food. Even our kids like it. Try the grilled eggplant, if you're not into raw fish; or cubed steak w\/garlic; or katsu don. And the brown rice sushi is really yummy too. In short, a great place and I hope they stay there for a long, long time.
