I'll be damned.  I swore I would never use OnTrac again but I did, albeit on accident.  I chose standard shipping (not gonna do overnight ever again), so I assumed that Amazon.com was going to use UPS like they did for every other piece of my order.  I chose standard 3-5 or whatever for everything and the piece of equipment that ended up being shipped out by OnTrac got to me today, when its estimated delivery was actually for Monday, just like everything else.\n\nSo, OnTrac, you did it.  You got something to me three days early.  Now, if only UPS would hurry the fuck up, I'd have everything I need for my camera.
