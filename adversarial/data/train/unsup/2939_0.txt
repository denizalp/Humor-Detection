I found blood on my bathroom door and the hotel supervisor had the nerve to charge me $126 for the stay.... only comp was letting me leave early no penalty.  Um I had to end my trip early!!  Who wants to have to do that? Not helpful and not acceptable.  This is a health hazard!! I should have walked away not having to pay a cent to sleep near that filth.  Cheap slum - that's the mirage these days apparently being only about As clean as a motel 6. stay anywhere else on the strip. This place isn't worth a thing with the way the hotel is kept.
