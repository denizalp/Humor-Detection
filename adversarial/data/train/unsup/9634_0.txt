So everyone I know RAVES about Goyemon. Whenever someone asks for the \"best sushi\" it is always mentioned. I came to realize this place has the same menu as Sushi Mon. And all the rolls taste the same. So If you LOVE Goyemon, then you should LOVE Sushi Mon too, amirite? I wonder if they are the same owners?\n\nI met my friend Jessie here for lunch on 1\/21\/16 around 12:30. It was busy, but not packed like it usually around lunch time. It did take us a while for us to receive our food though. This was mildly annoying because I only had an hour for lunch, but in that time I was able to try a decent amount of items:\n\ngarlic edamame\nsuper white tuna\nscallops\ngarlic tuna\nlemon roll\nlasagna roll\ndomingo roll\n\nThe garlic edamame is really good. It doesn't have diced garlic, but rather a subtle garlic flavoring on top of all the beans. The super white tuna was melt in my mouth delicious, and is always one of my favorite nigiri items. I also got to try the scallops and the garlic tuna that Jessie had, both were very good. \n\nThe rolls were next. I already love the domingo\/lasagna rolls so I knew what to expect and they were delicious. But the lemon roll is definitely a new favorite! It is just a california roll with lemon on top but it's so light and refreshing. I ordered 2 of these but we only got 1 due to time constraints. AYCE also includes dessert but I didn't have time for that either. For AYCE lunch it was reasonably priced at $21.95.
