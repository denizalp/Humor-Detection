Deep in the bowels of a random strip mall on Fort Apache and Tropicana lies Teddy's Bakery.  No, really, it's in the bowels --you will not find this place unless you're desperately searching for the Tropical Smoothie Cafe.\n\nAnyways, from the outside it looks promising.  Little tables filled with Bulgarian patrons, eatin' their pastries, enjoying their al fresco dining experience in the parking lot.  So quaint, or something.\n\nThe selection inside, however, not so promising.  The bakery case is filled with about a dozen, unfortunate-looking cookie selections ($12.00 a pound, yikes!). The cookies are joined by random cakes, tiramisu,  and sad-looking baklava.  Considering it's a Bulgarian joint, I was hoping for something a little more exciting.\n\nI tried a piece of the Bavarian cream cake ($3.50 a slice).  It wasn't very sweet, a Eastern European trademark, which was a huge plus for me. Sadly, the cake also wasn't very moist and was smothered by huge globs of frosting.  It's not something I'd buy again.  This bakery would be a good stop for someone without a big sweet tooth.  2.5 stars.
