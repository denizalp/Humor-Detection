I went here while visiting family and I love this place!! They have great flavors (my favorite is birthday cake) and a great amount of toppings.  I love that you pay by the cup and not the ounce that is such a clever idea. They also have slices of cakes and full cakes in a freezer by the register which looked good as well. The establishment was extremely clean and well kept up i would definitely go here again and recommend it to others.
