Excellent mushroom soup and corn chowder soup. The corn chowder had crab meat chunks inside. Both were very flavourful. Great soup and wrap deal, especially for dinner. The lamb wrap was really moist. Nice seating in the back. It's probably a lot busier during the lunch hour, but we got seating no problem for dinner
