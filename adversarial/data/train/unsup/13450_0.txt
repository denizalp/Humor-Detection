I haven't been to a red lobster in years. There aren't any by me in Vegas and there are tons of other seafood places so that's probably why. However when visiting my family its a close option especially on Good Friday when we can't eat meat. \n\nWe arrived and were welcomed by a strong stench. We kept trying to  figure out what the odor was but luckily we were seated fairly quickly. Not the friendliest hostesses, pretty sure she didnt even say welcome or make eye contact until she sat Us.\n\nWe were seated and a few minutes later out server took our drink order. It took him a good 10 minutes before hr came back with our drinks. We ordered our food and he seemed irritated or something, like he didn't want to be at work. Anyways. The promptness of the service would definitely get a 0. By the time we got our food from the time we were seated it was 45 minutes. Thats a really long time considering they were not busy at all. In our section, shoot on our side of the restaurant there were only 4 other tables sat. \n\nAs for the food, we ordered thebUltimate Feast. It was pretty good and no complaints for the food. The biscuits are really yummy. Thats my 2 stars.
