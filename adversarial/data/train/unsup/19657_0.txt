Cleveland Bagel Co. bagels can be found around town at Pour, Platform Brewing, and a number of other hip hotspots. These are the real deal and every bit as good, or if I dare say so, even better than the esteemed NYC bagel (no hate mail please). The bagels are a gorgeous slightly off-circle shape, with a luscious slight crunch to the exterior when toasted, and delicately leathery pull, with a perfectly chewy center. Highly recommend the everything bagel, which features the perfect blend of sesame, poppy, salt, and any number of other goodies. Somehow these manage to stay fresh and tasty long after other \"bagels\" have lost their fluffiness. I'm surprised methheads haven't taken to using these as a form of alternate currency in lieu of Tide, they're that good. Find your local Cleveland Bagel Co. retailer and run, don't walk for you're little round piece of heaven.
