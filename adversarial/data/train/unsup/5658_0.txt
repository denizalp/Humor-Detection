Most over-hyped pizza in town.\n\nVery crunchy, over-baked crust that was covered in black soot or some kind of crap that looked identical to black soot. Sauce that was too sweet and cheese that was M.I.A. Call me picky, but I like cheese on my pizza. Especially if I'm paying more than the price at any other pizza joint in town for it.\n\nLGO pizza is far better. And it's also next door to the best effing gelato you'll ever have (Arlecchino).\n\nLike my man Flavor Flave says--don't believe the hype.\n\nOr, like I like to say--don't drink the kool-aid you effing moron.
