Holy sandwich heaven. I have been meaning to try this place for SO long as I am a major Pizzeria Bianco addict. AllI can say is that it did NOT disappoint. The ingredients were so fresh and you could taste it. They only use vegetables that are in season, hence not having tomatoes but red peppers instead. I could eat their homemade bread by itself all day, every day and be a happy camper! My sandwich had prosciutto, homemade mozzarella, fresh basil, roasted red peppers, and EVOO. It came with a side of their white bean salad which was also to die for! This is a great place for business lunches as they have large tables in their back room or picnic tables out front. I will be back soon, for sure!!! (This review literally made my mouth water just thinking about it!).
