We came here on a Friday night and ordered their specials\n1. Burger and Beer, 5\n- Extra cheese, 50c\n2. Prime rib, 9.95\n$19. \n\n- A bit of a wait time to be seated. Expected for a Friday night. \n- shallow whisper...strawsssss? huh? haha..uh, yes please. \n- Reminds me of Grand Cafe but worse. \n- Burger was good. Made medium not extra for grilled onions. Definitely get the cheese. Made it juicy.\n- Choice of Tenaya Creek or Bud Light. \n- Prime rib was chewy. Very similar to the taste of a Station Casino buffet. Decent enough to clean the plate after a few too many\n- Fries were thin. \n- Drunk? Come here for a cheap eat! Sober? Get inebriated then come back here to eat.
