Did the Red Rock Canyon tour -- and it was the second most fun I had in Vegas. First was the Penn & Teller show. \n\nThe guides take good care of you, the cars are fun and the views are spectacular -- especially if you're not from the region and don't get to see this kind of landscape much. Way better than just taking your own car out. Also, I was a little worried about safety - but once we got on the road, I got comfortable pretty fast and the guides do a good job of guarding the convoy of little cars with guide cars in both the front and back.
