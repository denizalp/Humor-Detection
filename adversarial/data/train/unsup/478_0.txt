Run away from this place, every time I've ever been here and had a full set they break, and then they blame the customer for having thin nails haha what a joke.  The quality of the product is not good that's why they don't last long, 3 days and a nail cracked right in half ! Talk about painful! It's not like I hit it on anything, I literally was drying off after the shower and it happened.  Very disappointing and this is why I will Never be back.  You get what you pay for, I regret coming here for my birthday nails.  I usually go to Polish Me Nail Boutique in old town scottsdale but couldn't get in, I don't appreciate the level of customer service here at ocean nail, they talk smack about customers in English & in Vietnamese. I know a few naughty words in Vietnamese unbeknownst to them.  Jessica is the lady that runs front desk she's always there she never smiles and makes you feel very rushed.  Not cool \n\nPrices are good \nCustomer service horrible \nCleanliness unsatisfactory
