Called in to ask if they were buying clothes and the employee on the phone assured me that they were. She also said they looked at and bought clothes up until 6pm. \n\nWe made the voyage to this side of the world and we made it in around 3:30pm. The girl working the counter asked us if we were there to sell and I said yes. \n\nShe ended up sending us to the selling counter and another girl came out from the back to help us. I \"signed in\" and she started looking at my bag of clothes. (I had about 35 items)  \n\nI decide to walk around to look at their merchandise. The racks were practically empty, the clothes they did have, looked more like rags, and mostly all the shoes looked like they were worn out stripper heels, ewww. \n\nLiterally like 3 minutes of me leaving the counter the employee calls out my name. She puts my stuff in my bag and proceeds to tell me that they are currently not buying anything because they have a ton of stuff in the back. \n\nUGHHHHHHHHH. I grabbed my stuff and left. Don't waste your time! Go elsewhere to sell your clothes, unless it's old rags your selling. Then I guarantee you, they will buy it.
