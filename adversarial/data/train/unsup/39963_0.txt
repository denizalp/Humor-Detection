My husband and I stopped here for lunch on our way through town. I can easily say that this place is my new favorite restaurant. From the charming decor to the friendly servers to the huge menu, we really loved it! While we were eating, the tables quickly filled up, and we noticed that the server (perhaps the owner) already knew the \"regular\" orders of the patrons. We were impressed! Thank you! We will come again!
