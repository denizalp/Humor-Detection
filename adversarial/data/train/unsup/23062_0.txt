I haven't had the pleasure of dining here yet but Im sure that's in the near future. But this place as a nightclub... is awesome. Came here a few weeks ago with a group for Dash Berlin. We had the table directly behind the DJ booth where we got to enjoy the music and intimacy with the DJ all night. It was truly an amazing experience. I really like venues like this one and Marquee Day Club. Where you can actually mingle with the DJ before\/after his set. The ambiance was beautiful as well. Bartenders were great along with our cocktail server. I will defineatly be returning to this venue in the fiuture.
