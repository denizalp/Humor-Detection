Food was average, but considering we had two for one it was just okay.  However, we won't be going back.  The Buffett had a very unpleasant dirty stink to it.  Floors filthy with dropped food, and trash every where but the trash can.  Strong odor of cigarette smoke drifting up to dining area.  Been there many times, but no more, even with a deal.  If it was for free, the wife and I agree no thanks.
