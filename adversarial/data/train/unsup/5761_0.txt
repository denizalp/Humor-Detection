Churn is an old school ice cream parlor. It gives you the feels as you stand in line among all the candies from your childhood. I got a double scoop of butter pecan and Vietnamese coffee with added fluff on top. The toasted marshmallow added a touch of sweetness to the coffee ice cream. It's a cute spot for an after dinner treat or a date!
