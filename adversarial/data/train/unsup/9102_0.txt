This used to be my favorite place to get Indian fry bread when the state fair wasn't around. This is my first time going to the new location and it's kind of scary. Inside, it looks like an old Mexican restaurant and they have cloth hanging everywhere to hide windows and openings. The staff doesn't try to make conversation at all. As far as the food goes, the fry bread itself was great but the beans were cold. I don't know if I'll return. I'm kinda disappointed.
