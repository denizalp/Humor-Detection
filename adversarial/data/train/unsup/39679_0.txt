I cannot say enough great things about Lifted Trucks, and Truckmasters.  After purchasing my 2013 Ford F-150 Limited the check engine light came on.  Unfortunately, there was an issue with the turbo inner cooler.  After speaking to James about the issue he asked for an estimate, and he paid the entire invoice.\nMy truck is AWESOME, but more importantly Lifted Trucks, and Truckmasters are even better.  James has earned my business for all of my vehicles in the future.\n\nThanks again James for everything!
