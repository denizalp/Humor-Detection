Hertz is the WORST company to rent a car from!! There are way to many companies both cheaper and easier to deal with.\n\nWe have informed our accident and injury attorney how horrible Jowanna at their Corp office was and told them to NEVER recommend Hertz again! Instead of helping us resolve our situation she just spoke very rude and condescending then threatened to have us arrested and charged with felony theft for the rental car that we obtained through Geico Ins. from an accident where their client smashed our brand new vehicle. \n\nIt would've been nice if she would have given us some helpful options to resolve the insurance issue or at the very least allowed us the time to contact our attorney's office and get this taken care of right away. \n\nWe will NEVER recommend working with Hertz. They do NOT care about their clients they are to big of a company to care about customer satisfaction.\n\nThere so many other companies to chose from so I would recommend going another route.
