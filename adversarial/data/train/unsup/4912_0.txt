AVOID AT ALL COSTS\n\nStopped in to purchase a rotisserie chicken.  Prepackaged chicken leaked hot grease on my foot, ruining my shoe.   Store manager thinks that is not Wal-Mart's responsibility.\n\n\nGo to a store that doesn't rely on slave wages, non-American made goods ... leave Wal-Mart for the bottom feeders.  Go to a store that values it's customers ... like Safeway, Fry's or AJ's.  (unless of course you really need a rotisserie chicken to ruin your shoes).
