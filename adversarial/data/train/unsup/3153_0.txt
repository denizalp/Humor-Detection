Got the My Thai with boba, and I enjoyed it. Good boba consistency The place is cute and I like the names of the drink sizes (hug, kiss, and smooch). The drink names are a bit confusing like some have mentioned, had to look over the menu a few times to understand what the options are. My friend got the almond milk tea with boba and liked it as well. Located near the food court, plenty of flavors (mostly fruity) and sidekicks to add (boba, poppers and jellies).
