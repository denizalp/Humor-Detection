I would never take our dogs to another veterinarian. Dr. Roach and his staff are amazing! They are all super compassionate for you and your pets needs. I've had the pleasure of dealing with Dr. Roach and some of his staff prior to him opening up west Russell animal hospital and no matter how far he moves he is well worth the drive. Knowing our dogs are treated with respect and love is soo comforting and hard to find. I trust him 100% to do right by my dogs and he has proved in the past to go above and beyond to help save my dog. He has always been honest with us and our dogs needs- putting what's best for them first. He's never suggested anything unnecessary to make more money and speaking of money; his prices for teeth cleaning during dog dental month is by  far the cheapest we found. Even if they can't get your dog in while they have special pricing if you make your appointment during the promotion they will honor the price. There is never a long wait when making your appointment or while your there. If you love your pets like family I  highly recommend taking them here.
