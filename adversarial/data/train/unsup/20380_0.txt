Had 5 cars done at AZM. The best window tint shop. They also have audio system too. Actually sitting in the shop waiting for my new window tint. Post from iPhone.\n\n****************************************************\nWAIT! Here is the update 2009-06-30 1:55PM\n****************************************************\nHad 5 cars window tinted at the shop in the past years. I think I have gave the 5 stars review too fast. The owner seem to changed few time in the past year. I will write more review about this shop when I get my car fixed.\n\nThe first 4 cars tinted in the past years are perfect. Somehow the 5th one got screwed up. The job was done OK with a visible gap\/edge between the film and the window frame. They took the car back for re-tint some of the pieces. It turns out using the wrong film and scratch\/chip the window frame on my new car. They guy tinted the window seem to be nice, but getting inpatient when we ask why the frame was chipped and the film was wrong. Not trying to finger point, but wanted to get it fixed. \n\nWaiting for the owner to call back and see what they can do to fix it. Will update the review.\n\n****************************************************\nWAIT! Here is the update 2009-07-01 4:55PM\n****************************************************\nFinally, the re-tinted windows are fixed without no cost. The chipped window frame will be replaces with one of the body shop without cost me anything. It is very hassle, but they are willing to work out the issues and fix the problem. \n\nStill give them 5 stars, since I was very satisfied with them for the first 4 cars.
