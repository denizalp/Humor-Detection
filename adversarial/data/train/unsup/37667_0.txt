This is my third visit and I must say that the food is always fresh and delicious and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  I love the chicken kabob, where the meat is always tender and juicy. The basmati rice is plentiful and aromatic.  I ordered a new dish (for me) to go, it was supposed to be eggplant and peas.  When I got home and dished it out, there were peas and pieces of lamb in a thick, mild tasting sauce.  I'm guessing it was not what I ordered, but it didn't matter, it was tasty.  I will order the eggplant next time.  \n\nAs for my other two visits, I dined at the restaurant.  Service was quick and the salad that came with the platter was fresh and crisp. And their gyros with tzaziki sauce is excellent and makes for an inexpensive and delicious lunch or dinner.
