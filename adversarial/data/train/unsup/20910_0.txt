This place closes earlier than most competitors, so it took us a while to finally make it out to Fuego before closing time. It's a pretty bare-bones taco shop with some tables, chairs, and a salsa bar.  \n\nWe ordered some street tacos with carne asada and barbacoa, as well as one of their fuego tacos, which is a bigger-sized carne asada taco that incorporates cheese and a deadly jalapeno into the mix. While I saw other meat options on the menu, they seemed to not have much else available since they were within 30-45 minutes of closing.\n\nI really liked the mesquite-flavored carne asada. If I were writing a review strictly based on the carne asada alone, it would be much higher. The smokey flavor can be subjective, but I've always been a big fan. The barbacoa was just average. As for the fuego, it definitely lives up to its name! The inclusion of the pepper made it way too hot for my tastes, as it was the only one that I didn't finish. The rice, on the other hand, was pretty bland.\n\nOverall, I didn't think the tacos were too bad. Definitely not the best I've ever had, but not quite the worst either. We might return at some point in order to try some of their other options during an earlier hour of the day.  \n\nRecommended to try out.
