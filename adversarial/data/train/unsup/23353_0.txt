How these people sleep at night is a mystery to me,  they are a Ruthless bunch of jerks, not just their policies, but some of their staff as well.  I received a bill from these people for an unpaid medical bill I didn't even know I had (I received no prior billing from the company that used these jerks to collect, and like any other situation where you are hospitalized, you have many medical bills to pay and probably signed your name to many things you had no idea you were signing when you were dying and barely conscious), a nice girl called me up to come down and discuss it, and I did, thinking if this is legit, I'll try to work something out, and when I got down there, I encountered a total jerk who didn't want to hear any of it,  and with bullying and threats with court from this \"person\", I nearly walked out, but then the nice girl from the phone call  came out wondering what happened, after talking I agreed to make monthly payments which I could not afford due to owing other medical bills that I was trying to get ahead on, but I did not want to get sued.  I offered to make payments 3 months from that point when I would have been in a better financial situation to do so and they would not take it,  for a bill that was already supposedly over 2 years old, if the bill is even legit.  I made my arrangement, and started with the payment schedule.  A few months later, I was $40 short on a bill (I'm an independant contractor, my pay varies every week so keeping on this schedule was not a reality but I did try) and to be honest, I hoped to be able to pay it later in the week.  I honestly forgot about it which I take full blame for, and when I went to pay the following month (which I would have been able to make up the difference), they took that payment, THEN told me to wait so someone else could talk to me.  Apparently, the $40 short payment (my monthly payments were $200) was enough to have their lawyer draft a letter, which added $500+ to my balance, and were in the process of putting a lein on my house and garnishing my wages of 25% a week until the debt was settled.  I had my back against the wall once again with these people and they had set up another payment schedule which would have been $300 a month (I was having trouble with $200 and they set me up for $300- makes me wonder what their agenda is).  Needless to say, I went to a high interest payday loan place and borrowed the money to pay these people off, because the extremely high interest payday loan places  have higher moral standards than Allied Collection Services, if that helps you.
