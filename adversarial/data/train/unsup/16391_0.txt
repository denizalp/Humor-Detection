What everyone else said. :) Effing gorgeous club!\n\nSome things I want to add:\n\n-Go on a Friday night, it's less crowded and you will be guaranteed in with no problem at 9:30pm. Either that, or grab a stamp first then come back and skip the line!\n\n-Drinks can be a bee-yotch to get cause of how packed it is everywhere. I was in front of my bartender for 20 min and he skipped me 3 times, even for a dude who came after me! Rude, I say.\n\n-All the tables for gambling are all BLACKJACK, or at least the night we were there, just as a note.\n\n-Some ladies should NOT be up on those stripper poles. Some chick full on slid herself down the pole upside down with her asscheeks hanging out. Too explicit for me! plus security pulled her off after that.\n\n-Do bottle service, you won't regret it. Waiting in line for drinks is a buzzkill alone! We would've sprung for it but they were sold out, of course. I hear the standard is $500 for a bottle for 4, plus gratuity. Not too bad. They also have cabanas and the second level cabanas if you're feeling it.\n\n-Thank goodness for the attendants in the bathrooms, guiding the girls to the next available stalls.. makes the line move way faster!\n\n-We spotted Victor Drai walking around. Hard to imagine that a team of 60 yr old entrepreneurs created this club. damn!\n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, I am definitely reserving bottle service ahead of time! Until then..
