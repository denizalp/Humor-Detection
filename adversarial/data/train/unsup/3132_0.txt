I once had the pleasure of sitting next to Gordon Ramsay at STK and even snuck a picture.  I did not have the cojones to go chat it up with him (crying inside). \n\nJust a little claim to fame anecdote.  I hope you guys find it impressive because I tell this story at least 2-3 times a week.\n\nMy BF and I are both really big fans of Gordon Ramsay and our favorite show to watch together is Kitchen Nightmare.  This Pub & Grill seemed like a nightmare, to a small degree of course.  One thing Gordon Ramsay boasts on the show is a small fresh menu.  The menu was far from small and seemed to have everything under the sun. \n\nWhat I ordered was pretty impressive.  It combined everything I loved.  Scallops, clams, in a chowder broth with BACON.  BACON BACON BACON.  Love me some BACON.  Although the food was delicious the price left me wanting more.  I had the scallop dish and my BF had the fish and chips.  Our tab was nearly $75 with tip.  And, NO we did not order soda or alcohol.\n\nFood here was good but not worth the price.  You are better off going to the food court a few feet away.
