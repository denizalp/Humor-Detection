They sell sandwiches. And they have valet.\n\nLet me rephrase for maximum ridiculousness: It is a sandwich shop with valet parking.\n\nI imagine the absurdity of it is lost on Brad and Buffy, who drove all the way from Scottsdale in their yellow H3 for a night out in \"downtown\" Phoenix. Ohmygaw!\n\nAnyways, the place is packed every night (even Tuesdays) with Brads and Buffys. Good luck getting in.\n\nWe finally got a table on a Sunday morning at 11:05 AM. I guess Brad and Buffy had a tennis match at the club. It somewhat pains me to report that the service was impeccable, the decor was mindblowing (that back porch... wow!), and the food was pretty fantastic. I had a delish salad with shredded chicken, and Spouse enjoyed his Valet-style sandwich.\n\nWe will definitely go back once Brad and Buffy have moved on to the newest CenPho hotspot (St. Francis perhaps... if that place ever opens). Until then, drive carefully down Camelback. Brad's behind the yellow H3, and he's had one too many Chardonnays.
