I read really positive reviews on yelp and was looking forward to my visit.  Unfortunately, I didn't even get into the office.  I have two dental insurances and wanted to get an estimate of my cost for the initial x-rays and check up.  I thought they checked before my appointment, but, they still weren't sure. ( I had already given them the information over the phone previous to my appointment.)  I was slightly bothered because in my experiences with other dental offices, I know what I have to pay up front for services.  After I completed the new patient paperwork, I told the receptionist that I didn't want to write down my social security number.  I had been a victim of identity theft once in my life and it was miserable.  I am much more cautious now.  I explained that to the receptionist.  When I asked why they needed my social security number written down if they photocopied my DL and both of my dental insurance cards, she said that if people didn't pay their dental bills they needed the social security number to send the bill to the collection agency.  In the end, because I would not give her my social security number, she said I would not be able to see the dentist.  So, I left their office and went somewhere else.
