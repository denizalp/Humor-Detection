I will never lie to you yelpers about what is great and what isn't.  The Antiques Mall of Madison is great.\n\nFirst of all, you have to WANT to be there, because I doubt you would be driving to that crappy strip mall for anything else.  (I do like that chinese place out front though).\n\nThe owners leave you alone as you browse, an you could be in there all day!  It's my one stop shop for rolling pins, doilies, vintage easter decorations and old chairs.  Because, you know, I'm usually out looking for that stuff.
