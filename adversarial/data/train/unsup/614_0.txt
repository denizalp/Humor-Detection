Been here once for a birthday.  It is super fancy and dark inside, they have candles to lit up the table.  At first it didn't look like a AYCE place the way they decorated it.  It is a AYCE with Japanese and Thai fusion.  This place is a little more expensive than your average AYCE Japanese Buffet but with the additional Thai items I think it is worth the price. I believe it was $27.99 for a person before tax and tips other places charges around $22-23.  The service was also very good, as they tend to place their items in large plates and the tables are pretty small; the server kept clearing our plates quickly and refilling our drinks.   They have a few variety of soup and salads and the menu is quick vast.  I like the mango salad.  The quality of the fish was pretty good as well.  The portion size is smaller so you can try all the different stuff they have on the menu.  I guess it is good so people don't waste any food and can just easily re-order if they want more.  Will come back here again.
