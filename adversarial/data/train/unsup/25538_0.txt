Whenever I am in Vegas I always make a point to come here at least once. I love the mangonada so much. My bf tried the watermelon one and he was very impressed.  \nOne thing I did not like was the corn dish. There is WAY too much Parmesan cheese-- literally an even distribution of a half inch think layer across the top of the corn. After scooping out most of the cheese it was ok, but nothing special imho.
