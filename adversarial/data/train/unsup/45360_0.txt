Nice staff & friendly atmosphere. Unfortunately that's the end of the favorable comments. Had s Carolina Burger & fried pickles, with a side of crafty beans & fries. The burger was overwhelmed by the chili, that tasted like it came from a can. Fries were soft & less than warm. The fried pickles weren't terrible, but everything had to much grease, including burger. I ate the burger, but only tasted the fries & beans. This review sounds terrible, but I could see this just being a bad experience. The food could of sat waiting to be picked up, the place wasn't overly busy & had plenty of staff, so I don't know. Unfortunately, I probably won't be back.
