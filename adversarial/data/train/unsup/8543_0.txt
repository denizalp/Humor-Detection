1897 Market. (3.5 stars).\n\nMe: Hi, the sign outside says u have a raw bar here?\nHostess: No, we don't, the bar does. This is a sit down restaurant.\nMe: OK, is the bar part of 1897??\nHostess: Yes, but u can't order raw bar items here. Go over there! *Rolling her eyes at me*\n\nSo as I was rudely shooed away from the hostess stand, I was tempted NOT to stop at 1897.\n\nHowever, I'm glad I don't get terribly bothered by rude service because my order was extremely satisfying.\n\nI wish HNL (Honolulu International Airport) could have food half as decent as 1897 Market!!!!\n\nAs I sat at the bar, I noticed that the bar has charging stations. Awesome since my phone was in need of a charge.\n\nI was heading to New England & was ready for the last leg of my flight to be done. I was tired & hungry & definitely craving some oysters!!\n\nAs I perused the menu I decided on the following:\n\n-Brava Potatoes\n-East Coast Oysters\n\nBrava Potatoes - $3.99. (3 stars).\n\nI didn't know exactly what to expect as I read the menu description:\n\n\"Crispy bliss potatoes, smoked paprika aioli, & herbs.\"\n\nI love potatoes so I was excited to try this appetizer.\n\nThe potatoes were fried perfectly & seasoned with a sprinkle of seasoned salt. Addicting!\n\nThe smoked paprika aioli was tasty & packed full of flavor. The aioli was a bit too heavy on the mayo so I scraped most of the sauce off.\n\nThe only thing that I was not prepared for was the caramelized onions. Ack. They were mixed in with the aioli which made some potatoes inedible to me because the potatoes were swimming in onions & mayo.\n\nFor the price, this is still an appetizer I would order again. I would ask for the sauce on the side with less mayo & no onions!! Nonetheless a very good snack!\n\nEast Coast Oysters - $14.99 for 6 oysters. (4 stars).\n\nI feel that these oysters were extremely fresh & plump.\n\nConsidering this is an airport restaurant & bar, I was pleased with the quality of these mollusks.\n\nOne thing that I wasn't expecting was the sprinkles of fresh cilantro. While I love cilantro, I felt it took away from the raw oyster flavors since cilantro is quite pungent.\n\nAfter trying one oyster with the cilantro, I took the cilantro off the rest of my oysters so I could enjoy the oyster's natural briny flavor in all its glory.\n\nThese oysters come with cocktail sauce & mignonette but I just slurped them up without any sauce.\n\nDefinitely worth the price!!\n\n---\n\nAll in all, I'm happy I didn't let the hostess persuade me to leave.\n\nThe bartenders were extremely friendly.\n\nI would come back to try 1897's burgers as my neighbor's burger looked juicy & delicious.\n\nOh how I wish we could get this kind of food choices at HNL!!!\n\nGreat place for a meal & drinks while transiting through CLT (Charlotte-Douglas International Airport).
