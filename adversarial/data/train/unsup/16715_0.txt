Best salon in Phoenix since moving here 5 years ago!!!!\n\nLet me start by saying I am the pickiest, most anal guy about how my hair is cut and I'm not even gay...... not that there's ANYTHING wrong with that. \n\nI could give you a long history of my stylist experiences since moving here and even before moving here, but Its not important.  All you need to know is that if there is even one hair not cut to my liking I will not come back, haha, ok i'm not that crazy, but close.  I've been through 7 stylists since moving here.\n\nI have finally found someone that not only seems to have a PHD in hair but also takes more pride in their work than anyone I have ever seen.  Did I mention she has given me the best haircut in 27 years.  She focuses the entire time on my hair......I know very strange.  --THANKS LOREN!!! \n\nI come in about every 4wks and started comming here 6 months ago.  It's a little drive, I live in Tempe, but well worth it.  I would drive to Colorado for her haircuts, ok maybe not that far.\n\nOh and on a side note, everyone is beyond friendly and down to earth here.
