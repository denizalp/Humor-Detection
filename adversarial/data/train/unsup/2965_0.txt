A great place for blowing away money and enjoying the food aesthetics. Everything is very expensive, but the flavor and prep involved in the components of all the dishes are well thought out. My friends and I like to come here to explore the dishes they make, as well as to taste some of the interesting cocktails they have. \n\nOverall, this is a place where you can pretend to be fancy.....and then you go to McD's to actually fill your appetite.
