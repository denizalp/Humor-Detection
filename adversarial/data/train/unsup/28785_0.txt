Nothing like strip shopping center Italian to make you appreciate a good Italian meal. Large portions and good bread, my favorite part of the meal was actually the dessert of chocolate mousse. It was perfection!\nThe pappardelle bolognese was flavorful. Hubby went with the grilled chicken and shrimp in pesto and enjoyed it to the last bite, while also enjoying panna cotta as dessert. Decent pricing and a busy place worthy of a second meal.
