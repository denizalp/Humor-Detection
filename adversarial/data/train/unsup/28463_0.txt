This is currently my favorite Las Vegas hotel I have stayed at that I remember. Our suite was large for a hotel room, and it had a slightly sunken living room section of the suite with a couch, table, and giant window looking our at the skyline of Las Vegas. Very nice. The casino below is rather loud, large, and smoky, but other than that the hotel is great. The indoor canal shopping center with expensive gondola rides is a nice touch. The outdoors part of the hotel is also nice; it has the outdoor section of the canal that links into the inside of the shopping center. Also has a bridge that carries you (without water) into the shopping center. Beautiful decorations and art everywhere. For Lunar New Year they have a beautiful fountain with statues and everything. Would definitely come again.
