I really have mixed feelings about this place. It is definitely the closest and most convenient pet store in the Squirrel Hill area. They have a fairly good selection of supplies for how small the store is. They also sell plants both the type that go in fish tanks and the type that go in a windowsill. That being said, the store is quite crowded and a bit difficult to move through. The emphasis of the store is definitely fish, then birds, then rodents and reptiles. \n\nThe positive of the store was once the owner came out he seemed friendly, and knew his stuff fairly well as he has been in the business for a long time. He was even able to recommend products for my wife's red eared slider. It is a local business and fairly competitively priced. They sell animals in that store that I did not even know were legal. Who buys an American alligator? \n\nThe negatives were DO NOT TOUCH THE GLASS or point closely at any fish. There are some extremely aggressive fish in that store than will try to attack through the glass. Even if the fish attacks just as you walk buy the owner will yell at you for provoking it. Some of the tanks clearly say do not touch, but do not touch any of them. I touched the glass of an unlabeled tank to point at a fish and was yelled at. Also, I must say I was traumatized at this store. When I walked past the recently born corn snakes there was a baby mouse \/ rat in the cage (still hairless, pink, and blind) and the snake was trying to eat it. The little guy did his best to escape, but really had no chance. It was horrifying, but I could not seem to look away. It took the snake several minutes to eat this still alive baby tail first, so the baby was alive and trying to escape the whole time. As a person who has raised gerbils and hamsters this was very traumatizing!
