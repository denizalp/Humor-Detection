Most people buy cars, I buy teeth. Yep. I have more porcelain in my mouth than a Meissen dinner service for 12. So finding a good dentist is of the utmost importance. I have been going to Affordable Dental since 2008. It started out as a free check up type coupon thingy. More important for me would be that they would work with me on payments. I needed quite a bit of work done, mostly replacing crowns that were 20-25 years old. Plus cavities, root canals, and well, you get my drift. $8000 and 3 years later we are in 2011 and insurance is available to me for dental through my employer. Yehoomountaindew! Out of pocket won't be so devastating on the wallet. Love my AFLAC!\n\nOne of the things I like the most about Affordable is that there is very little turn over of the staff. The same people have been there for years and years. That says a lot about an organization. I am still a patient and I was in fact just there yesterday for my scheduled cleaning and check up. Seeing familiar faces like Dr. Vi, Carly, and Adriana always make my visits feel like I'm seeing good friends. During my check up Dr. Vi found a cavity and she was able to take care of that right away. I would highly recommend Affordable and I have! I receive $25 for every person I refer that has services. It adds up believe me; so far over $400. I hope upper management is aware how successful this location is and how imperative it is to recognize great employees for a job well done.  Recognize and reward. You heard me.....  ; )
