Just had a manicure\/pedicure. Nail salon is clean and tidy and they were able to see me right away on a walk in basis which was great. When quoted at the front for a pedicure ($45) I didn't realize that it is for just a basic gel polish change and no callous removal or foot scrub - that's extra! Wow talk about pricey. I'm used to getting the whole shebang for that price. Gel manicure I noticed there are bubbles left in the polish when dried. Sorry to say I won't be coming back.
