Great Indian food and well prepared. The restaurant itself doesn't feel super authentic, but the food is good enough to not care. Some of the staff are great, and a couple do seem lazy. Paulo is by far #1 and is very customer service oriented. I eat here (or takeout) at least twice a month and prefer it over other scottsdale indian restaurants.
