Abuelo's is a chain of Mexican restaurants that would've rivaled Chi-Chi's back in the day though the menu items are fresher and the decor is more light and refreshing. Delicious entrees and a wide variety of combination platters. I get the Laredo which is a beef enchilada, cheese enchilada and crispy beef taco. served with rice and beans. Better yet, try the Grande: Three enchiladas: one beef, one cheese and one sour cream chicken, a cheese chile relleno, tamale, crispy beef taco and guacamole. I also have to mention Papas Con Chili. A blend of whipped potatoes, red and green peppers, four cheeses and sour cream. You absolutely have to try them! Wash it down with a drink from the bar-  with a huge variety of beers and unique mixed drinks and margaritas. The Agave margarita and the Sangria Swirl are really unique. Service is usually very good and the there's hardly ever a wait. They also have daily lunch specials so check them out as well. You will love this place.
