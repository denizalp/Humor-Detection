The waitresses at this bar wait station are seem very tired and worn out. Then they are rude to you as well. Would not help me sitting right by the wait station! They all kept telling me it's not their section! Then the rude lady assigned to my area\/machine finally serves me a drink! \n\nVery disappointing! Please avoid this bar!
