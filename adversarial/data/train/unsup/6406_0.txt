I ate here months ago, but I still yearn for the great crunchy calamari salad I had!  Golden-brown calamari, tasty, yet not too greasy, over crisp-fresh greens (mostly romaine) and just the right amount of sesame house dressing.  \nThis resto is significantly smaller than that in Ahwatukee, which gives it a nice romantic ambience.  That is, until it fills up, and then it can feel quite claustrophobic in here.  I would imagine that it'd be a great place to chill out during happy hour: I've spotted nice-looking people here when I wasn't even looking to meet any!
