Another BSB's popped up.  This location use to be Feeney's Weenies, sorry to see it go.\n\nWe ordered and picked up over the weekend since we knew we would be driving by.  We tried 3 of the 150 types of wings...Primetime that are sweet and hot with a golden BBQ, the ever so popular Talk of Beaver Falls that are hot and tangy with large pieces of black pepper and the Medium.  All were good.  The wings are crisp with the sauce covering and sloppy to eat. \n\nThe menu included Burgers & Sandwiches, Hoagies & Gyros, and Salads and a few Starters for those not interested in wings.\n\nThis is really a take out location.  No seats.  There is a small skinny counter at the window if you want to eat in.\n\nThe service was good and very friendly.  The server gave one person a few tastes a couple of sauces after he asked them what type of sauce they liked along with a few other questions.
