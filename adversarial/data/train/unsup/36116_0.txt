Certainly a unique experience.  With the helpful staff to guide me on my first adventure into the Owen's bagel way of life, it was a very pleasant experience.  It was some tasty stuff, the onion bagel sandwich I had was amazing, once I got used to it anyway.  The difference in cooking methods made it taste slightly different from other bagels I've had.  But it was all good, I can see why they've been around for so long.
