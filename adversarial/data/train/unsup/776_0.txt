No bedside manner. First, Dr. Brokloff berated me for not having my wisdom teeth out already, (which is not my fault because I was told as a teenager I should have enough room.) Then he insisted he would have to yank an extra tooth, again, because I was soooo extremely old (32 yrs old). He finished up with some inappropriate comments about the makeup I was wearing which has nothing to do with my teeth. \n\nI decided to go elsewhere! Also didn't have to get extra tooth out, duh.
