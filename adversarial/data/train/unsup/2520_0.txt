Honestly, this mall is fairly standard, as far as malls go. What really makes Galleria stand out for me is the service and the windows. No joke!\n\nEvery time I have been there, I've received really great customer service, from the clothing stores, to the department stores, to the Bath and Body Works, right down to the Gyro place in the food court. I don't know if this mall has something in the water, but what it does have is the best customer service in the area (mall-wise).\n\nThe H&M and Forever 21 are pretty small, and the selection at these locations is fair to poor. But other than that, I really can't say anything bad about Galleria. I mean, they have a freekin' store called \"Tokyo World\", for peet's sakes! If you want really cute and random anime and Sanrio stuff, Pocky and sake sets, then this store is for you!\n\nThe children's play area is really nice, if you have kids 6 and younger. They need to get that mall choo choo train thing or maybe a merry-go-round.\n\nThe sky windows in this mall make it a great place to shop during the day, They have plenty of them, so all the light shines down and really brightens up the mall. Natural sunlight ftw. Really makes your shopping experience more cheery, I think. \n\nThey have a good sized Charlotte Russe, and they have some stores that are hard to find elsewhere, like a Windsor and an Ever. I love the Body Shop here, it's huge. Not too many high-end stores, but if you are looking for a fun, pleasant shopping experience in a bright and sunny mall, then Galleria is your joint, man!
