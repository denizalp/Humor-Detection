Penny pinching Cafe. \n\nBought $20 worth of pastries and then asked for a half cup of hot water to heat up baby food but the cashier wanted to charge $0.50. When they nickel and dime like this, I wonder what else they do to maximize their profits?\n\nEthics aside, only found the bbq bun worth it. The coconut filling ones are too sweet. The curry one sometimes taste powdery\/sandy\/spicy like it wasn't mixed properly.
