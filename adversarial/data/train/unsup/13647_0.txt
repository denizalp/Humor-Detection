OMFGBBQ Amazeballs 10000!\n\nSorry if that doesn't make sense to you, or anyone other than the Sushi Fish in my head, but please allow me to elaborate.\n\nMy girlfriend and I went here for brunch on New Years Day 2013. Normally I hate brunch, and almost always I hate the French, their food, their attitude and Gerard Depardieu most of all.\n\nBut this time, some how out of amazing OMFGBBQ Amazeballs magic, Petite Maison served me up one of the best meals I have had since moving to this fair hamlet they call Phoenix. \n\nFirst course, a french toast appetizer made with banana bread. It was so good I was debating getting on a plane back to Reno just to slap my momma.\n\nSecond course, a French take on huevos rancheros. Medium rare filet, a fried egg over medium, fries seasoned just right. This was the little slice of heaven, the piest de resistance that I needed to make sure that 2013 was going to start the way I wanted.\n\nMatter of fact, the second course was so good I don't even recall the rest of the meal. I know there were mimosas and champagne flowing, which never hurts.\n\nThe owner came over to check on us, one hell of a nice lady. We gushed, which we almost never do as we're bad people, on how good the food was, and how she'd ever so slightly changed my opinion on the French.\n\nWe'll be going back there sometime real soon for dinner. Hopefully they keep the winning streak alive, because I soon plan on becoming Dictator of the Americas for life (coming not to a vote near you in 2016) and right now it doesn't look too good for the continued future of France. If Petite Maison can keep cooking like they did on 1\/1\/13, I might let some regions survive my wrath!\n\nThanks again Petite Maison, I really like your cooking.
