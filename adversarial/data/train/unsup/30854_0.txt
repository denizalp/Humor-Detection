A typical Mexican\/Hispanic market, you will find fresh produce and meats, great marinades and exotic\/imported spices in this place. I came here for a pork roast and found not only a nice pork shoulder, but also great customer service. The guys behind the meat counter were welcoming of my questions and requests to cut  the extra fat off the shoulder and did it in no time. A few of the things you can find at this place are:\n\n* Malta (Venezuelan drink)\n* Frozen fruit pulp\n* Marinated meats (fajita, grilling, etc)\n* Harina Pan (Venezuelan\/Colombian cornmeal)\n* Lots of Goya products\n\nDefinitely drop by and check this place out!
