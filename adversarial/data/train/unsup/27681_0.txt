***This review is for the Fireside lounge only.\n\nSorry, but this just wasn't our thing.  Came here on our last night in Vegas for drinks early in the evening.  A couple other tables of people in the lounge, but the place was mostly empty.  I get the novelty of the place but we just weren't feeling it and it almost put us to sleep sitting on the big comfy couches in a quiet place.  Had one drink which was OK and then headed for the exit.
