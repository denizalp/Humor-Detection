I just wanted to write a quick update. I like this gym for the variety of the classes. I always ck the schedule online before heading out b\/c they have had changes. \n\nEQUIPMENT: I enjoy the fact that there are more ellipticals than @ other gyms and the machines actually seem newer. This includes the weights used in the Group X classes, i.e.  Bodypump, etc. \n\nBATHROOM: is always dripping wet everytime I walk in here. It just seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen but I understand that there is a pool so this is bound to happen. But I think they should put those mats down with the absorbent material\/holes so as to prevent accidents. I saw several elderly ladies walking in there and I cringed hoping and praying nobody fell. I've never taken the water classes@ 24hrfitness but I just think its an accident waiting to happen.
