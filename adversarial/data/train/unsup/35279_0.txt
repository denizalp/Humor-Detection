This is the best BBQ I have ever had. Every meat I tried was the best version of it that I have ever tasted. \n\nEach trip to little miss sets me back $150+ because I need to stuff myself while I'm there, and bring home more to continue to stuff myself all night and the next day. \n\nThe line is absurd - expect an hour+ for the wait. And get there early because they run out of food quickly. \n\nWorth the money - absolutely \nWorth the wait - absolutely \n\nIt's the best food in Phoenix
