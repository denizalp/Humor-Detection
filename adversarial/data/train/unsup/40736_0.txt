Food is great, but not worth the insane wait times.\n\nI had to wait half hour just for a single seat and they ended up sitting me across from a stranger which was somewhat awkward. Then I had to wait another half hour for the food.\n\nIf you can come at non busy time then it's worth while, but otherwise save yourself the time and frustration unless you're a die hard noodle fan.
