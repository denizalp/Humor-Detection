I have been around this town for a while and I have watched it change.  The night life has changed a lot in the last few years!  I feel like an old guy when I talk about it. Ex. Do you remember driving up Pima before the 101 was here type of stuff.  Anyway, Maya is without a doubt the baddest club Arizona has to offer.  There is no if ands or buts about it.  I have partied all over the US and internationally and Maya could actually be in a city like Miami or LA, but its not.  Its here in Scottsdale, AZ.  I think if more clubs like Maya were to open in Scottsdale it would put Arizona on the nightlife map.  I don't really know if that map exists or not!  Someone should make one.\n\nMaya is large, has several bars that are located in good locations in the club, has a very good looking staff, and is a great place for a night out.  They also focus on bringing in big name DJs which is awesome if you are into EDM (Electronic dance music).\n\nI have yet to get a table here and pop some bottles.  Maybe for the next big party we will start our night here!
