Whenever we go to Market Mall I always try to visit Dirtbelly as it is such a healthy alternative to food court food.\n\nOur recent visit we ordered veggie baco, cardamom tealada, and beet salad. Baco is essentially bread and taco combined - the veggie Baco is so good. It's filled with a whole bunch of veggies (cauliflower, kale, lentils, etc.), and vegetarian meatballs\/patties. It has a strong curry flavour and is drizzled with a sweet sauce (almost like donair sauce?). I have yet to try other bacos as I'm stuck craving this everytime.\n\nTheir salads are great as well, I love beets and kale so I usually get the beets with kale salad or anything with both mixed in them.\n\nDon't forget to order a tealada to compliment your meal! They have 3 flavours you can choose from and all are extremely refreshing!\n\nOkay now my review is making me hungry and crave for Dirtbelly!
