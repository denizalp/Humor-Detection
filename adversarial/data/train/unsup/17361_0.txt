This office will not accept patients who are not fully vaccinated they do not respect the belief that people have to not vaccinate their children I do not believe anybody should be turned away from medical care just because they have a difference in belief on vaccinations so I would give this office a big fat ZERO and NOT RECOMMEND.  If they are NOT going to RESPECT your belief on vaccination,  then are they going to RESPECT your belief on your child's care further down the line?
