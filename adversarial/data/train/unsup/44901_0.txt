I escaped the snow & cold by catching a movie. Though I arrived at the scheduled start of the movie - I was impressed at the quick service. I was in my seat before the previews ended.\n\nNothing else stood out - positive or negative. The theater was clean. The sound was good. I felt like I got my money's worth (at least in comparison to other movie theaters).
