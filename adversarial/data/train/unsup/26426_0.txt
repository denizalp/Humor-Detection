We are just finishing up a remodel and can't say enough good things about our experience here at the Mesa store. Sherri has worked with us on everything and while everyone there is very helpful, my wife enjoys working with her because she is so knowledgeable and friendly. They tend to get busy especially on Saturdays but when they're helping you - you have their undivided attention!
