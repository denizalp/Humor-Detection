Leave it to me to order a sandwich in a place known almost exclusively for their pizzas. Typical Bacon Boy. So, while Ayesha S ordered the 8\" Funghi and Robert M the 8\" Margherita, I was drawn to the Duck Club sandwich. Not just because it has bacon on it! Okay, maybe largely because it has bacon on it. Thinly sliced smoky duck breast topped with thick strips of bacon and an interesting sweet sauce were the perfect marriage for a sandwich, although it seems almost insulting to classify this as only a \"sandwich.\"\n\nThey have Guinness on tap and two seemed like a great start to this meal.
