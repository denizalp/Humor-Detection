The Silver Dollar Room has been around forever and is known as one of the city's best and original Blues houses. That being said, it it located at a very diverse intersection downtown and is located below a certified, rundown, whorehouse, oh I mean, low budget hotel. \n\nNowadays there are sometimes good live acts at this venue (about 50\/50) but the stage is small, layout not ideal, sound levels terrible and most importantly, this has become the ultimate late night \/ after hours \/ all night drop in spot.\n\nIf it's 3 am and you and you're buddies are coming down hard but about to fix that with more, um. . . .whatever it may be, well you'll fit right in with the other equally seedy characters lurking about the Silver Dollar Room.
