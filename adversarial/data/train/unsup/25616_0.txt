The intention was to ship my vehicle from Chicago to San Diego.  5 weeks later i found out they delivered the vehicle by mistake to Georgia. During this time they told me several lies as to what had truly happened to my vehicle and assured me everything was fine.  Upon delivery, the car had several additional miles on it, was empty on gas, and was in horrible condition inside and out.  When they finally delivered my vehicle it broke down literally 20 feet from the delivery truck in an intersection. I asked the driver to assist and put the vehicle back on the delivery truck and he couldn't have been more rude when he told me to call my insurance company.  Fast forward 3 months. I have yet to receive reimbursement for the rental vehicle that I rented while without a car, for the repairs that needed to be done to my vehicle, or for any inconvenience I had to go through.  Luckily I had my vehicle inspected the day before I worked with DAS and will be filing a lawsuit for the damages. I have been in constant communication with the company and they ensure me they will be taking care of all of the above, but I have yet to receive any sort of compensation.  I doubt I will ever see any sort of compensation.  I would stay as far far far away from this mess of a company as possible.
