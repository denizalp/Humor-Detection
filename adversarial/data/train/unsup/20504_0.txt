I wish I could give this place 10*'s. Absolutely the first place I'd recommend for a tourist or a food snob. I've been coming here since I first moved to Arizona in 2001, and this is my go to spot. The ambiance is laid back & sexy, and the staff beyond hospitable. I just read a review from Sandy about this place, name tags and uniforms?... This isn't Denny's my dear, Welcome to class..Back to the subject on hand, I do recommend the Chicken Parma and the minestrone soup! Soooo amazing! Applausi
