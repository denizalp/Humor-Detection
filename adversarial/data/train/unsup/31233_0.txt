This was my first time visiting an establishment with this concept.  I enjoyed it enough that I tried two other chains but this one truly stood out.  As others noted you have control over the sample cups allowing you to try as many flavors as you want.  The girl working was friendly and there's definitely an ample amount of toppings for every taste.   Price seemed lower than the other shops I visited yet product quality seemed slightly higher.  Wish we had one of these in Iowa!
