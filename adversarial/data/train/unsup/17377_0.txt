I'm really surprised with all the rave about this place. I've been here a few times and always walked out with a bad experience.\n\nFirst off, I feel like I'm eating at a cafeteria with service- sorry. The service is good and efficient and the food portions were small, inexpensive, and bad tasting. Now, I always came here with a bunch of friends, and they did not like the place either. I've had several of dishes here and my food had either been overdone, underdone, dull tasting or cold. \n\nI really tried liking this place, it's too bad. I won't be back here again.
