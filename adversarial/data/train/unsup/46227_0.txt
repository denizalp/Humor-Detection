This is a very nice cozy Asian place. They have different dishes from Hong Kong, Thai, Singapore, China etc. The food is prepared fresh and fast. My personal favorite is Chow Mein. My first time here I asked the Chow Mein to be made a little more spicier. Little did I realize that they use chilli flakes to make it. My tongue was literally on fire and I askee them if they could do something to make it less spicy. They made an entire new dish fresh. I have been a fan of this place ever since. The staff is friendly and so is the owner.\n\nPortion sizes are typically good and your hunger pangs should be more than satisfied.
