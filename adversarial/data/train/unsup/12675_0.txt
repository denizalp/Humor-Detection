With all the choices in Vegas my critical husband and discriminating son chose to eat lunch and dinner here.  The fries are \"the best\" hands down.  Try the truffle mayo.  You will die, I promise you.  Even compared to Bouchon's fries these fries caused my 8 year old to put his iPhone down and he never ever does that.  The foie gras made me sing. It's not only the ingredients but what the chef does to harmonize creating a desinence that completes you. I can see how the rich wouldn't hesitate for one second to order the $5,000 burger.  I applaud you sir!  When you visit Mandalay Bay, this is a must try bucket list restaurant.  Next time I will add truffles and foie gras on top of the Kobe\/Angus burger.
