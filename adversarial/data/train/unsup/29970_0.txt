This place deserves NO STARS AT ALL there should be an option where you can rate it with no stars. Worst place ever, from the minute you walk in there was no welcome just a evil and rude \"WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?!\" asking questions so rudely and making you feel unwelcome. I went here only because the place I scheduled my appointment with cancelled on me lastmin, and I wanted to treat my mom and sisters to a girls day out for Mother Day, there were 5 of us; not one of us wanted to be there any longer. I showed this lady (who seemed to be the owner if not their COMMANDER) a picture of the type of nail I wanted  and she immediately said it'll be about 20 or 30mins. I was fine with waiting, but my mom and sisters urged that we leave. So as we waiting I was scrolling yelp and this place popped up since I was trying to see if there was anywhere closer that might take us in less than 30mins, and then so happened BEAUTY NAILS popped up. Well what do you know it had the poorest of poor reviews and some customers were stating the same thing i experienced, guys that was the FINAL STRAW. I stood up and told her its okay we booked an appointment somewhere else(yeah right). NO WAY IN HELL AM I PAYING THE BRIDE OF CHUCKY TO DO MY NAILS AND END UP HAVING IT CHIPPED and in that case why would you do business with someone so rude. Although the workers all clearly can speak english since we can hear them talk, yet they still make remarks in their language and start laughing WELL WHAT IN THE HELL?!!!!!! Please save yourselves the trouble ladies, I would not bring my business here. Smh
