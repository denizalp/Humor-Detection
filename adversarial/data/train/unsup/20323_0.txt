Definitely visit this beautiful restaurant with authentic East Indian African food. I lived in East Africa a few years ago and this place reminds me of the beautiful times I had.\n\nHere you get fried cassava, called Mogo, sprinkled with chili powder and served with truly authentic green chili tamarind and coconut chutneys.\n\nThe beef ribs here are awesome. The flavor is great, right on the money. It's a strong paste of spices but it's not overpowering. Especially when you balance the ribs with staple dishes like the cassava, rice or ugali. \n\nWhich brings me to my next point. Ugali is a staple that you get in certain parts of East Africa. It's meant to be eaten with a fried savory masala fish, spicy boiled greens or meat. It's nice to see it on the menu. \n\nThe food here has always been fresh, delicious and a real treat. Everything I've ever ordered here has been good, kababs, samosas, ribs, tandoori and Mogo. \n\nDefinitely visit this lovely restaurant with great authentic East African food. Plus the service is always excellent too.
