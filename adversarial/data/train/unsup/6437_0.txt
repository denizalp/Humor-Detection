We had gift cards. The place was packed and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table. Not terrible, but I hate waiting! \n\nI got the 10 oz. ribeye steak with a nice salad and a baked potato with melted butter and sour cream. We also had muffins and cornbread which were good. For dessert, I had the apple pie with vanilla ice cream. For some odd reason, the dessert was totally sugarless! I don't know if they are trying to appeal to diabetics or senior citizens, but I wish they had used sugar. The flavor was lacking!
