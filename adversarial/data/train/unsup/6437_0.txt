I felt like such a cool Montreal local when I stopped in this groovy little coffee shop one morning while on holiday ;) There was only one dude managing taking orders, making coffee, and taking payment. He was kind, spoke both French and English, and oh-so efficient! My latte was robust and full of body to give my day the boost it needed. Bonus points for getting to grab a healthy to-go juice for a snack later!\n\nInside there is a large table and a few other spaces fit for catching up with a friend of efficient working. Next time I'm back, I want to be able to order in French to feel like a true local at this gem!
