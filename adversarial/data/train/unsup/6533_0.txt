I was looking for a good place for Thai food in Phoenix and opened on New Years Day. Well we found Chanpen, and it was definitely a hole in the wall type of place, but very authentic.  We called in to make sure it was open on the holiday and they were! We ordered 3 things and they were all delicious!\n\nThe chicken skewers, a little dry but love the peanut sauce!\n\nPad see ew was good, lots of seafood!\n\nFried rice was my favorite, well seasoned and great tasting.  They provided us with great service and great food, thank you!
