This financial district cupcake shop has been open for just about 1 week now. I decided to try it out after reading about it in the news. The owner, Jean Blacklock (a 'prairie girl' from Saskatchewan), is a lawyer by training and in 2009 quit her Bay St. job to live out her dream of opening a bakery. Everything is made from scratch and fresh ingredients (no preservatives, no artificial flavouring). Leftovers are given away to Second Harvest food bank. \n\nI went on a weekday afternoon and for a place with this much pink and a name like Prairie Girl Bakery, there were actually more men than women waiting in line! The place is bright and cheery -- NB that the entrance is off Victoria St. Jean was not there when I went, but a whole team of peppy, smiling staff were managing the crowd admirably. \n\nLOVE: \n- I had the Mom's golden buttermilk cupcake with strawberry icing -- divine. The cake was moist and fluffy with a real homemade flavour (translation: lots of butter), and the icing was creamy and there were bits of real strawberry in it. It has a hint of a yogurt flavour as well. \n- Cupcakes come in regular ($3) or mini sizes ($1.75) \n- Lots of flavours like chocolate, vanilla, red velvet, carrot and you can mix and match cupcake\/icing combos. There is also a weekly special. I think this week it was something with coconut icing. \n- You can pre-order online, which I'd imagine would be really useful if you want to order a bunch for work, a party, etc. \n- They do special orders -- e.g. a specific decoration or gluten-free (but they cannot accommodate people with nut allergies, fyi). \n- Cupcakes come in recyclable paper boxes with an insert to ensure that the cupcake doesn't shake around en route\n\nDON'T LOVE: \n- Zero seating\n- A bit pricey\n- I'm not crazy about the branding. There are way too many cute little shops with \"girl\", \"diva\", or \"-licious\" in the name these days. I know \"Prairie Woman Bakery\" wouldn't have the same ring to it but still...
