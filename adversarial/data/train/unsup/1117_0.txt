Back in the day, I classified this place as one of the more expensive burger joints.  Now that we have a lot more specialty burger joints, this place actually has become quite affordable in comparison.\n\nNote that they only take cash here.  The burger patty is large in diameter, but thin.  There is a nice charred taste to the patty.  The burger bread is pretty large as well.  There are the usual condiments, and if you don't tell them to add ketchup and mayo, they slather on bbq sauce instead.  Their specialty is the Apache Burger.\n\nI would not recommend their poutine.  It wasn't worth it at all.  The gravy was watery, it had no taste.  The fries was super soggy.  Really need to add salt.  It was disappointing.\n\nOverall, this burger spot is a legend for people in Etobicoke.  Before all the specialty joints popped up, I would have rated this place 5* stars, now, it is just ok.  The real kicker for the lower score are the lackluster sides.  The burger is above average due to the charred taste.
