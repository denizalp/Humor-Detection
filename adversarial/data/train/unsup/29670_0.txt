They always seem to have an interesting mix of items here. Staff is friendly and efficient and I always enjoy looking around, even if I'm not looking for anything specific. It can be hit or miss, but the selection is ALWAYS changing. I like stopping by and seeing whats new. They do carry a lot of higher end items at discounted prices.
