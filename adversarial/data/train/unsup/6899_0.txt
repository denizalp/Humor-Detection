Beautiful downtown Phoenix setting to visit. A peaceful area that pays tribute to fallen officers and vets.  Statues and memorials that represent Pioneer Women. All displayed in a large community green area around Jefferson & 17th. This area is known for runners and a beautiful walk way for fitness. I frequently visit to view the scenery and get a good work out in.
