I wish I could give this place 0 stars. The food was ok nothing great but the staff is outrageously obnoxious and rude! \nFirstly it was our graduation party so we were in a group of 15. One of our freinds as a surprise got a cake for us and we din't know they dont allow outside cakes as they have their own bakery. Anyway so the hostess mentions to us that each slice will be charged 10 dollars so for 15 people to cut the 20 dollar cake we will be charge 150 dollars!\nWe asked to speak to the manager to make an exception for us but the manager Ralph (or something like that) was super rude and he even called our attitude NON CANADIAN!!! \nThe food was mediocre and I am really dissapointed with all the good reviews this place received. \nI am sure the other branches are good but please stay away from this one if you dont want to be insulted!
