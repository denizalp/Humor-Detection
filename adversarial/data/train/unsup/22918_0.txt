This is probably my favorite Target of the locations that I frequent. The location is convenient for lunch hour runs. \n\nCall me a weirdo, but parking lots largely dictate which stores I frequent. The parking lot for this store is large and easy to maneuver. There are also plenty of other stores in the same shopping center which is convenient.\n\nThis location seems to have one of the best stocked locations of the nearby Target stores. It is rare that I can't find everything on my list here. The store has always been clean and organized which makes shopping here very pleasant. On one occasion I was buying something heavy and it was easy to get help from store employees in loading the item into my car.\n\nMost importantly, this is one of the locations with a Starbuck's at the front of the store. I love when I can combine a Target trip with some much needed caffeine.
