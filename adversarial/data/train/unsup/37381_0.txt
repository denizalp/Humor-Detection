Have been trying to reach them online - a pop up asked if I needed help. I responded and no one replied. To order the product I want I have to contact them. So I also called. An audio recording in an accented voice and a message with grammatical errors replied. I tried several times and although an automated system replied was unable to speak with anyone.
