Decided to try this place after reading reviews on Yelp. Ordered the Chicken Oishi bowl and Shrimp Tempura with Salmon burrito to go. The staff was friendly and helpful with recommendations after I told them it was my first visit. Food was okay but no different from other poke places that are pretty much on every corner of Rainbow Blvd. When I looked at my receipt, realized that a kids teriyaki bowl was charged to me by mistake. So much for the 10% discount for checking in on Yelp... I called them to inquire about the error and the staff who rang up my check couldn't remember helping earlier. Asked if I could get a refund or credit and was told to go back to the store for a refund. I wasn't going to drive all the way back for a mistake they made. Eventually was told to ask for the same person on my next visit and they'll give me a free item. My suggestion is to read back the order to the customer before charging to prevent this inconvenience.
