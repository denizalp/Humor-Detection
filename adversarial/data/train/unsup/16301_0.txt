This restaurant sucks. Service is crap!!!!! My boyfriend had made reservations through Open Table at 12:30am and so we got there and the hostess seated us. Then........we waited a million gazillion bajillion years for someone to take our order. We got drinks first and that took another infinite amount of time. And after some more damn waiting.. the manager person man came up to us and was like, well no one is serving you because the kitchen is closed and this isn't open seating and you can't seat yourself. WTF?!?!? You're f'ing hostess sat us down retard... And we made a reservation so kiss my ass. Then he got all pissy and that ruined the night so then when they opened the kitchen again we ordered two things to make their life miserable. Opening the kitchen for two small things. Service sucked ass at this place don't ever eat here. They wouldn't even come to us to give us the check so we just saw ourself out.\n\n\nEdit: OKKKKK it says on their website dining hours for dinner Fri-Sat are 5pm-1am.. how can we get seated at 12:30 and NOT GET FOOD?!?!?!?
