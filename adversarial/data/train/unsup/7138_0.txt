Congratulations to all you fit people or wanna be fit people-- I congratulate you on running, walking, skipping whatever it is that you do to finish a marathon or a 1\/2 marathon.  I actually had to drive to work this Sunday to get something off my desk I forgot and nearly lost my shiz when I saw all the roads blocked off but actually it wasn't bad I found my way to my office just fine.  It was actually pretty cool to see all those people out and about huffing away.  I honked as I drove by the underpass -- pretending to look around with that look on my face of \"who is honking??\"  -- hoping I motivated someone anyone.  \n\nSO this review is more a SHOUT OUT to those that participated.  WAY TO GO!!
