The customer service was non existent. While my grandma was reviewing the menu, they explained that they were just clearing the table. My grandma was concerned being that she recently had radiation treatments to her throat that the menu was too limited. The hostess heard our conversation and asked if we would like to be removed from the waiting list. My grandma explained not to remove us. Then in about five minutes the hostess said that it was an hour wait and offered no explanation.  I've never seen anything like this interaction in my life. I was so appalled that I walked out and decided to write this review.\n\n\nI also recently ate here about three weeks ago and had lovely service and excellent food. I stayed with my friends and drank on the rooftop for several hours. However, that five star experience could never outweigh the disrespect and complete lack of customer service that we experienced last night.
