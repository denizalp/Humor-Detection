I came in here to get passport photos for my Philippines passport. The lady was nice enough to ask me if the requirements for the photo were the same as the U.S. requirements and I totally didn't know. (They weren't. WHAT?!) Good thing she bothered to ask me because I would have wasted $9. Thanks sweet photography lady.\n\nI have prescriptions filled here (via drive-thru) and I buy makeup here. The nice cosmetics cashier is always there when I go and checkout with her is super fast. Did I mention it's open 24 hours? Woohoo.
