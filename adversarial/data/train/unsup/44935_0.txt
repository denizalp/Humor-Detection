So I guess open 11:00am-3:00pm is at staff discretion?\n\nWe were walking up to the window and the cook looked right at us, closed the window as we arrived, and walked behind the back wall of the kitchen at 2:40pm. \n\nAll we wanted was a milkshake...Not cool.\n\nThe food is decent, but the service can obviously use some improvements.
