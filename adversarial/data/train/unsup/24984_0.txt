Chop Suey, Chicken Balls & a Fortune Cookie. \n\nIf that sentence meant anything to you then you know this is not the place for you!\n\nLocation: right off east side of yonge in a small plaza directly across the RH Performing Arts Building. \n\nSmall cozy booth style inside but they can accommodate a group by re arranging tables, which is nice. \n\nMenu: Thai and random Chinese dishes from north to south China flavours. It's Canadian Asian style and flavour palette which makes it easy for some to experience this cuisine. But for experienced Asian cuisine lovers do not venture here, Madarin would be more authentic of an experience. \n\nRed curry was very watery and not by the means of extra coconut milk! \n\nChop suey is a mix of meats(BBQ pork slivers, baby shrimp, chicken) with bean sprouts of traces of other vegetables, like a stir fry?\n\nGeneral Tao- not spicy at all but well cooked so the chicken is not dry, sauce is sweet, and broccoli is al dente. \n\nPad Thai- I requested the chef to Thai it up, this does work at some places, but not here. We got lime, crushed peanuts and noodles that tasted like tamarind and ketchup made out. \n\nSaving grace dish: Malay curry with fish!\nStill a milder version of Malay curry,so it didn't offend anyone trying it, fish is lightly breaded and deep fried, in a warm spice of yellow coconut curry like dish. \n\nLove supporting local, this place was a 5* to a friend who raved about the dishes, and how authentic it is. I must be snobby and won't order here again, I should have known when I saw chicken balls on the menu!
