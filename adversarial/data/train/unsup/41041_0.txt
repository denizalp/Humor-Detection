Pho Tai Bac could be considered of having the best & most authentic Vietnamese Pho and Vietnamese cuisine in the GTA, including Richmond Hill, Vaughan, Markham.  We come here on every Saturday since their opening in Richmond Hill and we have never been disappointed. The service is a plus, the place is clean, the basil, sprouts that accompany the Pho are always fresh. The staff is friendly.\nPlenty of parking. \nWe are really happy to have it extended North.   We have stopped driving to Jane & Wilson.
