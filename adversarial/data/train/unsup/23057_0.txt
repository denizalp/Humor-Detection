If I could give no star I would... \n\nThis place sucks!!!!! \n1. Everyone comes in for buffet price. $8.99\/person. Sure that's not too bad. But young kids are charged almost just the same at $6.99\/child. My kid hardly ate anything. Why the neck would I pay for rice and soup and 2 pieces of meat for a kid!???!! \n\n2. Lemme start by saying that the food totally sucks. Eggrolls were ice cold. As if it was cooked yesterday and served today!? How gross??!! \n\n3. The rice... C'mon, even a kid can cook rice better than them. It's very dry and almost hilaw. \n\n4. As we were about to complain, we spoke to one of the ladies that worked there who never bothered to pay attention to our complaints. \n\n5. The sinigang... Hardly had any meat in it and it took forvever for it to come out. \n\n6. Bathroom, uncleaned, unsanitary, disgusting, stinky. Worse than a portable-potty! \n\nAltogether, our experience here is beyond horrible! Would never come back!!!
