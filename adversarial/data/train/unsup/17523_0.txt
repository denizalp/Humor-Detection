I was sent a link to this place today; previously I'd never heard of it. Hours later, it's easily become part of my weekly schedule (I can see the future).\n\nAttraction 1: The Wilco theme. Nice, a hook. The sandwiches are named after Wilco songs and there are some Wilco posters on the wall. Otherwise, the decor of the place obviously hasn't changed from whatever used to be in there. Maybe some bright colours on the wall would add a little extra oomph.\n\nAttraction 2: Homemade breads and soups. BIG  PLUS FOR ME!! Soup & sandwich may be my favourite meal, and homemade is very important. Brown bread, zesty lemon white, cranberry cream cheese are some of the loaves up for grabs.\n\nAttraction 3: Inventive sandwiches. I have vowed to try every vegetarian option on the menu - there are several. They look scrum-diddly-umptious. Red-Eyed &  Blue with mozzarella, tomato and basil leaves? YUP. She's A-Jar with almond butter and banana? I will be eating that. \n\nToday I had the One Wing, which has \"thinly sliced oven roasted turkey with cream cheese, cranberry sauce and a hint of stuffing.\" SOUNDS SPECTACULAR. I regret to inform you that it wasn't as beautiful as I hoped it would be; the bread was easily the best part while the turkey was grocery store variety and the stuffing most likely Stovetop. \n\nThe tomato rice soup was the best part of my meal for sure. I've yet to try the pumpkin cookie, which looks divine but I'm too full to eat. \n\nThe owner is SO NICE. I had a nice chat with him and he's delightful. I told him about my vow to try every vegetarian sandwich; I hope he took me seriously. The challenge is on.\n\nPS: Keep your eyes open, the place is kind of hidden on the top level of a small plaza thing on Bloor. But it's worth a visit - huge sandwiches and c-h-e-a-p.\nPPS: There's a breakfast menu, too. And muffins & scones.
