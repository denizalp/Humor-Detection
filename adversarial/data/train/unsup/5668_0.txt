Picked up lunch to go here w\/ a coworker & we each had the bento box special.  I wonder why they call it a \"special?\"  I promise you nothing special about it.  Consisted of a krab roll (yup, I'm talking krab w\/ a k), 4 pcs nigiri, mixed green salad, miso soup.  All in all, it sucked.  The fish just tasted blah & the miso too concentrated.\n\nI'll give it 2 stars for atmosphere-with-potential for nighttime, and for not making me violently ill.  Come for a cocktail, go elsewhere for food.
