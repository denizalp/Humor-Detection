I came here for our Yelp Book Club gathering.  I got an unsweetened black iced tea that was very good.\n\nThe place is quite nice with several large arm chairs, tables, and a good place for our small group to have our gathering.\n\nWhat other coffee shop gives you the chance to see Wayne Newton's plane parked in his back yard (well the tail fin and the top of the fuselage).  It reminds me of Jaws!
