I have lived here nearly 2.5 years and have had nothing but positive experiences, and they continue to get better every time especially with new manager Nuvia Rodriguez. Margie has been here since my first day and she is very professional and accommodating. The newer office staff Elena and Ryan are also very nice. These people work hard and have many things to deal with at any given time, yet will always greet you with a smile. \nMaintenance is great, fast, and friendly even with all the many tasks they have to accomplish on any given day. They do a great job. \nI'm a bit surprised at the negative reviews from others. My electric bill has never been $200 (although my apartment is only one bedroom with less space to keep cool). I have never had any issues with pest control.\nMy only complaint would be that people drive way too fast thru the parking lot and then get mad when you're backing out of your parking spot and didn't see them coming. Maybe if you slow down, you will have less near-accident situations. I'm pretty sure wherever you're going will still be there when you get there 10 seconds later. \nOther than that, this is my home away from home and I love it.
