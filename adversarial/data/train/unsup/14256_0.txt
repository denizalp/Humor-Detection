We went for happy hour and the service was quick. We sat at the bar but there was a hostess waiting to assist as soon as we arrived. The food isn't amazing, nor is it bad- just average. I tried the sweet potato fries and my friend had a burger. All apps are essentially half-off during happy hour and draft beers are a little over $4. They had some long island ice tea, margaritas, etc. for around $6. \n\nI only came here because it was close to where I was after a last minute decision of happy hour. It's inside the Orleans so it's not exactly the best location to just hang out and chill with friends but it's plenty fine for drinks. It can be a little chaotic being inside the Orleans but nothing really bad to say overall.
