A friend and I were looking for a Steelers bar for games that aren't nationally televised and heard about Bikini's in the university area as catering toward the black and gold.  They were right!!  The beer specials were decent, 10 bucks for a pitcher of a few different drafts - and I thought the food was overpriced for what you got....BUT - they had over half of their TV's tuned to the Steelers game with the whole sound system in the building devoted to that game.  The place was filled with Steeler faithful and the waitresses were really great about letting you pick which area you wanted to sit based on where the TVs were.  So if you are reading this and are a Steelers fan looking for a laid back, friendly, steeler-fan filled bar to go watch a game on a Sunday, I would definitely recommend Bikini's.  If you are going for the food, I'd go elsewhere :)  My rating is probably even more biased since the Steelers won today too!
