Another successful visit to the Green Eggplant. Went here with my mom, sister, boyfriend and best friend for my birthday. \nWe all ordered a variety of food including the lobster artichoke spinach dip which came piping hot, with tons of chips and full to the brim of the very large bowl. Needless to say 4 of us shared it and didn't finish. \nEverybody was very pleased with the food, my best friend who had never been there loved her teriyaki salmon and told her mom about the place for family gatherings. \nFor 4 of our meals plus 3 alcoholic drinks and 1 non-alcoholic = 89 bucks. NICE.
