Fast and friendly service was a huge plus! Southerners, this is like a cross between Sonics, Cook-Out & Dairy Queen. Everything was decent, but it didn't match the hyped-up expectations I had from reading reviews, talking to locals and Swensons very own publicity as \"American's Best Cheeseburger!\"  \n\nWe ordered: \nThe 'Award-Winning' Galley Boy (3.35 stars) | $3.50\nDouble Hamburg (3 stars) | $2.90\nDouble Cheeseburg (3 stars) | $3.35\nShrimp Dinner (3.45 stars) | $6.85\nFrench Fries (3 stars) | $2\nOnion Rings (3.65 stars) | $2.10\nVanilla Milkshake (3.85 stars) | $3.10\n\nThere were no outdoor menus  for each individual parking space like @ Sonics, but it was kinda cool that the building probably dates back to the 60's. We enjoyed how the staff travels at hyper-speed from car to car taking and delivering orders. They graciously brought us paper menus and told us to cut our lights on when we were ready to order. You then cut your lights off when you have placed your order and back on again when you have finished eating your food. \n\nThe food was average but the service was very entertaining to watch. These guys move like lightening. Have you ever watched ants as they zip around and gather food? They will occasionally get in each other's way, but bounce off one another and keep going like clockwork. That's what it's like to watch these guys try to keep up with the constant flow of cars. You certainly could not be a lazy person and work here! It is very evident that Akron loves Swensons because they were in a constant state of busyness. My youngest thought the burgers were bland and 3 stars in his opinion is \"generous\". Surprisingly, we all enjoyed the shrimp more than the burgers. Did you know they serve shrimp?\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nOverall it was a cool experience, but I doubt very seriously that I would be a regular customer if I lived in the Akron area. Overall I wholeheartedly disagree with any claim that this burger is even in the vicinity of consideration worthy of being dubbed America's Best Cheeseburger. It truly looks like the burgers they served in my high school cafeteria. Thank God it at least tastes slightly better than it looks.  \n\n\n2016\/72
