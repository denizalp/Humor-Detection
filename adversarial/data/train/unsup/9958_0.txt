This Aldi was clean and well stocked. With the exception of the produce.\nCouldn't find any carts so I had to use my own bag to do my grocery shopping. \nThere were only 2 registers open, which made for a long wait. But, it is what it is. \nI was able to pick up bread and pb&j for my homeless guys for super cheap. I'll definitely start coming here. \n\nWhen I got to the check out. The cashier asked me when I was due. Now, I'm not pregnant nor do I look it. I had just come from the gym. But, it's a bit unprofessional for an employee to ask that question to anyone. \nI just looked at her and said I'm not, apparently I'm just fat today.\nPlease people. Have some respect. Some people aren't like me and wouldn't have just laughed it off. \nTeach your employees to keep their comments to themselves.\nAfter carrying my heavy bag around the store and checking out. All was good.\nNice big marking lot with plenty of parking. \nSure wish the produce section looked better.
