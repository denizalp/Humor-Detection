Convenient location and easy to order from, just point to what you want to grab it to-go or get a meal here.\n\nI primarily came here to try their Halo Halo Special to see if it was anything similar to Halo Halo I get from Filipino shops like Goldilocks, Red Ribbon or Jollibee. Unfortunately, they were out and only had the regular with vanilla ice cream.\n\nThey also didn't have sinigang on the day I visited and only left with a small take out of Dinuguan which is a delicious pork blood stew that has a very similar aroma to that of duck and tastes equally as delicious with that graininess that blood has. Simply delicious with white rice.\n\nAs with most of the Filipino restaurants back home in Santa Clara area of California, food prices are a bit steep for what they are. It remains true even here, I got a small container of food and a halo-halo for $11.\n\nNonetheless, I'll be back to try more of their food when I miss my lola's (grandma) or mom's cooking. Crossing my fingers to get my hands on some turon and to try their Halo halo Special.
