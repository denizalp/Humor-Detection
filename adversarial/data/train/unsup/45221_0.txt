If I could give 0 stars I would. I asked for the 5 meat feast ($9) and were told they were out of sausage (how do you run out of sausage!) Poor management obviously. So I asked if I could substitute extra one of the other toppings \"umm no that would be custom\" so then I said okay give it to me without the sausage and she tried to charge almost $13 before taxes umm no! So I ordered my other \"guaranteed hot n ready\" pizzas and was told they would not be ready for another 15 minutes! Wtf they could have said something before I paid! Which that was a whole other issue how do you not have change when the order was more than half the bill you presented? Then the signature pad doesn't work! Fml. I will not be back here ever.
