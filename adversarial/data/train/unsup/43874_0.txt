Finally made it over to Matt's Big Breakfast, and I'm glad I did!  This place is your quintessential get-in\/get-out breakfast joint, but with local ingredients in a clean open atmosphere.\n\nWe ordered the breakfast sandwich (bacon, marinated onions and american cheese) and salami scramble for breakfast.  The scramble came with a choice of hash browns or home potatoes, so I went with the hash browns.  I must say, I think those were my favorite part of the meal!! The outside of the hash was super crisp, and the inside potatoes were luscious and almost creamy tasting. 10\/10 would order again.  \n\nService was also good.  Our waitress was fast, sharp and on point.  She was good about keeping our water and coffee glasses full, and I appreciated the amount of times we were checked on.\n\nAll in all, I had a enjoyable quick breakfast, and look forward to going back to see what else they have to offer :)
