The waitress is very rude and doesn't have any customer service manners, I ask for the menu she broth it and slap it on the table, then I ask for jasmine tea and very rude said, if you want tea, first read the menu and see what we sell, didn't answer yes we have or no we don't have jasmine tea.\nI ordered shrimp and she brought chicken, I told her I didn't ask for chicken and she was arguing with me for awhile telling me Yes, you ordered it!, the place is dirty and she is RUDE. I will never go there again. No wonder why the place is always empty.
