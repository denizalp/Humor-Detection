What can you say about this place? The restaurant is not nice, the neighborhood is not great and it's not that close to where I live. Now with that being said, I love this place! Always tasty, always consistent and you could literally get something different everyday of the week for an entire year and never have the same thing twice. One of my favorite places to eat ever!
