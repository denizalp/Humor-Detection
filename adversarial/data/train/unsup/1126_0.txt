The suites here are pretty sweet! Projector screen, kitchen, awesome bathroom, bathtub in the bedroom, cool decor and we had an awesome view. Can't lie, the suites make for a great great time. We also had fun by the pool and the ambiance of the Westgate Towers Lobby is nice and does feel more exclusive...\n\nHOWEVER, service here was horrid upon arrival. This place was attitude central. You'd think after paying them that much money to stay for 2 nights, the least the PAID STAFF could do is be nice to us.\n\nFirst, Valet was \"full\" - that's awesome, off to self park we went (no big deal), minus the fact that Steve (horrid valet guy) stood in front of me like a vegetable when I asked him if he could help with our bags since we were checking in. He didn't say anything, then I mentioned it again, \"could you please help with our bags before we head to self park?\" - his response, \"yeah, I heard you\". -- Well Steve, I'm glad your ears work because your attitude fails, my friend. Against his will he helped with our bags - halfway through he wanted to leave the rest for us to deal with. I didn't know these guys got to choose which bags they wanted to take. Another guy comes heading out and looks @ our bags and starts shaking his head (yeah guy, I saw that too...). Jerks.\n\nWe went to check in, and yes we were early (as we usually are and it's never a problem at ANY OTHER HOTEL IN VEGAS!). I go to vegas at least 1x\/month and have always been able to check in at whatever time I arrive. Tabetha (another piece of work) was so disgustingly rude we were about to just say F this place and head back to to LA. It was my girlfriends birthday, so we were trying to not let all this horrible service ruin our good times ahead...\nThe tone and manner with which we were treated was appalling. Maybe because we don't fit the \"old\" and \"rich\" bill she thought it would be okay to treat us the way she did. I didn't know Planet Hollywood operated this way, apparently Tabetha and the hotel DO operate this way.\n\nWe walked away from this stellar employee (NOT) and sat back trying to figure out what to do for 5 hours. After deciding to go back to another front desk employee, Hallison said \"a suite just opened up!\" and was able to get us up to our room - finally. She kinda turned our morning around, but the BAD SERVICE and ATTITUDE is hard to forget. \n\nPH Towers, you only get one chance to make a first impression and that first impression was NOT a good one, unfortunately. \n\nWhen it comes to Vegas, I suggest you spend your money elsewhere, where you'll be treated properly. Stellar service should be a given.
