Honest and friendly! - Being new to Las Vegas I did not know a good shop offhand so I visited a number of them to get a feel and compare prices.. After being mostly disappointed I finally found DC Sound and I'm glad I did. I didn't need anything fancy, just a new head unit installed in a classic car.. Long story short, instead of trying to up sell me on things I didn't need, Carlos actually had me run to another store and pick up a unit I wanted that he did not have in stock at the time and when I came back, had one of his guys install it for free! \"Just tip my guy\" he said, which I gladly did. Could not have asked for better service and understanding! Thanks Carlos!
