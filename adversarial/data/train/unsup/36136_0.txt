If I could give a zero I would! Usually I love coming here but Tuesday night my husband and myself went and the bartender that was working was so rude. We waited forever for her to even acknowledge us and when she finally did she was just nasty. She had such a bad attitude that we didn't even stay we ended up giving the menus back and going elsewhere for dinner. Find a new job if you don't want to deal with people!!!!
