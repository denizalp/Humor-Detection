If you are a southpark fan - I kid you not,I notice if they ask for donations every time I visit. \n\nIn all seriousness, I frequent this location on a weekly, or the occasional bi-weekly basis. I love dropping by just to pick up a healthy drink or snack. It is located at an amazing intersection with huge volume of traffic, but the amount of customers inside whole foods is pathetic - which makes shopping here such a joy. Little to no wait in lines and the people who work here are wonderful. \n\nIn the summer, they have their little \"patio\" open, and it's great to make a healthy bowl inside and enjoy it under the sun while absorbing some vitamin d. Just dont forget the sunscreen (and if you do, they probably sell some organic sunscreen!!).
