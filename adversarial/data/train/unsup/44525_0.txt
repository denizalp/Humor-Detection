While the Masterchef association is inevitable when it comes to Chris Siu's baking, DaanGo Cake Lab stands out on its own as a pastry boutique!  I've ordered cakes from Chris before, and was delighted to hear he was opening a stand-alone shop.\n\nI ordered the Diamond cake for my friend's birthday, and Chris was even able to customize the colour of the diamond!  Inside, we also left a custom hand-written note that fell out (along with edible pearls) once you cut into the diamond. It was a truly decadent experience and I would highly recommend purchasing a cake from here - just to see the look of pure joy on your loved one's face is worth it, but the high quality ingredients and the amount of time that goes into each cake is an added bonus.\n\nDaanGo's setup is lovely: airy, with lots of natural light, boasting an assortment of adorable macarons and beautiful cakes, and the kind of place that you walk into that instantly makes you feel happy.  The staff are hard at work filling macarons and taking orders, but they're also attentive and efficient. Thanks, Daango!
