I've been going to a salon for the longest time and after cutting my hair short from being REALLY long I always wanted to try going to a barber shop but was hesitant because I grew a strong relationship with the lady who cut my hair since grade 7 (first year college now). Long story short going here and getting my hair cut from Stephan who also cuts my best friends hair and his brother was an amazing choice, He did an amazing job and would suggest him to anyone!!! Only reason why I'm giving the barbers chair a 4\/5.\n\nOut of what I saw he was the most professional as he focused on me the customer the whole cut and never talked to his co-workers once which is something small but means a lot (I bring this up because as I was waiting I noticed the ladies who cut hair their really do a poor job focusing on the customers and rather talk about what they ate for lunch with each other so keep that in mind when choosing which barber you want to go to)... Stephan focused on small details and I can't thank him enough for such a good hair cut.
