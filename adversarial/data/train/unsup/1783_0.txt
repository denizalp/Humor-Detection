I suppose I should get around to writing this review sooner or later. \n\nEvery year for the past I won't say how many years, myself and a gaggle of my deviant friends pile into a car and rocket out to Las Vegas for a punk rock bowling, which, with 2010 as an exception, is held annually at Sam's Town.\n\nOne year, I remember sheepishly asking the front desk how they approach this time of year. \n\n\"Oh, it's one of our favorite weekends!\" an employee resounded, enthusiastically, \"We love punk rock bowling!\" I always remember that, and in 2010, there definitely felt like something was missing. \n\nThe high roller lifestyle affiliated with the Vegas Strip is kind of lost on me, as it is, but Sam's Town has dozens of little perks aside from just being tidy and affordable. They've hooked me up with a microwave when I wanted to reheat some particularly delicious leftovers from the previous evening. Their employees are so accommodating and so discreet - noble traits, to someone who spends her sloppiest, drunkest weekend of the year here. I love the fact that the Atrium bar never gets too smokey and we see the same, nice bartender every year. \n\nBYO Records may have a reputation about as clean and white as Lindsay Lohan's, but the image of dozens of drunk, washed up, tatted up punx singing \"Proud to Be An American\" along with the Sam's Town laser light show, will be burned into my memories, forever.
