Had my first escape room experience last night with my SO, MIL and her friend. We booked 'Lost in Space'. It started off pretty good - we found our light source within 5mins and then we got stuck.  Mainly because the props were well worn and hard to read\/see. Didnt help that we didnt have fresh batteries and the light was very dim. With people feeling the walls in the dark potential clues were rubbed off and not prominent enough to be read. We buzzed for help twice. Each time the girl came in she didn't look impressed we needed help. Almost like we were interrupting her. We truly think we were missing a clue of some sort.\n\nAll in all we had a great time for the first 30mins but then it got discouraging and frustrating for us.We would definitely do an escape room again, but probably not this one.\n\nNot worth regular price - go for a Groupon instead, even try to get additional 20% thru them too.\n\nNot wheelchair friendly - lots of steep carpeted stairs to climb.\n\nGood luck!
