My Yelp app continues to send me reminders that I must review this Starbucks. So, here you go.  \n\nThis Starbucks is in the same parking lot as EOS Fitness (Durango).  I'm not at this EOS too often because it's one of the busiest gyms in town.  That being said, I am not at this Starbucks too often.  This location looks small from the outside. So, I was surprised that it's spacious inside.  Most of my visits have been in\/out or through their drive-thru and service has always been good.  By the way, this Starbucks has one of the quickest drive-thru's in Las Vegas.  That' for real.
