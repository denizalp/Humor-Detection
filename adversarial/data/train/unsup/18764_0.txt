The coffee is good no doubt, but it's loaded with what appears to be just friends hanging out around the till. I get it- it's a coffee shop but it's very unconventional and uncomfortable. Maybe some spacing arrangements would fix this. Also the staff isn't very friendly. I went here my first time today, I wouldn't go here again.
