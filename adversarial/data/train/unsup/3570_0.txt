I came for dinner with a girlfriend last night and we had the most inappropriate and rude waiter. It was the most bizarre experience and really took away from our overall experience. \n\nHe started by insulting my friends name when he looked at her ID. Then when I told him I would be sticking with water, he told me that I was boring and not adventurous enough -- I am 5 months pregnant..... All of this was off-putting but could have been brushed off as social oddities or his immaturity. He then told he thought I had pretty eyes, I said thank you, but he then followed with l, 'which is odd because I don't even want to sleep with you,' and told me that really he was just insulting me by saying that. What?! Every interaction was awkward and weird and we kept dreading he'd come back and speak to us.\n\nThe entire meal, instead of asking if we needed anything or how the food was, he would just come to the table and stand there and say he was just eavesdropping. Finally, he came by and I said 'we are fine, thank you, please go' and he snapped that he was just doing his job. The food was decent, not amazing. Honestly, the waiter was so distracting and so creepy that it was hard to enjoy our meal.
