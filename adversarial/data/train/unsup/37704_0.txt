This place is literally revolting. First the line is out the door, 1 hostess. Finally get through the line and we get told to walk somewhere to our table. No idea where this table is located, so we seat ourselves. Once seated, we're told those seats were not available, so we're redirected to another table and finally get tooken care of. Foods ok, it's just a good ol regular buffet. Nothing special.
