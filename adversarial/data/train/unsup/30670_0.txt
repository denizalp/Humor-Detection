The actual hair cut was great. The new check in system is flat out terrible. Customers now check in on a computer, which is fine, and your name and wait time is then posted on a tv in the waiting area. My wait time was 11 minutes, and I ended waiting an extra 30 minutes past the initial 11 minutes for my haircut. The place was not busy at all, 2 people were FINISHING hair cuts as I walked in. The employees were having a great time making conversation, texting, and not working with any sense of urgency. If it was busy or there were a lot of people waiting I would understand, but it was not busy at all! Very frustrating experience.
