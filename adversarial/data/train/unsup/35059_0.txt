I happily bought $60 more than I intended on my first visit because Noel (an engineer and brewmaster starting a brewery with others) was so knowledgeable and helpful! I'm excited to try all this stuff out! About the same selection and prices as total wine for beer and spirits.  I didn't look at wine but I'm sure it's decent. I'll be back for more but with a growler next time to fill that as some beers are only available on tap.  Oh don't forget to download the five star app before you go in so you can get rewards points.
