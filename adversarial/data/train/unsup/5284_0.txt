I had very high expectations for an authentic and original concept to come to Charlotte and shake up the food scene in the South Park area. My expectation's were met with much disappointment. While everything was not terribly horrible, the restaurant was an oddity, the atmosphere felt confused and awkward, and the service was-HORRIBLE.\n\nWe were greeted by the general manager opening the door, which was nice, but the hostess sat us at a horrible table, when there was literally no one else in the restaurant. With multiple seating options it felt a little ridiculous to be sitting at the first tiny two top against a wall-which just felt unwelcoming. With booths available you think you would want to make your guests comfortable. \n\nThe server was the master of up-selling, he brought us out a $6 bottle of Fiji water-and without even presenting it he opened it up and proceeded to poor. Where is the tap water, the other tables had it? He asked if we wanted sparkling water or still water-thought this was synonymous with tap water??He also insisted on \"guiding\" us through the \"dinner experience\"-like I cant order and read for myself. After an odd monologue about Baku-he moved us across the dining room so we would be more \"comfortable.\" That was kind of awkward but I was glad to have a better table. \n\nFood-\nThe calamari was amazing. The calamari was tender, served hot and fresh, with the perfect amount of seasoning, it came with sliced green chillis that added a nice kick of flavor. A little oily but this didn't distract me from enjoying it. 10\/10\n\nIt went downhill from there-\n\nScallops with foi gras- Ok, they were amazing as well, but we waited 15 minutes between finishing the calamari and receiving the scallop. I say scallop because it was one scallop cut in half- you think you'd receive more for 19 dollars? It had a nice flavor but the foi gras was not substantial and by the time it got to the table it had melted away, also hard to cut with chopsticks. 6\/10\n\nChicken Skewers with leeks- Ok- came out hot, had a nice smoky flavor from the grill-right amount of sauce, but where were the leeks? It looked like green scallions were substituted for leeks, and this didn't lend the same amount of  appeal and flavor you would experience with actual leeks. 4\/10\n\nDuck breast Entree- Nicely rendered piece of duck, cooked properly, it had a smoky flavor and it was nicely done. It lacked seasoning and a sauce. It came with a small dish of chopped plum chunks-which added a nice sweetness but lacked the body of a sauce and didn't adhere to the duck because it was hard and awkward to eat with chopsticks.. This could have been an amazing dish if it had been served with a sauce and hadn't been so difficult to eat. 7\/10\n\n-May I mention that our server suggested we order a vegetable to \"cleanse our palet.\"  So I assume this means before the meat course\/main entree? We literally waited for 20 minutes after we finished the duck entree for corn on the cob. By this point the meal had ended- and waiting 20 minutes for corn felt silly. Also no one came by our table to ask if we were ok- the server literally disappeared  When he brought it out he had the audacity to say it eats like desert- by that point we just wanted a check and a box for the corn. \n\nOverall-Weird experience. The music was horrible as well-felt like I was at a graduation party. The ambiance felt confused and unestablished.Food was good, but the courses were improperly timed, dishes could have used a little bit of seasoning or at least the server should offer salt and pepper. Service was non-exsistant for most of the experience, the server was nice and \"attentive\" at first but after he took our orders he spent most of his time doing side work making us feel abandoned and awkward- the restaurant was pretty much empty- you think you'd be a little more attentive. The service and experience could have been better-especially since the South Park area has a decent amount of competition for a new restaurant. They need to step it up if they want to survive. \n\n\nWouldnt go back. Overall- 5-10 \nNot worth the price :(
