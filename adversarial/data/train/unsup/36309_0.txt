To start, I don't enjoy one star reviews too often but I really can't sum this place up any better than a huge disappointment. My girlfriend and I did a lot of research on places to eat and such and this buffet was rated \"the best\" or \"top of the line.\"  To start, they mentioned it was going to be 32.99 and come to the place and it was 42 per person (not the end of the world) let's continue.  There were roughly 5 parties of people in front of us. Few families and couples.  We stood there (didn't move in line) for not a joke, 50 minutes. Right in front of us in line were tables, two of which were vacant and dirty from the previous parties for roughly 25 minutes before someone said something. ALSO, there was about 9-10 groups of people who left while we waited in line.  Again, some things are worth the wait, let's get to the food.  The food was very disappointing.  Some food looked old, the pizza alone looked like dominoes. The crap legs were very stringy and cold. I don't know about you but I enjoy them freshly hot and steamed AND with butter, which when I asked about the butter, I was told \"yea guess we don't have any.\"  Do yourself a favor and head over to the Paris buffet or the Caesars Buffet. Paris is a bit cheaper than Caesars however, both are very good.
