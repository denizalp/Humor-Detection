Carrot Top had me laughing the entire time!\n\nHis show is located in the Luxor in the Atrium Showroom.  Small theatre = good seats anywhere!  Just a warning they keep the air condition to South Pole temperatures so bundle up!\n\nHis opening comic was funny to start! He isn't out on stage very long but warms up the crowd.  Once Carrot Top hits the stage, it's continuous jokes with a little rock n roll at the end.  He has a good balance of his prop comedy with funny stand up.  He even spends a little time poking fun at himself! He ends the show dressing up as different singers rocking out to a fun variety of songs.  \n\nThe show is funny and entertaining.  I enjoyed every second!
