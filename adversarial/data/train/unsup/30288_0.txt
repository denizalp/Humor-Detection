This Vegas trip we wanted to get away from the typical clubs and VIP b.s. Downtown is the place. This was one of three bars that we were lucky enough to catch before they closed. What? Apparently Vegas does sleep. \n\nOn the night we went, it was piano karaoke night. Pick a song, the piano man does his thing, random amateur singers do theirs. But the singers this night were far from amateur. Very chill spot to meet regulars, local first timers and tourists. And a side of Vegas that I enjoyed more than dropping hundreds of dollars on the strip. \n\nReally cool place that I will visit again and be sure to take friends to when the money starts running low.
