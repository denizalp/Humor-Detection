The awesome duo that was performing got our attention. We had an hour to burn before a show so alcohol + good live music made absolute sense. We had a round of free drinks because of our show tickets.\n\nWe claimed our drinks at the bar. Chilled there for a bit while I was watching the playoffs. After finishing our first round, we moved to a table right in front of the stage...just so I could fall asleep! I hope I wasn't snoring. I couldn't even remember the name of the performers and what they were playing but I'm pretty sure it happened. All that matters is that the people I was with who stayed awake enjoyed the music and had a good time.
