Many Vegas restaurants compete for glitz and glamour, so it's a real treat to be able to dine at a restaurant simply for it's homestyle comfort foods, and that's what Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill brings to the table time and time again!\n\nSimple classics such as freshly made potato chips are dressed with truffle oil and a blue cheese dressing. Veal ravioli is gently tossed with mushrooms, brown butter and crisp sage.  A crispy chicken milanese is set apart with an arugula salad and cherry tomatoes.  And dessert is simply divine: a banoffee (banana and toffee) cream pie with a sugar dough shell, and bruleed bananas; a sorbet trio served in a brandy snap cup and topped with fresh berries.\n\nService needed slight improvement, granted the floor (both restaurant and casino) were busy, but the food should definitely be on everyone's checklist of things to see and do while on the Strip.
