I noticed this place open up around the holidays.  It seemed to be dead whenever I passed it so I wanted to stop by and give them my business.   Plus, they have a %15 off sign up and that sold me getting a mani\/pedi.\n\nThe decor is great, everything is clean and there's a beautiful water feature when you walk in.  Picking out nail polish was the best part of the entire experience, lots of wonderful colors and a large variety.  Even though they didn't seem to be busy, I sat and waited for about 15 minutes to be called back - most places will give you a pedi chair right away.  After I was called back I waited a total of 45 minutes soaking in the chair.  At first, I didn't mind because I was really into my book but then two ladies sitting next to me were sick of waiting so they got up and left and it made me aware of the time.  A woman on the other side of me started flipping out because a dead bug was on her foot so I started to get antsy and contemplated leaving.  Then, I realized that my water had gone cold and it was making the rest of me cold so I took that as my cue to leave.  I shoved my cold, wet feet back into my shoes and walked out.  I did get an apology as I was leaving though.
