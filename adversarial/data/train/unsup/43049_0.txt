Fusion Sushi in Kensington is pretty great! The service was quick and the staff were very careful and attentive with my orders given my various allergies. The food was all well presented. Although it's not the best sushi ever, it's pretty great for an all you can eat joint! \n\nPrices are very reasonable and the restaurant is well taken care of.
