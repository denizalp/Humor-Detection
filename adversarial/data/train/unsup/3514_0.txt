I know this is an offshoot of Nordstrom but it just feels very plain in here.  They didn't put any thought into the d√©cor and it makes it feel sterile, to the point where you feel the need to be quiet while you are shopping.  However, if you are not me you will not notice such things because you will be here to snag a deal of some sorts.  I guess you can say that I am not your conventional shopper as I was staring at the ceiling wondering why it was so white in here.\n\nOnce I distracted myself from my surroundings I finally noticed that there was merchandise to be riffled through here.  I wasn't really in the mood to look for clothing but I felt drawn to the shoes.  I just wanted to smell the new shoes.  You know, that smell of fresh, no sweaty socks, leathery smell that makes you not care about how bad your feet will hurt in a pair of shoes, you just want it to be pretty.  The discounts on these shoes were of a decent caliber as well.  I felt like I wasn't going to be shelling out too much for the shoes I have wanted but was too stingy to pay for.  \n\nIs this place worth a special trip: no.  Would I stop here if I'm already in the area: possibly, especially once the dust settles.
