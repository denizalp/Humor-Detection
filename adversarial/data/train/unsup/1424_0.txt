Man this place is so damn good.. \"Made me wanna slap my momma\"!!! \nlol.. Really though! I have been to a few taco spots in my day from L.A. street tacos off Pico, Whittier, East L.A... even found some gems in the Bay Area.. but hands down.. this is definitely one of the best spots I found in Vegas, if not anywhere. The Al Pastor tacos are BANGING and the Carne Asada Vampiros will do amazing things to your taste buds. All ingredients are fresh, made to order. Staff is awesome and the salsa bar is well stocked with a good variety of sides and flavors. Casual atmosphere with great music, great food, and affordable prices. A must try for all you taco-heads out there!\n\n-SCA
