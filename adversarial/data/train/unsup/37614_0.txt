Tonite I waited 45 minutes after I was told my pizza would be ready. Unfortunately there was a computer glitch and orders were getting lost in the system. These things happen nowadays so I wasn't too upset. When they called my name the Manager refunded me and everyone else who had to wait. \nVery nice and unexpected. Thank You!
