Dr. Rehl is an amazing physician with exceptional bedside manner. I have to write this review to let his surgery scheduler, Laura, know that she is abrupt, abrasive, and is a poor representation of Dr. Rehl. Here you have this outstanding physician with an exceptional way with patients and then you are left to deal with Laura. \nLaura - to be specific - it is the tone you use with patients. It is condescending and downright rude. Dr. Rehl deserves, and I'm sure expects, for you to treat his patients AT LEAST as well as he does. My goodness!
