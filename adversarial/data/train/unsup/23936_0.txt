Review on TangoChina, Summerlin\n\nThis small, charming, new Chinese Café\/Restaurant is located in a shopping plaza in Summerlin. It has a neat and inviting decor. It has a good selection of Lunch Specials of typical Chinese cuisines; complete with soup, chips, and a side of rice or fried Chowmein, for $6 or $7 each, thus, of excellent value.\n\nThe waitresses are very friendly and quite accommodating.\n- The Szechuan Spicy Chicken I ordered had excellent aroma, texture and presentation, but surprisingly, it was unsually \"too SWEET\" at every bite! I asked kindly and half-jokingly my friendly server if the chef had used sugar instead of salt by any chance. She was helpful and accommodating, and actually went to talk to the chef about it, who said it was no mistake, but was totally WILLING to re-make the dish with less sugar! Well, to me, that is a mark of good business practice, I was impressed.\n- Yes, I have had Szechuan style spicy dishes in restaurants in SZECHUAN, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and in a few Chinatowns in the States, but no, I have never tasted a Szechuan dish with such sweetness before. Well, at least the chef at ChinaTango was willing to remake the dish! The helpful waitress offered her good advice that the next time I order, make sure to ask the chef to go easy with the sugar! Good advice, I'll definitely go back and give it another try.\n\n- Based on the happy faces of other customers, the cuisines must be pretty good in general. I'll definitely go back there and try other items in the menu.\n\nBy the way, another plus for this Chinese Café: - It has a very CLEAN bathroom, complete with paper towels.\n\nPeterskis3\n12\/16\/11\n--
