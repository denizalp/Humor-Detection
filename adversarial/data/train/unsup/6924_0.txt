With Spiegelworld having produced two of the best shows I've seen in Las Vegas (Absinthe, Vegas Nocturne), there was never a doubt I was going to see Opium.  I jumped on the locals deal they had last December for $30 per ticket ($79 regular price) and while there were definitely some quality laughs and oddity that only they do, at its core, this is a $50 kind of show.  Tickets go as high as $129 retail and I would honestly save that money and just get high.\n\nCocktails start at $18 and come in a plastic bag with a straw.  I noticed a whole row of people on the other side drinking them and they all kind of looked like they were sucking dick while palming an ice filled scrotum.  I highly doubt this was coincidence.  The French 75 was pretty strong and two would be enough to get a quality buzz going and really, with this show...the more trashed, the better.  \n\nComparing Opium to what was previously in this venue was unavoidable.  The production budget is nowhere close to \"Vegas Nocturne\" and none of the performances cost much money aside from the terrific live band and each performer's own wackiness...which I guess is kinda priceless.  Without going into spoilers or details, my favorite bits were the bananas (literally a budget of 25 cents and a couple of crazy people) and the dog. \n\nI know the show will continue to evolve and I will see it again down the road, but as it is now, I'd rather just see Absinthe for the fourth time.  10 shows a week is pretty aggressive!  I hope they get better.
