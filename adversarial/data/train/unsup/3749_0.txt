Avoid this place, avoid the kids, avoiding the terrible gaming, avoid the smell, avoid the vomit soaked carpets, avoid the terrible food.\n\nThe only ONLY ONLYYYYYYYYYYYYYY good thing about this place.  The Steakhouse in the middle.  I wish it could be teleported to a hotel that didn't suck.  \n\nEven then, it gets one star.\n\nHunter Thompson must have been totally blitzed to come and stay here for an hour or two.  I couldn't make it ten minutes each time I come.
