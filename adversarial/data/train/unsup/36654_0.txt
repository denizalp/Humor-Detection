Wow...what can I NOT say about Juan's!  The service 5 stars!  Our server Amanda was the best - hands down. You know she loves her job and Juan's. Amanda was so helpful with recommendations. She and the other staff members were very tentative. We had the table guacamole; Chili Verde w\/ rice n beans..and 2 flour (regular size tortillas) w\/ rice n beans...yummy yummy yummy!  I'm orginially from Denver, we have hit or miss with mexican restaurants here in Vegas...but, I miss say Juan's is a hit!
