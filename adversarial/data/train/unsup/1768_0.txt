We eat here at least 2-3 times a month!  One of those special little hideaways that's perfect for date night or a night out with the family!  Every thing is made to order so if you want fast foot, go to pita jungle or Burger King!  This is fresh, organic, and delicious, made-to-order food!  Samy and Amy are always so warm and welcoming!  The beautiful pastries and desserts are scrumptious and are hand-crafted by Amy herself!  We have our favorites which include the pizza bread, salads, sandwiches, and pastas!  If you're planning on going to a movie, do that first, so that you can linger over the wonderful wines and food and make it a special evening!\nThe decor and ambience is wonderful and we are always treated like part of Samy and Amy's family!  Anyone headed to Scottsdale needs to make ABC\/Amy's a must!
