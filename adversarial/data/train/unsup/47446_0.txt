I'd just like to give a shout-out to the Chipotle employee who helped me out today. I ordered my Burrito Bowl, got to the register to pay, and realized I'd left my wallet at my apartment. I got flustered and left to get it, promising to return. When I did return, the employee handed me my food, and when I tried to pay, he said nope, it's covered. He'd tried to tell me before I rushed out the door. Such a nice gesture, and as always, the food was delicious! I hope this comment doesn't prompt mass wallet forgetfulness, though. :)
