Great place to eat and drink late night on the strip. We hit the restaurants around 10PM and service fairly prompt given how busy the place was. We ordered the Eggs Benedict and roast beef sandwich. Both tasted great! I'd compare this place to an upscale Denny's with atmosphere and look (like many have already said) of a cruise liner. \n\nWe did order a couple of drinks (which you must order from the cocktail waitress instead of your server for some reason) and they tasted great as well. (We ordered the 64 ounce monster drink) Overall a great place to stop by for some decent late night food. Parking was easy to find also.
