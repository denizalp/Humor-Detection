This place is such a great breakfast option! I had their french toast which came piled with fruit and a cup of fresh squeezed orange juice. The decor is very modern and features a spiral staircase leading to the upstairs seating. They have a huge menu ranging from just about every breakfast option you can think of. Definitely a great place to stop in before a day of sightseeing in Montreal.
