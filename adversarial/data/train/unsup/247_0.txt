Good food, my biggest complaint is price.  Was over $9 for a sandwich and a soda.\n\nIt was their first day open so they were running a bit slow.  The table next to us had their order lost.  Hopefully it's just first day hiccups and the service will improve.\n\nI had the bandido pannini.  Roasted turkey, roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, pepperjack and chipotle mayo.  It was pretty good.  But as I said before, I don't think it was really worth $9.\n\nI'll make trips back from time to time, but I wasn't amazed by this place.
