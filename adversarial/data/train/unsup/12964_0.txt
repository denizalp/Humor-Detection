This place is so legit, especially since my old college roommate, who is Vietnamese, drives from Greensboro to buy the banh mi here. Her Mom cooks the best Vietnamese food and loves this place. \n\nI knew I was in for a treat when my roomie brought 4 of the banh mi for me to try. Since it was take out, the toppings (Cilantro, peppers, pickled daikon and carrots) where packaged in two separate Ziploc bags so the sandwiches wouldn't get soggy. This worked out since I didn't get a chance to try them until later that day. The banh mi were tightly wrapped and numbered on the outside. There was one #1, #9, and two #10. My brother had the #1 and #10 while I had to rest. The #10 was the classic pork and the #9 was the sardine. Sardine banh mi is my favorite and their version was the best I've had. The sardine is not covered is sauce but instead crispy flakes (I think onion) that added additional crunch. The bread is fresh, thin, with a crispy outside and chewy inside. I like how the bread is in proportion to the filling unlike other places where it's too thick and drowns out the other ingredients. And yes, I have bit my tongue before trying to chew through a thick banh mi baguette at a different place in Chicago (not a good idea to eat one after a dental procedure when you can't feel your face let alone your tongue...it required several stitches). I digress. The classic pork was just as good. We both inhaled both banh mi in one sitting...a feat for me who is used to eating just one at a time.\n\nSo happy to have a go-to banh mi place whenever I visit Charlotte. Can't wait to come back and actually visit the store and order for myself.
