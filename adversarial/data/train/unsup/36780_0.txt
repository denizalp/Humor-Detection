Oh what a lovely meal this was!! I can not say enough wonderful things about our dinner at yardbirds. Our waitress was so wonderful. I asked her to surprise me with a drink because there was so many options that looked amazing and she didn't not disappoint with the southern revival. It was a delicious blend of passion fruit and wild turkey 81 garnished with grapes and basil. That garnish really sealed the deal and made the drink a wonderful sensory experience. I wouldn't have normally gotten a drink like that but I'm so happy I did. \n\nOn to the food, butter milk biscuits with homemade apple jam and home made butter they were so on point I wish I could eat them every day. The chicken and waffles were delicious also. I've never in my life had fried chicken as crispy and juicy as what they served up at Yardbirds. We ordered a few sides also with the chicken and waffles, Brussel sprouts (amazing), mac and cheese ( who can go wrong) and my personal favorite jalape√±o corn bread!! All the items paired so well together the meal was truly amazing. \n\nThe atmosphere was a little dark but it was cozy. We sat on the couches to eat and they were pretty comfortable aside from the tables not being big enough for all of our food. They have mason jar lights hanging they were pretty awesome to see the scene.\n\nSure there's plenty of places to eat a meal in Vegas. But no where on the strip are you going to have a meal that is as amazing as the one you'll have a yardbirds. Walk the extra few hotels to get to this restaurant, you absolutely will not be disappointed. They'll send you home wishing for the next time you can take a seat at their tables. Happy eating!
