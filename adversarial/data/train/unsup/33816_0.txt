I was visiting from SoCal about a week ago and decided to get a mani-pedi.  A quick check of Yelp led me to Queen & King.  I walked in at 3PM on a Friday and Anna was able to see me right away.  I got a regular pedicure and a gel manicure.  Both were wonderful.  The atmosphere in the salon is very friendly and they play a movie on one screen and the TV on another screen, but neither were too intrusive.  The gel manicure is possibly the best one I have ever received - Anna was really good at shaping the nail just the way I like it (rounded square).  But here is the big difference,  It's been 10 days and not one edge has lifted - whatever Anna uses\/does is superior to my regular place in Burbank. Also, the hand\/arm massage was very nice, she really applied pressure, which I liked.  Every time I visit the area, I'm going here!
