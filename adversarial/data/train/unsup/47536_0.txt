This is a review of the cafe overlooking the garden of the McCord Museum.  We arrived thinking to have a quick bite before touring the museum. The maitre'd asked if we had a reservation, and when we said no, he said they were fully booked for lunch, however, when we said we were just interested in a light lunch, he found us a table.  His welcoming demeanor made us like the terrace restaurant immediately. This open air caf√© faces the garden of the McCord Museum in Montreal. It is a top notch restaurant. The talented chef's prowess showed in every dish. My wife and I ate one of the best meals of our trip to Canada here.  Food and service is excellent. A bit pricey but well worth it. Try to make reservations, as it is a very popular place for lunch and dinner. The restaurant card said Le Club Chasse et Peche, which we discovered is one of the top restaurants in Montreal!. I imagine that this restaurant runs the lunch at this lovely veranda cafe.
