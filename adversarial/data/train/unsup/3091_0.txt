Decided to try this place out for dinner one night with some friends. One of my friends said their duck noodle soup was really good and I've been trying to find a pho place that I can stick to and honestly love.\n\nSo I decided to order pho of course! With beef balls and rare steak, which is typically what like to order at a restaurant. Two of my friends ordered pho while one ordered the duck noodle soup and the last ordered their beef satay noodles. \n\nThe broth was okay. It seemed normal to me. I think the flavor could be a little stronger? The broth was really light to me. At least the broth wasn't sweet! Sweet broth makes me want to pour a jar of sriracha in it to cover the sweetness. haha. The noodles seemed kind of overcooked. I actually like my beef balls to have tendons in them and theirs didn't so I was a little disappointed in that. The rare steak wasn't all that impressive to me either. \n\nService was okay however they did forget one of our orders. Friend ordered an avocado smoothie but it never came so she just decided to cancel it.\n\nOverall, it was okay. I do want to go back to try some other stuff.. probably not their pho though.
