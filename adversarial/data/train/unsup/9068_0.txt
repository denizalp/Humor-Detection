A poke invasion has finally swept through Charlotte. I'm not mad about it. \n\nLocated next to Dilworth Neighborhood Grill, this spot serves up fresh poke bowls, oysters, and seafood rolls. There are 10 Hi Tide Signature Bowls (Regular: $8.95, Large: $12.95) to choose from and you can add toppings to those. There's also the option to build your own bowl with a laundry list of bases, proteins, toppings, sauces, etc. There are sauces on the table as well. If I'm getting a lobster roll, I'm dipping my fries in the sweet soy reduction. I also throw some sriracha in my ketchup.\n\nSpecials alert: all day long on Monday's: lobster roll with your choice of seasoned chips or fries $15.99. Big savings, they are usually around $23 (market price). Monday-Friday they do oyster happy hour from 4-7pm. 1\/2 off fresh oysters. Note: regular price of their cheapest oyster is usually $3. I still say the steal of the menu is the Poke Nachos ($8.95). Delicious, big portion, and the unagi saucy is tasty. \n\nThey always offer free cucumber & mint water. They also have fresh daily made frescas and a delicious cold brewed Hawaiian Coffee with coconut cream. There's also a cooler with wine, champs, and beer options. \n\nA heads up: the parking lot is kind of on the small size, you may have trouble finding a spot during peak lunch time.\n\nThe Stars are Just Like Us: Coach Ron Rivera sat at the table next to me during a trip here, so if anyone asks I technically had lunch with Riverboat.
