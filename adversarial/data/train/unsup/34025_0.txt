I love this place. Great Mexican street food.   Somewhat quirky ordering system, but very manageable once you get the hang of it.  Large menu and everything is made to order.  I especially like the tacos with carne asada or al pastor.   The bar is also a nice touch. It's tiny, but the bartenders are friendly and creative.  And they know tequila!   \n\nRecommended.
