Run-of-the mill sandwich place, nothing spectacular or revelatory by any stretch, but not horrible either.  I took my chances with the pastrami, and while it did give me mild indigestion and the accompanying pickle spear was bland, it was alright.  I'd say it could've benefited from more pastrami, but no, not really.  Onion maybe, but no more pastrami.  It was very greasy and rather meh.  The price was right though, and bland as it was, it was still a free pickle.  A random pigeon stopped by while my brother and I were eating and took a look around - luckily he stayed on his side of the counter.  \n\nIf I lived in Cleveland and worked downtown, I'd probably hit this place up for lunch and get something other than the pastrami, but it's not worth going out of the way for it.
