Valley HO! \n\nI dig. \n\nPicture this. A cooler version of the Brady Bunch decides to buy a hotel in Scottsdale. The kids get to decorate the rooms and design the pool. There are cabanas, retro furniture sprawls about, everyone is friendly (I mean for real, like JUMPING to get you stuff) and the beds are like little patches of poofy clouds. \n\nI stayed in a \"Cabana King,\" which was just splendid. Outdoor seating right by the pool, a bathroom with a separate soaky tub and rain shower, and oh.my.GOD. Did I mention the bed? I NEVER sleep that well in hotels, but this was like a little lullaby. MMM, a good night's rest. PRICELESS. \n\nThe retro vibe is hardly understated. In fact, it's just WAY over the top, but it works well. Every detail is taken into account, nothing is overlooked. Each font, color, piece of furniture, accessory, fixture, paint color, staff member: CHECK PLUS. \n\nSO, why the 4 stars? Room service is a bit ridiculous (add a 20 percent gratuity, AND the food was not so great. An omelette with burnt bacon and WAY too much soft cheese for a normal person to consume). I'd skip the restaurant. It tries hard, but falls short...\n\nThe beds and the pool are where it's at, FO SHO...Valley HO! I'll stay again.
