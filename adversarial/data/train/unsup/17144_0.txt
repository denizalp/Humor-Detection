If you're in a time bind, this restaurant seems to achieve getting your pho out quickly and with great taste. There's a lot of flavor in their broth and they make it so easy to add Sriracha, hoisin sauce, and chili sauce to your heart's content!\n\nI love how some other customers compare this restaurant to Saigon Kitchen. It's different. This place specializes entirely in pho so of course that's what the focus is. They keep their menu simple. Did you want chicken, beef, or shrimp? Those are your main choices with the pho here. (Saigon is upscale and trying to provide a different \"spin\" on traditional Vietnamese food in general, not just pho. They offer salmon belly pho, and pho with tendon, tripe and Vietnamese meatballs which are more southern Vietnamese fare. Plus they offer other dishes like Pork Banh Mi or non traditional \"Shaken beef.\") \n\nSometimes, I just want pho, and now that I know I can come here for a quick and easy lunch with great food, this will be one of my regular stops. Sure I wish there were some more unique pho offerings like tripe or those Viet meatballs but why add it if it's not as popular with their main audience? \n\nI ordered the mini beef pho combo #3. You order at the counter and they cart you your food. I didn't realize my combo came with a shrimp spring roll and two egg rolls and some greens. They don't mess around with portions. For $10, you can get pretty full but not uncomfortably. It's \"just right.\" I might try the shrimp one next time!\n\nIt's a pretty tight squeeze in this place unless you sit in a booth. It's not like we planned on spending hours where anyway so it really didn't matter. Come check this place out!
