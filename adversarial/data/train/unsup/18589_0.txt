Holy schnit-bottoms!! \n\nOut of words for how amazing the food was. A MUST try if you are ever in town. The holy mother of schnitzels, they are frikken massive, and cooked to perfection. Topped over one of theeee best potato salads I have ever lived to try.  Halusky tasted equally amazing, so amazing my kids killed their plates in less than 5 minutes..unheard of. $14.99 is the perfect price if you consider sharing your meal. The place is really outdated and you will get a few strange stares if you're Asian like me, but everyone was so sweet including all the customers who wished us a Merry Christmas.
