This is my opinion is the only place to get your smoked salmon.  I had some last month and shared with a friend, she was blown away and said it was the best she ever had.  It's new year's eve and you can bet I have it in my fridge right now and cannot wait to get home and have some.  It is awesome on it's own or you can buy bits and use them in a pasta or quiche.\n\nI love the thick slices too.  I had the pleasure of working beside the owner at Taste of Toronto many many years ago and have been buying his salmon since that day.
