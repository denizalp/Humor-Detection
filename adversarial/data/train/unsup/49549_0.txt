Are here for the first time last night and I have to say it was pretty mediocre a at best. The service was terrible, I had to ask numerous times for refills and even a steak knife which took 10 minutes. The waiter handed numerous people including myself very hot plates that he has the luxury of holding with a towel, he also reached around and over us quite a few times rather than going out of his way. The waiter forgot to include our salads so when they were brought out each one was different almost as if they want back and emptied the fridge of all their salads. The food was pretty good, my steak was a little tougher than I expected but sometimes that happens. Overall I can't say they was a very good experience and the only reason a tip was left was because gratuity was already added to the bill.
