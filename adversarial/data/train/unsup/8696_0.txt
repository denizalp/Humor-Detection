At 5:30 in the morning if you want to skip the line for *$, keep moving down towards the end of the A concourse. Cinnabon has the hot coffee and sugar you need. And I needed it. Sadly, only the coffee was decent and the \"classic\" bun with light frosting was not great. It had a texture that suggested it was not as fresh as it should have been. Half of it never made it onto the plane.
