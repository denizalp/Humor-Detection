I went it to the store and observed:\n1) prices way too high.\n  Example blustream $25 theirs $32\n2) puppies\nThey are very adorable and all.. I find it they are waaaaayyyy to young to be coup up like that. They need their moms.\n3) puppies...\nAgain, some of them are malnourished. I was playing with a frenchie and both of them are very skinny.\n4) clerks\nNot one of them said hi to me as I walk through the store.\nI don't recommend this store at all!
