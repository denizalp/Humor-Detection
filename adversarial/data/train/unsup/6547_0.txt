So I was coming back from dinner further south on the strip when I heard some loud music and a group of people gathered around watching the scene - employees inside this booth were dancing to the music and putting on a show. I watched for a moment with amusement and after the song was over most people left. I just realized that I had had Turkish ice cream before years ago - in Tokyo Disneyland of all places. They called it Dondurma or トルコ風アイス and the guy serving it usually puts on a show stretching the ice cream - carnival like - sorta like the way you see pizza makers flip their dough. So I decided to get a tiny portion in a cup - paid in cash since they charge extra for purchases under ten dollars on a credit card. Walked over to the corner where I was further entertained by a doomsday preacher bent on saving souls from Sin City. The chocolate hazelnut ice cream had that Turkish ice cream consistency I remember - gooey and stretchy and each spoonful stretched in a gooey strand from the cup to my mouth. This aspect of the ice cream makes it easy to get on your clothes so be careful. Not too sweet so I liked that as well. I'm usually not much of a sweets\/ice cream guy but this is the first time I saw a place in the states that serves this stuff. so I just had to have it - had to! After preacherman's novelty wore off I went up the bridge and crossed north over Flamingo to the other side where there was more entertainment - this time a singer\/saxophonist playing Pink Floyd songs. Good times! Place is in the Grand Bazaar Shops on the strip outside Bally's. They also serve other food items other than ice cream but I had already had dinner - maybe next time.
