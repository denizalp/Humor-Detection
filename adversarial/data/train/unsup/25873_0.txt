Awful awful place. I pay cash for my children to attend not paid for through DES and today learned that a teacher(whom i had never seen before) yelled in my daughters face. She is 5. My older son who was also there confirmed what my youngest had said. They have such a high turn over rate when it comes to \"teachers\".  Which i have brought up before to the female owner. Which she DENIED. The 3 months my daughter has attended there have been at least half a dozen new teachers for her preschool class. I am just so done with this daycare. Today was my daughters last day.
