New favorite!\n\nService was incredible! Elena and the rest of the staff were fabulous. Attentivd but left us to enjoy our meals. Explained the whole menu in detail. Elena was particularly fabulous and showed us their reservation area and answered all our questions...she was so incredibly amazing! \n\nThe food was good. Honestly i found the chicken plate i ordered a bit overcooked but the sauce and the perfectly cooked and seasoned array of vegetables i chose as a side dish made it perfectly forgivable. Boyfriend love his spagettini arrabiatta...spicy beyond belief and he enjoyed every bite.\n\nThe decor and the atmosphere is very chill and classy and comfortable. I loved showing up in a pretty dress but i wouldn't feel bad to show up in a nice pair of jeans and t shirt either. \n\nParking is available in the back off Notre Dame. We paid for parking right in front but not much as it was near then end of tariffed times. \n\nRight along the river, we will be back to enjoy this place more!
