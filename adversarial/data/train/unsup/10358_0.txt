this Starbucks is pretty rank. it's overrun with homeless and down-and-outs...the men's bathroom is typically broken or poop-filled and for some reason the sink faucet runs dangerously hot as the ONLY setting. filth, man. just a disgusting location.\n\nthe back patio is beggar's row. the front patio is just run-down and smushed between a sandwich shop and funky cheap-o bagel joint.\n\nthis used to be my favorite Starbucks about three years ago (solid staff, good seating, professional clientele). but over time the staff became less caring, the cleanliness became borderline horrendous and the riff raff stink, literally. granted, some of the old staff that does it right remains, and there IS a little pep to their step. but they are overwhelmed by newbies who either don't give a damn or for some reason can't do their job.\n\nagain, sad since i used to love this location. it NEEDS a manager onsite every day, because right now, the homeless are running the asylum, baby.\n\noh, the coffee and tea? it's a Starbucks- same wherever you go. however at this location it might take a couple tries to get the order right. plop.
