I grew up eating Vietnamese food, so I can taste the difference between good and bad bun bo hue.\n\nThe main reasons why I gave this place a one star was because: \n1. The service was terrible. I was not greeted at the door or at the table until I got someone's attention 10 minutes later. Yes I did sit myself because I thought that was the norm, and yes I came in during business hours. Maybe they were playing hide-and-go seek with me. Who knows. \n\n2. Perhaps they were trying to be hip, but the room was really dark... The only bright light came from the kitchen. \n\n3. All the items on the menu were quite pricey compared to the Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown \n\n4. I ordered the bun bo hue and received a few pieces of meat, noodle, soup, and bean sprouts. Keep in mind that bun bo hue should have banana root\/blossom or at least red cabbage on the side, beef shank, pig's feet and pig's blood cubes inside the the soup.\n\nYou are better off making 10 cent ramen at home. If you want good Vietnamese food, go to Chinatown.
