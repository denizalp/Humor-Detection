As the saying goes, when one Thai food door closes, another Thai food door opens...\n\nIt was Sunday afternoon. We were hungry and we wanted Thai. We walked up to Thai Gourmet, our usual go-to Thai spot, and were greeted by a \"closed\" sign on the door. They don't open until 5 on Sundays?!  But I want Thai food NOWWWWW (feeling very Veruca Salt that day). Dejected, I walked my rumbly tummy up Liberty Ave, and lo and behold, another Thai restaurant appears a few blocks up. Whine and ye shall receive.\n\nAfter perusing the menu, we decide to take out some chicken pad thai and another dish called \"three flavored chicken.\" Both solid choices. The pad thai portion was huge and chock full of the good stuff (they did not skimp on the meat or veggies in here!)  The sauce was flavorful and plentiful, yet light...not overly thick, oily, or sticky, as some pad thai sauces can be. The \"three flavored chicken\" was also tasty with its crispy, breaded chunks of white meat chicken. The sauce was interesting and unlike anything I've ever had before. Despite its name, I really only tasted two flavors that dominated the sauce -- vinegar (sour) and sugar (sweet). It could have used some spice to round it out, but even so, it was still delicious. I do wish it had some broccoli or other vegetable in it so I at least felt a little less guilty about eating copious amounts of fried chicken chunks :)  And overall, for our tastes, both dishes definitely could have kicked up the spice intensity. We had ordered both at a level 8, and as I said, I couldn't really detect any spice at all. So if that was an 8, next time I'll probably order a 33. :)\n\nOverall, this is very yummy Thai food. I'm not sure that it will replace my usual go-to Thai spot, but it'll definitely be high on my list!
