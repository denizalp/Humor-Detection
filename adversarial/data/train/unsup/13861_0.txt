I do not have a membership here but I come frequently as a guest on a friends account. If a planet fitness like this one was closer to my house I would be a member there (instead of my current gym) to be quite honest.\n\nI like this place. Its HUGE and has many options and machines and weights available to you. There are plenty of t.v. screens and cleaning supplies available to use.\n\nThe reason I deducted a star is because this place gets BUSY. Its crazy hearing the small roar of all the different machines, weights, and people. It can be quite challenging at times to get 2 machines together when doing cardio with a friend, but it is manageable. And I keep seeing free pizza at the front area. Come on I just worked out it's way too tempting LOL.\n\nThey have nice amenities and if you upgrade like my friend did then you get unlimited guest passes and access to their mini spa.
