I was pretty excited to check this place out last Friday, and enjoyed it while I was there. The service and food were both pretty good, and I really enjoyed the venue and the crowd. However, both my friend and I both ordered the pulled pork sliders and we both got sick later that night. That is enough to keep me from coming back.
