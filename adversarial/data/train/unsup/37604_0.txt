Awesome bar, food is good, love the happy hour prices during football season (game days). Wife and I went there 4 times and always had good food and good service. Can't complain, it's a Seahawks bar. The sports bar part is awesome and the sit down resturant part was good too. It just need more big screen tv. Overall, I will always go back to support Scooter's Pub and the Seahawks. Go Hawks!!
