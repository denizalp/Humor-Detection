I am addicted to this place!! I wish I could go every Sunday, but that would get expensive!! I go specifically for their vegan brunch menu and it is out of this world! The vegan chicken and waffles are perfect as well as the \"tuna\" sandwiches! You'd never know it wasn't the real deal! If you're vegan and in town definitely don't pass this place up!
