First off let me say two things. Some of the pictures posted are old so it may not reflect the prices accurately or the portion of soup you'll get. Secondly I was in the mood for soup so there are two locations you can find them on the menu. I was told the ones under the Soup are \"appetizer\" size and the ones listed under Noodle and Rice are considered the large portions.\n\nI decided to get the pork rice noodle soup and if you like pho and if you like garlic then you'll love the rice noodle soup they have. Broth was full of flavor, taste like it had fish sauce in it already. The roasted garlic complimented the ground pork and fish ball, yummy. My only complaints are that the sprouts were already in the soup when they served it, which made them partially cooked and less crispy and also, I found a lot of garlic skins in soup which I had no intention of eating.\n\nOverall I was very happy with the meal for the price. It's a unique soup and I will come back to have more.
