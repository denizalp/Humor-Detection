Lots of empty stores (Deserted Ridge Marketplace), difficult and time consuming to navigate, easy to enter - difficult to leave. Poor traffic flow - benefits stores more than customers. You can check out anytime you like but you can't ever leave.\n\nNice fireplace\/fountain feature, good for taking a date or significant other. Also good because they restrict teens in the evening. Cool fountain, allows kids to play in the water without getting into a pool. \n\nIf I could do one thing to improve Desert Ridge it would be done with a bulldozer to straighten out the roads and make a couple more exits with traffic lights. Like I said, it is designed to impede your driving, slow you down, and make departure difficult.\n\nI was told by more than one employee in  a store there that this mall is a hot spot for car thieves and armed store robbers. I doubt DRM wants us to know that. So keep your eyes open and behave accordingly and always lock your car and leave nothing of value visible from the outside of the car.
