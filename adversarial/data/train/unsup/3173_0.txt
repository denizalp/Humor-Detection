Tree Hugger's you disappoint again.\n\nMy mom has been here twice in the past few months & raved and raved.  I thought to myself, Tree Hugger,'s you must have gotten it together & stepped it up.\n\nOh no you haven't....\n\nMom treated me to lunch post-church yesterday.  $40 for two?  Ummmm can we say pricey?  For two entree's, one side, and an appetizer (for which I had a coupon)  I think you're over-doing your $$ for what you're doing here.  I get that you're buying local & doing organic, but if you don't do it well.....\n\nThe service sucked.  The place was 3\/4 full and there were two servers working the room and walk-ins for the register, and it looked like 2 people in the kitchen.  I had to walk my beverage up to the front to ask for refills, walk to the front to snag more napkins, and oh yeah the utensils I needed to eat with.\n\nI ordered the chicken salad wrap & artichoke soup.  The soup was no-bueno with a gritty texture and an overly-powerful rosemary taste...so much so that I wondered if it was rosemary soup & not artichoke.  The wrap was large (yay!) and not too bad, but the chicken was dry and I wasn't given the opportunity to ask for some mustard or anything.  My mom ordered one of her favs...the black bean burger, which was huge, but DRY DRY DRY and not very hot either!  In fact, everything here was DRY!  Beans should not be dry.  Chicken should not be dry.  The black bean app that we ordered had good flavor & was probably the best thing of the meal, but again DRY!  And seriously, why are you deep-frying thick pita for chips?  Tree Hugger's if you are friend to the vegan, the vegetarian, the health-nut....why are you deep-frying?!\n\nAgain, you're not hitting on full-cylinders here.  It is a shame too.  The location sucks, and they don't even cater to their captive audience at the gym next door.  When you don't open until 10:30 am you miss your opportunity to make $$ on coffee, bakery, and smoothies to that 5am gym crowd.  I'm just saying.\n\nI want to like you Tree Hugger's but you're too pricey, crappy service, and not good food just disappoint....every time.
