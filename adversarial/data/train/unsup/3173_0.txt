We went on Sunday and it took over an hour from the moment we ordered to get our food. Our waiter was horrible and the manager did not do anything to make up for the slow service and long wait. People were walking out because the food was taking too long. We ended up getting our food to go because we had lost our appetite. Although the food was good we will never come back. No concept of hospitality\/customer service.
