Perfect place to bring your favorite NASCAR friends. You will learn all about the most famous cars and riders and take pics with the cars.\n\nSomething that was pretty cool? They have the real grade\/slope of the corners of the tracks that you can climb up\/take a pic with\/ drink and walk :) \n\nThe best part of the place? Can any of my competitive peeps guess? Yes!!! It is the simulator!! You get to to pick your car and focus enough to beat all the other pucks! \n\nThe best advice I can give is to watch a round to see how the simulator cars are. Then, get in the car, don't overcompensate, and work your way to glory! This place is by far one of the best I have seen in a while!
