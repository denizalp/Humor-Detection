So.. star bonus to the owners, first off. Both times I went in, not only were they very friendly and present, they had recommendations ready to go, kept the lines moving, and were very proud of their hard work launching this storefront. The location is extremely convenient, however plan to get take out because there is little to no room to sit and eat, even the expansion of seating in the back. It's a tad embarrassing (as a host)asking a small group out for lunch and not being able to accommodate a place to eat, but not really having been in before, it's something I should've scoped ahead of time. \n\nThat being said, I know they are a franchise, but hopefully some suggestions can be made. I wanted a wrap (no added protein) and soup. $16. They only serve large bowls of soup, no small cups as a side or a half wrap\/half soup. I even still thought $8 to not have a protein added (extra $2) was a bit much, HOWEVER you have to remind yourself that these are premium, quality ingredients and that it is going to cost a bit more. I scrapped the soup off of my order. \n\nNow onto the food.. I ordered a Tex Mex burrito. The flavors in it were amazing. However without a protein I think it was missing that fullness to the meal and I was left a bit hungry after, despite the size of the burrito. Next time I would definitely get falafel or chicken to give it a bump, but I feel lukewarm about paying $10 for a falafel wrap when there's authentic Mediterranean cuisine downtown that has falafel for less. \n\nI typically circulate the same food places downtown weekly, and although I'll be back, I'm not sure I'll add this to my weekly repertoire of repeat restaurants that I rotate, only due to the cost and not being quite filled. However, the quality of the food and the flavor have kept me as a repeat customer.
