I was craving pizza and didn't want to settle for the regular, doughy kind, I wanted a wood fire, thin crust pizza and we drove right by only to make the U-turn. \nWe had been here a few times before, but to be truthful, couldn't recall what I had, but remembered I like it! A quick look at the pizza's and I knew it would be the spicy Italian sausage. \nWhen it arrived, it was very thin crust indeed, so thin, the juices from the sausage and mushrooms seemed to have melted through the crust, it was impossible to eat without a utensil. \nMy hubby was trying to do right and keep to his diet, so he ordered the Caesar salad with chicken breast, it had to be the biggest salad, it was big enough for the two of us and then some!  \nOverall, the staff was quick with the refills, friendly, the place smelled really good, and the pizza, well, I would definitely try again.
