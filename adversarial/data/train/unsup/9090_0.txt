Not gonna lie, but the main reason I went here was because I wanted one of the light bulbs with the awesome smilies lol. Apparently they are also known for their 2 drinks in 1 cup where you can pick two flavors (perfect for those of us who are indecisive!). If that description was kinda confusing, just imagine those yan-yan snack containers where one drink goes in one half of the container and there is another drink on the other side (they aren't mixed together).\n\nI ordered the mango green tea with boba which was decent. I was able to taste the mango which is a good thing, but the drink itself was really sweet, like artificially sweet. I usually get my drinks at 100% sugar so maybe I'll tone it down the next time I am here. I ended up adding some water to my drink when I got home and it ended up tasting better. The boba itself was okay since it was warm and chewy, but it didn't really have a flavor. \n\nThe workers are really nice and attentive. The establishment is clean and has a nice outdoorsy theme with their moving benches and stuff lol. The next time I come here I will probably for the 2 drinks in 1 cup since I already have my light bulb :D. \n\nP.S. I was able to try a sample of their strawberry smoothie which was pretty good. Although it seemed to be more of a slushy since it is water based and icy. This was better than my mango green tea drink lol.
