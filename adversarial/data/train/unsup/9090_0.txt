Great professional service, Larry was kind and helpful!!  Was extremely disappointed that there was no wifi offered to be able to work while I waited an hour.  Get with the times..... You can afford it!  I recommend work station high top table with power like they offer at the car dealerships!  Lots of tire service options out there.... What  is separating Discount tire from the rest?
