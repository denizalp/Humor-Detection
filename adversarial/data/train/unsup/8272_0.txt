Came here for booze and medicine! Found exactly what I was looking for. Probably the nicest Walgreens I have ever been too. THEY HAVE A WALK-IN FRIDGE FOR BEERS! How neat is that?!? \n\nMainly came here for allergy medicine because the weather in Vegas is ridiculously hot and the hotels are freezing cold. Also, the lovely smell of cigarettes triggered my allergies 10x more. \n\nI was staring at all the medicines very dumbfounded until a lady from the pharmacy name Laura came up and asked me if I needed any help. YES! YES I DO! I told her all the symptoms I had and she told me what's the best thing to get. Allegra was the answer but she told me I could get the Walgreens brand for the same exact results. THANK YOU LAURA! You saved me so much time and money! \n\nMany of Walgreens on the strip but this one has to be my favorite.
