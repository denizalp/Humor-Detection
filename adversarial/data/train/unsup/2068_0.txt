To reiterate my charming companion, and her meager-looking Jamieson...\n\nCame here on a rainy Wednesday @ 6ish. The crowd was a mix of tourists and business folk. I suspect this place is more happening on the week-end. They might want to try a happy-hour drinks\/food menu to draw in a more hip, local crowd during off-times.\n\nDo NOT order the \"popcorn\" sweetbreads. I was expecting substantial nuggets of hot, crispy-coated offal with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. What I got was luke-warm, flour-dusted bits of sweetbreads, with some droplets of sauce, drowning in too-large cuts of green onion as garnish... I expect to impart an Asian feeling? Mission not accomplished.\n\nThe bartender, after giving great service the whole evening, asked what I had thought of them, and promptly took them off my bill after she received a resounding, \"Meh?\", even though I had ordered nothing else but tap water.\n\nIn conclusion... Great service, good fancy-business ambiance, probably happening on the weekend, but don't use it as an opportunity to round out your Facebook Food List Challenge.\n\nPS. I really want to give this place 2 1\/2 stars, but since there's no option it gets 3 'cause I'm nice :)
