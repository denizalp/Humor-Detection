In town visiting and stopped in on a Friday evening around 7pm.  The restaurant wasn't packed so we didn't have to wait.  You can expect friendly service and an owner who will make his presence known at all the tables.  Our server was well versed in all the items and timing was prompt.  We enjoyed the spinach and cheese pie, tomato basil soup, Greek salad with lamb kabob and hummus, keufta plate, and shared a piece of baklava for dessert.  The hummus was so smooth and the pitas so soft I couldn't get enough.  The lamb was pleasantly tender and juicy.  Their version of baklava was a tad dry on the top half, but when eaten with the bottom half was good.  This version also lacked cinnamon and I could really taste the rose water.   This restaurant will definitely satisfy your craving for Greek\/Mediterranean\/Middle Eastern food.
