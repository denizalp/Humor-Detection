Parsley Modern Mediterranean isn't the most authentic food in town.. but it is quite tasty. \n\nAs other reviewers have stated, this ordering set-up here is similar to a place like Chipotle: you pick the style of dish you want (skewers, wraps, bowls and so on) and then select toppings and extras, and then pay. Parsley is clean, casual, and staffed with super friendly employees. Service has always been exceeded my expectations for a laid back spot like this. \n\nI saw my friend Jamie P. had written about the steak bowl in her review so I decided to try it out. It was so good, definitely my favorite item to order. The pita bread here is not my favorite,  and on my last visit the hummus was on the watery side, which is never a good sign. \n\nAside from the hummus situation, I have had nothing but great experiences at Parsley. Definitely a recommended spot for a quick, Mediterranean-esque meal.\n\nTIP: Groupon has a deal for Parsley currently!
