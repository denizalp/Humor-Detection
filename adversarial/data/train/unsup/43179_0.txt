I've been going to Amanda for about a year and a half now. She is such a riot and we have the same taste in crazy ideas for hair. This salon is such a cute little place; modern design, refreshments for guests, and music is always on point. Amy, the owner, is such a friendly person and you can tell she truly cares about her staff and clients.
