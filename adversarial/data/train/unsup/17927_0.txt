The staff\/service was good.\n\nThe food, well, let's just say you get what you pay for. The food is edible-lol-but not that great. I ordered their Steak and Lobster dinner, which was reasonable priced at $13.99. I ordered it medium rare as any quality steak should be. Seeing as how it wasn't a quality steak, the proper medium rare cooking would've helped make it a more tender, juicy, steak...However, it was over cooked..\n\nThe beers however, were nice and refreshing!! Lol\n\nIf you want a low priced decent meal, than this might be your spot. Lol\n\nAnother thing to note, is that the place is cool cuz it has a few things..Bowling, billiards, a fast food joint with pizza and hot dogs etc..
