Words I would use to describe this restaurant: generic, bland, boring, underwhelming.  There is nothing exciting about this place except maybe the descriptions of the entrees, which falsely made everything sound wonderful.  I ordered the Green Hatch Chile Enchiladas, which was listed on a portion of the menu that contained a warning about the spice-level.  The entree was described as slow-roasted pork carnitas enchiladas in a spicy green hatch chile sauce.  First of all, not spicy at all - really, I would have felt fine feeding this to my one-year-old.  There was definitely not slow-roasted anything in the dish - just cubes of unflavored meat.  And the hatch chile sauce?  I am pretty sure that it was from a can - the type you find at the grocery store.  My wife was equally disappointed with her entree.
