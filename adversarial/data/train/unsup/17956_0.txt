This is a 4.5 star review. A friend and I stayed here a few weeks ago and at first my friend was leery of staying at an off-strip hotel. She quickly changed her tune after the first day. Located a half mile walk off the strip (on the same block as Flamingo, Bally's and Caesars Palace), this place is fantastic. The decor is swanky and I almost fell asleep waiting for my friend on the comfy couches by the elevator. \n\nOur room was a larger suite which had the living room and full kitchen. Bathroom was gorgeous. Note that we booked this room from a Snique Away deal. Views were gorgeous and so was the pool area. Lots of comfy areas to sit with pop\/dance music playing on the speakers around the pool. There is a hotel restaurant on the same floor as the pool so you could order food\/drinks, too. The night we got in, there was an art and wine at the pool. Free wine tastings were abundant and I got toasted off of pink Moscato. The art walk was cool, too, and I picked up a great leather bracelet\/cuff from a local artisit. \n\nThe hotel also has a restaurant\/lounge in the lobby with happy hour every day. The food and drinks were great and prices reasonable outside of happy hour. There was water and fruit in the lobby and sometimes chocolate cookies! Loved it. The only negative I had was on the Friday night, they closed down the pool at 4 p.m. for a wedding reception. I didn't think that was fair or appropriate for the other hotel guests...especially on the weekend. Other than that, I will definitely stay here again!
