Came in at 1:00 for lunch on Wednesday and there were no other customers. I ordered a mix between brown and white rice and previous Yelpers are right when they say this place piles on the rice to make your bowl look fuller because they skimp out on meat and veggies. \n\nI ordered one scoop of crab ($1) and spicy tuna ($2.50) and was very upset to see that the spicy tuna is minced and creamy instead of chunky\/diced like other places. When I ate the poke, the spicy tuna just got lost. I wonder if they do the same thing with the regular tuna ($3). \n\nThe sauces were pretty good, I got wasabi, Hawaiian sweet, spicy mayo, and ponzu. The topping selection is decent but the scoop of avocado is pathetically tiny. I know other Yelpers have complained about this but they still haven't changed it. \n\nI liked the selection of dry toppings and really appreciated that they were complimentary. \n\nThe fact that I had to pay $1 for a bottle of water because they don't have water cups\/refill station is really weird. I don't know other restaurants like this. \n\nLunch cost about $8 and did fill me up, but that's because it was mostly rice. I would probably come back here but would not get spicy tuna and would not rave about this place being the best poke ever because it really isn't.
