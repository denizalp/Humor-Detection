I recently used this company. They helped  on very late notice. Front desk very nice. The head mover or Forman was rude, acted as though he didn't want to answer my questions. Didn't seem as though he cared anything about my things. They handled my things roughly, broke a couple of my things in the process, table missing pieces I still haven't found, and didn't bring a big enough truck to get all my things. I had to make 4 trips back just to get the rest of my furniture. I paid over $1000 dollars for a two story 3 bedroom home for this service that was worth maybe $400, which is what they quoted me at first. I would recommend this company if you want movers with good customer service and handle your things as if they cared. Now, the other workers with the Forman were great. \nI have much to compare this to due to me moving from Florida to Las Vegas with REAL PROFESSIONALS. \nJust a few pictures uploaded of my dresser drawer knobs that were broken. Called it in, they did offer to fix the knob. I don't know how....maybe they were going to use wood glue, lol. Maybe if they were careful this wouldn't have happened. Nothing was damaged when I moved from Florida, but moving across town this I get broken knobs and missing pieces SMDH \n\n\n\n8\/13\/18 \nTonya gave me a call to followed up with me about my experience. I was able to explain everything that I was unhappy with. They do not tolerate the behavior or lack of professionalism that the crew working with my move showed. She offered to fix or rectify any issues I had. Her and the Owner were very concerned and willing to do what they could to make my experience better. I really don't want anything in return but just to ensure no one else has the same issues. Moving itself is stressful, really don't need more on top. Tonya was awesome in ensuring it would be addressed.\n Thank you for the follow up. I truly appreciate that. Not all businesses will do this, but it seemed as though it is going to be squared away. Happy Moving!!!
