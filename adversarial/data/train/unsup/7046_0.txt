I just want to give a shout out to JPG. I've known Jim for some time and remember when he started this company. Jim is a devoted family man who works hard for wife his kids. He treats people with respect and I know he is the same way with his customers. JPG is highly rated in many local media outlets and has been featured on local shows like Your Life a to z. Jim cares about his customers and I know personally that he will go out of his way for them. Jim has a background in the police force and knows his product. He is pleasant to talk to and strives for honesty. So if you are looking for a home security system and want to avoid the overhype and frustrations of the more known companies, go with an honest local guy who knows what he doing.
