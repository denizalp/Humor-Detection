I've been on the gondola before about 5 years ago and had really good memories about it, however just recently we went on it and I feel it was a complete total waste of time and money.  \n\nIf you have never been on a gondola ride before and want to do something romantic\/different than by all means try it.  But seriously it wasn't anything special and our guy wasn't that great.  Thankfully we saved some money because we were staying at the Venetian and got a discount through their passport app.  We had the gondola all to ourselves and we did have to wait about 45 minutes before riding.  \nSo I highly recommend making reservations or just have a plan on something to do, go walk around and shop like I did. \n\nAnyhow all in all i thought my lil one would like it but he wasn't that excited as i thought he would be, the ride was super short and the singing could have been better or the guy could have been more interactive and talked to us more.  I wouldn't go back, waste of money and time!
