My wife felt a craving for lamb while we were at the Kingsland Farmers Market for the Corn Festival, so she tried the lamb at Kaffir Lime, and voted it a solid two thumbs up. You know what they say--happy wife, happy life, and my wife is something of a lamb connoisseur, so I had to give them four stars. It would be five, except I didn't order anything for myself. That's for next time.
