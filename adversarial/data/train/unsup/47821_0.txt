So sad to have had a bad experience at Pullman. We were 4 people who had traveled all day and decided to stop in for a late snack (10pm) and a glass of wine. The welcome was chilly. The upstairs was so dark we had our phones out for lights to see the menu. We brought a candle from a nearby table. When the waitress arrived she told us they don't usually have a candle on that table but she'd let us keep it. The wine was lovely, but just wanted out of there as soon as our light meals were finished. Reading other reviews, I'm wondering if the problem is a particular staff member and not the usual level of service. Sad opener to a delightful stay in usually friendly Montreal.
