Came here for my 21st birthday saturday night (11\/11) and had to wait until 12am to get in but that was no big deal, the line was alright and my friend and i got in for free. This place is like a maze, you have no clue where you are and it's just meh. i expected way more with all the hype. The music was whatever, you can NOT go on the dance floor because it was too crowded and it was just a bad experience..\n\nWhy? YOUR BOUNCERS HAVE ISSUES. They kicked a few of my friends out just for asking a simple question of what happened. Seriously? calm the fck down. power tripping for no reason. SO disappointed with marquee. your bouncers are assholes, your place is crowded, the dance floor is unreachable, it's a MAZE in there and it is so hard to navigate in there. I had to walk down 6 flight of stairs to reach the exit. I was only able to stay for an hour and a half before my friends got kicked out.\n\nThank you Marquee for ruining my birthday, which should have been a good night. You need to tell your bouncers to relax and remember everyone is there to have a good time so loosen up.
