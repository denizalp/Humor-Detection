This place is so disrepectful!!! My girlfriend went in and asked for dreads and because she was white, they said her hair would not loc, and they would not do her hair. They said because she's white she should not have dreads and turned her away. This shop is not professional at all, it's 2018 and it doesn't matter what style hair you have, just because you're African American doesn't mean we own dreads!!! DO NOT GO TO THIS SHOP! IF I COULD GIVE A NEGATIVE STAR I WOULD!!!
