I really wanted to be able to give 5 stars but it wasn't quite there.  My baby's haircut was good and the little room for them to play in until they get picked up is really nice too.  The staff was fairly friendly but there was one woman there that snapped at my dog when she didn't think I was there and then came into the front office while I was getting ready to leave, didn't even look up at me and not a word when I left.    My dog was a little more anxious than usual when I picked him up so I will try another groomer next time.
