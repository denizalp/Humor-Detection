I've been coming here for a few years now and always get a pedicure. I've never had any problems with this place. The staff has always been friendly towards me. They recognize me when I come in and always make me feel welcome. The place is clean and sanitary. They use liners for the foot spas and their tools are clean too. I would recommend this place.
