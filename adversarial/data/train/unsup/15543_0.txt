I have trust issues when it comes to places with glowing reviews as I've been burned multiple times having high expectations only to be majorly let down in the end. This Thai restaurant is located across the street from Nellis AFB housing community. Their parking lot is like what I imagine driving on the moon would be like - craters and all. They only have a few and I mean A FEW parking spots. The tiny strip mall didn't look promising with iron those iron doors. Anxiety started to kick in. Am I about to be let down again?\n\nThe restaurant is small and could probably seat 20 people max. The place is clean. The menu looked promising with the common Thai dishes and a few others that seemed interesting. What would normally cost $12 at other Thai restaurants, they have for $8-9. That's not saying much BUT oh my goodness is their food good! By default, I got Thai iced tea and pad Thai.\n\nScallion Pancake:\nA beefy tasting puff pastry with scallions inside. Light, airy, slightly crunchy savory appetizer you dip in sweet and sour sauce. 5\/5\n\nPad Thai with Crispy Pork:\nNormally, Thai restaurants would give you options like chicken, beef, shrimp or a combination of all 3. I like crispy pork belly may it be the Filipino version, Chinese version, Spanish version, Thai version, etc. So, when I saw crispy pork as an option, I just had to get it even though I was not really in the mood for pad Thai. Their spice level is from 1-10 (10 being the suffer the burning sensation in your mouth and the burning sensation out the next day). The pork belly was well-rendered and crispy. The pad Thai itself was piping hot and amazing. Noodles were well-coated in sauce. 5\/5\n\nThe service was great too. Not overly friendly - it was just right. I'm still blown away by the fact that we have this hidden gem in this part of town. I can't wait to go back.\n\nAs far as the parking and seating issue is concerned, you can always get food to go...or Postmates.
