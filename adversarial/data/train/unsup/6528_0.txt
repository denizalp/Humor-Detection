Actually not sure how to rate it. After waiting at the counter for 7 mins while the person at the register answered phone calls and took food out to floor ... I left.. They did acknowledge me .. But just a irritation of mine... Brick and mortar establishments ignoring customers who drive there and walk in to dine while they answer the phone calls.\nWent to the Lodge next door to a nice invite and sitting in front of a cold  tea in less than one minute..\nWill try again when I have more time to kill.  Menu looked very good-had plenty of time to look at it.
