One of my favorite coffee shops in the Valley.  If you're driving around lost looking for this place and you see a coffee shop that looks and feels like it could be set up in an old Jiffy Lube location, then pull into the parking lot because you found it!\n\nSip has a super cool and chill vibe... and expertly prepared espresso drinks!  And for a caffeine addict like myself, I love that their large espresso drinks come with four shots of espresso (a \"quad\" as they say)!  No need to pay extra $$ for those shots that I would have added anyway!\n\nFree, fast wi-fi that I have never had an issue with and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating so you will always find somewhere to plop down and be productive.  And hey, if being productive is not your thing, then wait until you see their beer board!  \n\nYou can be as unproductive as you want at Sip... just order some of the brews, veg out listening to the live music that can occasionally be found here, or just get in some good people watching at this spot that never lacks a nice crowd!\n\n*****FIVE STARS*****
