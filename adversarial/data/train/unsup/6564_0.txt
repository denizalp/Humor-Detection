I have been \"dying\" to go to the Heart Attack Grill for years, ever since they opened the now closed location in Chandler, Arizona. When I found out they opened one in Las Vegas I couldn't wait for my next trip to Sin City so I could finally risk my life by eating a burger and fries.\n\nThat day finally came!!\n\nAt the end of the Fremont Street Experience, I walked in the door and was promptly greeted by one of the sexy naughty nurses. She put a hospital gown on me and asked me where I wanted to sit. Being alone I chose to sit at the bar and be served by the doctor\/bartender. All the nurses and doctors were very nice and fun.\n\nI ordered the single bypass, not because I am a wuss by any means, but because I was in Vegas and didn't want to be in a food coma for the rest of the night. I did augment my burger with an order of \"flatliner fries\" which are cooked in pure lard.\n\nHonestly, I was a little concerned about the fries. I thought being cooked in pure lard would just make them greasy, but they were actually quite tasty. They are actual cut potatoes and not processed potato parts like most restaurants. They were definitely my favorite part of the meal.\n\nThe burger itself was good but unremarkable. I've definitely had better and I didn't particularly care for the bun. Still it wasn't bad at all.\n\nThe doctor\/bartender tried to sell me on the butterfat milkshake, but I am not a fan of buttermilk. She made me a taste of it and I didn't like it, but while it was not to my taste I could definitely see others liking it. As I said, I don't like buttermilk. If you do, you would probably like the shakes.\n\nMake no mistake though, the true appeal of this place isn't the food but rather the atmosphere. As mentioned before the staff was all very nice and fun. \n\nIf you go make sure someone in your party asks for \"pain management therapy.\" I am not going to tell you what it is, just that you definitely should have someone in your party do it, and it probably shouldn't be you. :)\n\nWould I go back? Probably not by myself and not just for the food, but if I am with others who haven't experienced it I would definitely take them there. And make one of them get the pain management therapy.\n\nFYI, about my rating. I would actually give them a 3 1\/2 star, but since yelp doesn't allow that they get the extra 1\/2 star.
