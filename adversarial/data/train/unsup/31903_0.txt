Just visited this Starbucks and ordered a Venti Matcha Green Tea and they gave it to me half full with mostly foam. When I advised Barista it felt half empty her response was it was probably a lot of foam. really!! She offered to remake it with an attitude but I had to get to work so I didn't have time. This is terrible service, I didn't pay almost $10 to get half a drink.
