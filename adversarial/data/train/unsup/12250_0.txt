I 'upgraded' from the $3 to the $6 wash. It actually was better than the $3. The one thing that bugs me about this place is 9 out of 10 times I come here, the dryer doesn't seem to work. I'm always wiping my car down. I come prepared with towels! I do like the free vacuum and large car cleaning bays. \n\n\n10\/12\/2016: \nThis time will be my last unless I'm offered a reason to come back. \nI got here at 5:45pm, didn't see a sign with hours, put my $ in machine, the man put me thru the wash, and when finished, I pulled over to vacuum only to find cones in the way. The man said \"we're closed at six.\" (It wasn't 6:00 yet) \nHe let me in to wipe down car since AGAIN the dryers weren't working correctly and use the vacuum. I felt rushed. I asked why he didn't tell me they were closing in 15 min, and he had no response. Really? Ugggh!!!!  Could it be that they wanted my $$$?????? Wow. Really bad
