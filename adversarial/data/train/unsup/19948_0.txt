Chat chat chat chat chat. Maybe more conversation. Maybe some more talking during relaxation. That's all my masseur did. I don't super want to talk about my tattoos or my injuries while on the massage table; I want you to relieve the tension in my neck. \n\nI was also super pressured to join their club, which I suppose I should know better. I won't be back, even though their massage club seems like the best deal of all the massage clubs. No thanks.
