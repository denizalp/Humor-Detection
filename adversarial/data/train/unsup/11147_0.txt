Superb. If you find yourself walking down Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill with unsettling nasties from that lox and cream cheese omelette you ate ten minutes prior, look no further than the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, Squirrel Hill Edition. \n\nThe public restrooms in the CLPSQHLL are beautifully decorated with all the modern touches. The tiling work - breathtaking. And the orange shade of paint is unexpected but really, so chic. \n\nI felt right at home in the toilet stalls as I vomited the Uncle L.E.O (Lox, Eggs and Onions, FYI) Omelette right back into the universe. The stall size is pretty accommodating for such practice and the toilet seats are clean as a whistle - just waiting for you to wet your whistle!!! You'll find no other bathroom users will bother you in the process. In fact, a small French child may crouch down beneath the stall door to ask if you are okay being sprawled across the floor of the bathroom. \n\nIf you are feeling too ill to walk, rest your food poisoned body in one of the many luxurious leather lounges available, over looking a gorgeous view of the Murray Avenue Rite Aid. Don't mind the other library goers, they are too busy reading their graphic novels or Yahoo News to notice the possible vomit on your person. Just sleep it off until a librarian gently nudges you awake, because the library is closing in five minutes.
