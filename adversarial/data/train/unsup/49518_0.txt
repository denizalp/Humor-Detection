Came here for dinner with a couple friends. It was a nice day so we sat out on the patio. It's a laid back place just off Yonge street. Service was a bit slow and inattentive. Food was good, but could've been a bit hotter (temperature wise). They could've thrown a few more shrimps on their dishes (only 2 on the Pad Thai). Gratuities added to the bill automatically.
