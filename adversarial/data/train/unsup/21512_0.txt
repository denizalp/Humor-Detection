The bbq here is pretty good, but that has been documented well by others. My favorite thing on the menu is actually the fried chicken. It's a HUGE boneless breast that is breaded in a yummy coating and although it is fried, it is not a big greasy blob. It comes with two sides, but they suggest one be the mashed potatoes and gravy. The mash is really quite good. There is a hint of spice in there that is unexpected and nice.  My only gripe is that they serve the gravy on top of the fried chicken and I have never understood why you would drench something crispy in anything that is going to eventually turn everything to a gooey mess.  The flavor is great. Just put it on the side.\n\nThe free donuts are a nice touch, but nothing special, so save the calories and get the banana pie\/pudding thing. The crust is made of crushed nuts, which is then topped with a substantial layer of bannana pudding. All of this is then topped with carmelized bananas and drizzled in carmel. YUMMO!!\n\nAnd if you like their macaroni and cheese (which IMHO) is heavenly cheesy goodness, skip it as a side and order a quart to go instead.  You will get about 8 to 10 side servings for around $6.50 and that is a HUGE savings over the sides price.\n\nPut your walking shoes on for the hike you will need to burn off the calories and just know going in that you have to through your diet out the window for one good meal.
