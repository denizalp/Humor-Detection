I'm so used to getting ripped off by repair shops that I expect it.  I'm also so used to bad or indifferent service that I expect it.  I found Coraopolis Collision and Repair via Yelp and thought for sure the two reviews had to be written by paid reviewers.\n\nNope.\n\nI am now a fan.\n\nIt is the first time in my life (I've been a car owner for 25 years) that I've walked out of a repair shop feeling guilty for paying so little.  I will describe my experience.\n\nMonday:  \n\nCar is completely dead in my driveway.  Call AAA.  They ask where they should plan on towing the car.  I tell them the local dealership where I always go.  I call the dealership to give them a heads up.  Dealership informs me that they can't get me in, even for a simple battery swap, until Thursday.  No suggested alternatives.  I'm used to this. \n\nI check Yelp for repair shops near me.  Coraopolis Collision and Repair pops up.  5 stars.  Hmmm.  Can't be.  I call.  After one ring, a very friendly voice answers the phone.  I tell him my situation.  He says he'd be happy to take in the car and he could get started right away.  AAA arrives.  Turns out they could jump it.  Either way, I wanted a new battery, and the car was due for a lot of other work (new tires, timing belt change, oil change, state inspection, etc.).  So I drove it there.\n\nI meet the friendly voice.  It is the owner, Tom Kehoe.  He not only takes the car and cheerfully tells me he can handle everything I need (including new tires...got four General Grabber HTS' at the same price as TireRack.com!), but offers to give me a ride to wherever I need to go!  Seriously?  Given that the job would take a few days, I needed to rent a car, so I waited in his nice waiting room (flat screen TV!) for my wife to take me to Enterprise.\n\nTuesday:\n\nI check on the car.  All is done but the inspection.  The dead battery added a wrinkle that extended my car's stay at the shop.  I asked if he could get done by early afternoon on Wednesday so I wouldn't get charged an extra day by Enterprise.  He said, \"I forgot to tell you, I could have rented you a car for $15\/day (to just cover his costs).  Sorry about that!\"  Next time, I will be renting from Tom.\n\nWednesday:\n\nMy car wasn't ready by my Enterprise rental cutoff time, but he personally met me at Enterprise with a nice car from his fleet that he let me use on the house until my car would be ready later that afternoon.  He saved me $50 on another day's rental.  He called shortly thereafter saying my car was ready.  He asked if there was anything else he could do.  My radio was locked because of the loss of the battery.  I needed to input a code from Honda (which I misplaced).  Tom called the Honda dealership on my behalf and got the radio working again.  He wrote the code in my owners' manual in case I need it again.  No charge for that service.  Also, when I picked the car up, it was sparkling clean, inside and out.  \n\nThe price was ridiculously low compared with what I'm used to.  Especially considering the first class service.  Don't let the spartan-looking building fool you.  Coraopolis Collision and Repair is a top notch shop with white glove service.  \n\nTom, if you read this, thanks again!!!
