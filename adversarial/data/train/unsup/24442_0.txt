Rules to go by if you are considering to come by here:\n\n1. Don't ever ever come here on a day that is hot. Nope. Don't even try. I think I almost had a heat stroke walking on the brick trail with a stroller in tow.\n\n2. If you're not into an all cacti arrangement, this place is not for you. That's all they HAVE. Don't be surprised. The Butterfly Exhibit only have monarchs. I was hoping for something a little more special than that, at least some swallowtails, come on!\n\n3. The admission is $18 for adults now. Luckily I am a student and students are $10 to get in. Bring your student ID's, people! $3.50 additional to get into the Butterfly exhibit.\n\n4. The place is very very well kept, clean, and have tours and staff that know what they're talking about.\n\n5. The Great Pumpkin Festival makes it more worth you're money to come in the fall time, (the entrance fee for the festival is free with the garden admission). Plus, all the arts and crafts, games, hayride, petting zoo, and 1 pumpkin is free to take home. Food, drinks, and pony rides are not free obviously.\n\nThis pretty much sums it up!
