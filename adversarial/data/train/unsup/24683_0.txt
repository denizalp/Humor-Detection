First time and it looked incredible. I usually like to reserve reviews for when I've gone a few times but we were really hot and cold on this one. You order your food on a line, and someone is taking your order before you even get to the register, and writing it on a paper bag. They give you an order number and call it when your items are ready. I didn't like that the salads and sandwiches were picked up in different places. They were using a speaker to call the numbers for sandwiches, but for salads they were just calling out, and we couldn't hear a thing since we were clear across the restaurant. \n\nThe food itself was a mixed bag for us. My husband liked his Italian Steak sandwich. The crinkle cut fries were simple and good. I absolutely despised my apple walnut chicken salad. The chicken was chewy, and COLD. \n\nI should go back and try a burger or a dog, and maybe I will on a future visit, but I don't want to spend anymore time here this weekend since the salad was so disappointing.
