As an avid Starbucks drinker, I rarely venture from my usual Starbucks Americano. However, this morning I decided to break tradition and give the new place a try. \n\nI was puzzled when I scanned the menu board and noticed that the Americano appeared to come in only one size - small (12 oz). At a price tag of $3, I naturally assumed that this must be a very special cup of coffee - to command a premium such as this. \n\nI inquired about the feasibility of obtaining a larger size, to which the barista obliged - for a whopping $5.50. Now I knew for sure I was in for a life-changing cup of coffee. At more than double the cost of my beloved Starbucks Americano, there was no way that I would be disappointed...\n\n...or so I thought. This particular specimen lacked the trademark smooth finish that I've come to expect from a Caffe Americano. In its stead, a foul, almost sour finish that got far worse as the beverage cooled. After the third sip, it went right in the trash. $5.50 definitely NOT well-spent; and I won't be back.
