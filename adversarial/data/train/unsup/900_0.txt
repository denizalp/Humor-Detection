Howard and the Heartwood Tree Care team was amazing to work with! I couldn't have asked for better service from him and his team and was very impressed....very knowledgeable and great to work with!\n\nWe are selling our house and needed to have a tree removed from the side of our home. He came out and provided me with a quote the same day that I had called and walked me through exactly how he'd be removing the tree.  Since it was so close to the house I had my concerns but he graciously took the time to explain how he'd ensure it would be safely removed.  Howard and team came out, removed the tree exactly as they said and I couldn't be happier with the completed job.
