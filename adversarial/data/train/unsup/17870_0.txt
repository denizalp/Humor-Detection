(This Portion Is For The Starbucks) Seriously the best customer service I have experienced in the valley, anywhere. The manager of this Starbucks (I believe it is Dominic) is extremely nice, asks questions in a genuine fashion to actually engage you in conversation and is equally friendly with every patron.\n\nThey always make the drinks correctly the first time, I get a bonus freebie shot every now-and-again and always leave with a smile on my face.\n\nI will choose this location over the one on Priest\/Elliot any day!!\n\nAs for the Safeway, they have extremely friendly, helpful staff. Great produce. Huge product offering. Clean store. Quick checkout. No qualms with the grocery store AND they always have book drives and bake sales for muscular dystrophy!\n\n2-for-1!
