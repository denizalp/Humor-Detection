I'm happy to say that TJ's has been a part of my life since there was a T and a J running the joint -- in excess of twenty years!\n\nThere are hundreds of reasons to shop at TJ's; the breakfast sausage is better than any pre-packaged sausage you'll get anywhere else, the bacon is unbelievable, the lunch meats are terrific, and the steaks and chops are top notch. But the deal-breaker here are the smokies. They're so delicious, I keep a pound on hand at all times, just so that when I do get a craving for them, I've got one or two or three to eat. Don't miss the eclectic seasonings, the pre-portioned and frozen burgers, and their collection of small producer's potato chips.\n\nThe sandwiches steal the show, too. With at least thirty to choose from, you could eat one a day for a month, and not repeat one. Well, unless it's July, September, April or December. Or October. But, whatever. That repeated sandwich will be worth it.
