No, I've never gotten a DUI, nor do I routinely drive in a way that 'violates' the law, but on one fateful morning when there was not a single other car on the road at 7:00am Johnny Law decided to pull me over for a \"rolling-stop\" and then tack on an additional fine for failing to turn into the nearest lane, instead merging into the second lane over so that I could make a left turn at the next street.  While I personally believe I made a complete stop there is really no way to argue with someone at the end of their shift (clearly hoping to make a DUI arrest given his line of obnoxious and persistent questioning) and as such I simply took my ticket, said my apologies, and went about my day...until the trumped up $476 charge appeared on the Clerk of Courts website leading me to contact Traffic Ticket Defenders - the end result a dismissal of the second citation, no points, no traffic school, and a total savings of $150 even after lawyers fees.\n\nAt first a little tricky to communicate with given delays in the court system and issues with scheduling all told my experience was very positive and I'd gladly use the service again, though it is my sincere hope that the Metro Police will find more creative ways to spend their time than harassing tourists (which I was, at that time) for questionable infractions on uninhabited streets in the future.
