Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Had the spicey tortilla soup, which was excellent with fresh veggies, a craft beer from Seattle in an ice cold glass, and the 9 oz steak with whipped potatoes and more fresh veggies. Everything was excellent!\n\nEven gave us dessert on the house, great cheesecake!
