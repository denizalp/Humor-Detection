O.k. I've been to Teharu twice and each time had a completely different experience. We went on Memorial Day weekend and it was not busy. There was a large variety of food and sushi types rolling down the conveyor belt.  We went 2 weekends ago and completely different. It was busy and we were seated on the far end so the conveyor belt took a while to get to us.  There was little variety to be had with the sushi. Lots of water\/milk\/juice etc. going by.  Service is decent and the price can't be beat but a little variety with the sushi would make me come back.
