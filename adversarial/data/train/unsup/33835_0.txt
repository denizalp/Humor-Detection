Honestly, this is one of the best places when it comes to service. Kelsie and Chelsea have both been really nice and accommodating. \n\nThe food is pretty good too. The nachos ($14) and nacho fries ($17) are SOO good and huge portion too! The BBQ burger ($18) is also a great choice. Yeah, it's pricey but it's Vegas and right by the pool. \n\nThe Bloody Mary was boooomb and strong. I was pretty tipsy after the 24oz. The blue slushee (blueberry something) is the best one out of all of them. $24 for 24oz with souvenirs cup and then $17 for refill. The liquid drinks are waaaay stronger than the cocktails though. You'll get more bang for your buck that way. \n\nWe always have a great time when we come here, and will continue to come time and time again! No pictures since we didn't bring phones to the pool :(
