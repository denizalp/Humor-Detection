I dont frequently go to eat here, not that there's anything wrong with it, but it's not an elite restaurant. I would usually go here and get the 'endless' bowls, but on my last trip, they got rid of it and moved to small, medium, and large sized bowls. The pricing for what you get is also higher than it used to be. Before the switch to the sized bowls, I'd give it four stars. After all this, I would still recommend this place
