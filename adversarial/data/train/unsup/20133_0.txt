Lychee Slushie Boba. Extra Boba and Lychee Jelly. My standard mantra as I enter Veggie Delight.\n\nOne of the only purely vegetarian establishments in Las Vegas, Veggie Delight is the savior of our weekly \"what do we eat tonight?\" predicament. Their Vietnamese sandwiches (pork chop, crispy chicken and spicy chicken) are amazing. They come in soft french bread and have mayo (or vegenaise), soy meat (trust me, it's good here) and a little pickled salad of sorts with cucumber, cilantro and carrots on it. It's a very filling and satisfying sandwich. They've started to offer their sandwiches as part of a lunch special. About 5 bucks for a sandwich, soup and hot\/cold tea. Very very reasonable. \n\nYes, this is not a ritzy place. It's actually very far from that. The staff here is seriously challenged with grasping the English Language and the menu ...not at all appetizing. But voila....the food they come up with is amazing, consistent and very satiating. Service is efficient (remember the language barrier but pointing to pictures on the menu helps lots).\n\nOur favorites are the following:\n\nVietnamese Faux Crispy Chicken\/Pork Chop\/Spicy Chicken Sandwiches\n\nBasil Faux Chicken\n\nTaiwanese Faux Beef Noodle Soup\n\nFaux Pork Skin Hand Rolls\n\nFaux Spicy Chicken. \n\nAll in all, this is a great everyday meal solution. Not too heavy, expensive or pretentious. And of course, their Lychee Boba is to die for. Remember to order it the way I do (See above).
