Puppies are very crowded and expensive!!!\nI did purchase a puppy which had been there at least 2 months, I offered them less than asking and they took it! BUT! My puppy has giardia, he is on meds now! But will need another round of meds due to severe case! I was told petland is famous for this type of thing!
