First off...  I usually reserve using yelp for restaurants I really like and try to keep things positive.  This is the exception.  I feel so...  violated.\n\nI am also a person who went on a Groupon.  It was given to me from my dad.  We went to Bravo Bistro excited based on the few things we had read.  Thats what groupons are great for right...?  to try new things.\n\nThe waitress was very nice, in fact, the service was just fine.\n\nIt was the food.  We looked over the menu, listened to the specials....  and everything sounded great.  We decided to get the \"Chefs Cheese Plate\" as a light appetizer before the Heavy main course was due.  \n\nI am not sure who \"chef\" Tony is...  but the cheese plate was described simply as \"Selection cheeses, fruits, nuts, crackers\" \n\n- Fine, sounds simple and tasty.  Now I am thinking or envisioning in my head was a few artisan cheeses...  some almonds, simple fruits and nice crafted crackers....  What we got, and this pretty much set the stage for continuing disappointment, was what looked like a cheese plate one would get from Safeway.   Seriously...  Long sliced wedges of PepperJack and American Cheddar...  with two strawberries cut in half and not a single nut to be found.   The crackers were one variety of the most generic kind.  Terrible.    \n\nI didn't even really know what to think.  I don't normally send things back or cause a fuss, so I endured through it.  This should have served as a warning...  a very obvious warning.\n\nI boldly ordered the Cioppino.  When it came it looked great...  when it entered my mouth it...  didn't taste like anything.  Totally bland.  edible, but bland...  I don't normally ask how much the special is when The waitress is done describing them...   I think it is tacky...  but this time it might have been a good idea.  I paid $36 for the worst Cioppino I have ever had.\n\nNeedless to say, we skipped desert.  I guess we learned our lesson.\n\nTotal bill for total sh*t and 3 glasses of Chianti...  $98.  Yep, that is 2 entr√©es, a totally crappy cheese plate and 3 house Chiantis...  $98.  I was absolutely floored and furious.  \n\nThis place sucks, do NOT go there. \n\nI don't even feel better after writing this.
