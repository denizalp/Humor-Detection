Just had my blinds and shutters installed in my new home. Not only was the price incredibly affordable, but Larry and his son Cory are polite, easy going, and straight forward. There's was no up-selling or showing me things I didn't want. When I asked questions, they gave me straight answers. It's nice to know there are family businesses out there that just know how to take care of their customers. By the way, the plantation shutters are awesome and my only regret is that I didn't put them in all my windows. At least I know what I want for Christmas!
