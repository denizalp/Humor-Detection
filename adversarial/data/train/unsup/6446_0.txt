When you schedule meetings at coffee shops or choose local brunches based purely on whether or not they carry these holy bread halos, you know they're good. \n\nThe Cleveland Bagel Company is still rockin' it without the store front, but I promise you it doesn't keep even the laziest person from seeking their bagels out at local shops. I'm not ashamed to admit I've checked 4 coffee shops once, only to find them sold out at each one. That's how effing ridiculous these things are. \n\nHandcrafted, chewy inside, killer outside crunch, amazing flavor. Even the plain bagel can be eaten just straight up and blow your mind. However, their everything bagel is my everything. And I'm pretty sure I already mentioned their cheddar chive cream cheese is life-changing in my previous review. \n\nAnd yes... I scheduled a meeting today at a coffee shop I knew carried CLE Bagel Co. just to see if I could get my hands on one. I took home the last two. I got lucky.
