I used to eat here at least once a week when I worked in the area, at LEAST once a week.  My go to items were as follows;  Red Chili burrito W\/ beans (enchilada style), Machaca burrito, Machaca plate, Red Machaca burrito, Tamale and Enchilada plate, Two Taco plate, Chicken Tostadas, Green Chili combo....  Basically the whole menu.  Now that I think about it, my Carolinas fandom was probably the single greatest contributing factor to my ever expanding waistline.  It is not the best Mexican food evarr, but it is pretty damn good.
