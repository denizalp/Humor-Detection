I absolutely loved this salon for over 1 year, went every week to have my hair blow dried and flat ironed. Over the past 3 months huge changes have occurred and there has been significant staff overturn. This did not disrupt my appointments and everyone remained friendly and upbeat.\nHowever when I went to my scheduled appointment and was sitting at the sink, I was told effective immediately the cost of my treatment had increased $20!! The stylist claimed that the increase was fair and just as per the manager and reflected the time and product to use on my hair ($40 to $60).\nNow I agree that things do increase in price, and I do agree my hair had grown BUT is the proper time to tell someone this at the sink?\nNo, they could have told me 1) when I booked the appointment or 2) when they called to confirm. I was offered to speak to the manager...but he wasn't available. I have not returned nor will I return to this location. Can you imagine telling any client of a price increase effective immediately? WOW!\n(I waited 1 month to post because as you can imagine I was MAD) Hope someone finds this helpful.
