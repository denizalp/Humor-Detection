We gave Gaetano's 2 tries. We thought the first time was a fluke. We were wrong.\nThis time around, the service was below average and the food was nothing special. We could have spent less and had more flavor at Carrabba's.\nI ordered the lasagna. It was a nice size portion, but the sauce was very watery. \nMy husband ordered the special, chicken and asparagus risotto. It was extremely bland....we were trying to spice it up by scooping up my watered-down sauce onto it. We would have liked to try some fresh mozzarella or parmersean on it, but our server only checked on us about a minute after we got our food. We never saw him again until it was time for the check. \n\nWe really wanted to like this place since it's got a great ambiance and is so close to our house. But we won't be back.
