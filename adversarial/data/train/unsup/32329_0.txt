We just wanted a place to eat dinner tonight and it was between pub food or whatever else we felt like at the moment.\n\nI've walked by here numerous times but mexican food is usually on the bottom of my list (thought the drinks are about the top of my list).\n\nGreat attentive service by the sole server.  We ordered:\n\n1 frozen margarita\n1 Michelada (beer + hot sauce + lime) \n1 fish ceviche\n1 Tasting Platter (Chicken enchilada, beef burrito & choice of quesadilla or tamalito on the side)\n\nWe were served a basket of complimentary tortilla chips and salsa.  This is my favourite item to eat at the start of the meal.  The chips are thin and delicious.  Not rough and thick like a Dorito chip.\n\nOur drinks and mains came in great time.\n\nI don't think I've ever had a bad margarita!  I wish I could have had 5 more.  The Michelada (I believe that's what it was called on the menu) was a great spicy, almost carbonated mix.  I can take spicy but it was the spicy that gets you in your throat!  Excellent!  All these would be SO great on a hot summer day.\n\nThe ceviche was presented nicely on a bed of romaine lettuce with tortillas.  I have had other south american ceviches but not mexican.  Seemed like it was the same salsa sauce that came with our initial basket of tortillas with added ingredients and avocados.  Still quite delicious.\n\nThe tasting platter was pleasing because we got to sample so many items on the menu.  Also came with a tortilla bowl of refried beans and cheese on top.  Delicious large chunks of beef in the burrito.  Perfect amount of stringy hot cheese on the enchilada.\n\nMy only thought is... why is mexican food always so expensive?  Entrees are average $17 and up.  And usually consists of a corn product, cheese, sauce and a bit of meat.\n\nThis place must be rammed during Pride!  It's the perfect place to wet your parched  whistle!
