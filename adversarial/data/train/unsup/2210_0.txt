About time I've updated my review! The whole family goes here now (Mom & me for gel mani & pedi, Daddy for pedicure for diabetes) We are all beyond satisfied & we all are picky as hell :))\n\nAnna does my nails, to give you an idea of how AMAZING she is: a gel mani survived Tough Mudder (two weeks in) with one crack. My body was cut up from head to toe, but my nails were bomb. Theresa does Mom's nails, and has such an attention to detail; really helping Mom to look and feel pretty. Paul & Duke round out the dedicated and talented family\/crew who define going above and beyond customer service. Really. Sweet, on point and friendly small business owners: the EXACT \"find\" Yelp is all about. \n\nOff the beaten path, nestled within Sun City in the CVS car park. If you come during breakfast\/lunch, stop by the Sun City Cafe across the street. Daddy had been going to a high end Spa for 10 years & went because his tech retired. He loved his results and the staff, and he is reluctant to change. \n\nCouldn't recomend them enough, worth seeking out! Thanks for being so kind and caring...it is appreciated!
