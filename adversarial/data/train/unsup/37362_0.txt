I always pass this place and thought their slogan was hilarious. Plastered on all the signage is the phrase \"Fresh My Farm.\" I don't know exactly what this means, I'm assuming it means the food is fresh from the farm but \"Fresh My Farm\" just always tickled my funny bone. Today I happened to pass by while extremely hungry & I noticed a very faded \"World Famous Fried Squash\" on the sign & I LOVE fried squash so I decided to stop in. Wow. Omg. It was like a joke how scary and run down this place was. There was a back dining room with a sign that said closed but it was still visible & omg was it disturbing. I have some admittedly low standards & expectations but this interior of this place literally startled me. The ceiling is covered in stains, mold & holes & is falling through in many places. There were inexplicable dusty stacks of thick binders on a table. There was a bunch of dry wall lookin stuff just sitting on a table. I guess it had fallen from the ceiling & just been left. I am brave though & I was hungry so I decided to order anyways. The young woman who took my order was unbelievably bubbly, sweet & informative. She is the only reason I am giving two stars. Her personality was so radiant & her good service made me temporarily forget the horrendous surroundings. Unfortunately, the food tasted like the restaurant looked. Sad. Not \"Fresh My Farm\" at all. The squash was not seasoned & left a bad feeling in my stomach after a couple pieces. I have a stomach of steel so this is concerning. I have a bunch left & unfortunately they'll probably be going in the trash. I'd feed them to my pet rats but I don't want them to get stomach aches like I did.
