Dr Michaels was my doctor until 2007 when I moved to CO with my husband who was military at the time. After several years of enduring treatment with miltary doctors who rushed you and acted like you were wasting their time by being there, I knew when we came home to Vegas, Dr Michaels would be my PCP again. She has always been patient, she listens to you, and it feels like she cares about you as a patient. The office staff has always been friendly and efficient. And there is a Quest lab in office for added concenience. I would recommend this office to anyone in Vegas, as I know good medical care is in fact difficult to find here.
