DaYung, here's to the start of a brew-tea-ful friendship! *clinks boba glasses*\n\nFirst of all, service here is pretty great. The lady at the register was friendly and talkative.  She even gave us a sample of the Strawberry Fresh Milk and it was amazing! If it wasn't so heavy on milk, I would probably get this. Instead, we took advantage of their grand opening special of BOGO boba milk tea. After tax, I paid $4.05 for two drinks. Gotta love drink specials! \n\nThe milk tea itself was pretty good. It's not quite as heavy and rich like the Hong Kong style milk tea where they use condense milk but is instead much lighter. I love the small boba they use here.  Did I accidentally swallow a couple when I was chugging down my drink?  You betcha! But what doesn't kill you makes you stronger... or something. \n\nI recommend the tomato smoothie with aloe vera. It's not savory like a Bloody Mary but it tastes more like sweet cherry tomatoes. The aloe vera has no flavor so it's more like chewing on tomato meat.
