Exceptional Burger! Meat was perfectly charcoal-broiled with a just slightly crispy, crunchy edge, and juicy, steaky flavor, sitting on top of a generous layering of dressing, followed by shredded lettuce, 2 Beefsteak tomatoes, diced, grilled onion if you prefer, and perfectly melted thick-sliced cheese. Can't stuff it in your gullet fast enough! The oil used for frying has got to be changed often, because the fries come out with a perfect snap everytime. Prices are very fair. Portions very generous. Service is exemplary. One of the Best Burgers I've ever tasted!
