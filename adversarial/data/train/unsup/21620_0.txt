Shrimp and Baja fish tacos were delightful. To die for. Like you would fight your grandpa over the last one. So delicious that it didn't matter that there were barely any surfaces to place your tacos on (very limited seating but quaint). I'd just stand there with the taco in my hands while the spicy sauce dripped down my face, devouring it like a person who hadn't seen food in lifetimes. It was that good.\n\nI travel 1 hour + 45 minutes on bus, subway, and streetcar just to eat this once a week. I come from a faraway land of Taco Bells and Tim Hortons. I pledge allegiance to Seven Lives!
