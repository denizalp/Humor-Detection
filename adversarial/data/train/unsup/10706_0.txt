Spend $500,000 to \"buy\" a unit, $600 in association fees and having to spend $30\/night when I stay in my own unit I just spent 1\/2 million dollars on?  Plus then when I'm not in my unit, I have to put my belongings in a locker so Vdara can rent the unit I 'purchased' for $500,000 on as a hotel and have the Clampetts who are getting \"my\" condo for $55\/night off of Priceline?\n\nSad, sad, sad and so \"pre bust\" mentality.
