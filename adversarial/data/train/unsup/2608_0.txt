Free open wifi and ton of outlets! \n\nMaple Library though may not be modern and chic but still a great place to just chill and get some work done. \n\nNoise level can be a little high because of the acoustic of the cave like space. \n\nFurniture looks depressed and worn out... Maybe it is time for an update? \n\nIf you want some privacy, there are some private cubicles on the left. A better option than the communal tables. \n\nPlenty of parking....
