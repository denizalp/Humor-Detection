This place has great food and a nice atmosphere.  However, the music is so loud.  Why does the music have to be so loud?  You go out to converse with your friends and family.  Not to get a headache and sore throat from screaming.  And the service....Oh my, horrific!! They have a lot of workers, but who knows what they are doing, because they are not waiting on you.  If you are in a hurry or want to talk with your friends, this place is not for you!  And it's sad because the food is good.
