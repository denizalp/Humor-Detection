I live very close so I went for the convenience originally. I really like the ambiance, the employees and the color selection they provide. I am very picky about where I go for manicures but a good pedicure is so hard to find! This place gives the BEST massage I've ever received! I am very happy with every service I've received from them thus far. Tiffany was my technician today, you should definitively ask for her!! It's quiet, relaxing, clean and new!
