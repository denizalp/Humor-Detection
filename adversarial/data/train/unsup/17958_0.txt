We stayed on a Monday night for $30.23 (Used a Groupon deal 15.68\/night and 14.55 resort fee) It also came with a coupon book.\n\n- Not very many people come here apparently. We got parking right next to the hotel!\n- Upon check in, the black guy at front desk says, \"so are you gonna be like him and give me a hard time too? Complain about the $100 deposit!\" LOL. \"You know I ain't got my readers on, Go head and read me your address!\" Come on now...\n- \"Oh no more king rooms available. I'll put you in 2 queens.\" WTF.\n- Coupon book came with 1 play of free bowling. $3.75 for shoe rental. \n- Horrible fitness center. 2 treadmills but only one working. The tread of the one that is working is coming apart! fail. \n- Hotel room like Palace Station. 3 Star. Great view of a wall! YAY! \n- I agree with Tera, I have ATT and had poor reception at the hotel. \n- Don't play blackjack here. 6:5 6 deck. boo. \n- We ate the Grand Cafe at midnight and got the $1.99 special. Great value.
