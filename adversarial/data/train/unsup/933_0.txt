For the location and price it seemed like a good idea. Food is very mediocre and service is terrible. What was supposed to be 15 minutes, ended up being a half hour. As we placed the order, the guy overcharged or got it wrong. Also, he was very rude. I highly advise using cash, as they use their computer for cards. Which seemed sketchy, as it is a website for the payment. The food was greasy, over cooked and mediocre. Pizza was decent, pastas and wings were over cooked.
