VIBE \nI don't really eat in Chinatown. Why? Rats. My biggest fear. I don't dig the rats (not that there's people out there saying, \"WHOA. I love me some rats with my Chinese food.\" Or rapping  \"Rats Rats Rats Raa Raaa Raaattss!\"  ( I think this needs to be made into a Portlandia episode Toronto style). \n\nBut yeah, call it prejudiced or stereotypical, it's why I mainly avoid eating at these restaurants. And we ALL know that Blog TO exclusive that went out years and years ago. That said, I've been to Swatow and New Ho King and I dig it. Mother's Dumplings is no exception. I thought I was going to find a hole in the wall and it's quite a spacious restaurant now. Nice and clean but totally keeps that Chinatown vibe, where you get to see the people working on the side making the dumplings. \n\nWe had a good solid hour here and it was fine -you know, just don't come here if you're in a rush. My server learned it was my first time here and she told me all of her favourites with much fervor. It was so nice! \n\nA perfect Saturday lunch! \n\n\nWE ATE \nThe food was really, really great! \nWe got 10 bok choy, mushroom and tofu dumplings. They did not taste like vegetarian dumplings at all. (Note:next time beef and chive!). Love all of that flavour. We also had the wonton soup - the parsely really brought out the flavour and the wonton gave us that protein factor. My friend, Vicki, couldn't stop eating it. She loves it that much! \nThe potato pancake has chive in it too and it's worth the $3.50! \nYou also get complimentary tea along with your meal. \n\nAll of this for two people (and we were quite stuffed) came up to $20. Are you kidding me?!  Geez.  Now this is on my top cheap eats in Toronto. I walk around this area a lot and it's funny the places you don't notice and what's behind the closed doors. Right? Right! \n\n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK \nI keep on calling this place \"Mother\" Dumplings. And this places gots dumps like a truck truck -- oh come on, you know you want to sing the Thong Song too. Did I just date myself?
