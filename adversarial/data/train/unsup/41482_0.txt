I dare you to not fall in love with these tacos. If you like a larger menu and a lot of Mexican options- this isn't the place for you.  Just tacos and chips\/salsa\/queso for dinner, but that's because they're so tasty, with so many variations; there's no need to have a three page menu. Super fun decor and tasty drinks to top it off.  The downsides- long wait times on prime nights (of course), not-so-friendly hostesses, and service on the slower side.  I've always had pretty friendly servers, but I'm not overly impressed with service in general here, but nothing super negative. Every time I have brought a friend from out-of-town; they've been very impressed too, so overall, a local gem.
