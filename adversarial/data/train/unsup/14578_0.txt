Just okay for my taste, the one thing I do like is that you can go crazy with what you decide you want to have them cook up for ya!! \nYou simply, pick your choice of meat, choice of seasoning, veggies, sauce and starch and you hand it over to the cook, that then they heat it up for you in their gigantic grill and TA DA, it is all ready for you to enjoy!!\nThe one thing that I honestly don't really like is the price, it could definitely be adjusted, it is a bit over-priced for the portioned you get and that is without a drink, if they included your drink of choice then I would then be content!!
