not connected to the airport..connected to only a limited number of stops...mgm to sls with the convention center between...stops in the far rear of some of the hotels like bally's, flamingo, harrah's, etc...quite a walk from the strip and through the hotels to get to the station in the far back...seriously took a long time...probably would have been faster just to walk along the strip..monorail runs far behind the strip, so no views except of the giant ferris wheel...and, getting off and walking back to the strip is another journey....$5 single ride, $12 24-hour, $22 2-day, $28 3-day and goes up to 7-day passes for $56...$1 for nevada residents...not convenient (unless the destination happens to be the far back the hotel stops like mgm arena)...expensive...take the cab if in a group or use the slow deuce bus for $6 2-hour or $8 24-hour...
