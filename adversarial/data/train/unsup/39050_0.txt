I really enjoy stopping in this bakery, however, I must agree with several of the other people that the employees behind the counter are not that friendly. They seem impatient if you want to browse or if you ask questions. I have liked almost everything I have tasted. I do wish they had smaller portions of some of the pastry items though.
