This hospital actually deserves two reviews.  One for the hospital itself....antiquated, small rooms, uncomfortable and outdated OR's, recovery rooms and patient rooms.  Beds are uncomfortable and some machinery doesn't work (my call button broke one day).  Generally awful, though I had a great view of the lake.  I had no choice as the Cleveland Clinic surgeon working on me works out of there.  Having a choice, there would be several other hospitals I would choose first and I'm frankly shocked that the Clinic hasn't begun updating this place yet.\n     However, my experience with the staff was fantastic.  Unlike other hospitals I've seen, I had absolutely nothing but positive experiences with EVERY member of the staff, from nurses, doctors and the like down to the housekeeping people.  They were all respectful, polite and very helpful, as well as very good at their jobs.  Now, if they could just be put into a decent facility!
