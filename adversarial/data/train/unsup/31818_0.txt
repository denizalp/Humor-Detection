Got a cheap rate for a Sunday night so I stayed there on my way through town. Given that I was there by myself, I wasn't sure which bathroom to use or which room to be in cuz i had more space than i certainly needed. It was more suitable for a weekend with friends. But having said that, I can't imagine paying more than $200 a night for a room here as the rates here get RIDICULOUS for what you get. Spa closed at 8, so wasn't able to take advantage of my free admission. The wayfinding here is aweful as there are barely any signs to help you figure things out. Ended up walking by the lounges and it was full of posers, but I don't think they were lost like I was. Great room if you can get a great rate.. otherwise, better bang for your buck elsewhere on the strip.
