Yelp Elite Event, I do love them, especially when I can get into one. Well technically I got in as a +1, thanks to James C, but anyways I got in! \n\nDonuts and beer!? That sounds like an odd pairing. I don't think I've ever tried them both together before but here we are at an event pairing them together. It actually works. So the donuts were from Donut Bar and the beers were from CraftHaus Brewery. Everyone was served 5 whole donuts with their beer pairings. Yea 5 whole donuts not samples.  Whoever finished them all probably had trouble sleeping that night. I know I did.  My favorite was probably the pumpkin cream cheese donut with double red IPA. All of them were tasty though. I might have to start pairing donuts and beer at home.\n\nI'm not gonna lie I really didn't know to many people at this event but you know how I am, I made a few new friends. Table shoutout to the table peeps James C, Daniel S, Ayesha A and her sister. \n\nGlad our new CM, Jennifer, finally got to meet me. Welcome to the LV Yelp community and keep it up. We have to work on those hugs though. Great event in Henderson. Thanks Yelp, Jennifer, CraftHaus, and Donut Bar.
