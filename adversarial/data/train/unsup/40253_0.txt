Got a great deal on a set of brand new tires from Anthony. It's not a big shop like the chains with 5 bays, lifts, and a fancy waiting room but I was thoroughly impressed by the service I received. My car was worked on immediately as soon as I showed up by 2 guys who were professional and friendly (in fact, one was just a kid, looked to be college aged, and I was really impressed with how well-spoken and mature he was) and it was done in no time at all, like 15-20 minutes. Brand New, Brand Name tires for half the price of anywhere else, insanely fast service, and they give you a 1 year warranty - though I can't speak to how good that is since I just got the tires yesterday. \n\nI don't think you can ask much more from an independent tire shop and I'll be referring all my friends there because I browsed their inventory and it's really impressive. Brand new or nearly new take-offs for 40-60% less than the big chains. Anthony seems like a really nice guy too. A+
