I came here on a Busy Mother's Day for dinner with reservations. We were greeted by the front desk had to wait about 5 minutes for our table, we were seated upstairs and sat at a nice quiet table in back of the restaurant. There is one large buffet area with soups, rice, salads, veggies and sauces. Our server took our drink order and allowed us to get up and get our side items. Once we sat down a bowl of cheese bread rolls, fried bananas, Yucca fries were delivered to the table with another horse radish looking cream dip. The meats started to come by and we gladly accepted the options. Garlic steak, flank steak, salmon, sausages, bacon wrapped chicken, filet, bbq ribs and grilled cinnamon pineapple came around the table and I filled my\nPlate. It's is a fun experience and greatly accommodates large parties. The restaurant is romantically dim and has an intimate feel which makes it universal for social occasions of larger parties OR a quiet romantic dinner for 2. The service was impeccable for being a busy Sunday but the food was nothing to rave about. This place is more of going for the ambience and the experience of an \"all you can eat\" restaurant with that trendy upscale flare. I will be back but ONLY for special occasions!
