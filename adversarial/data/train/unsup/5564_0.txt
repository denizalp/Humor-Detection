I've had this place bookmarked for a long time and finally was able to visit this morning since I was in the area. To my surprise, I walk in to a cute and modern coffee spot. I walk up to the counter and the cashier didn't give off a friendly vibe. I ordered the California Club and a small vanilla latte with almond milk. She gives me my order number and I guess I just have a seat. I just felt awkward and out of place the whole time I was there waiting for my food. Another employee gives me my food and my coffee and I leave. \n\nWhen I get back to my office, I take a sip of my vanilla latte. It lacked flavor... and the California Club was okay. I'm not sure if I like the cream cheese in a California Club but I ate half of the sandwich. Food and coffee were okay, service was less than okay but overall, three stars.
