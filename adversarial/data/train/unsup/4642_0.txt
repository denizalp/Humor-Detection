So I must give a big UPS to my fellow Yelpers. Without you I would be parisienne macaroon-less and my oh my I adore my french macaroons. I used to work in a restaurant that made these delicate cookies as petit fours. I've been addicted ever since. \n\nBouchon Bakery is in the Venetian right underneath the escalator (if coming from self parking) next to the Apothecary. They close early sometimes depending on how busy they are. The 1st time I tried to go here they were shutting down at 10pm to my dismay.\n\nThe macaroons here are HUGE and the price tag is $3.59 a piece. I got the seven pack for (I'm embarrassed to say) $17.29 and a cappuchino to boot. My mama opted for their chai tea and the apple fritter croissant with almond creme. That croissant was delish and even though I'm not a huge croissant fan (after you've made them once its hard to eat that much butter knowingly) I snuck a bite or two of this. \n\nI haven't made it all the way through my box yet but so far the chocolate has been the best. The texture of the macaroons is right on point! But the macaroons will only last (at the most) a week after you buy them if you keep them in the refrigerator the entire time (warns the staff). I really wish they labeled the flavors in the box :(.
