OK so burgers are entrenched in North American culture.  That said with so many burger choices out there today finding just any burger is as easy as finding a major intersection it seems.  From worldwide chains to national chains to local chains to mom and pops the choices are virtually endless...\n\n... and then comes along a place like the Burger's Priest.  With the quantity of burgers I have consumed in my life from all across the entire continent from coast to coast and everything in between I have to say that this local place is probably the best I've had to date bar none... AND I've only had one of their burgers (Vatican City).\n\nAt this point I am intrigued to try other combinations of what they serve just because what I had was so good the only way to tell you how good it actually is, is to have you try one yourself.  There are no out of this world toppings, nothing fancy or expensive or imported here, just plain, solid awesome technique and results.  \n\nLet's face it, the base ingredients for fast food burgers is really nothing that can be taken too far from the base that would transcend the fundamental ingredients.  You have beef cooked in a variety of ways, bread used to hold your meat and whatever else in between that makes it either standard or different depending on how far out you decide to go. \n\nWhile I cannot comment on the rest of the menu, even the fries because I was so full that I didn't even try the fries or chili fries, I can only go on the one single burger I had yesterday, the \"Vatican City\".\n\nThis burger is pretty much your basic double burger with only one real exception.  The buns are made from grilled cheese sandwiches made from hamburger buns.  So both the top and bottom \"buns\" are essentially mini grilled cheese sandwiches.  I can tell you that this made all the difference in the world on how this burger tasted because while I know the familiar American cheese flavor that goes so sublimely with beef patties this brought the experience to an entirely different level.\n\nThese little cushion treats were like buffers of heaven holding the contents of deity class meat between the souls of the holiness that at a certain point in time may lead you to believe that any other burger is sheer blasphemy.\n\nThe burger patties were just melt in your mouth goodness.  Apparently they are cooked flat top style.  The toppings which I had (everything but pickles)  were complimentary and did not overpower or overshadow the meaty cheesy goodness of the rest of the sandwich that was the main attraction here.  The onions added flavor, the rest of the toppings wouldn't have been missed if they were in there or not.  \n\nThe grilled cheese buns just hooked me, right then and there like a hungry newborn baby to a mother's teat I simply could not get enough of the burger while I was eating it.  It was an awesome experience that I wish to repeat... again and again.  \n\nThe only downfall of this place is probably the fact that their food is so good and not good for you that it may kill some of the locals.  Thankfully we have universal health care in Ontario to perhaps mitigate that situation as much as possible.\n\nBy the way this place has a menu that is posted at the store and then there is a \"secret menu\".  The Vatican City falls under the normal menu.  The most expensive burger \"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" is basically a Vatican City with 2 added \"Options\".  \n\nA single \"Option\" is cheese placed between 2 portabello mushroom caps, breaded and deep fried.  Ya and the Horseman has two of these added into a Vatican City.  The burger is over 20 dollars.  The Vatican City is about 12?\n\nTo get to the secret menu you have to answer a skill testing question and as of now the question is: \"How long was Noah on the ark?\"  and the answer is 370 days.  \n\nI went ahead and ordered a milkshake as well.  I had the Riggs and Murtaugh in reference to the characters in the movie series \"Lethal Weapon\" (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover).  I had to look it up, apparently it's a vanilla milkshake mixed with chocolate milk.  It was really very good and a very nice sweet compliment to a very savory burger.\n\nWould I return to the Burger's Priest?  The answer is not yes, it's a Hell yes or Heaven's yes whatever you believe in.  I do believe I will return to pay tribute to the burger gods.
