I have been here three times and I love the food. The Lawnboy is fantastic! However the service is not so good. Two of the times I've been there my waiter was Mark. He was extremely slow and on the verge of rude. I think he was trying to be sarcastic and funny but it came off creepy. He took forever to take our order and tried to wait until after 2pm so that we couldn't get the \"express\" lunch. While we waited almost 15 minutes for our check we could hear him talking to someone about a woma  being a hooker! The restaurant was pretty empty so there is no reason why we should have waited as long as we did.
