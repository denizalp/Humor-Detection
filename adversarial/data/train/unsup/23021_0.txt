This place is a nice addition to the area.  The area needed a solid place with good food that is geared to the younger crowd and Grassroots hit the mark.  They have a menu full of comfort food-like selections that doesn't overwhelm you with choices.\n\nFor an appitizer my table shared the barrata which was excellent and perfect to share because of it's size.  I was also surprised at the size of the short rib entree.  You get 3 large hunks of rib that were cooked perfectly.  The BBQ sauce was just ok but the meat was plenty flavorful and tender so it really didn't need much.  The grits were also delicious and a perfect compliment to the ribs.  The 2 under cooked asparagus spears were more for decoration than to be eaten though.  I also sampled the bbq brisket which was also very good.  As with the short rib, I prefer my meat a little fattier (I know, I'm sick) so it wasn't out of this world good for me.\n\nAll-in-all Grassroots was a good experience and I would return.  Next time I'm getting the shrimp and grits for sure.
