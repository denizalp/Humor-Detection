It's A Grind has been a place that I'll end up at with my partner(s) in crime after a long night.  We love to wind down with some coffee and conversation, and It's A Grind makes for a great place to do just that.  24 Hour coffee shop?  With board games to help entertain yourself?  Yes please.  If you stop by and see me there, challenge me to a game of Othello.  I would say that I play this game 90% of the time I stop by here, and I barely lose, so bring it on!  \n\nIt's A Grind offers customers a selection of coffee, smoothies, blended coffee drinks, sandwiches, pastries, cigarettes, cigars... You can kill some serious time here depending on what you enjoy.  Overall I enjoy the fact that this place is 24 hours, but other than that it's just another coffee shop.  If it weren't for their hours, I don't think I would stop by so often.
