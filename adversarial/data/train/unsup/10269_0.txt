For the suburbs this place is very close to being upscale.  The hotel is equipped with a killer work out room; a laundry facility; and in room amenities such as a full kitchen, DVD player, and Internet connection that makes your stay very pleasant.  The staff is very attentive.  The rooms are white glove inspection clean.  The bed was comfy and had I needed to work there was plenty of workspace available.  \n\nMy only criticism was that the sign advertising the daily rate for walk-ins was far below the rate I paid on the Internet after searching extensively for a good deal on a reservation.  I hate feeling as if I paid too much.  Otherwise, I would stay here again because of its close proximity to where I needed to be during my stay.
