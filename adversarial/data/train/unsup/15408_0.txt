First of all PARK IN THE WYNN (Not Encore, which makes no sense because the club is in Encore, but there is a bridge that connects it to the Wynn parking garage- 2nd floor- which makes everything easier). Your girls will thank you when they only have to walk 2 minutes in their heels to the entrance instead of 8 minutes. Or better yet, don't drive so you can get drunk off $20 drinks in the oven they call Las Vegas. \nEBC seems to have become the unofficial club for the Asians of Los Angeles. Beach clubs seem to attract a significantly younger crowd than regular clubs as well. \nThere is plenty of space for those without a cabana or lily pad. The lily pads are cheaper than cabanas, but end up being more fun. Get a cabana if you want your own space and don't want people coming by. The lily pads are in the water and allow you to be more social. \nThere are lockers to put your stuff in, but they are extremely pricey. Do yourself a favor and get a waterproof phone bag for your ID and money and don't bring anything else in. I've seen way too many people lose a phone after dropping it in at EBC and it'll save you the locker money :( \nThere are tables for gambling and two bars for drinks. Drinks are what you would expect at a Vegas club. The day clubs are what you think of when you hear EBC, but don't forget about their night swims. It's less hot, just as many people and just as famous of a DJ. Night swim is way better than day club in my opinion!
