It being the time to finally get a newer phone, I decided to attempt to do everything online so that all I had to do was pick up my phone as I drove through an area.  What ended up happening was a fiasco.  \n\nI had everything set up, payment made and decided to head out to pick up my new phone.  I showed up here and ended up having to wait.  Quick question, when did AT&T start thinking they are Apple.  \"You need to have you name in the queue.\"  Is what I ended up hearing.\n\nUpon walking in I was greeted and told I would be helped as soon as they had someone available.  I was fine with that, but still puzzled that such a big store only had three employees working.  More people were helped prior to me and when it looked like I was going to be helped next the girl that approached me said what I quoted above.  She put me on the list and then promptly walked away even after I said that I was only here to pick up my item.  \n\nWaited a few more minutes and finally was able to get some service.  Not sure what the mix up was but the guy helping me ended up having to go back to the stockroom a few times before my phone was in my hands.  Well, almost.  Even though I had taken care of everything online before getting here there was still stuff to be done on the computer and a receipt had to be printed.\n\nWhat kind of freaked me out was after all this and I had everything in my hands and was ready to walk out the employee walked me to the door.  Unless we are lifelong friends or family, I don't need you to show me to where the glass door is on the huge glass wall.  I did walk in here myself not that long ago...well longer than it should have been.
