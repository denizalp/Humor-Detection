If you see the Pizza People Food Truck, stop and get a pizza. Today, they were parked outside of the Coffee, Cookies, and Crafts event at Bragg's Pie Factory. Lucky us! \n\nI'm a personal fan of the Popeye and Fun Guy. The Popeye has spinach (obviously), basil, garlic, tomatoes and green onions. The Fun Guy has mushrooms (get it?! FUN GUY? Because mushrooms are fungi. You know, in the kingdom Fungi.) as well as arugula and basil. Plus, the pizza dough is freakin' fantastic. I could eat a pizza of crust. \n\nAlso, there are vegan and gluten-free options. But don't panic, carnivores! Plenty of awesome meat choices too.\n\nGuys, long story short, it's really good pizza. You'll wait no longer than 12 minutes for your pizza, and pay no more than $10 for your meal. That's $10 maximum. Really, you'll probably spend $7 or 8, and that's including a drink.
