I can't rave about The Wellsh Eye Center enough! Everyone in there was beyond friendly while maintaining excellent professionalism! They took time out of their day, after office hours, to check on me personally. I had no complications with my Lasik. I can't believe I waited so long! I'm extremely happy with the results, the Wellsh Eye Center and each and everyone one of the staff. I would recommend them to anyone considering Lasik.
