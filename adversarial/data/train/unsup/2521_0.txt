(Lyrics - Will Smith - Miami)\n\nHere I am in the place where I come to eat\nthe drinks and the street tacos\nEveryday in The Yard in all, everybody party all day\nNo work all play, okay\nSo we sip a little something, lay to rest the spill\nMe and Jenny at the bar runnin up a high bill\nNothin less than ill, when we dress to kill\n\nEverytime the waiter pass, they be like (Hi Bo)\nCan y'all feel me, all drinks and cocktails\nReal spicy sauces\nEvery different toppings, Chicken, Onions, Asada, Cilantro\nPork, Steak, Cubano or Salsa\n\nI only came to Bo Bites and playing\nBut everytime I come I always wind up eating\nThis the type of place I could spend a few days in\nUrbano the place that keeps the kitchen blazing\n\nParty in The Yard where the heat is on\nAll night, on the patio till the break of dawn\nWelcome to Urbanos\nBuenvenidos at Urbanos\nBouncing in The Yard where the heat is on\nAll night, on the patio till the break of dawn\nI'm going to Barrio Urbano\nWelcome to Urbanos\n\n\nI think any place with the name Barrio is going to work especially here in the valley!\n\nBarrio Urbano is located inside The Yard next to Cleo's.  I really enjoy the lively atmosphere these three places provide.  Great food and live entertainment yeah!  The only thing weird about it is that you can't bring food and drinks in and out of each restaurant as if you were in Vegas!  \n\nNeedless to say, I wasn't too bummed.....maybe just a little.  I always seem to sit at the bar when I attend Barrio Urbano; ahem!  Drink menu please!  The bartender is very knowledgeable about Tequila and let's just say my favorite drink here is the El Picado; a spicy limey cocktail.  Food here is amazing with James Beard nominated Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza in the kitchen or at least creating some banging meals!  I went for the street tacos this time around starting with the Carne Asada, Pulled Pork, Fish Tacos, and the Chicken Avocado.  Overall, I love them!  The carne asada and pulled pork was tender and had limey cilantro bite.  The fish tacos was perfectly cooked and the cabbage provide a crunchy welcoming texture.  Finally, the chicken avocado was good, but definitely probably my least favorite of the four.  \n\nIn the end, Barrio Urbano brings great Mexican food was a modern twist.  I love the atmosphere and the list of Tequila they have and I can't handle too much of it. - Enjoy!
