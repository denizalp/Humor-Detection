Overall mixed review...We are locals and were psyched to go see he new SLS. Unfortunately we were underwhelmed. It was hyped so much, but didn't deliver for us.\n\nWe stopped by two different bars and there were no specially drink menus (which is odd because the restaurants had great sounding drinks). At the Monkey Bar We ordered standard drinks--old fashioneds and cosmos. Service was slow (to be expected by the crowd) but the drinks were terrible. We left them on the table. The waitress apologized but there wasn't much she could do.\n\nWe ate at Cleo which was very good! The restaurant line up May be the best thing this place has going for it! The service was excellent and the food was great. We will definitely be back there...\n\nThe decor seems a little off and the carpet has got to go! It looked like it hadn't been cleaned post renovation...\n\nExcept for the restaurants, we won't be back....too many other good options south of SLS. Overall just blah.
