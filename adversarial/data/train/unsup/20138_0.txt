Oh my god I'm so excited I finally got to come here!literally the coolest concept ever.... With my favorite pastry... THE CINNAMON ROLLL!!!! They're also super huge which is a plus. \n\nThe process was easy, pick a icing and toppings. That is it! This hidden gem is located in the shopping center by tropical smoothie on 215 and flamingo. Each cinnamon roll is about $5 which isn't bad at all since its customized. They also have example cinnamon rolls on display if you're an indecisive freak like me. I got the pumpkin spice, horchata, and tiramisu icing on each and a few toppings of my liking.\n\nThe spot is super cute. Clear directions, clean, and awesome interior design. Overall... I will be back! I absolutely love this establishment.
