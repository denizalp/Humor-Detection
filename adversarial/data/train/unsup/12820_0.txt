If you're looking for cheap and efficient transportation, \"Suburban Express\" shouldn't even cross your mind. Here's why:\n\n1) Unfriendly service. I'm not talking about your regular unfriendly bus driver. In my experience with Suburban Express, I have been chastised and called names by people at all levels of this organization. A bus driver called me a \"jackoff\" for tripping on the stairs as I was getting on the bus. The people in the office really don't give two shits if you get to where you want to go, and if you say anything, you'll be banned for life.\n\n2) Deceitful ticketing. If you order a ticket on their website, after you pay there will be a pop up window with your ticket information on it. If you don't print it then, its gone forever. That means if you are at a computer that has no printer ready, or if you accidentally close it, say goodbye to your bus fare.\n\n3) Unethical business tactics. If you go to the U of I, you definitely saw the signs posted everywhere by Suburban Express that blatantly advises customers to not use their competitor, Lex. These advertisements are in no way healthy competition- they are completely one sided, and most of them don't even have Suburban Express on them. Its basically two shitty bus companies, but Suburban Express uses slanderous means to get an advantage.\n\n4) Unhelpful phone staff. I tried to find out about tickets over the phone, but the person I talked to on the phone was blatantly not paying attention and ended the conversation by saying \"yeah, sorry, we don't serve that route. You should try LEX.\" This incident really summarizes what a terrible company Suburban Express is. They post slander about Lex all over the U of I campus, then refer customers to it because they are too lazy help us out themselves. \n\nThis may seem long, but the terrible service that Suburban Express delivers is worth the ten minutes to rant about it.
