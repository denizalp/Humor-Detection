Dr. Nack recently removed my daughter's teeth for orthodontic treatment and the experience was nothing short of perfect, especially considering the nature of the appointment. Needless to say, my 12 year old was pretty apprehensive right before the appointment, and Dr. Nack was so patient with her and calmed her down, she even slept some during the visit. He was so gentle during the procedure she had almost no pain after! Definitely recommend this office to anyone looking for a great dentist and a friendly team. A+!
