I booked a room, and walked in on another guest.  The front desk was unable, for 50 minutes, to answer my question if there was another non smoking room with a desk available.  I watched a parody of customer service as the hotel made guests go in and out of rooms.  \n\nThen I was offered a vacated room (but without cleaning it).\n\nI was offered a bottle of water and nuts for my almost hour wait while I watched the circus unfold after midnight.\n\nMany grumpy people.  For our trouble?  Complimentary breakfast.  No thanks, have a breakfast meeting.  I needed that hour of sleep. \n\nAlso, not cool asking me to downgrade and pay for the higher priced room.\n\nAll around, a fiasco.
