Decent place, I don't know what all the bad reviews are for. Service was good. Food was good. We ordered seafood jambalaya which you can get with either rice or pasta, we ordered it with pasta. It was a huge amount. And tasted fine not great but fine. Also ordered Dungeness crab, fried oysters with a side of garlic fries, very good. The oysters came with a nice size helping of coleslaw, I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw but I tasted it and it was good. Crab legs came with red potatoes. All good.
