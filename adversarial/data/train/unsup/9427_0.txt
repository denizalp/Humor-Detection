Other than an occasional excessive wait time the quality of product here is unmatched. Defalco's has the best grinders and cheese steaks around, plus they offer fine-dining quality pasta dishes to eat here or take with you. They also have a mini Italian grocery with a variety of meats, cheeses and olive oils.
