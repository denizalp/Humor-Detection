Here in Vegas for EDC and was craving dessert after some delicious noodles next door and so we came into Sweet Box! It was an absolute wonderful choice! We got two Strawberry Latte and we are ADDICTED! We were taught by the sweet barista that you eat the luscious cream with the fresh strawberries on top, and then you mix the cream with the strawberry puree on the bottom, take a sip and you'll be in strawberry heaven! Can't wait to come back for the rest of the weekend!!!
