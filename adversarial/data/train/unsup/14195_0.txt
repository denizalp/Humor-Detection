My mouth is watering. For their gigantic burgers! For their homemade potato chips! For their Parmesan wings! For the many many many beer selections on draft! They literally have a burger that's called the heart attack. Be warned! \n\nThis is just a great place on so many eating and drinking levels! I also enjoy the outdoor seating area during the summer so you can people watch on Carson St! There's usually a wait most nights and on weekends but it never takes too long to get in. Plus it's TOTALLY worth it!
