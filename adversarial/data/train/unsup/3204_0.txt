I have to say I am a total fan of the food and our server Chad was great.  But I thought it was lame that he couldn't wear his eyelet earrings or his hair in a totally retro fohawk but all the women that worked there looked like they were dressed for a sexy night out on the town.  I don't mind that the ladies were all strutting around with all their naughty bits on display but give us lady patrons something to ogle too!  How about putting the guys in fitted shirts and allowing their personalities to shine through adornment and coiffed hair.  \nBut back to the food, for an appetizer I tried the deviled eggs and they were wonderful and big!  No slacking on the portion size.  We were a large group so I got to sample the burger, grilled cheese sandwich with roasted tomato bisque, the french dip and beef stroganoff.  Every single one was heavenly and delicious!  I also like the plating of the food.  I will be back.
