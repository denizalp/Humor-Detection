I dined in at Ingos for happy hour the other night. I asked the waitress to explain the happy hour and she said 2$ off any drink. We ordered the frozen lemonade. When we received the bill, the lemonade remained at full price. We asked the manager, Arzu [sp], why the lemonade was not reduced. She responded that it was already at happy hour price and that it was \"hard to explain\". When we told her our server told us all drinks were 2$ off, she said \"oh she must not know.\" She did not apologize for the poor communication, nor do anything to resolve the situation. She brushed it off and ignored us the rest of the evening. We had to flag down our original server to pay and received no further explanation. Very disappointed with the poor service, poor communication, and no attempt to resolve the issue.
