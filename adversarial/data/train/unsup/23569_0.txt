We decided to eat here when we were at GVR for a conference and had a lunch break.  The selection of pizza is good as well as salads and sorts.  \n\nThe Vedura pizza was amazing as well as the Italian Fries and salad.  At lunch time the service was very good, our order was taken quickly and the food came out pretty fast.  Getting our server to refill our drinks was a little bit of a challenge but overall she was very good. \n\nThe staff is pretty friendly for the most part and we really enjoyed our experience here.  There are places in town to get pizza which is very comparable at a cheaper price but overall for a casino environment, this place rocks...\n\nWill I come here again, most definitely yes we will be back as the price is worth the quality.  If you are at GVR, this is a good place to eat.
