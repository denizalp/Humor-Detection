I can't believe I got to review this place before the DG! I feel honored and privileged. For all of the 2 star haters: THIS PLACE IS DOPE!!!! \n\nI have never eaten food here. It has always been too late in the night for that. Plus, there was only one thing on our minds when we go. KARA-fucking-OKE!!! Well, I mostly am inebriated and Z and Dally want to sing. The people that run the jams remind me of the house band at the Dresden in Swingers. There is always this older dude there that insists on playing the bongos along to every song. Even if it doesn't fit. \n\nInevitably we sing \"Don't Stop Believin'\", \"Piano Man\", and \"Sweet Caroline\". It will be a group of us guys and it is a good time had by all. One time I worked up the courage to sing a song with my buddy Z that didn't involve everyone at the bar. We did \"Black\" by Pearl Jam. I think it went well. It felt like it did anyway. \n\nI always have a blast when I am here. Save the time my ex-wife and the girl I was seeing at the time came within about 5 feet of each other. It felt like my head was going to explode. I think Garth Algar said it best,\"Did you ever see that part in Scanners when that guys head exploded?\" No amount of alcohol could have made me drunk that night.   \n\nYou will see a very eclectic mix of people in here, but don't be scared.
