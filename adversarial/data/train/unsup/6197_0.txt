I ran into this store, so excited as I wanted a nice pair of Burberry slacks.  I was disappointed to find them at double the price of the outlet mall close to my home. \n My wife quickly found what she was looking for-- a polo shirt. I spend a lot of time trying on clothes, in hopes of finding something I liked. The t-shirts were soft to the touch and too soft on buddy, my nipples were pointing out. \n I ended up leaving with nothing, but it was still a fun shopping time. The service inside was great. See ya next time!
