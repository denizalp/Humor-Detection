I want to call this the biggest POS bar in Vegas, but for some reason I think there might be a winner elsewhere. Regardless, DB's is on the list of places NOT to visit while in town. Even the cheap drinks can't save this sinking ship. \n\nWhy is it so bad? I'll list this out (it's Monday)...\n-The place looks like the last time it was cleaned was in 1941. The floors, the walls, the stage, the ripped furniture, blech. \n-The internet jukebox... broken\n-The tunes playing.... awful\n-The ping pong room... sound broken\n-The ping pong room... broken paddles\n-The ping pong room... terrible lighting\n-The ping pong room... a ton of furniture around for the ball to hide under\n-The crowd... What crowd? It was dead\n-The TV's... no sound and playing a 'classic' college game when there were at least 10 Top 25 teams on\n-The beer pong area... dirty\n\nWord is there is food here, but we weren't brave enough to try it. The whole experience felt really awkward and I was kinda embarrassed that I brought friends from out of town here. Skip!
