Hello All,\n I am just here to give some information about Toy Town. The new owner just took over in July of 2012. If you have suggestions such as the ones below. (hours, toys your kids love but they need more of, etc.) Please go on facebook http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ToyTownPlaycenter or their website http:\/\/toytownplaycenter.com\/ and suggest them to the owner. I know her very well and she would be more than happy to here your feedback about the place. \nThank you!
