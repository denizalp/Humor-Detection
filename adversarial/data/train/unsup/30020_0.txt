I went there for the first time 2 days ago. For $20 ($15+tip), I expected more. The whole atmosphere there was just weird: from the fact that the employees do not speak English amongst themselves in the presence of customers (are they talking about me?) to the dirty looks that one female employee was giving me (now I'm certain they are!). \nNot sure how others manage to not feel rushed there, because as soon as my manicurist Lisa finished applying the top coat, she grabbed my bag, took me to the drying station, and a second later someone else was sitting in my seat. Assembly line, anyone? But I get it, they are busy and time is money.\nThe cuticle work wasn't outstanding, and I'm actually left with some torn cuticles. The hand massage was OK, but I didn't enjoy it because it felt very forced (Lisa made sure she avoided eye contact with me at all times). I can't say anything about the staying power of their polishes because I brought my own base coat (China Glaze Strong Adhesion Base Coat), color (Essie Really Red) and top coat (Essie To Dry For). \nMaybe I'll be back... after my cuticles heal.
