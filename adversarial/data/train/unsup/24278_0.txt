I am reviewing this specific location and not the chain in general.  Really, do not waste your time going here and just go to another location for your Taco Bell needs.  \n\nAs any TB frequenter knows, there are some of those visits during off peak hours where they have their JV folders on duty and the result is your food is just not put together well.  This location seems to only hire JV folders.  \n\nAnother thing that is upsetting about this location is that their rate of getting orders correct is at best 1 in 4.  They constantly put beef on my bean burritos and put onions on the 7 layers.  \n\nIf you enjoy interaction with crack heads, then this place is for you.  I have gotten harassed by other patrons who just yelled random comments at us, and this was during the day.  Also, one of the workers was definitely under the influence during one visit.  \n\nJust drive the extra 3 minutes and go to another location.
