For me, it's hard to find an Indian food restaurant that meets my standards in both authenticity and flavor. Taj Mahal definitely surprised me. It's unfortunate that you wouldn't know it exists in Oldtown Scottsdale unless you went out of your way to find it, but what an unexpected treasure it is. The fact that they were able to accommodate on spice level for my boyfriend was wonderful, and the spice level of my own dishes was pleasant and not overpowering like some can be. The owner even came over to introduce himself. This place has a great atmosphere like what you would expect in Scottsdale, but the personal touch of making us feel welcomed and appreciated for coming in really made the whole experience for us. Would recommend to anyone, however be aware that at dinner time, ordering from the menu can really add up! We had a bill of over $70, but it was still worth it.
