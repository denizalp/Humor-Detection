Very surprised of the angry bad reviews. I GOT MY DREAM CAR WITH THE BEST PRICE ON THE MARKET! And my dad bought his car there too in January 2015. They got him financed and then called back 2 days later after purchasing the car they called him to tell him that they found a lower interest rate to finance the car. They never stop helping their customers. \n\nNow with my dream car, Charlene did an amazing job. It's was fast very relaxing. This is the 2nd time I've purchased a car from Charlene and I wouldn't do business with anyone else but Charlene! \n\nAnd Sales Consultant JC Caldwell, thank you for working with me on buying my dream car! You and Charlene made my dream come true!
