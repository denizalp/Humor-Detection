With Yelping as long as I have, I don't think I have ever been so disappointed in a company. So to update you future brides\/bridesmaids this is what has happened since my last review. Please keep in mind I have reached out to Kim (Manager who posted a message to my original review below) 3 times to ask a few questions and try to get some answers. Every time I call no one can help me and they say they will leave a message for her to call me back. She has not gotten back to me.\n\nAfter purchasing my bridesmaids dress through the store, the other bridesmaids decided to wait. Come to find out they were able to order the same exact dress online, it was cheaper, they were given the option to ship the dress straight to their home and have already received their dresses! It took 5 business days to get to them! Keep in mind we all ordered standard sizes, because that is all Davids Bridal allows you to order, each size is in stock and they are all the same dress\/color. I paid more for my dress, I have to drive an hour to the store to pick it up and it will not be here for 6 weeks!!!! Please tell me how this makes sense or why anyone would want to shop at this store? Ladies.... do not waste your time! If you happen to come here and find a dress you like, snap a picture of the tag and order it online! Easier, cheaper faster and no bad customer service experience!\n\nHere is the BIG kicker!!! I can not return my dress it is considered a final sale even though I was not comfortable with the standard size they said I needed, I took the plunge fully expecting having to pay for alterations because they didn't give me any other choice. The girls that ordered the same dress online CAN return their standard size dress for a full refund or exchange! WHAT!???
