Tryst is definitely fun! We found an area to the side of the sea of people where we could have some space as a group to dance, smoke our cigars, and chill. \n\nThe waterfall transports you into another world, so you enjoy the ambiance more than a usual club. \n\nI don't remember a lot of the details I normally would because, well, we went to Blush's open bar before coming here... but trust me - it was a lot of fun!
