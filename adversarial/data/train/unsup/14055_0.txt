**Talk about uneventful, anti-climactic, overpriced, and overall boring**\n\nPROTIP: Go at night when you can see lights. It's very boring during the day.\n\nThank god this was free for me; otherwise, I would've given it a lower rating.\n\nLets begin with a few things wrong with this attraction:\n1. The High Roller is so awkwardly placed behind the strip so you don't actually get to see anything on the strip; you see the high buildings and hotels and that's about it.\n2. The place to buy tickets is actually not in the lobby with the prices of the ride (where it would logically be); instead you get tickets on the side of the building with NO SIGNS.\n3. There are more employees working at the High Roller than there are guests (who thought this would make money?).\n4. When you're inside the sphere that goes around, the music is so ridiculously loud that you NEED to be drunk to enjoy it. There are monitors that line the top that tell you how high you've gotten, 100ft... 200ft...300ft... etc; however, if the sphere ever stops for maintenance reasons, the count is totally off. We were at the apex when the monitor told us we were 3\/4 of the way through with our ride. FAIL.\n\nPros: Cool if it's free\nCons: Expensive if it's not:
