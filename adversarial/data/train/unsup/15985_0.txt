Owned by the most shameless and petty person, and a complete disgrace to Indians all across the world. The owner has the audacity to personally contact me and abuse me regarding wanting a refund for my order after it was 30 mins late and I was forced to stand outside in cold weather waiting for it (since I live in an apartment complex). The food was cold and the naan (bread) was stale. I called up the place before placing my order if whether they'll be able to deliver it and the owner confirmed he will be. Next day, he's abusing me that he had \"to go outside of his way\" to deliver my food and that my demand for a refund wasn't justified. Well, they just lost $25\/week business. Keep up the petty behavior!
