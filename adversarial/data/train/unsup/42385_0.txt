Love their menu options...everything is always good. \nI really enjoy the garden burger option & low-carb lettuce wrapping option. \nIt was Sunday & packed of course but we got seats at the bar. We received excellent customer service from Carlos (98% sure that was his name) but the other bartender seemed irritable with how busy it was & he didn't really want to be there.. \nRed Robin doesn't really ever let us down-- Red Robin, YUMM
