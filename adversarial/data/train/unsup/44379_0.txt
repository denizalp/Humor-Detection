Lousy warranty. Lousy customer service. Small company, not open on weekends, so you can't get service in an emergency, however that doesn't stop them from calling YOU outside of normal business hours if it pleases them. The first time I used them, they were just plain rude to me, and attempted to avoid service within the required 24-hour clause in the contract, so I pulled out the fine print on them (they wanted to have someone out in 48-72 hours, but I put my foot down). This year my wife received an overdue notice for a payment for service they lost accounting of (luckily we had bank images from cleared check). Tonight they called me on a Sunday evening 12 hours after I left a message on their service, to tell me that I would have to call a third party company to schedule service for my broken air conditioning the following day (what a joke). They make you do their job for them, but they're always right on time with the renewal notice every year. I enjoy giving them an extra dollop of my type A personality, as an additional reward for what lousy business people they are, and for the unprofessional tone of their voice (a single voice it would appear). Tonight they hung up on me LOL. Guess I'll be leaving some more messages on their service. Go with a company who knows what they're doing (that includes handling an upset, unruly customer...because that's the business ya'll)...this company is not that company.
