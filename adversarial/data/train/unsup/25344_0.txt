I'm typically very weary about trying new places but after much research, I finally decided to come here. \n\nI came in with an idea of what it is I wanted and presented it to one of the artist Josh Etch. My idea was a scene out of the Haunted Mansion ride from Disneyland, the part where Madame Leotas  head is floating around in a crystal ball, but in my head I wanted the whole scene. Like a true artist, Josh explains that less is more and my idea if put on paper would be too cluttered. After seeing his work, I felt completely confident in giving him freedom to draw something up. I was first told to come in about 1 week after I first walked in the shop so Josh could measure my arm. Then, about another week later I was shown the design and when I saw it, all I could literally say was WOW. Josh exceeded what I was expecting! \n\nWhen we prepared to actually to the work, he was very professional about everything. His attention to his work was outstanding. He takes his time while working to ensure you will get an amazing product. He constantly kept making sure I was doing okay if I needed a break and we talked the whole time. The first round was the line work and shading, in about 3 weeks I will be getting color done. I'll be posting the finished product then. \n\nOverall, I would definitely and highly recommend coming here. There are other awesome artist that work and the atmosphere is very welcoming. While getting my tattoo, owners Joe and Michelle kept my wife entertained which we all actually ended having some laughs together. \n\nWant some good work done? Definitely come here!
