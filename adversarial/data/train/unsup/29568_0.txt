I own a property management company where we manage about 125 homes valley wide. Shamrock is by far the best roofing company I've worked with, and I've worked with a lot of them! They are honest, reliable and stand behind their work. They don't try to oversell you what isn't needed. They are fast, knowledgable, and their prices are reasonable. I would recommend Shamrock without hesitation.
