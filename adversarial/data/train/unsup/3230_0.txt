Island snow in Vegas. FINALLY\n\nAfter dim sum with my \"usual day-off foodie friends,\" we \"needed\" to cleanse our palette with something sweet. I had heard (seen) about this place through IG and, quite frankly, I wasn't too impressed with Kuma so, I was excited to see what this place was all about. Since we were already on Spring Mountain, it was the perfect time to samps SnowFlake Shavery.\n\nFor some reason, I was expecting this place to look like Kuma with bright walls and a cute Asian look interior. Other than the cartoon seal (similar to Kuma's if u ask me) and snowflake\/icicle painting at the corners of the wall, it was quaint instead of cute. \n\nAnytime you come to any kind of yogurt, ice cream, snow places there are so many choices of flavors and toppings but, it was nice to see that they have set combos that were for the \"coconut, strawberry, mango, chocolate lover\" and so forth! \nOnce I saw the \"black sesame sensation,\" I immediately knew my girlfriend would choose that - she did.\nThey had various \"usual\" flavors but, once I saw COOKIE BUTTER flavored snow, it was a done deal for my roommate. He got that with egg custard and condensed milk topping.\n\nWhen we received our snow, we immediately noticed the \"ribbons\" in the snow. Exactly like the \"snow\" or Taiwanese snowcone that we have in Hawaii. That alone was very promising. \nThe cookie butter was UHHHH-MAAAAZE! Sweet and caramel. Not sure exactly if it really tasted like cookie butter but, it was amazing nonetheless. Black sesame was like other black sesame I've had before but, not as \"potent\" or strong flavored as I've had...whatever that means.\nEither way, both was soft and melted into a creamy goodness once it hits your mouth. Om nom nom :) \n\nAlso, gotta give credit to the worker who was alone at the time. Considering she was the only one taking orders and making the snow, she was very sweet and friendly.  \n\nCan't wait to go back!
