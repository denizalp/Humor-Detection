If you're visiting Cleveland, the best view of the city (that is, what there is to see) is from the top of the tower. However, make sure to take the elevator down. I had a friend who wanted to take the stairs, got stuck on the fifth floor, and then got yelled at by some very angry and less-that-polite security guards.\n\nAlso, the Film Festival here is also a fun event every year! They have films from all over the world and it really lets you explore! Also, its very convenience that the rapid is located right inside. The building itself is also beautiful!\n\nHowever, the mall itself is a disaster. They do have some nice stores, but the security guards seem more content on harassing 17 year olds who are quietly eating chinese food in the food court that on dealing with the bums and groups of loiterers who harass shoppers for $5, block off all the entrances, and break windows at their leisure. Hopefully this will be cleared up by the time the convention hits, but I doubt it.
