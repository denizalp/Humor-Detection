The waitress says, \"The special of the day is the Eggplant Sandwich, although I am allergic to eggplant, the eggplant is really good.\"  \n\n Hmm... _  and  (_)\n\nMy reply:  \"What happens when you eat eggplant?\"  Waitress:  \"I am allergic to eggplant.\" \n\n\nWent to lunch with buddy Ordered a spinach salad, dressing on the side.   The dressing came on the salad, suprise.  The French onion soup is extremely salty - - - overbearingly salty.  When the waitstaff was made aware of this, their only comment, \"Oh, I know, I agree completely!\".  Huh?  What planet are you guys on?  If you knew, why did you serve it, or at least inform me?  Or even better yet, fix it, or God forbid offer up a solution?  I would have like to  have been offered something else, even though I'd have declined.  It would have been polite.  But no.  I left a 22% tip (paid cash) because there was no one at the register. Lunch: spinach salad, salty soup, veggie sandwich, 2 iced teas, $36 with tip.  I won't be back.
