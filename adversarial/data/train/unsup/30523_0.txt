Just finished celebrating my legal marriage here.\n\nGood news first: the wine cellar room was amazing! Such a cool space and it was free to reserve. \n\nMy family enjoyed the ribeye, pork chop, and scallops. Delicious!\n\nBad news: seriously, what's up with the filet? Four people at our table ordered it and requested 3 medium wells and 1 medium. When delivered, all four were rare, with very dark red centers. One person agreed to eat his, one person ate the edges and kept the rest to finish cooking later and two people sent theirs back for more cooking. Their two steaks returned, and one was cooked, but the other was just as dark red as before it was sent back! Thankfully, they didn't charge us for the failed entree, but seriously. Their kitchen operations needs some attention if our experience from tonight is a regular occurrence.
