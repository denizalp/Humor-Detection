I spent 3 hours at the Apple store. Sadly I wasn't shopping. Although I did see robots, drones and all manner of exciting digital toys to explore, alas my work computer was the order of the day. My Mac Mini was slow as molasses. \n\nI do graphic design and that means I use the Creative Cloud suite daily. That is a substantial group of programs that take up a bunch of space. After trouble shooting on the phone for an hour an appointment was made for me to visit the store. \n\nIt was determined there was no software issue as my system was removed and reinstalled. They could not find any hardware issues, but said I could leave it for a 48 hour check. The prognosis seemed to be a requirement for RAM. \n\nThe store was very clean and appointments were required. You check in with one of the staff who has a tablet and stands in the middle of the store. They wear casual pants or jeans and a blue apple shirt with a small logo on it. At first glance, it was hard to tell workers from customers. From there, if you have a computer issue, you are relegated to the back long wood table with matching wood stools. \n\nSince I was there for three hours I was grateful they had a bathroom for me to use. This also was very clean. I think Apple takes cleanliness very seriously. I like that. \n\nThe girl who helped me told me her name a couple times, but for the life of me, I can't remember. She was petite with dark hair, dark eyes and glasses. She was kind, soft spoken and put me at ease. She stayed by my side for the bulk of the time I was there. It's a stressful time when your tech doesn't work. She was comforting. \n\nCurrently my computer is undergoing the 48 hour hardware check. Fingers crossed for a faster, fully functional computer.
