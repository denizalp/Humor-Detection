I went here with a bunch of friends hoping to enjoy the last warm days of the season. Well little did I know that this was an S&M place. One of the servers (that was off-duty) was basically being assaulted by the 'owner\" (so I was told). When I questioned the abusive behaviour, I was shown the door. I was there with five other people (my closest friends) and we were all shown the door. The so called \"owner\" took my beer from my hand and asked my group to leave. When I asked her why she was doing that the said \"you've had too much to drink!\". I guess that line is generic and is used in all occasions when the \"bar\"  is challenged.\n\nBottom line is....DON'T GO THERE. Unless you are into S&M and like being abused by the \"owner\" when you are paying cash (oh and they don't take debit or credit card btw. I am writing to CRA about that\")\n\nThere are so many friendly & hospitable places in Kensington....please do yourself a favour and DON'T GO HERE! \n\nAlso, what a dungeon inside! SAD!   But I guess if you're into bondage...you'll be right at home! Yikes!
