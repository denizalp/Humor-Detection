Just a sheer disappointment all around. We came here for my 40th birthday. We had reservations and we were seated within about 10 minutes. This is the only reason this place gets a star,  although I'm not sure I could give them 0 stars even if wanted to.\n\nWe sat at our table for 20 minutes, and I never got a drink, or the little wooden marker so I could be served dinner. I get it,  you're busy,  but this is  inexcusable.  Forget thinking you're going to get a nice meal here.  It's in a mall.  It's over rated. And it's a huge letdown.\n\nAfter waiting like a castoff, I got up and left.  But first I gave the manager a piece of my mind. I couldn't believe his best suggestion was \"you should stay here,  you're going to have to wait wherever else you go,  you should just stay here for dinner\". Um, yea, I don't think so. \n\nHonestly, stay clear of this place.  It's just not anything special for the $50+ per head.
