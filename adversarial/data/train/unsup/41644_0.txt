Always Great haircuts!\n\nI just wanted to give a shout out to Steph. This homeless women walked in and said she had no money and wanted a haircut. Steph stepped up and \"said no problem. I'll do it for you.\" The lady was so happy and surprised. It made me happy to see that there's still good people in this world. Awesome!
