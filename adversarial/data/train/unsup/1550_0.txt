I wasn't ready for the goodness of The Cracked Egg. To be fair, my friend did forewarned me that I would love it. She knows me well! I was hooked. All three times that I visited the Cracked Egg there was no wait time, one of those days was on a weekend. \n\n\nThe space is clean and spacious. \nSuper friendly and accomodating staff. \n\nWhat I had and recommend...\n\n- The eggs benedict\n- French toast\n- Bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant.\n- Coffee\n\nWarning: No wifi; which means people have to talk to each other.\nI loved that. Get off the phones and eat up people.\n\nI can't wait to go back to Las Vegas just to go to The Cracked Egg.
