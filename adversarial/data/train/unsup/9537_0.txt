As someone who no longer lives in New Mexico but still considers herself a New Mexican at heart, I crave New Mexican food on a regular basis. So, when I come  to Phoenix, I must have a New Mexican food fix!  Several visits ago my sister took me to Los Dos Molinos and we found it fits the bill as well as any displaced New Mexican could ask. \n\nToday we ate at the Camelback location for the first time. The building is a cute Adobe with an inviting entry. Inside, the decor is colorful with many New Mexico themed paintings. We arrived right at lunch time, yet were greeted and seated immediately by Jorge, who ended up being our server. The service was efficient and friendly throughout our meal. \n\nNow for the food.  How do I describe the taste of heaven? We started off with the spicy nacho cheese (a special) to accompany our freshly fried chips: wonderful flavor at a spice level that had heat but was not overdone. For my entr√©e I ordered a machaca-filled chimichanga with green sauce. Machaca at Los Dos is like no other I have had. It is their delicious shredded beef tossed in their equally delicious spicy red sauce. The combination of flavors was delectable and, to my surprise, just spicy enough to keep things interesting.  My sister had a green corn tamale that was also amazing.  The beans and rice were pretty standard fare, but also good, and provided a welcome break from the heat, as did the side of sour cream and guacamole that came with the chimi.\n\nNeedless to say, I am already planning my next visit to my sister and nephew.  It's the family I am coming back for,  right?
