Want to get a lecture about cancelling and told how you don't prioritize your health over supporting your family, go talk to Evan. The guy is a load of knowledge about your personal life and can't wait to put you down because he knows what is best for your life decisions.\nRemember, ask for Evan when you try to cancel and you'll get a laugh. Absolute joke, can't believe they put someone like this in a customer service position.
