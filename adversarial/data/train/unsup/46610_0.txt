The service is very fast and friendly. About 98% of the drinks are made from syrup or powders with the exception of the avocado slush. But, if you don't mind the syrup the drinks aren't that bad. I personally prefer their Honey Green Tea with or without boba.\n\nSidenote: If you're into sports, they've got about 7 TV's on different sporting events going on at the time.
