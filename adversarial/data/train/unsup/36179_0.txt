Not only is the food amazing but the service is great too. The people who work here are so friendly and conversational. I always order the Chicken Club and swear by it. This place is perfect for lunch during the week or brunch on Sundays. A little bit more expensive but worth it for the quality of food you're getting. The decor is also very cute and aesthetically nice. Would recommend!!
