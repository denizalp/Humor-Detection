This place is amazing!!! My boyfriend decided to take me here for dinner on New Years Eve. He had been here with his family before but it was my first time. We sat outside under white tents that had heaters, which were actually very warm and nice to sit outside. The patio is so romantic, all tables are candle lit and the fireplace is beautifully decorated too. Our server came to our table with a sparkler and a complimentary bottle of Perrier Jouet...... WHAT I SAID ....never have I heard of such a thing, and I use to be a server back in my younger days:) . The owners had decided to give every table a bottle in celebration of being here and open!!! I still can not get over this I have told everyone how awesome that was. Nice touch!! Food was fantastic as well we shared a warm shrimp dish to start. I had a filet which came out perfect and was served with roasted corn and shishito peppers which are  my new favorite thing. I can't wait to return.
