\"As gas prices continue to drop, 28 states are now selling regular gasoline for less than $2 a gallon. It's getting cheaper to pump two gallons of gas outside the station than it is to pump two squirts of nacho cheese inside.\" â€• Jimmy Fallon\n\nIt's always a great meal when you come to Joyride.  Whether it's this location or the one in downtown Gilbert, service is always excellent.  I actually think service at this location might even be friendlier.  The bartenders didn't even give us crap for sitting at the bar and not intending to drink [it was a bit early, folks.  I'm a *sensible* alcoholic.  ;D]\n\nAfter working an early-morning gig over at The Wrigley Mansion, we headed over here for some tacos and some street corn.  Everything was delicious.  My almond horchata was so thick and did nothing to quench my thirst but that's why you get water on the side or steal your buddy's cucumber mint agua fresca.\n\nTaco Tuesday?  Psh, that's err'day.  Come to Joyride!
