Dear McCarran Airport-\n\nIt is apparent that morale is low amongst your employees. This is what I am telling myself to rationalize for all of the not smiling, irritated, and unhelpful airport employees.\n\nI could highlight your condesending and abusive TSA staff, but why bother? They're famous for their attitudes and bitter scarasm. What stood out to me this trip was that they appear to be understaffed. I'm not making excuses for them; they know where they work. However, morale and customer service might improve if you put a few extra people on staff. Just a thought...\n\nMy second observation was your employees, because they are short handed, appear to be overwhelmed.  Some employees did appear to be attempting to help customers and perform to the best of their abilities. Nevertheless, I observed too many employees say \"I don't work for the airlines\" and have a general- Do not talk to me attitude. Really?! Ew.\n\nArriving in Vegas is always a pleasure. The departure, not so much. Please consider ways to improve travelers departure experience.  If my last impression of Vegas is distasteful, it will influence my thoughts on when I will return.
