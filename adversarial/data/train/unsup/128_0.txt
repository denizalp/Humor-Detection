I love this place so much, the staff sets the bar for customer service. I used to work at a hotel and I wanted to bring my jackass staff to see how its done. I have been going here  since Feb. '12 and have lost 50 lbs (its not a miracle program though, you have to do the work and its not always easy) They also have a ton of other goods and services available. The skin products they sell have been my saving grace as well. I have been in once a week for quite some time and not one time has been a bad experience. The facility is beautiful and clean, they have flexible hours and you even get a free vitamin shot if you refer someone or fill out their survey. I am one very satisfied customer and will come here even after I reach my goal weight for the other services they offer.
