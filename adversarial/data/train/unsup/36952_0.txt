I love breakfast and I love Egg works! Every time I come to Vegas I make sure to swing by this gem. If you love breakfast than I guarantee you will love this place. Not only is the food excellent the service is great, especially Nicole! She is so friendly and so quick I make sure to request her whenever I go in!
