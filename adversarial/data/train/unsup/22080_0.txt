So I've only been to this place once. My 21st Birthday was on a Tuesday so I figured I would want to go somewhere a little more laid back and had no intentions on bar hopping or anything like that. \n\nThe enviornment was great, had a small band playing and the bartenders were super nice. Also they were out to get me wrecked! The bartender started me off with his own version of a Running Naked, which contained 8 shots worth of rum, triple sec, vodka, gin, raspberry liquor, and topped off with Blue Moon. So along with that, a double shot of Liquid Marijuana, a double shot of Patron Tequila, and 4 beers later, needless to say I was definitely hammered. Not obnoxious and the staff was always very friendly and celebratory! Made sure to leave a nice tip for the Bartender. \n\nDefinitely need to visit again soon and see if I can bump this up to 5 stars!
