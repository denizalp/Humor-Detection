Organized chaos on the northwest corner of Rainbow and Trop.  Tight quarters in the middle of the afternoon.  Gas pumps, smashed in parking, lot's of bodies.  Upon further review, it close quarters battle with juveniles, people heading wherever, and the homeless.\n\n7-Eleven provides all that one one would expect for a 7-11.  With that being said, keep your head on a swivel, and be prepared to obtain a heightened state of awareness to get in and out!
