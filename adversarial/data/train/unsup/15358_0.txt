DC Elite Fitness provides one-on-one personal training, as well as group fitness classes and bootcamps. \n\nDaniel, the owner and lead trainer is patient, friendly, incredibly knowledgeable, and is a pleasure to work with. He helped me lose 14 pounds, reduce my cholesterol level, and gain strength, agility, and a poise that I haven't had in many years. Every workout is hard, but very do-able. I walk out of the gym exhausted but exhilarated at the same time. I look forward to every workout!\n\nThis is a new location for DC Elite, and the gym is coming along nicely. I'm really excited for Daniel and am happy to call DC Elite 'my gym'.
