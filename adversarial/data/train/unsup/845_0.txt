I've had a true Philly cheesesteak a few times in my life and admit, Straight From Philly makes a mean, true to Philly tasting cheesesteak. I've never had Pat's, but have sampled Geno's. And if you ever tried Geno's and liked their's, then you'll love what Straight From Philly has to offer.  They hook it up here with big portions and low prices.  The staff is great, very professional, and the restaurant is clean. So, why the 3 stars? First of all, 3 stars is not horrible. In my opinion, Straight From Philly is just okay. I've never been a huge fan of a legit Philly cheesesteak, especially since most that I've tried have been flavorless and greasy. Straight From Philly is no different. I prefer a juicy not greasy steak burger over a cheesy, greasy cheesesteak any day. My opinion about Straight From Philly is just that, my opinion. When it comes to a cheesesteak made the way it's suppose to be made, Straight From Philly does it right. I'm just not a fan.
