Holy cow ... where do I start?  If I could rate it a zero, I would have.  The server butchered our order, disappeared from sight for a half hour, and then returns with cold food.  When my wife told her that her omelet was cold, she had the audacity to ask if my wife wanted it warmed in the microwave to warm it up or another order made fresh?  After expressing some initial discontent with our order so far, we then got the stare down from one of the management staff from across the dining room.  Instead of coming over to apologize or check on our concerns, he just kept staring at us ... big marks for customer service there.  \n\nUpon check out, we had to ask for a manager in order to discuss the issue.  Thankfully, a different member of the management staff came over to discuss it.  He showed some skills in dealing with a customer who had a bad experience.  He comped some of the bill and apologized.  He even offered up a dessert to go for those who may have had cold or inaccurate meals.  I am hopeful he just has really good customer service skills, but my gut tells me it is just from way too much practice.\n\nI will not go back, nor will I recommend it to anyone ... even to people I don't like!
