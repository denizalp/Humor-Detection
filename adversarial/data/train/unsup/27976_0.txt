Not reliable, not timely, and inconvenient to do business with.  They also said they would accept payment with a credit card, but when the time came to pay up on the moving being completed, I had to write them a check, and it was a hassle to move money around to cover the check.  That also meant I did not get any frequent flier points with my Visa card!  Add to that that they parked blocking two stalls reserved for people with disabilities, and stayed there (it being most convenient for them) after I'd told them they were illegally parked, and asked them to move.  I don't recommend them.
