I was here this past Thanksgiving weekend and it's in a really great location on the strip. The rooms are spacious and has a classic feel. This casino brings my dad very good luck. My fianc√© said that the sauna area was overseen by some not so friendly people. It's convenient that there are restaurants and a buffet located at this hotel. I will return!
