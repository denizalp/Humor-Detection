This is the worst service ever. I went in with a complaint of animal that couldnt walk and was in pain. Ross Babcock is old and should retire. Just like the previous person he proceeded to do a physical exam to see if anything was broken, good thing nothing was broken. During his doing the exam the animal whimpered but Babcock was to deaf to hear it. He proceeded to talk down to me and tell me nothing was wrong with his he wasnt in pain and there is no pain medications to give this animal and did more tests. Come to find out this is what happens in the end stages of animals life.. I am sad my animal died the next day so if you worried about your animal RUN FAR AWAY FROM HERE!!!!!
