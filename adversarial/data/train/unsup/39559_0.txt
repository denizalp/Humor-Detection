Had their mecklenburg shortrib dish. It definitely wasn't what I expected. When you think of short rib, you think \"fall apart or fall off the bone. This it was not. The meat was so tuff I had to saw through the piece I was given with my butter knife. I will not be going back. People in my party will not be going back either.
