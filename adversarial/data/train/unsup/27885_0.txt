Awesome tasting appetizer specials! Fried bread with roasted tomatoes and herbs in a cream cheese base - so fresh and tasty. Fried eggplant slices with chorizo chips in a black garlic sauce - perfectly crispy with an interesting flavor to the sauce. We weren't here to party. Just staying in a hotel down the street and looking for some to-go food. They don't really do to-go, but they accomodated us. And we waited on the street side patio with a view of Notre Dame. Perfect. I'd go back for drinks, food and atmosphere.
