Monday, 3.27.17 8pm.  Second time in Kabuki for dinner.  Thoroughly impressed.  After a 20 minute wait, we were seated in Brendan's section.  Our super busy server took our order & was right on time w\/ everything!  Great job Brendan!  You made me update my review to four stars.\n\nWe weren't in a rush either so had a leisurely dinner visiting while we waited on our green tea, sake & 'Sushi Table' order.  The sushi tables range from $45-$70.  Ours was fantastic & perfect for four.  Every roll was wrapped perfectly & fresh.  It was beautiful so kudos to the sushi chefs.  I will be back again soon & am still craving sushi.
