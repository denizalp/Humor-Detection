I absolutely love love this place for so so many reasons!!\n\nNumba uno, this place is great for snacks both sweet and savory.They have a long list of items in their overwhelming menu to pick from but in my case I refuse to experiment here I love my basics which are the popcorn chicken, lobster balls, wings and their mango tapioca dessert.The popcorn chicken is fried pieces of dark meat(which I'm not too fond of) chicken topped with their special mayo, tuna dried flakes and dried seaweed with another sauce absolutely  delish!\n\nSecondly this place is very reasonably priced and on  average when I order a 3 apps and a desert my total generally is around $30.\n\nI have to mention their service even on a busy night which is normally every night is fast and the food is piping hot.Ambience wise I'm not a big fan of this place and therefore 4 stars..this place has bright lighting and tables are placed too close to one another.\n\nThere is plenty of parking out there in the shared parking lot.I do recommend this place for these reasons and I believe it's open till 2am on weekends which is an added bonus.
