I would like to personally apologize to the staff of Mulligan's for my repeated escapades after partaking in the refreshments.  There is just something about this place that encourages excess drinking...or perhaps it's just the particular group of people who I hang out with here??\n\nThe food is above-grade, I was expecting typical bar food but the dishes I have tried have been pretty good.  (that might also be due to the excess refreshments)...But I think you would be safe trying some of their specialty dishes.
