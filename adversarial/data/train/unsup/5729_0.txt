I am a fan....\n\nI have always been a Pita Jungle fan for the great food and excellent service. I  am a frequent diner at the downtown location during lunch and happy hour. I was sooooooo excited to have one go up in my neighborhood. This location is trendy with an upbeat atmosphere. What I admire most about this location is the location has plenty of parking since it is in a grocery shopping store location. \n\nWhat I like about Pita Jungle is the food is cooked to order and fresh. You get plenty of food for the price and they cater to all types of taste buds. Clean, healthy food for a great price. \n\nMy first experience at this location was take-out. I placed the order in house and waited. The wait staff immediately greeted me and got my order in. They move fast as it seems the moment I sat down my food was ready to go. Sadly one of my entrees was wrong. However, I won't allow that to stop me from coming. It was an honest mistake. The waitress put the order in properly though it was a simple mistake on the cooks end. I called the location and the person who answered the phone apologized and said they would make it up to me the next time I came in. That has been my only problem I have ever had at this location matter of fact at any Pita Jungle. I have always been happy with the service and quality taste of their food which is why I will always return.\n\nThank you Pita for a job well done on hiring great people and cooking tasty food.
