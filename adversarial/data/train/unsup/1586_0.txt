Just went to go my favorite Carbonara and the tasty meatball spaghetti to serve our crave! \nBut both are way tooooo salty that we can't even force ourselves to swallow it!\nAnd the sauce of Carbonara is not right today, either! \nThe only thing that tastes the same is the meatball!\nBig disappointment for our long time next door favorite shop, and I don't think if I would take a risk to damage my kidneys in the future
