Maybe this mall was cool a couple of decades ago, but the store selection is currently pretty sad and the mall itself is dated and run down. Your staple stores like Aeropostale, Hot Topic\/Torrid, Bath & Body Works, and the Hallmark store can be found here, along with the odd choice of Frederick's and Sleep Number, but no one really seems to get much business and everyone seems to have clearance signs permanently posted in their windows.\n\nI'm sure there are exceptions, but the customer service I've received at many of the stores here over several visits has been dismal at best- consider yourself lucky to be acknowledged. Don't be surprised if you witness shoplifting or loud fights between couples... none of the staff bat an eye.
