One of the best breakfast I've ever had. The omelet was cooked nicely, with a light serving of fruits and sliced potatoes. I went back the next day with a couple more friends and ordered their classic Eggs Benedict. It was my first time eating it, and I can definitely say my body probably hates me for putting so much goodness and butter into my bloodstream. The eggs were lovely, with a gentle stream of yolk oozingâ€‹ out onto the plate. I was greatly satisfied, so satisfied I skipped dinner. I would really recommend this place to anyone who comes to Montreal.
