Charlotte's best Tapas spot and has a pretty good wine selection, to boot!  Great bar to sit back and relax with friends.  I will say that years ago, Arpa was located a block East on Trade and Tryon and I honestly liked the menu and food quite a bit better.  It could just be me...but they have changed things up a bit since then and I'm just not quite as bit of a fan.\n\nEither way, if you are looking for some good Tapas...do NOT go any further than Arpa
