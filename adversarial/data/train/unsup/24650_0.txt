I love ZARA and will be forever a fan. Located in Fashion Show Mall on the strip.  I went back over the weekend and found some fabulous jeans...but still the found the staff like Night of the Living Dead.  Zombies!  Smile People!  They just look so miserable:(\n\nMuch better selection of trendier fashion very much in the vibe.  Many Europeans here on this day, not surprising since they all take Holiday in August-wish Americans took a month off maybe we could see better customer service:)
