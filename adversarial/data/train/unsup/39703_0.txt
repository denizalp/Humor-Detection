Great prices and ridiculously friendly staff. \n\nMy favorite things there are: mini whole-wheat pita, free samples, garlic hummus, kettle corn popcorn (pink bag), frozen fettuccine alfredo and charles shaw wine! ($3 and super tasty!) \n\nLeast favorite things: chaotic parking lot (the top lot is metered and underground parking is free but cramped, usually bike there though so don't have to deal with this), the packaging on the produce- so wasteful. \n\nThe prices are great for the quality of food, I don't do all my shopping there but there are items that I come just to TJ's to get.
