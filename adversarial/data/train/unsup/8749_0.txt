Let's take a stroll down memory lane...\n\nThe mob museum, nestled as a crown jewel of the downtown district, is centrally located in Las Vegas. Parking is easy and accessible with security monitoring the lot. Of course like most things downtown, you do pay for parking.\n\nThe museum building looks like a federal prison ($2 million well spent). Inside 3 levels of genuine artifacts stories and relics can be found. Movies, clips and interactive video showcase real accounts of crime in America and mob success and failure. \n\nA small coffee shop is on the second floor, should you get thirsty. In February a speakeasy is being built in the basement! Can't wait.\n\nA must visit at least once.
