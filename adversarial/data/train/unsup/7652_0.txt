BACKGROUND \n\nI had the opportunity to visit the Orpheum Theater when I attended Isabelle Allende's book signing of The Japanese Lover. \n\nISABELLE ALLENDE\n\nIsabelle Allende is the \"world's most widely read Spanish author\" and has written 12 books of fiction, 4 memoirs, was given the 2014 Presidential Medal of Honor by Barak Obama. Isabelle Allende is beyond inspiring and if you ever get a chance to see her, you absolutely should.\n\nORPHEUM THEATER: THE HISTORY \n\nThe historic Orpheum Theater was built in 1929, and sits in the center of downtown Phoenix within walking distance to the Phoenix Convention Center.\n\nAfter 12 years and $14 million dollars, the Orpheum Theater has been renovated, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is recognized as one of the West's most significant theater structures.\n\nTHE STORY \n\nThe book signing was at 7pm, and by the time I got there, all of the street parking was pretty full, so I parked in the nearby garage, about a block or so away. The garage seemed closed, but there was a man with a cardboard sign charging $10 per car. Which later seemed odd when everyone tried to leave, and all of the exits had the bar down, the guy was no where in sight, and someone had to go get the manager to let everyone exit.\n\nAnyway, the Orpheum Theater is very impressive walking up to the entrance at night. All of the lights and bright sign make it feel like it's a Hollywood premier. (see pic)\n\nThe inside of the building is surprisingly large and well restored and maintained. There are long dramatic hallways that lead to the main seating hall, and stairways that lead to seating areas with fireplaces. (see pic)\n\nThe main hall is very impressive and seats 1,364 people. There does not seem to be a bad seat in the house.\n\nSERVICE EXPERIENCE \n\nThe staff was cordial, although they did ask people to stop video taping and put their cell phones down from time to time.\n\nCONCLUSION \n\n5\/5 RECOMMEND \n\nOF NOTE \n\n*The Orpheum Theater has an impressive schedule of upcoming events which can be viewed at:\n\n*https:\/\/www.phoenixconventioncenter.com\/orpheum-theatre\n\n*http:\/\/www.orpheum-theater.com\/orpheum_theater_phoenix.php
