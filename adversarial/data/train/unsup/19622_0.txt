Gardunos seemed to be the casino coffee shop equivalent of a Mexican restaurant at the Palms.  This place was mediocre at best. The service was pretty slow, especially considering how unbusy the place was.  The waiter seemed completely disinterested in serving us.  To top it all off, my burrito was saltier than the dead sea!\n\nYes, they have a salsa bar, so what?  So does Rubios and Baja Fresh.  The tortilla chips weren't good enough to get a second helping.  The only reason why I could tell they weren't from a bag was because they were too oily.\n\nIf you go here, I'd stick to the bar for drinks and maybe a few appetizers.\n\nTip: When you're eating the chips and salsa, you have to yell \"gard-UNO!\" when there is just one chip left.
