Interesting set up.  You walk in to a large foyer that houses a food court to the right, and then some other miscellaneous shops to the left.  Straight ahead is the market.  I found the produce selection to be less than other Asian markets I've patroned.  It's was nice, but will probably not return unless they offer hard to find produce that I cannot find elsewhere.
