The once or twice I happen to come upon articles from this abortion of useless information and one sided reporting, the more I can't stand it. They're not even transparent about their \"agenda reporting\" anymore, it's so one sided it's almost an insult. How stupid do they think their readers are....uh...nevermind. By the site of the ads they obviously cater to unemployed teen dropout porn addicts. \n\nEven their \"Best of\" is a joke! They only include restaurants that pay for advertising in their paper. The more you pay, the more your \"The Best\", even if your not located in Phoenix. \n\nThis trash isn't worth wiping one's arse with it!
