Ambience: upscale \/dim lighting \nSo this restaurant is inside the casino it is right across from the light nightclub and citizens there also other small restaurants around the area... It was a Wednesday night we did not make a reservation... It is very nicely set up open dim lighting perfect for a romantic dinner the waiter was prepared to  take our orders and wait on our beck and call ...ordered a Pinot Noir to start off ....they accidentally brought us an onion soup which they let us eat on the house as an apology (that was nice of them) ...then my butternut squash soup arrived very creamy with pieces of crab -must try -then we also had some \nFoie gras which was very easy to swallow not a lot of flavor in my opinion  and lastly the filet mignon that I ordered medium was very dry and hard to cut !..they had given me medium well done which is not how I ordered it ...!!!...great set up good service but very expensive food and not to my expectations!
