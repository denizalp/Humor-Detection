Experience is the key word for me, when describing R+D. \n\nIt's not often you wait in a dark alley to go someplace swanky. Once called, up you get a briefing and an Inquisition: \"been here before? familiar with the rules? any food allergies?\"\n\nYou get directed to your spot. Intimate as you want it to be... make eye contact and someone may ask you about your drink -- or tell you about theirs. Don't make eye contact and you'll be left alone.\n\nYou must order from the menu. No tweaking (i.e. club soda instead of tonic is NOT an option).\n\nEach cocktail is hand crafted and takes 3-10 minutes just to MAKE. Some are performances in them self! Dramatic flaming tequila falls; bubbling \"gin\" being distilled before your very eyes, complete with a lesson on the history of gin. \n\nPrices range from $11 - $18\/drink.\n\nA very unique special occasion experience!
