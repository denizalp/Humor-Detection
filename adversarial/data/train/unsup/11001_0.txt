My roommate and I live in this part of town, so we decided to eat here this evening. It's definitely a fabulous place to get some Chinese food.  The place has  a great family atmosphere, and the food is delectable. Portions are huge, so you get a good value for money especially the set lunch option. \nIf you're not in the mood for going out, they also provide a delivery service. I'm giving them 5 stars because I'm a generous reviewer especially if the service is friendly, courteous, and fast.
