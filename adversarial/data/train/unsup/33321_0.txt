Before the rest of this, I must disclaim that in general all-you-can-eat restaurants aren't for me. Eating responsibly doesn't usually go well with eating from an unlimited quantity. For this restaurant, the quality did not suffer. All the meat, vegetables, noodles, and sauces were delicious. Their hottest sauce is the hottest article I've found in Madison, though I don't really have much experience with the hot wings market here.\nSadly, every time I've eaten the complementary soup, it hasn't paired well with the food. Either eat it first or order the salad, I guess. Also the line to have your food grilled can get a little long at times, though it's not so terrible as long as you've already eaten your first serving. I guess there's another reason to eat the soup\/salad first...
