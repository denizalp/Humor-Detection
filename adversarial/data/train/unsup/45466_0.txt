We were in the NY NY Casino around dinner time and saw Tom's Urban. I looked at the menu and saw they had Frog Legs and Grits, whoa, I'm in. My plate was mounded with legs and, if I had been staying at a hotel with a fridge, I would have asked for a to go box. As it was I forced my self, lol, to eat them all. We will be back on our next Vegas trip
