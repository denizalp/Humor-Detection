Let me start off by saying I think that my bad experience may be based on how busy they were. The parking lot was packed. After ordering, I tried to find somewhere to sit. I finally found a place in the atrium. Unfortunately it was too far away to use their wifi. After waiting about 20 minutes on my food, I decided to get it to go instead. The girl at the counter was very pleasant and helpful in getting it changed over. As soon as I got to outside I realized the cup of soup was spilling in the bag. Btw- it was portobello & onion, the mushroom seemed like an afterthought in decent french onion soup. I then noticed that the full sandwich I paid for looked very small(they only gave me 1\/2 of my full sandwich-the pieces didn't match based on the diagonal cut). At this point, I didn't feel like even going back in to deal with the missing half sandwich.  I'm sure someone in the kitchen enjoyed it. I liked my half of the turkey and brie. I'll probably go back, but not if they are packed.
