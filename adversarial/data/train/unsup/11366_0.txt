It's a real shame.  But some proprietors apparently don't know when to leave well enough alone.  \n\nAfter creating what I considered to be a perfect rendition of a New York style pizza, someone decided to change the formula.  So, on our last visit, instead of being presented with relatively thin but supple and highly malleable slices of pizza, I was instead greeted by a Large Pepperoni, Mushroom, Italian Sausage, & Green Bell Pepper New York Style Pizza made with high-grade San Marzano Tomato Sauce but fashioned with cooked dough that was, alas, both too thin and too crisp.  The toppings were still first rate.  But changing the recipe did not improve the product.  Diane, too, liked the toppings on her large Ham New York Style Pizza but also deplored the thinning and crispness of the new model.  The place was packed on a Sunday night.  But service by friendly staffers was excellent.\n\nUnless the New York Style pizza served here is restored to its earlier, more traditional excellence, I may be back--but definitely not as often.
