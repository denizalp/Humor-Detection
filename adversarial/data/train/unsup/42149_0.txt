Well, it used to be a tremendously, customer service orientated pharmacy, but everything has changed.  Three months in a row they have botched my prescription where my doctor has had to call them every single month to ask them to get it straight and yet as I wait here yet again in line, they have managed to mess up yet another order.  I see that there is a new female manager which is fine, but what was wrong with the old one? He always got my prescriptions correct. They used to be fast, expedient and great. Now they say things like, \"this won't be ready today, you're doctor never called it in (which is BS) and my manager has to look at this can we have the script back with the receipt and you can come back later\" uh excuse me? My medicine does not have preservatives in the vials. They have to be injected at the same time every week. What is going on with this pharmacy? Is it all Walgreens or should I switch stores?  I feel badly posting this but it's getting ridiculous....
