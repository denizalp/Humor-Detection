Another great addition to the Ossington strip!\n\nThe menu consists of some traditional bistro fare including steak & fries and crispy duck leg, as well as other tempting items such as fried chicken and lobster & corned beef hash. They also serve brunch on the weekends (11am to 2pm), which I've heard is fantastic... maybe for my next visit!\n\nWhat went in my belly:\n\nPerogies ($11) - if there's one thing you're going to order from the Saint, it's gotta be the perogies. They're stuffed with pork belly (yes - pork belly!), topped with caramelized onions, green onions and smoked bacon (of course). If only all perogies were made this way...\n\nSteak tartare ($14) - meat was finely chopped, seasoned nicely but overall just okay.  Not one of the best I've had. \n\nSavoury Pie ($22) - changes daily, today's was the pork tortiere. Comes out piping hot in a large cast iron pan. The two of us packed about a third of it to go.. very comforting, filling and tasty.\n\nCauliflower & Bacon ($6) - Perfectly cooked and the bacon certainly didn't hurt. A great side dish I'd gladly order again.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable experience. Solid food, good service and great cocktails!
