They honestly have no clue about how to do a High Tea, so I'd skip that in favor of the happy hour, which has the unusual nibbles and cheap drink prices that you really want, and the lobby location really hearkens back to an earlier era. There's no dress code, which is a plus and a minus, but as long as you have company it won't matter too much.\n\nI can't see making this a regular stop but something to try once for sure to experience the William Penn's vibe. It's super-public - everybody coming and going will see you and vice versa -- so if that's not your thing, take note. I kinda like doing this every now and then. I thought I saw Betty Draper order a Gimlet.\n\nI note as ever you can order \"off menu\" if you ask the server, since there's but the one kitchen for the five food\/drink venues in the hotel.
