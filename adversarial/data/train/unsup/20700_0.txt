This is one of the few real coffeehouses I've found in the east valley.  There are pretenders in the area, but the 2 Coffee Rush locations in the EV are definitely authentic coffeehouses.\n\nWhat sets apart a real coffeehouse from a pretender?  Tough question.  You'll know when you're in one.  There's a more connected feel.  There's a sense of community.  The employees know coffee & tea.  The employees take pride in a quality product.  There's a relaxed vibe.\n\nBoth locations feature Baklava-one of my favorite pastries.  Yum.\n\nBonus:  free wireless & several PCs to use.
