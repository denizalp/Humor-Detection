There are a couple of Raising Cane's around town but I like this one because *TIP:* they offer you a student discount with a Rebel ID. I mean, being so close to UNLV, it makes sense, but this is the only location that does it and I don't think a lot of people know about it!\n\nStaff is always friendly and just like any other canes, I love the food.
