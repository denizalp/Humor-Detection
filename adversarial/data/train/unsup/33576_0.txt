So I was intrigued by the name. A place that focuses on soup? Normally a restaurant has a soup section on the menu, but not a soup menu.\n\nI went here for dinner and loved how simple their menu was. Less than 15 total items and a few daily specials. The focus is soups and wraps. You can also get a combination for ~$10. \n\nRavi's soup was outstanding, the ingredients were fresh, and the flavors were deep and rich. Ravi (who wasn't in when I dined) made the receipe's and has earned my respect! A balance of flavors that were outstanding!  I also got the chicken wrap and loved, again, all fresh ingredients, and a decent portion size. \n\nI strongly recommend you check the place out AT LEAST once, get a combo and enjoy the daily specials! They have vegetarian options if you need them! You'll love the full flavor and won't feel guilty or like you've overeaten. \n\nhave fun!
