I live in the area and have been here often over the years. Best breakfast and fast service definitely. For a while I was going fairly regularly. I stopped for this reason - the one waitress who is usually surly (although she has improved in her attitude) told me I couldn't delay as they were busy. This was because I was alone and I always take a book when eating alone. This does not mean I am going to linger after I have eaten, I have no interest in doing so. I was in and out within 20mins. and always wished I'd said to her \"was that fast enough for you?\" The irony was that the place had several empty booths when I left. I was extremely resentful of being treated that way just because I was alone; and resisted going back for a very long time because of it.\n\nI finally gave in and have visited a few times since. While this particular waitress has improved in attitude, she will still place me at a tiny \"half-table\" in the back corner because I'm alone; I would be willing to bet if I had someone with me that would not happen even though the table could fit two.\n\nMy 4 stars in fairness is for the food. Definitely a step up from Sunset Grill as one reviewer stated (who serve good food, but far too much of it).
