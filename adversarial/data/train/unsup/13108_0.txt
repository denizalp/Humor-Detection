Down Time Wines has me totally Uncorked! \nI met these fine fellas at an Anniversary event at Nicantoni's where they were sharing their locally homemade wines. A business that started in a kitchen has grown into a sweet local business. I've never been a big fan of wine, thought it was a drink of the older generation and the proper folk with their pinkies out...or is that tea? Anyway after one sip of the Tropical Lime wine and I was hooked, and I bought a bottle to take home. I finally made it over to their Chandler shop, where they not only sale wine but host karaoke, painting and personal parties. (follow on FB for info) The owner let me sample a few wines and wine made gummy bears...yes you read that right GUMMY BEARS MADE WITH WINE!!! Needless to say I stumbled, I mean walked out with a few containers of those babies for adult movie treats and a few more bottles of wine. In addition to the Tropical Lime I bought a Vanilla Fig red wine, which my daughter said didn't like fig and drank the whole bottle in one night! These wines are magically filtered not to induce headaches or wake up with a hangover, lucky for her! And lucky for me the wine is not only fabulous is totally affordable each bottle $16 and under...\nI'll be back soon...I'm out of Wine!
