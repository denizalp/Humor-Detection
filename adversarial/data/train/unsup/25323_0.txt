We stopped in here the other day, mostly because I have never been before.  I saw women's clothes in the window, but upon closer inspection I would say about 80% of the assortment is for men.  Lucky guys.  The assortment actually appears to be well curated.  The sales people were helpful - after about 90 minutes of fairly attentive service my bf left with a tux and a suit.  I'm happy with the level of service we received.\n\nI wish they had more stuff for ladies, but I guess I have a ka-zillion stores to choose from so I shouldn't be picky.  \n\nWorth the visit.
