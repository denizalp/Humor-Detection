Yelper's the only thing Monte Carlo has going for it is the location. it's down the block from Paris hotel and a 5 minute walk to Bellagio but besides being close to the airport and tolerable (especially in triple digits temps), walking distance from 2 nice hotels, STEER FAR AND CLEAR!\n\nMy hun and I were stranded in Vegas due to our flight being CANCELLED BY MOFO DELTA! Lucky for us, we had checked our flight status before heading to the airport and found out our flight had been canceled without any notification from Delta! Those incompetent MOFO's did absolutely NOTHING to accommodate us and offered up useless apologies which did not improve our situation. My hun and I didn't look forward to spending the eve at the hotel and so we quickly booked a night's stay at the Monte Carlo.\n\nThe rate is not that cheap $202 total given the sad state of the hotel. The pool area is pathetic with absolutely no view besides the huge construction site next door. The interior of the hotel is definitely in need of an update or entire renovation. The carpet smells terrible and the lack of AC in the elevators added to it reeking terribly! The rooms are small, dark and the furniture is very outdated! \n\nOur toilet wouldn't flush unless we kept our hand on the flusher and our shower was clogged up so bad I was worried I'd flood the bathroom if I spent more than 5 minutes in the shower! \n\nWe couldn't wait to check out first thing the next morning after seeing how pathetic the accommodations were!
