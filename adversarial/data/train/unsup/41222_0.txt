Was visiting from Los Angeles with some friends. Had been drinking there for a cool 3 hrs with the boys. It was finally my turn to buy a pitcher of beer and they refused me because my ID was vertical instead of horizontal. I went downstairs and continued to drink the same beer that I had been drinking for the past hour.....all of a sudden approached by security and escorted out for not having a horizontal ID. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Had been drinking there for the past 3 hous and all of a sudden its not okay and i get kicked out for my ID being vertical instead of horizontal. I am 23 years old for goodness sakes. What a load of shit. Wasn't the only one with the horizontal  ID but was the the only escorted out of the place. What a terrible experience. Thanks for nothing. Hope you guys figure your shit out sometime soon.
