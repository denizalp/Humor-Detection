This place is adorable, and they have a great selection of foods and baked goods.  \n\nBut, despite working in this building twice a week I rarely frequent the Roastery for two reasons:\n1) They don't take debit which can be very annoying at times\n2) Their coffee isn't very fresh, so unless you are getting made-to-order types of caffeine, the coffee is meh.\n\nReally cute place, decent food, a bit pricey and the coffee underwhelms.
