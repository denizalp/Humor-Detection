I was absolutely appalled at this meal. I would have been mortified to serve it and the behavior of the staff made it all the worse. My steak was inedible and as I have pointed out, I do not return food to the kitchen. Either they get it right the first time or I don't want them near my food for another go round. When I left my steak uneaten the server asked if I enjoyed it. Really? What did he think?\nI pointed out that it was inedible and he told me if I only let him know, he would have brought me another. But at this point, it was too late.\n\nHe explained this often happens and they just serve it to the pigs. Gosh, thanks. The pigs? So it's either me or the pigs. Nice visual. \n\nRather then an apology or can we bring you a glass of wine, a few other employees made their way over and short of actually making it right, let us leave feeling like we we had done something wrong. Maybe it because we weren't dining with movie stars. I'm not sure what it was but something just didn't click.\n\nWith so many fabulous restaurants in Las Vegas, this one should be avoided. Bad food and rude wait staff and a $300.00 bill. What more could I ask for?
