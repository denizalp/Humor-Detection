Just bought a home over here and wanted to explore the area. Really happy we went here. Our waitress was extremely good. Super helpful and outgoing. We ordered the fried pickles. I must say they are the most uniquely cut fried pickle we have ever had. They were by far the most delicious. I highly recommend. I ordered the tortilla soup and cesaer salad. The salad was bland, but the soup was delicious. My husband ordered the fish tacos and thought they were great. Overall, good service, clean, quality food and reasonable prices. I look forward to coming back.
