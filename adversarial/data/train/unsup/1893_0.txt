This is an outline of the FAILS of this dental clinic.  Granted I went here once before they partnered with Image Dental and I had a good experience. However, since they have merged, things have gone south.\n\nI booked my appointment in Aug 2014 at my last visit for 6 months out, that brings us to early March 2015.  Come the day before my appointment, I thought it was a little strange I did not get a reminder call.  So I call up the clinic to verify my appointment.  They look and cannot find my appointment in the system...apparently when they merged, the appointments did not merge with their new system.  FAIL #1! Practice management tip...perhaps you should have sent letters to your existing patients informing them of this issue so they could call and re-schedule the appointment.  Okay, no big deal, I'll make another appointment.  I asked to be seen with ONLY Dr. Tongsiri, since my coworker had been to the Sahara Image Dental location and were abhorred by the service they received there and the dentists at that location.  I requested to be seen at their W. Craig road location with Dr. Tongisiri.  I was given an appointment at 5:00PM.  I get a call the next day, Dr. Tongisiri is not actually available on that day at that time, we can reschedule you for a different day.  FAIL #2!!  Okay, I am given another appointment again at 5:00PM.  Next day, I get another phone call...oh I'm sorry Dr. Tongisiri's last appointment is actually at 4:00PM....uh okay so why did you offer me another appointment at 5:00PM?!  FAIL #3!!!.  So, okay I decide I'll just keep that appointment time and see whichever provider is there that day.  Again, come the day before my appointment...no reminder call...I again call to verify my appointment, they forgot to schedule it!  FAIL #4!!!!  At this point, I should have walked but I wanted to give them another chance...yes I was foolishly patient with this office.  Okay, so come today, my appointment was verified two days before...should be smooth sailing.  I get to the office, fill out the paperwork and come to find out with my private Metlife Dental Plan, I still owe $100 for a exam\/cleaning...mind you this does not include x-rays since I declined them for medical reasons.  So I ask, \"How is it that I had no payment due in August 2014 when I last saw you and my dental benefits have not changed?  Do you no longer take my insurance?\"  The receptionist replies well we of course take your insurance or you wouldn't be here, but we accept it \"differently.\"  No offense, I'm in the medical field, you either accept the insurance or you do not.  And you accept the terms of their coverage or you do not.  So if I'm being billed, it probably means you are billing in excess of my insurance for bogus items.  \n\nBelow is a copy and paste of my coverage from my insurance...\n\nBitewing-Single Image  2 per 1 period for children separated by 6 months, 1 per 1 period for adults (liberal interpretation)\nLast date of service 01\/20\/14  100%  No deductible\n\nComplete Set Radiographic Images  1 time in 60 months\nLast date of service 11\/24\/09  100%  No deductible\n\nOral Exams  1 time in 6 months\nLast date of service 08\/27\/14  100%  No deductible\n\nProphylaxis\/ Cleaning  1 time in 6 months\nLast date of service 08\/27\/14  100%  No deductible\n\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm covered for a routine cleaning and exam 100% with no deductible as plainly spelled out in my plan.  Mind you I have no cavities, no fillings.  So what in the world are you trying to bill me for? THIS IS FAIL #5!!!!!  The front desk lady then offered to perhaps get around this $100 fee, but I would have to assume the responsibility of being billed if she could not make it work.  This front desk lady must think I'm a fool, you just said you would bill me later essentially..... NO DEAL. This practice is very questionable since they have merged with Image Dental in terms of their billing practices and competency of staff. Even if you have been here before and nothing on your side has changed, make sure you ask what you will owe for the exam even if you think it will be a routine exam.  It would have been nice for the office to be up front when I made the appointment to tell me that they were now accepting my insurance \"differently.\" Whatever that means.....\n\nI literally made an appointment in the car outside their office with my last dentist, he may be further but he is a great dentist that does his own cleanings. His staff is honest, efficient, and on top of things.  They were able to verify no deductible or payment due for an exam and cleaning with my insurance.  So please explain to me Silver State Smiles why are you charging an extra $100 for the same services on the same dental insurance plan?\n\nSo here's a plug for anyone looking for a new dentist, go to Dental Plus with Dr. David Tong,  He has extended hours as well like Silver State Smiles and you will not deal with the incompetency that I dealt with or be told your insurance will be accepted \"differently.\"
