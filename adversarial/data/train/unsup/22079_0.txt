I signed up for their e-club and got myself a buy one get one offer for my birthday. It's $46.99 per person (dinner) so this coupon was a MUST use for me and my buddy. We were seated by the salad area so everything was easy access for us. We tried every meat that has past our table (might have missed some). ALL of the steaks tasted like an orgasm in our mouths! Kidding! Seriously,  great food all over and great service. Our server, Bonnie was GREAT as well!\n\nTdB keep it up!
