Place is pretty awesome! Spacious with a laid back atmosphere and the patio is beautiful! Staff is friendly and were always smiling. We ordered all apps: Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower  the best I ever had! Parmesan Truffle Frites and Ahi Tuna Poke! Topped it off with \"Just About Bottomless\" cocktails! Got my vote!
