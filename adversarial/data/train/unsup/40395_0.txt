I had a haircut and shampoo with Matsumi! I have to say she's the best hairstylist I had so far in Toronto! Her attention to detail and variety of cutting skills helps to trim my messy ugly hair into exactly what i wanted! My bang used to go to sides and my bare forehead will show, but after her cut, my bang is straight and neat! The hair length was adjusted with layers and it felt easier to wash or style when I'm at home. Definitely coming back next time for a haircut with her!
