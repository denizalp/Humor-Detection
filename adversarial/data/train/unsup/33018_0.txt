I went to the ER early Sunday morning (Nov. 2), and i have to say the staff was great, and the doctor that morning was even better.  I really had a great experience with everyone and they were professional and friendly.  I was recommended to go to the \"Bone & Joint Specialist\" (which was a disappointing terrible disaster, and I will never go back there again) and that was a disaster, but the Hospital\/ER did a very good job and I was impressed with their knowledge, professionalism and bedside manner.  They helped me promptly and carefully, and really seemed to be concerned and care about my injury.
