Let's face it - this is a tourist bar. I should not be going here, but needed a drink within walking range. It should be renamed Midwest Sports Grill. All the annoying Chicago types who think they own the town in the winter. They rival the Scottsdale douchebags for annoyingness if that is even a word. The beers are reasaonable at $4 a pop for Bud Light, but the food is very average. It might be good if your a hotel guest and are clueless about the area, but that's about all. The corned beef in the rueben is of sliced deli variety and that just leaves the whole sandwich at average to below average. I suppose they can say they have good, beer battered fries, but that is not something that wins awards.
