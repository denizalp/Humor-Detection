DeFalco's is one of my absolute favorite places! You order at the back counter and then take a seat among the shelves of Italian goodies. They have so many imported Italian products that I feel like I'm back in Italy when I'm there. The line can get long during lunchtime, but it moves pretty fast and you get to look at all the different wines, meats, cheeses, and desserts while you wait. The staff is friendly and helpful. The portions are huge and very reasonably priced. I'm on a mission to try everything on their menu. My favorites so far are the chicken parm sub (perfect on their Italian sub roll), the cheesesteak (both beef and chicken are fantastic), the Italian combo sandwich, and the il purista (so good on a baguette). The pizza and cannoli are also fantastic. I stop here whenever I'm in the area, no matter what time of day.
