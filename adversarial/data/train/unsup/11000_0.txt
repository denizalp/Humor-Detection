Ahhh finally a place that makes the best crepes!!\nWe had the banana nutella crepe and the apple crisp crepe. .. Every bite of that crepe was worth gaining that few extra pounds. \n I cant even describe how delicious these crepes were, you just gotta go and try it, but beware because they're addicting!!!\nDamn it, my mouth is watering, I need my crepes!!!
