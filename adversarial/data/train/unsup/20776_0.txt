As much as I would like to support any new local enterprise I was disappointed with both visits I made to this new store. First visit was okay, the lady made me a great meatloaf sandwich on a house baked bun and I had it with a coffee, yum yum. However the shop layout appeared to have been put up with little retail in mind. Two examples: \n1. An old retro style frig filled to the tits with pizza dough, when I opened the door the stuff literally exploded onto the floor. The front window display was an ancient wooden rack filled with plastic bags full of day old reduced breads. How appealing is that? \n2. Later as we were finishing up our snack the store filled up with customers. The lady at the cash (an owner I presume) had her hands full servicing the customers, however she received no help from the other employees that were placidly working\/chatting in the production area in the rear of the shop. \nTo the Owner\/Nice lady: Crack that whip!!\n3. A year goes by. One fine spring day I passed by and went in for a coffee and bun. Here is what I saw: A woman sitting on a stool at a mezzanine table, her back to me. She had a newspaper spread out with all of her stuff lying on the table. I thought, hmmm Owner? Customer? Wasn't sure. There was no one else around in the shop. I hesitated... the woman didn't turn around, she was wearing a pair of low rise tights and displaying a good 6 inches of sweaty ass crack. I quickly left, shaking my head as I did. Not sure what I had just witnessed other than it was really unappealing. I never returned. I cannot get that image out of my mind no matter how hard I try. What would possess someone to let it all hang out in such a blatant manner?
