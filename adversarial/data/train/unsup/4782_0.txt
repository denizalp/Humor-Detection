I brought 8 kids here to play some board games as part of a church event. We booked a table ahead of time. \nOnce we got there we got seated right away. Only 1 worker there but he was super friendly and even helped me explain some of the games to the kids.\nWe did not have any trouble finding any games suitable for kids under age 14. They all enjoyed their time here. \nThere were non-caffeinated drink options available like smoothies and sodas. Had their passion fruit soda, it was good. They have gelato as well but no food available. They also have teas that come with a  timer for optimal steeping time which I thought was interesting... \nDuring the time here I saw maybe 2 other groups come in. \nPrice is $12 for all you can play. Includes a drink less than $3.25. You could add extra money to get something bigger. \nI liked it here cuz it wasn't too crowded and pretty quiet.
