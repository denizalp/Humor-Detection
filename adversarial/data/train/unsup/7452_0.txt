Came here for lunch the other day, well actually I was brought here for lunch. It wasn't my choice. \n\nLocated at the Desert Ridge, this restaurant is near the AMC theater, so many people are around, I thought it would be a good place for people watch.\n\nThey ordered sashimi and a couple of rolls for appetizer for a group of share. Sashimi was served in a nice presentation. Quality of fish wasn't bad at all but I had them better at a nearby sushi restaurant. \n\nI ordered sushi plate for lunch. 7 pcs came with an order and it was $15. They added rice inside the egg, I thought that was interesting.  Lunch comes with miso soup, they did good with dashi but mushroom sort of ruined it. \n\nService was a bit slow side. Well, sometimes too fast, she wanted to clear plates before we finished. It was business lunch, and we often paused eating to discuss, she thought we finished eating.\n\nI wouldn't expect anything authentic here. Good place to come for people watching from patio seats.
