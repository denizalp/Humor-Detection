Before I left home for college I used to accompany my mother to the Chico's boutique in SouthPark Mall.  Since the store mostly targets the mom-crowd, I found the merchandize in there not really enticing for someone in my age bracket or for those into sexy club wear (Cougars, you should shop elsewhere).  However, my mom was in (fashion-blind) heaven.  I noticed the other ladies in there in a similar (tasteless) trance.  Maybe it has to do with the major vanity sizing (and boring cuts) with Chico's offerings? \n\nThey don't really use conventional sizing, but a 1, 2, 3 system that corresponds to small, medium, and large, albeit without the 3 offending those who would wear a large, and the size 1 making them feel really small.  Of course, their size 1 really corresponds with the \"standard\" size 8-10, so it's vanity sizing to the extreme.  The sizes range from 00-4, but 1,2,3 gets the most floor space.\n\nOr maybe it's all of their \"one-of-a-kind detail\" advertising, even though all that can be seen is forgettable mass production of mom-wear. \n\nRegardless, there are some nice things in there for those who fit their clientele criteria.  This is not a place for those looking to be on the forefront of fashion.
