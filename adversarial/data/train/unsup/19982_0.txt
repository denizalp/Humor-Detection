Landed this hotel on Priceline and we ended up with a HUGE room -- big living room, full-sized kitchen with all the fixings, floor-to-ceiling windows, walk-in shower, TV in the bathroom, and a full-sized jacuzzi.\n\nAaaaaand that's where the awesomesauce runs out.\n\nJust try getting someone from the hotel to answer a phone call, like, say, room service.\n\nGo ahead, I'll wait.\n\n(45 minutes pass)\n\nStill on the line? Yeah. I was too. Once you finally get room service, there was a bunch of stuff on the menu they wouldn't bring you because the room service menu actually belonged to the Planet Hollywood main hotel, not the \"towers\" that we were at. When it did come, it was pretty underwhelming.\n\nAnd the hotel staff really didn't give a rats ass about helping you at all -- about anything. I know Priceline customers are last on the priority list, but the service was downright rude at times.\n\nThe location was fine -- right in the middle of the PH Mile Mall with two theatres, lots of shopping, and... wait for it... a casino! I know!! Who'd have guessed?! ;-)\n\nIf it weren't for the amazing room, this place would have gotten one star.\n\nOne more thing was that... WAIT! ZOMG! Room service picked up the phone! Hold on a sec... \n\n...no, no... someone picked up then put me back on hold again. {sigh}
