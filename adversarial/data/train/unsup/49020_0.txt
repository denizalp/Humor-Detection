Ate here tonight celebrating a family members birthday. Had heard about this place from multiple friends so we decided to give it a try. When you first walk in you are impressed with the ambiance and the overall atmosphere, very cool. Love the open kitchen and waterfront patio. Our server, sorry could not remember her name, was very good, very attentive and was on top of things all night. For appetizers we ordered a plate of bruschetta and the Fritto Misto (calamari, shrimp, and zucchini). The bruschetta was very good but I am unsure as to why the Fritto Misto is even on the menu. I could literally go to any dive bar and get the same dish. Thats my bad for not knowing what Fritto Misto meant, had to look it up, but I like calamari and shrimp so I ordered it. So on to entrees, two people ordered the sea bass, one salmon, one spicy shrimp risotto and I ordered the sea scallops. Everybody loved their entrees including myself. Scallops weren't grainy at all and matched with the polenta it was a very solid dish. We all ordered desert and everybody loved their gelato and lemon cake. Overall Olive and Ivy is very good and I will be going back, just won't be ordering the dive bar appetizer.
