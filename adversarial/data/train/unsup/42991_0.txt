I decided to switch my prenatal care from a traditional OBGYN and deliver at Babymoon around week 30 of my first pregnancy. After touring both the birth center and St. Joe's L&D department we were certain hospital birth was not for us. From the time we scheduled our tour to now, (almost 8 weeks after delivery)we have had an incredible experience. The billing person, Janet helped me convince my insurance company to cover part of the cost making delivery at Babymoon possible for our budget. Ultimately, the cost was more for us to go the birth center route than the traditional hospital setting but it was so worth it! All of my appointments with the midwives were at least half an hour. They were genuinely interested in how I was feeling physically and emotionally. The Lamaze series of classes that were included were phenomenal. Even if you aren't delivering at Babymoon you can still take these classes- do it! They were fun and informative, we used so much of what we learned during my labor and within the first week of my son's delivery. By the time I hit 37 weeks I could call the office and say \"this is Aimee\" and they knew exactly who I was. Since having my baby I have participated in the mommy group they hold once a week. There I have made a few friends and started to build a community. Right after having my son I was having difficulty with breastfeeding.  They had me come in right away to meet with the lactation midwife. She gave me her phone number and answered all my text messages with questions and concerns weeks after meeting with her. My experience has been wonderful. I will be returning for all future pregnancies. If you are on the fence I hope this helps!
