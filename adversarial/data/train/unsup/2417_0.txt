Awesome hotdogs next to a gas station!? Yes!! SO MUCH YES!! This cute, small, family owned hot dog joint is the real deal. Any kind of topping you could possibly ask for.... its here!! From sweet dogs, to savory, and every in between.\n\nThis interior was super cute. Lots of white and green. Very modern looking. \n\nThey have Belgium Waffles for dessert. We did not get a chance to try them this time around but I will be trying them very soon. They looked awesome. \n\nThe family who ran the place was there, taking orders, ringing you up, and making your dog. They were super freiendly and made sure you were enjoying every bite. I highly recommend coming and cheching this joint out.
