Sumo Boy is a really silly name. I know. But it's not really bad. It's decent quality for Mentor, Ohio. Decent for the price you pay as well.\n\nI've eaten at Sumo Boy a handful of times and have never been disappointed. \n\nTheir menus are weird and maybe a bit sketchy. Some of the servers are probably too talkative and tell you a bit too much about their personal lives. That's better than Johnny Emoface not speaking to you at all though. Right? \n\nThis is not a fine dining establishment by any means. \nWhat it is: quality sushi at quality prices. Nothing frilly, different, or exciting. \n\nThey are kid friendly and don't mind one bit that your child spits out their shrimp or chicken teriyaki on the floor. They won't even allow you to try and clean it up. They insist on doing it themselves. Cool.
