Located a bit off of the Fremont Street, downtown, in a hipster area, O Face Doughnuts is a culinary delight in terms of doughnuts. The flavor combinations are exciting and inventive, even more so than the other fancy doughnut spots I've patronized. They take their recipes to the next level, here. I am reminded of recipes from Dynamo Donuts in SF, Sidecar in the OC, and the now defunt Glazed Donut Bistro in Weho. \n\nI had a Vegan berry thyme donut and it was amazing. The filling was complex, the raised donut was simple, and it all worked together really well. We also tried the apple bacon fritter which functioned as a deliciously dense and filling breakfast pastry.
