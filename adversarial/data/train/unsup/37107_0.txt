Stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Large screen in the lounge showing World Cup matches was the perfect spot to have a bite and a drink. The guacamole was some of the best I've had and the burger did not disappoint. Cocktail menu is creative and delicious, the Daquiri Ahumado is like nothing I've had before smoked strawberries and Venezuelan rum! The Manager Cecilia stopped by and she actually created that cocktail, way to go! She chatted with us about the restaurant and the tequila and rum selections, extremely knowledgeable and just really warm and inviting. Can't wait to come back and try more delicious food and talk rum with Cecilia.
