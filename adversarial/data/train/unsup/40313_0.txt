I saw Dr. Burns. She was knowledgeable, helpful, and comprehensive. I'll be making the 40 minute drive to see her again.\n\nBut it was the little things about this place that bothered me enough to give a 3 star rating. The front desk girl was stand-offish and not very friendly, except when a regular walked in and she gushed all over her. Then she tells me they don't take Discover. Then she tells me there's a $2 fee to use a debit or credit card. I'm sorry, but that fee is your responsibility...jeez. The exam room was a little grungy and I didn't feel like things were that sanitary. At least it didn't smell like urine.
