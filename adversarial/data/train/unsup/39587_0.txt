An enchilada eatery that thrives doign things the right way. With fresh ingredients, fast preparation, and delicious results. By giving the people the choicest choices of ingredients and letting them decide how to dress it up, it gets a lot of comparisons to Chipotle, and while Chipotle deserves all due respect, Gadzooks has truly raised the bar for Phoenix-based Mexican food. The green chile pork and tomatillo chicken are delicious, the braised short rib is savory, the jack potatoes are unreal. Add the hand mixed guacamole for extra creaminess, the slaw for some crunch, or get the fried egg on top for an authenic (and filling) flavor experience. Go early to avoid the longer lines, just don't get it to-go, it's best when eaten fresh out of the oven. My only regret after each trip is not having enough room in the stomach to eat three more orders.
