Still the best Hainan chicken in the game! I just love everything about this dish, from its exquisite taste to its beautiful presentation. The chicken is organic and free range, and it is ridiculously soft and tender. The chicken fat rice is so flavorful, and the dipping sauces are the game changers, especially their house made chili sauce. I also got the Chinese sausage as one of my sides, and it complemented this dish very well. \n\nAnother one of Chef Sheridan's dishes you do not wanna miss out on is the Kaya Toast with foie gras. Served on a brioche toast which is made locally, it is topped with seared foie gras, a fried egg, and coconut egg jam. The dish is also decorated with their house sweet soy glaze and flowers, and it's just so pretty to look at! One bite of this, and I was in a state of pure bliss. So good! \n\nThe chicken wings (humongous) with honey butter and angry sauce were also really good, very crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside! The angry sauce reminded me of Korean chicken wings with a gochujang glaze. The Son-In-Law Deviled eggs with the tamarind glaze was bomb as well!\n\nService was amazing! The entire staff is so friendly and attentive. They also have a full bar now and are open for dinner. I tried the Le Grand \"flocktail,\" which is vodka with lime, honey, bitters, and Le Grand Courtage garnished with rosemary, and it was very refreshing. I also admire the decor and ambience. It's very hip, modern, and rustic, and has a downtown vibe to it. I can't wait to come back!
