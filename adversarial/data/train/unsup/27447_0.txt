Really was anxious to try it.  I really like good Persian kabob. It was very clean inside and the food appearance was 5 stars but I really didn't find the taste to be the same as other Persian restaurants. It wasn't bad, just didn't taste as good as it looked.  I will return and try it again. Would like to see musto-mucir (yogurt dip with shallots) on the menu.
