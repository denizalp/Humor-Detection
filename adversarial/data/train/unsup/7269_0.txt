This place is TOO loud, too crowded and the staff is RUDE.  When they said \"not your daddy's steak house\", what they should have said is we got rid of all the good stuff from your daddy's steak house and kept all the bad.\n\nYes it has a sexy vibe, after all the hostess staff and female bar staff will remind you of Coyote Ugly, you have club music playing at club decibels and its dark.  What this means to you, is bartenders with attitude, hostesses that only pay attention to the men in your group and an envirnoment so loud you can't hold a conversation.\n\nThe saving grace was our server and the food.  Our server was top notch and very personable, the food was good, but not good enough to put myself through that experience again.  The manager could care less about his hostesses behavior, there were no apologies just excuses and he even lied to us.\n\nIf you have to entertain your in-laws and you HATE holding a conversation with them, then this is the place to be.  You can easily ignore them through the meal because you can honestly tell them you can't hear a word they are saying and eat in peace (as long as you can ignore the hear shattering music).  Also bring your ones with you when you use the bathroom and when I say bathroom I mean as in ONE AND ONLY ONE stall per ladies and one for men.  Get ready to wait in line or you have to leave the restaurant to use one.\n\nIf you STILL want to come to STK make sure you have the truffle mac n cheese.
