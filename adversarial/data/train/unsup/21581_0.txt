I'm a huge plant person. Love to garden and barely stepped into this star nursery for the first time since I moved here 5 years ago.( I cannot compare this location to any other).\n\n We were greeted at the door by a kid who whispered to us and I continued to ask him the same question until I could actually hear him. He was the only one to greet us the entire time we were there. Prices are a little high and there should be no reason for it, they could be competitive and beat all the big companies but whatever. Their plants were horrendous! They all looked to be on their last leg. I'm sure most people visit here if they are looking for something that they cant find elsewhere but Home Depot had a better selection.  \n\nWhat made me super sad is that growing up there was a nursery close to home that we would shop at and it was like a staple to my youth. This place could very much be the same thing to many people in the area but their prices, lack of quality and impersonal type of CS is what made me walk out never wanting to return. I really walked in hoping to make this into something similar to what I grew up with but no way. \n\nLet's revisit the fact that not one person asked if we were doing okay and when we checked out (our 1 item) she barely said hi and handled the transaction with no CS skills at all. Everyone around her was the same way. We commented loudly about it. I'm getting really burned out on the rude ways of Vegas for sure! \n\nSo for being a \"local\" business that's been in the community for awhile, they sure live up to the rude Vegas style of high prices for  low quality product with a side of rude employees . They should learn to want to entice people to shop there not push them back to big corps!
