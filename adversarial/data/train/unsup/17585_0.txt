I have never come here to fill a prescription and before the CVS opened in CityScape this was my closest drugstore.  But I still make the trip here if I am out driving around and not walking downtown. \nThey have done a good job of maintaining the exterior to make it look modern and clean.  If you have never been there before it can be a bit confusing as to where the entrance is, it's off the parking lot to the east.   \n\nIt is across from the McDowell light rail stop whic is convenient and as it is in an eclectic area, many of its patrons are also eclectic. \n\nFor the most part I have always found what I have needed here.
