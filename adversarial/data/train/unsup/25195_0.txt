First time at Felice. Warm night in CLE. Enjoying dinner and drinks outside in the outdoor patio area, which is one of the best things about the place. Probably my favorite thing about the place. The night was packed with a mix of old and young people. It seemed like everyone was enjoying themselves.\n\nService is really great. I spent time at the bar, ordering drinks, having a good time. The hostess and bartenders were more than accommodating, filling our glasses with wine and helping us with recommendations off the dinner menu.\n\nStarted off with a few appetizers: calamari, mussels, and the quail. All very good, but the quail is undersized. Dinner, I ordered the skirt steak, it was alright, but my mistake. I probably ordered the wrong thing. Everyone else seemed satisfied and happy with their orders. Next time I'm around I'll probably try the bouillabaisse.\n\nMost likely come back here. Definitely a cool place.
