Believe the hype. If you are craving comforting, onolicious cooking then this is the place to go. \n\nSERVICE\nFast, attentive, helpful and friendly. Awesomeness.\n\nFOOD\nI ordered Loco Moco: 10oz homemade hamburger patty on steamed rice topped with two eggs any style and brown gravy. Choice of original, roast pork or chicken katsu. Patty was good but my gravy felt like it had too much butter in it. \n\nI do want to point out that their serving size is HUGE. It seemed that all the other table asked for a box to take the left overs home. When my server handed me the order, I immediately started to wonder if I accidentally ordered triple mega extra large or they mistakenly thought I was participating in some kind of eating contest. Honestly, the dish that loco moco came in look like a bathroom sink. I could dive in and swim in this. What even.\n\nNo complaints because left over means you get to enjoy more. Plus the price is really cheap considering the amount they give you. \n\nCONCLUSION\nIsland Flavor is as good as it gets. Easily my top favorite Hawaiian restaurant!
