Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? my pasta (squid ink pasta with lobster ragu) was so buttery that I couldn't finish the dish (and I'm a big eater). I give it a 3 star, because the appetizer (octopus salad) was refreshing and our bottle of wine was amazing. Also, the service was great. I just really didn't like my main course.
