First off this Allison girl has no idea how to make a bowl... and also has no idea what goes on at a Mongolian Grill. At this grill the menu is not needed... it only shows you what deserts they offer and different drinks. And how do you rate this 2 STARS... you pick what YOU want eat!!! \n\nWhen walk to the line, make sure you get enough meat to satisfy your tastes. I particularly like the sliced beef and the marinated steak. When you get to the vegetables make sure that you push them down into your bowl. The more you press it down the more room you have. Once again, I don't know where Allison has been to eat but normally you give your bowl to the person that cooks it and they give it back on a plate. Allison must eat like a champ, eats wayyyy to much or she is just dumb. You DO NOT NEED TO GET A BOTTOMLESS BOWL.... Press everything down and you will be full after you are done eating... ALLISON!!!! You rated your bowl 2 stars and you have no idea what you were doing... go back and make another bowl the right way and I promise you will like it better.
