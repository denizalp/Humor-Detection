After months of impatiently waiting, I was excised to finally get to try this place. The acai bowl was one of the best I've ever had - I loved how it was more like scoops\nof sorbet than a soupy smoothie bowl. \n\nI added blackberries and pineapple to the bowl, and I was happy I did, it really made it extra delicious. The decor is awesome, I love the mural wall...really the whole aesthetic. \n\nThey don't serve coffee (at least not yet) but luckily sambalatte is just next door. I didn't get any kombucha on tap this time, but as a huge booch fan I'm really excited they offer it on tap and had 3 flavors to choose from.\n\nI can't wait to try more of their menu options, looking forward to cold pressed juice snow cones!
