I have been here once and it was ok. I don't think I would go back again. I prefer Lahori Tika house in little india. \nWe ordered naan, butter chicken, and nihari.\nThe food was pretty  good but the atmospher was very off setting. it was very cold inside, the tables were not so clean, and the bathrooms were in the weirdest place. You had to go all the way into the basement through all these hallways and finally get to the bathroom. I felt kind of dirty eating there. They put the naan in a bread basket that wasnt even lined with parchment paper or anything.\nthis place is just a bit too grungy for me and the food is good, but not good enough to make me want to come back.
