Loved the environment at The Henry! They have a cozy space with lots of vintage decorations, and friendly staff that makes you feel at home once you arrive. All of the items on their menu have solid flavor combinations that made choosing just one a challenge. \n\nWe ended up with the short rib potstickers, which were delicious (super tender meat filling!) but also a little pricier compared to other appetizers. I also split the Roasted Turkey French Dip with a side of Kale and Apple Slaw. I wasn't a fan of the kale slaw, but the sandwich was fantastic, especially with the jus for dipping. I loved the kick from the horseradish too! \nFor dessert, we had the bread pudding, which was huge! Definitely big enough for the table to share (we had two people and couldn't finish), and had a great fluffy texture! \n\nI don't know how I had never been to The Henry before, but I will definitely be back!
