I purchased an entire home entertainment system from Dan at Best Buy ( Scottsdale location )- OUTSTANDING SYSTEM! Even better was the service Dan provided.   His follow up was above and beyond and he took his time to teach our entire family how to maneuver through the all the various functions of the system.  When we have trouble we have been able to directly call Dan and he is quick to follow up.  Could not say enough great  things about Dan, our new system , and Best Buy\/ Magnoli.
