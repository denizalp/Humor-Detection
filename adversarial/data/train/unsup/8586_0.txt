I booked a reservation a couple of months in advance in anticipation of a full restaurant.  We opted for lunch and already knew what we were going to order before we walked through the doors.  \n\nAll you need to know for your first experience at Hell's Kitchen is the 3 course lunch menu.  Seriously, this is prob my favorite commercialized spot in Vegas at this point in time.  Cmon...what do they always cook on every single episode of Hell's Kitchen?  Beef wellington, of course!!!  \n\nFirst though, you get a choice between caesar salad or white asparagus soup.  I was able to try both and have zero complaints.  Beef wellington...DELISH.  Perfectly cooked, served with delicious garnishes...I could taste every single ingredient.  It was everything I thought it would be.  Lastly, the sticky toffee pudding.  This dessert is huge...and probably one of the best, if not the best sticky toffee pudding I have ever had.\n\nOur server also had a fantastic personality and kept the meal lighthearted.  At the end, we asked if we could take a photo with Michelle, head chef and last season's winner.  She was extremely gracious and took the time to take photos with anyone who asked.  Super down to earth and just really nice.  \n\nI highly recommend this spot if you're looking for good food and if you're a fan of the show.
