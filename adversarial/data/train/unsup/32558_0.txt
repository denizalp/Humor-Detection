This was probably the worst grocery experience of my life. We just moved to Belmont and this is the only grocery store aside from a Super Walmart that is always packed. First off, I now reek of the Deli \/ bakery area's fried chicken \/ hot and ready foods. Secondly, there was no fine steak available. I don't need a filet mignon but a decent top sirloin would be great. The fresh chicken options are one crappy brand or one even more crappy brand. The wine was expensive - more expensive than Harris Teeter. \n\nThe staff was somewhat friendly so that's why I'm giving one star here.\n\nNeedless to say, my experience was so discouraging I will not be back, and Walmart is my only other option. Now we're counting down the days until HT does open their new location in Belmont.
