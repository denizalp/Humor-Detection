I was so excited to have dinner at Yardbird, I had been waiting and my initial experience was not stellar, but then the GM and owner reached out to see if they could change my view by offering a complimentary lunch. So a friend and I went and from the moment we walked I the manager Michael made sure we felt at home. Andy our waiter made sure we made good choices from cocktails to entrees. They made sure not to be overly fawning but just the right amount of service.\n\nThe food well it is every hub writes about and more. The fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs were perfection in a plate and the fried chicken, well just heaven on a plate. I can't say enough about the whole experience! Thank you Yardbirds for a magical last Las Vegas experience!!!!
