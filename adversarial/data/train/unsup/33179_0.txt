We visited from New York and saw this on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives. My boyfriend and I watch all the time and love Guy Fieri so we were eager to try his restaurants while in Vegas! We ate here twice because we wanted to try both of the meals that were on the show. The first night I ordered the Mac and Cheese burger which was HUGE, but yummy! The second night I ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich on pretzel bun which was okay. I didn't love the cheese on it I felt it could have been melted more and the sandwich was pretty salty. However, the pork marinade was absolutely delicious! All of the surrounding restaurants are around the same price, so we chose to go with one that had large portions to fill us up! Both nights there was a wait (on a Tuesday and Wednesday) around 7:00 p.m. for about 30-40 minutes which I feel is fair for such a busy spot! I enjoyed the atmosphere and I absolutely loved their fries that comes with the sandwiches! All of the waiters and waitresses have similar outfits which is pretty fun. The only complaint is one night one of the waitresses assumed we had a tab at the bar but we didn't (we were drinking water at our table anyway) and she seemed confused. Other than that, I recommend! If you go I recommend getting one of their burgers!
