The Toasted Tangerine, a moving target of rock n' grub that doesn't miss the mark. The sharp black and purple zebra-striped mobile sandwich press has been on the road since November of last year and sprung forth from Adrian & Alyssa Tangerine's passions for great food and Led Zeppelin. I like these people already.   So fervent was their shared affection for the iconic rock band that before saying their \"I do's\" Adrian legally changed his family name to Tangerine after the band's epic rock ballad. \n \nIt's a nice break for core dwellers' turning carousel of choices between pan-Asian, delis and pizza in subterranean food courts, each outpost looking like the last.  For those willing to wait, good things will come and at roughly the same price.  The only complaint from this food truck seeker is that not all the mouth-watering options that appear online (http:\/\/thetoastedtangerine.com) are available at any given stop.  Luckily the fragrant BBQ Chicken Sliders (tender oven roasted chicken pulled and tossed in house-made BBQ sauce with tart apple poppy seed coleslaw on a whole wheat carrot bun) were good to go in their 100% recyclable packaging at $8 a pop.  This was not an overly generous serving but then who wants to go back to the office to suffer through the afternoon in a meat coma?  My partner in foodtruckery crime chose the fried Spinach and Ricotta Raviolis with fresh Marinara for dipping.  Yes, lightly breaded fried ravioli, which made a delectable finger food lunch selection.  It all finished especially well by sharing their berry\/lemon\/vanilla bean trifle which is somehow both light and rich at the same time.\n \nThe Tangerine's home base cafe, Marish's Boulangerie, nestled on the Lake Shore in Port Credit (possible the only thing that could entice me to visit Mississauga) is famous for its sweets, so it's no wonder to find lunch time dessert options and sweet sensations mingling with the savoury.  Items like the Slow Rider (slow roasted whole pork shoulder topped with a strawberry BBQ glaze and pineapple & jalapeno coleslaw served on a 5-Grain ciabatta bun) and the Heartbreaker (old-fashioned smoked turkey, applewood smoked bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, crispy fried onions & fresh peach mustard, also served on their 5-Grain ciabatta bun) would prompt me to chase this mobile foodie delight from location to location.  These guys truly are living reflection from a dream.
