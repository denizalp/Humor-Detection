This show was borderline cheesy and raunchy = perfection for any bride to be. Some of the routines were a little out there (think tarzan) and some where straight out of Magic Mike. Be aware though the performers run\/jump\/grind on the tables so clear them! My phone almost got crushed by a couple of firefighters.
