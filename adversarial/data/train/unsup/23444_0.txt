I don't particularly understand why the super low ratings.  I wonder if there's been a staffing or management change recently?\n\nTuesday, I was craving pizza something fierce on my way home from work, and so my husband asked me to swing by Little Ceasars.  \n\nI walked in, and while they didn't have a Hot n Ready sausage...well...hot and ready, I placed an order and was told it would be about 6 minutes.  I also ordered crazy bread with extra cheese and butter topping.\n\nAbout 6 minutes later, I had my pizza and crazy bread, and was heading home.\n\nThe food was good.  Its pretty standard for a chain like this, but they used a lot of sausage, and the crazy bread was great.\n\nService itself was polite, but I was a little miffed that I got all the way home only to discover that the young lady who helped me had NOT put a marinara sauce in the bag or box for the crazy bread.  That was upsetting, and honestly, the only reason for 3 stars instead of 4.  \n\nI'll be back again, for sure.  \nFor cheap pizza, its a no brainer!
