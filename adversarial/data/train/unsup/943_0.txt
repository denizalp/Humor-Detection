You'd have to be crazy to come here.\n\nOkay; things were never great here. They have become truly deplorable. If I had any other insurance options, I would go somewhere else.\n\nIn the last year, I've been handed off from a Dr. who I trusted and admired to three other Dr.s - with no warning and no explanation except that the previous 3(!!!) had left.\n\nEach new 'first' appointment, it has been very clear that the Dr. has never seen my charts or notes from the previous Dr (s). \n\nThe last one tried to gloss that over with a doctoral \"And how are you doing today?\" - I said \"Hi. I don't believe we've met.\" The Dr. expressed shock and said \"But you seem so familiar.\" Again, I noted that we hadn't met, and asked \"Tell me what you know about my history, and I'll tell you the rest.\" She started shuffling through the papers.  I said \"Okay.... nothing. Listen, I'm on some pretty serious meds. It might be a good idea if you knew why before you see me.\" \n\nWe had a very brief (less than five minute) meeting, in which she decided that I should continue with the same treatment. I had come to this meeting specifically because the treatments were not working. \n\nI was scheduled to come back in six months with no further conversation.\nSix months later, I call for my appointment only to find that - once again - I was to see a new Dr. as the previous one had left. \n\nJust Dreadful. Really.
