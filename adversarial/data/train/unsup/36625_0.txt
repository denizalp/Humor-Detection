Poor customer service, did not contact me for 5 months, after I received a frame that did not fit despite following their instructions to the letter.  The process of putting it together was also much more involved, laborious and messy than described (you need several tools the average homeowner does not have).  When I finally did speak to them about the frame that did not fit, they claimed I had measured wrong (although directions did not mention the issues involved) and offered to \"recut\" a frame that might fit for 50% off, not to accept a return or replace the existing frame, which is apparently $200 worth of trash.  The customer representative was not empowered to \"do more\" to help me, claimed she would contact a manager, but never called back.  Cannot recommend.   Great idea, poor execution, poor customer service, useless product.
