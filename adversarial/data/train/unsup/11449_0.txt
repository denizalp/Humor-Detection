I had called Direct TV at (855) 679-4357 and was on hold for 5-10 minutes.  Finally, a male voice came on, in a monotone voice and wasn't much help when I explained to him that I'm only in Las Vegas only (3) times a year because I use that home as a vacation home. I hung up with him and remembered that I had forgotten to ask about my contract expiration date.\n\nI called back a second time and spoke to Jill.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!! Jill was so friendly and said that she would do all she could to help me save some money since I'm hardly at the Las Vegas house. I took the less expensive package and am so happy with her help! She explained to me that I could take the less expensive package and still stay within my contract; which no one ever told me. I'd give her 10 STARS if I could!!!  Thank you Jill!!!
