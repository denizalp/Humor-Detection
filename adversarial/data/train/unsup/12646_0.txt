My first time having Round Table Pizza was while I was out of town.  Little did I know there was a location close to home.  I decided to give it a whirl for lunch.  \n\nDuring lunch hours they offer the pizza buffet for $6.99.  Pretty cheap lunch so why not try it out?  They have cheese stuffed bread sticks, small salad bar and about a half dozen pizza varieties.  Fairly good pizza but I wish there were more options like some of their competitors.  \n\nI did enjoy their breadsticks.  I had to ask for dipping sauce though.  I wish they would have some out for guests.  The lady looked at me like I was crazy for wanting sauce.  I think she gave me the smallest cup she could provide.  Oh well.  \n\nService could be improved as stated before.  I also noticed dirty plates and tables weren't cleaned off right away.  I may have seen one guy make a round through the dining area while we were there.  For a buffet style lunch I don't think that is often enough.  \n\nIt's ok for lunch buffet option but I think they could do a tad better.
