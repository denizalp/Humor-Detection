Food is good, really good. The service sucks though. Waited 30 minutes for a table for 8 which wasn't bad for a Sunday Brunch and it being Tournament Weekend. We sat at the table for 15 minutes without a Server to at least welcome us or take drink orders or bring water. Needless to say when we complained and got someone over we had to order drinks and food at the same time. Al though our Server just came to work when she was thrown to us(Kai) she was pleasant and helpful. Now back to the food....the Whiting and Grits were perfect and the Chicken and Waffles were cooked to perfection. My Lava Drink was cute for the effects not taste.
