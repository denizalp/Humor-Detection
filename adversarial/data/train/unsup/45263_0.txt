I would never have known this restaurant existed if not for Yelp - it is tucked back into a small shopping plaza away from the main road. \n\nWe grabbed some carryout on a Saturday night, and thought the sushi was really good. They had a few veg options for me and my husband tried a couple of unique rolls. \n\nI thought the rolls were on the smaller side, so that was slightly disappointing. \n\nIt is a cute and cozy little place that would be good for meeting friends - everyone working was really friendly too. We would try it again.
