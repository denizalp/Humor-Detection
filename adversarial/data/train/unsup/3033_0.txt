Horrid customer service and lack of commitments from this company.  I have used movers 12 time in the last 14 years, West Coast Movers is by far the worst-case movers possible.  I had 5 large furniture items not arrive at my new location.  The packing job was sub par, and the items that did arrive arrived broken beyond all recognition.  If this review could have pictures,  you'd be shocked. The claims process is unbearable and not looking like I'm going to get any response from their third party. I didn't even get so much as an apology from customer service.  The rep I delt with will not return my calls. I'm beyond upset. I'm out $8K plus not to mention the freight charges from the furniture that did not arrive. Please go with an alternativemail if you lie your stuff
