Such a fun afternoon! Made appts for 6 to get pedis and a few manicures to get ready for my sisters wedding. We had a lovely time. We brought in champagne and just lounged around on a quiet Friday afternoon. They were super friendly and excited to have us there celebrating. This was my second time here and both times have been great. The reviews about having to wait are ridiculous. They can only work so fast. 3 staff working and we were 6. We were Happy to wait and visit.
