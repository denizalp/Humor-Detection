This was a really interesting place to eat. We were looking for something new and different and came across here. We didn't really know what to expect, but they recommended different options and explained what was good. We really liked it, but it was definitely different from anything we were used to. I had the vegetarian platter and I think I enjoyed my plate most out of all of us. I'd recommend this place though!
