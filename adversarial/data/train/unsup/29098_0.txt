My friend's tire needed patching, which was our guess since it had a slow air leak and the tire pressure light went on two to three days ago.\n\nI called in two places before heading here. O Tires had a 2-4 hour wait time on a Friday around 2:00pm.  To be safe, I gave Discount Tires a ring, per my friend's request. They didn't answer and I got their voicemail. \n\nSo of course, naturally, my favorite spot, Firestone, answered my call. They weren't that busy and could see us today and it's free for tire inspection. \n\nIt only took 1 hour to do the tire inspection and patch a tire.  Great customer service with great low prices.\n\nWill be recommending more people here.
