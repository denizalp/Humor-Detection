Yeah.  A change of pace from your more standard \"Mediterranean\" or \"Middle Eastern\" joint, Moroccan Paradise offered up a delicious meal tonight for my family.\n\nOne of the specialties here is the tajine, or meat dish in sauce with vegetables and prunes with rice.  My wife really enjoyed hers, and my daughter equally liked the vegetable version with falafel.\n\nAs for me, I got the mixed grill--a fabulous combo of beef kabob, kefta kabob, chicken kabob, and chicken leg, served over rice and accompanied by salad, pita slices, and fried potatoes.  I'm full.\n\nNo baklava here, but they make up for it with huge array of mixed juices, milkshakes, and crepes.  The desserts take up multiple pages on the menu!  This is easily one of our favorite restaurants of its kind now.  We will be coming back--even if just for dessert. :)\n\nNot just \"Middle Eastern\" or \"Mediterranean\"-- it's More Rockin'.  Give it a try.
