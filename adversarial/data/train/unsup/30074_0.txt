This place is the COOLEST!!!!! \n\nThe inside is so hip and decorated well and the employees are the nicest. We received a free sample of the mango slush and it was sooooo delicious. \n\nFor the pops, they taste just as good as the are cool! You can get any flavor pop plain for a cheaper price or get it deluxe which comes dipped in your choice of chocolate and topped with three sweet or savory toppings of your choice. \n\nI got the strawberry sorbet pop with a light white chocolate drizzle and sprinkles on top. Amazing! I read one of reviews below that mentioned that these are not too cold and do not bother sensitive teeth..... this is truth! My teeth are super sensitive to hot and cold but i was not at all bothered by the pop... this place is magical. \n\nFor the tea, I got the jasmine milk tea with their green honey boba. I asked for 100% sweet and it still was pretty bland so he added more sugar and it was a bit better. Still tasted a little watered down so I think I'll try out the classic milk tea next time to see if it's stronger. Boba was great though! \n\nCan't wait to return!
