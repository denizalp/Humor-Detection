I love the idea of fusing Mexican and Chinese foods! In this case, they fused the fast food aspects of both! Think of Panda Express fused with a Filibertos and this is what you get! Except it's way better! \n\nI am so sad that the one in chandler closed! I had to come all the way to this one to get my fix after years of not eating this stick. I always get the same combo whenever I go! I get the orange chicken quesadilla, the jerk fried rice, and the bbq pork burrito! It always ends up being a little more than I ordered, but leftovers are fine with me. \n\nThe sauces are awesome there too! It's some kind of fusion of hoisin sauce and salsa. Just take it all and dump it all in your plate! If you have the urge for a cookie too, they make pretty good snickerdoodle cookies too.
