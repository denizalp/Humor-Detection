This is a nice, new, and modern hotel. It has a good location not too far from all the key activity areas in Tempe. The lobby level is large. There are a lot of seating areas and a big bar.\n\nOur room was nice. It was average sized. Like the rest of the hotel it featured modern decor. The bed was comfortable. The television had the system that allows you to log into Netflix and a few other streaming accounts.\n\nThe bathroom was nice. The shower had a hand held head and a rain head. It was roomy too.\n\nThere is a pool on the roof. It is not big enough for laps, but it is plenty big enough for hanging out and trying to cool off. There is a decent amount of seating around the pool. There is limited shade though so be prepared.\n\nThe staff was friendly and helpful through out our stay. We will definitely consider this hotel next time we are in the area.
