Woot Woot! I can see the curvature of the earth in here! Man is this place big! I love a big ol' liqueur store! Yep Yep!\nHuge selection of wine, lot's to drool over!\nAmazing amount of booze to chooze from..\nFriendly and knowledgeable staff to help you make a selection. This Lees is pretty close, but I have been to others and they are all pretty much the same, some are larger (if you can believe that)!\nGet in here, the prices are better than most stores and the selection is definitely amazing!\nPlease do not drink and drive. No really, just don't..
