In St. Lawrence Market there are quite a few places to purchase meat from butchers but White House has some pretty exotic meats that you won't find at some of the other establishments under the same roof.\n\nI have not yet tried camel, ostrich, kangaroo or any other type of meat like that that wasn't either a jerky or Slim Jim type of packaged ready to eat snack.\n\nI didn't know how they tasted or what they were comparable to and I had no idea how to prepare them or how to dress and spice them.  I didn't do my research... they do however have a variety of meats like that and not only in burger or sausage form but even in steak or other types of cuts.\n\nI went conservative and went with some bison and venison burgers, meats I knew and knew how to cook.  My plan was to cook them on the BBQ you know because they're burgers, ground and formed, sealed and frozen.\n\nI also indulged in a \"tomahawk\" steak which is a rib steak bone in.  It's also sealed and could be used as a ping pong paddle or used for a spanking of the meat variety.  This was one serious piece of meat.  You know how women see shoes or purses and\/or other girly thingies and just all impulsive and that?  This is my type of impulse I don't mind indulging in from time to time and that's a nice steak.  Sure it was a little expensive so what?  YOLO right?  \n\nI made the smart decision to eat BEFORE coming to St. Law because it's dangerous to come to a place like this hungry unless you're willing to drop bills on food because you're in hunger\/greed mode.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and eat before shopping.  You may regret not buying that side of beef but then again you may not.\n\nWhite House has a good selection of what is visually good quality... Now I just need to cook up this stuff and consume it.  The butcher I spoke to was giving me all sorts of techniques on how to cook what I bought and even had instructions that he taped to the steak so I wouldn't forget.  That's pretty good customer service!\n\nThe venison burgers were 2 for about 7 dollars and the bison were 2 for about 12.
