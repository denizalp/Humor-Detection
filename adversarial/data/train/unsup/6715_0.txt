Worst experience from ordering at this restaurant from uber eats. The food came late and cold. I was sick and haven't eaten anything all day, and 2 hours later I'm sitting here eating this cold pork bone soup. \n\n1.) the food preparation time kept getting pushed back and Uber or insadong restaurant never called me to tell me what's going on.\n\n2.) the uber driver got lost and kept going in circles around my condo. This man clearly does not know how a gps functions\n\n3.) when the driver finally arrived, he called me and shouts at me on the phone to come to his car and grab the food. I have never ordered food before where I have to walk up to a strangers vehicle and grab the food through a car window!\n\n4.) The pork bone soup was not very tasty. The rice and side dishes were okay and probably the only reason why I would give this restaurant a 2 star. \n\n5.) I had almost no potato in my pork bone soup unlike the photo on Uber eats site. The tiny piece of potato I had was the size of a quarter. Seriously.\n\n6.) The items on the Uber's eats app are 10 % more expensive than their dining in menu, however the food is not much better than if you dined in. You're paying more to order from uber eats and $4.99 delivery charge just for this nightmare experience.
