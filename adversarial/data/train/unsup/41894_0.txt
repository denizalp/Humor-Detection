Eggstacy is a good trendy spot to go for young people who want brunch. It's not as bumpin as R&R, and not as family-oriented as Butterfields. It's a good mix. \n\nThe food is pretty large, but it's not as tasty as other breakfast spots - drier, less fresh, doesn't have the same feel. Overall, good ambiance, decent food, and a nice place for young people to get brunch.
