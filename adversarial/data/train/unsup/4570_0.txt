In town with friends and hungover. One buddy says that we have to try this place. So we go for it.\n\nIt is inside of a semi-depresing casino. Just a handful of stools and a line. We waited 2.5 hours to sit down. I considered breaking up the friendship at that moment, because I was starving, but there was nothing else around. I threw some money into some slots and we waited out turn while making some friends in line. We were probably #10 ten in line when we arrived... yeah. Some people just hang out regardless of the drooling masses eyeing their bar stools. \n\nThe food... so it's soup. And it is very good. And the chef is very friendly. The rest of the staff was a little absent in their service, which in part explains the huge delays. I was hangry and order a dozen oysters to start. Let me preface by stating that I love oysters and eat them often. I have never had oysters like these. Imagine a large human tongue... yeah, like that. Not sweet, but if you;re the type who likes to cover your delicious oysters in topping to cover their natural flavor then you might love them. I did not.\n\nIf you have a friend like mine who drags you here, order the combo pan roast and enjoy a few beers. You will leave full and moderately happy.
