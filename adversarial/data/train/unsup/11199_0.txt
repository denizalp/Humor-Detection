Don't go here.  I ordered the shrimp while my dinner companion ordered the steak.  Steak was okay.  Shrimp was so awful.  The bean puree, tomatoes and mushrooms accompanying the shrimp all had a terrible burnt taste.  If i wasn't starving and short on time pre concert I would have left mid dinner.  \n\nService was also terrible.  We got our appetizers before our drinks.  And if we needed anything (salt, another glass of wine) we waited a good 10 minutes before our waitress even came over.\n\nI was excited initially that they could seat us on a Friday pre concert without reservations but now I know why.
