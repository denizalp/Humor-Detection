Stayed here overnight after getting sick during a road trip. Went to emergency room at hospital was checked out given some scipts and was told to stay off road for a day or so. Upon leaving hospital went to the Walgreens across road had the scipts filled. Took them across road checked into the \"Sleep Inn and had a goodnights rest. Woke up well rested and continued onto my visit to see my kid.
