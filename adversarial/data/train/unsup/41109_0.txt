By far the best Mediterranean restaurant in Vegas, trust me, I've tried them all. \nApart from the exceptional service the lovely lady behind the counter, the place is clean, the food is freshly made and the flavours are as authentic as they can be. \nWide selection of all the good stuff!!\nPlus they got a pastry section that is just a feast for the eyes.\nDefinitely will make this place a regular.
