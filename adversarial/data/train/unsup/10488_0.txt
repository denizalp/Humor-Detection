This is one of our favorite sandwich spots because of the bread and tasty ingredients!\n\nWe are at Palms Hotel and Casino quite often as we see a lot of movies at their movie theater so of course we stop here for a nice treat.\n\nOur latest visit my boyfriend decided on the cannonball which is meatballs, cheese and marinara and I got the tuna melt! I like that they use albacore tuna for this sandwich as it makes a big difference as I prefer Albacore at all cost. This is one of the most tasty tuna melts I have had and I am already craving my next visit to enjoy this sandwich again.\n\nThe bread and the very good ingredients is what makes their sandwiches a hit with so many of us EOS fans!\n\nI have tried many of their Signature sandwiches such as the Hawaiian, cannonball, turkey and cheese, tuna melt, chipotle chicken avocado, The Original and the turkey dinner sandwich they featured for a limited time in November that was a winner! It was not as good as the famous Bobby at Capriotti's however it hit the spot. \n\nThe last two visits we made we used our buy one get one free coupon from the 2013' Entertainment guide. I was so happy and shocked when I saw them listed in the book so that meant two free sandwiches for us, awww yeah!\n\nMy boyfriend and I will be back many times over to enjoy a sandwich and their yummy brownies!
