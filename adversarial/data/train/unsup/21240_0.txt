Always love this location but i also just live starbucks. The employees always seem happy or even if they look unhappy from afar... once they see you they look automatically happy ahahha\n\nGood amount of space in this location & it always seems to be filled with officers & medical people. I usually come here around 2 or 3ish & sometimes it is PACKED!.... but even though there is a line to the door... somehow I am in & out within 5-10 min tops they just mass take orders & then they just mass produce everything.\n\nMy favorite thing to get right now is the passion tea lemonade for the hot weather. There is just the right amount of sweet & tart in that drink along with the refreshing coldness of the tea & ice... plus I just LOVE the color of the drink ahahhaa\n\nOverall the space is big... the staff is charasmatic... the drinks are perfect & consistent EVERY single time!
