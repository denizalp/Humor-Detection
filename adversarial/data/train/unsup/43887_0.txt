I love State Street Brat's! The Food is great, try the Bacon Cheddar Curds. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and quick. If you want to drink and watch a game look no further. \n\nBrat's also has an awesome dance floor and Dj. I usually go on Thursday nights for their progressive special. From 9-10pm Drinks are 5 for $5, 10-11pm 4 for $5, 11pm-12am 3 for $5, and then 12am until they close it's 2 for $5. \n\nBrat's is one of my favorite bars in Madison.
