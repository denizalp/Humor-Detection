We looked at the menu before we went, and even then we had a difficult time deciding what we wanted to eat. My boyfriend went with the steak with the blue cheese sauce and I had the veggie burger. Both were excellent (maybe his steak was a tad bit better..) and extremely filling. Minus the fact that the patty in my veggie burger kept falling apart because it seemed like it was a lot of dry ingredients packed together (quinoa, grains, etc.), it tasted awesome.\n\nWe also went ahead and ordered dessert. We had the ice cream sandwich and it came with a side of fruits and a tiny little bowl of chocolate for dipping. Divine. Others we were dining with had the chocolate mousse and it looked like a gigantic parfait, and looked delicious!\n\nI would definitely go back to this place. Seems like a nice chill place, without the dirty, grungy pub feel. I have to admit it is a bit on the expensive side, but wouldn't mind dishing out the extra dollars for the great food and service.
