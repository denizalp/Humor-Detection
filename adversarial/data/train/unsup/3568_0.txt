If you've ever wondered where every girl gets that jogging suit with 'juicy' embroidered on the butt, wonder no more.\n\nJuicy is a trendy designer, and they're pricey, but they do have some pretty cute items. They have little sundresses, jeans, tops, shoes, bags, etc. etc. and they're definitely a store worth going in if you're on a shopping spree.
