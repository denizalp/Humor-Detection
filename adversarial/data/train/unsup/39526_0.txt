favorite place to stay.  the rooms are huge, and now that i'm beyond the \"willing to sleep on a floor or couch\" stage of my life, i really appreciate having all the extra room to relax.  the rest of the hotel is great too, although the layout is a bit weird.  won money at the craps table, so makes it that much better!
