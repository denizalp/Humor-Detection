Ok, so their sushi isn't exactly Drop-dead-yummy sushi. HOWEVER, for the price, the sushi is pretty good! It's cheap, quick, and delicious. I've been here a few times with big and small groups and it works either way. Too big of a group might not work though. (It's a rotating sushi bar) so seating would be a little awkward in a big group. \n\nYou pick the sushi you want to eat off the belt and just grab it and eat it! The prices are based off of the color plates you have, which they total up at the end. Let's just say I myself ate 4 plates one time, and the bill was under $13.00!!! I think it was like 3 rolls of sushi and something else. Now try doing that at any other sushi place. NOT easy, right? :)\n\nThis is a great interactive place and wonderful with kids because they get to see and pick what they want to eat.
