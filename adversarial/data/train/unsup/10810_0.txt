\"At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all\n\"Your eyes, your eyes\n\"Ah-ah-ah\"\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn A Sentence™\nGood tacos!\n\nQuick Review™\n+   Open late; 2$ chicken and chorizo tacos; 2.50$ carnitas and al pastor tacos; and, a superbly convenient location along US-95. \n\n-   Flan is alright. Just alright.  \n\n------------------------------------------\n\nYou've got your tacos, and then you have everything else. I come here for tacos, and although I appreciate that they have Jericalla (flancito) (unlike their original downtown truck), it is a tad steeply priced at 3.50$ a serving when Los Antojos [http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/los-antojos-las-vegas?hrid=TF0KCJK2ujGG_uZdF8tWQw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)] gives you a plate the size of your goddamn head for that price (and their flan is actually good). Of course that is across town, so ... 'drive or quit complaining, Edwin P.!'  \n\nAlthough ... there is a cute employee here. I am honest enough to admit that this fact probably accounts for more than half of my patronage. (Check check-ins.) You see: I am an honest creep. The last honest creep.\n\nTacos de pollo: 2$ más impuestos.\nPostres: 3.50$ más impuestos.\n\nMy whole life I have been paying impuestos. Waiting for the day when I can pay less impuestos and they hit up the dirty Romneys instead for all the years they have cheated society. I digress. \n\nPro Tip:\nYou have to pay with cash if it's less than 10$. Not unheard of when it comes to taco stands; however, this is restaurant with storefront. Bit weird. \n\nSuperfluous Note:\nMaximum room capacity 59.\n\nPro Tip:\nThey make some good stuff, you know. Skip the flan.\n\nThe location is somewhat hard to miss because they don't have large (or any, really) signage besides one small vinyl that cannot be the largest size that the County Commission permitted. Don't know. Use your GPS (or ask a Mexican).\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nTourists\nNo tourists here. None. Zero. \n\nKids\nGood for kids, if they're Latino.\n\nDogs\nNot allowed, unless service animals. \n\n------------------------------------------\n\nRating: Three-stars, \"A-OK.\"
