Stadium setup is great- Views of the mountains- fireworks and nice scoreboards and screens to see all the action.  Bench seating - sucks-  bathrooms are scarce, exiting is horrible - in terms of outflow.  Sound system - or PA system needs an upgrade.  Overall a great venue and better than some of the other venues in the pac-10 like Cal.
