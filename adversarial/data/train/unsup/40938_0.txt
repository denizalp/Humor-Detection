Fat Tuesday is always a must when I end up in Vegas. Every year, me and my bests head to the strip for a mini vacay away from home. Fat Tuesday has become an annual tradition when we head to Vegas. They're so centrally located in the miracle mile and found everywhere on the strip.\n\nIn the past, I've ordered a Tumbler or Yard stick w\/ an extra floater shot, of course. However, I recently discovered their $1 Jell-O shots. Hands down the best thing on the menu! \n\nThe staff is so friendly and accommodating. In the past 4 days, my friends and I have ordered  20 Jell-O shots to go. We received a bag or a box for storage along with straws. Love that their Jell-O shots have lids! It's straight to the point, delicious, portable, convenient and easy to store when you're on the go - Vegas style.
