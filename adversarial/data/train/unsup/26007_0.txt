Ok I love burgers but this is the worst burger place ever, especially this locations. I tried it at least 3 times and each time there had been a problem. I asked for a cheese burger with nothing on it but cheese ketchup only and they gave a a burger with just the bread. One time I got a combo with no fries and etc. so I gave up and decided to right this review. The cooks Are very slow but the guys at the front and very nice.
