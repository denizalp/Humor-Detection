GOSSIP UPDATE\n\nI haven't been back since my last bad experience, but I did get some gossip from a reliable source.  Apparently, a little while back - right around the time I noticed a significant decline in the quality - they lost their head chef.  Word is he went over to the other Sushi Mon in Henderson.\n\nAnd I also found out that it's not entirely correct that the two Sushi Mons are not related.  Apparently the old manager of this Sushi Mon on Sahara started up the Sushi Mon in Henderson - there may have been like some sort of payment or franchise type agreement.  \n\nCurrently, the two are separately owned and run, but there is a little bit of a relationship there as you can see.  However if you ask them they will say they are not related.\n\nAnyways, if the head chef's gone over to Henderson then I guess I'll have to check that place out again.
