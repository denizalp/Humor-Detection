As good as this place is, it seems like once in a blue moon that i have talk to someone who has actually heard about River Moon Cafe.  What is also curious is the place is always packed, maybe its the same people always going just wearing different clothes or maybe my mind was waning.  The first time i went the Tex Mex rolls were recommended.  I have never tried such a concept so i gave it a whirl.  It wasn't the greatest appetizer ever but it was something different and worth the gamble as i left other desiring appetizers in my hand.   For entree, the fillet and the crab cakes were both winners.   On the dark side i wasn't crazy about the wasabi mashed potatoes.   Now I am a big fan of wasabi and mashed potatoes and was eager to try them, but was overwhelmed by the root.   Not sure why chefs try to mess with mashed potatoes so much, just like hamburger helper they do just fine by themselves.   Here are more reasons to grab an arm and head out for a moondance, BYOB, everything is made fresh to order, chef comes out often to check on customers, and they have prefix menu specials during the week.
