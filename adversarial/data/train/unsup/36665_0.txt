Sue has been looking after our dogs for years. Are dogs are our babies and we love them very much we feel like Sue's Pets and Friends feels the exact same way. And our girls love them like family and look forward to visits from them.\nWe always get a  report card detailing that day's visit or visits. Time in and time out. The girls mood or spirits. An outline on their Adventure.\nWe are very particular about our girls and our home and would not just let anyone in. We wouldn't just trust anybody with our girls. Sue's pets and friends is very reliable, flexible  and we wouldn't have anyone else.\nIf you are looking for pet sitting or house sitting make sure you put them on the list to interview and it will make your search for a service easier once you meet the them.
