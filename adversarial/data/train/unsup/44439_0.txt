Avoid the pot holes when getting here. There's an entrance that you can try to avoid, that is closer to the stores.\n\nSelections - they have a somewhat of an abundance of different ethnic foods (Vietnamese - plenty, Chinese, Thai, Philippines, Korean...).  The prices here are a lot cheaper than what you can find compared to other Asian grocery stores. When I do come here, I try to load up a lot of Vietnamese produce, fresh shrimp, rice paper rolls, vermicelli noodles, bag of rice.. Because, it is just cheaper!  I kind of wish the quality of the meat is a tad bit better.. Love how they have Vietnamese pre-packaged desserts and food snacks :)\n\nPrice - as mentioned, decently priced. Not as great of a price like in Houston TX and or DC.\n\nService - at the seafood place, great! The cashiers on the other hand, not nice..
