My review as a tourist staying at nearby Villa Mirage resort on Princess: If you like to get outdoors for a walk or run this is the place. Very handy to have full bathrooms and water fountains. I noticed lots of people around playing soccer, plenty of parking and easy to access. I did a couple of early-ish morning runs before the heat kicked in after 9am. So glad to see those water fountains! Great spot.
