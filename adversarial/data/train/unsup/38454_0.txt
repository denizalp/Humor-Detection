OB PATIENTS PLEASE AVOID DR DEKA. I was COLDLY misdiagnosed with a miscarriage after my first Apt with her. She performed the ultrasound herself. within 2 minutes she COLDLY concluded that I had lost my precious baby. She ordered hcg l levels \"to confirm\". She and her assistant tried to get me on her D&C schedule not 1 but 3 times even after my hcg levels continued to rise! I spent 3 days in a deep depression thinking I had a miscarriage. I then received a second opinion and within 4 seconds my perfect baby with a heartbeat of 176 was found. I am currently 17 weeks pregnant with a baby girl! My baby would be dead if I took her \"expert\" medical advice! Don't go to her and if god forbid you do get a second opinion if ANY issues arise.
