We used Creations in Cuisine for our Wedding in November and they were a total hit.  Professional, attentive, organized, easy to work with and customer focused are just some of what comes to mind when I think of Tony and his WONDERFUL staff.  And, how could I forget the food?! People have been raving about the quality and flavor of the food since the wedding- and I had some hard to please guests.  We had a beef, fish and pasta dish and all were excellent.  \n\nWhat's even better is they got the small things right- from the \"captain\" (think head waitress) introducing herself to me and making sure that if I had any problems or concerns that she would take care of them to working with us on all our special requests to making sure that my dog (who yes, was in attendance) had food and water.  We supplied all of our own alcohol, and the Creations and Cuisine team served it- including a signature cocktail. Amazing!  \n\nOh, and how can I forget Tony working within our budget.  Friggen awesome.  Here's an example- beef dishes are expensive; more than we wanted to spend, but we really wanted that option.  So Tony used some creative thinking and designed a plate that featured 2-3oz fillets instead of one 6oz fillet, which saved us a ton of money- not to mention the presentation was gorgeous!\n\nFrom start to finish working with Tony and his team was an absolute pleasure.  If you're planning an event, look no further and just hire Creations in Cuisine.  I promise you'll be glad that you did.
