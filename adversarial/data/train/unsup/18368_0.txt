Delicious and creative taco's, although in Montreal we have a lack of taco trucks so everyone may have flipped out on this one and lost all perspective. Friends of mine recently booked the taco truck to cater their wedding and have been thrilled with the kind service and tasty sampling options, so the great reputation comes with a dose of good-people-ness that puts me up to 5 stars.
