Trump DUMP! Over 3 strikes YOU'RE OUT!\n\nWe booked 2 rooms next to each other with our family arriving the following day. My husband and I were on a work trip and we spent 40minutes carefully checking in and after 40minutes of double checking we thought both bookings were all set!\n\nThen our parents arrived and NO ROOM. THEY GAVE AWAY OUR PARENTS ROOM. The original front desk lady incorrectly flagged our parents to arrive the same day we did and then when they didn't show up the Trump released their room. RELEASED THEIR ROOM!!!\n\nWe spent over 4hrs sorting out our reservations - it was dreadful! No compensation - and I was pulled out of a work meeting to sort it out and change rooms. We had to pack and move all our belongings including a crib and all our food and baby gear. When I suggested they ask the people who checked into our in-laws room to move then compensate them with a dinner, the manager on duty refused to call. Nice.\n\nI was assured a manager would call - there was no call. I needed to get back to work so I let the room debacle go.\n\nOh - they lost our package for hours - it was signed for by a Trump employee at 10:30am and delivered by 6pm! Lol seriously, now that's efficient!\n\nIf all of that wasn't bad enough - the following afternoon there was smoke coming through the a\/c. I called the manager Tommie, he was very nice and apologized for all the inconvenience but still no compensation. Nothing. Not a breakfast or a massage - nothing.\n\nThen my in-laws ask for directions to the Children's Museum - the bell desk sent them to THE WRONG ADDRESS!! Nice!\n\nToday I get back to a smoke filled room - this time it was REAL SMOKE. The stove was not locked (we hadn't touched the stove so it wasn't us) but we suspect it had been on low - probably our entire stay. Something was bumped onto the stove and while my son was sleeping the room filled with SMOKE. A security guy alerted my mother-in-law who was monitoring my son from an adjoining room and we pulled him out.\n\nWhen I came back from work I could smell smoke from the elevators. Another 2hrs + aggravation and we are now moving rooms to sleep because our room is too filled with smoke. \n\nWhat a mess. The manager on duty, Victoria was accommodating but I'm still waiting for their gesture of \"we totally messed up your stay here's a \"something\" from us\" it won't change how much time I wasted but at least it would be an effort.\n\nWe have booked the Trump 5 years in a row but I will NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN. And I suggest you don't either.
