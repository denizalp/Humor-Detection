So this is my second update.  I've checked in here 19 times so I come here some.  Its the closest to my house and I will just come for drinks now.  The Happy Hour specials are AGAIN changed.  The website still says tacos and wings but its not.  They do have craft specials for 3.00 which is nice but they force you to buy that crap pizza from up the block.  Its terrible.  I actually bit the bullet and came tried it again.  The 9\" was barely a personal pizza and ALL DOUGH.  The wings looked good but they gave me no sauce (which I ordered) and wrong dip.  Everything was walked through the back door by some dude from the pizza shop.  Not even made AT THE BAR IM SITTING AT!  And what happened to the free pizza being out at happy hour?  Yet ANOTHER thing gone.  I told the poor bartender I didn't want any of the garbage food and just payed for my beer and left.  I felt bad so I tipped her well and walked to the Lizard and got a GOOD pizza.  I felt bad because all she has in there was a few random day drunks.  So inconsistent and misleading the happy hour is.  They even got rid of Mossy so there is no reason to see bands here, really.  Sucks that a whole group of us pre-game at the house and will walk right past this possible goldmine to go to another place due to it doesn't know what the hell it wants to be.  Lakewood has a lot of Irish bars.  Lakewood has a lot of sports bars.  Lakewood has a lot of good happy hours.  This place does none of them right or with consistency.  Its like an Irish cross dresser that's got a sports and cover band fetish...
