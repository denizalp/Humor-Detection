after seeing a recent review about this Safeway it reminded me of the last time I shopped there and it made me never want to go back. \n\nAs I reached the check out line I hear the cashier say out loud \"oh not another customer. C'mon there are other lanes open. How come people keep coming into my lane?\"\n\nNow you could make the assumption that he was joking, but I know he wasn't as because a minute later someone got behind me and he again started complaining. \nI just couldn't believe this guy was complaining about having to do his job in front of customers and co-workers. It was really rude and unprofessional.\nLook pal, I don't like to go to work sometimes either but I don't sit and bitch about how I don't want to be there. \n\nAnother thing, the Starbucks thing is ridiculous. There is already one in the same complex and then they put one inside the grocery store. Did we really need another one?
