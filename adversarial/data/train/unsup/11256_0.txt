No idea where to begin. I've never been to a place that has a \"Pillow Menu\" with about 20 different kinds of pillows. I have never slept in a bed that I would want to spend the rest of my life in. It's hard when I'm in Vegas to tear me away from the casinos, but at the Sky Loft? I didn't want to leave the damn room. You have your own butler on call; your own chauffeur who drives you to and from the airport in a Rolls Royce Ghost; steam room in the glass shower with views of the strip throughout both floors; your own private lounge on the entire penthouse floor where they all know you by name.... There are only 2 things known to make me cry. Onions, and leaving the Sky Lofts. Like a baby, every time. ***PUT THIS ON YOUR BUCKET LIST!!***.... In other words, mucho recommendo.
