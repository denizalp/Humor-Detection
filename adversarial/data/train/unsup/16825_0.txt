Odd Seoul is very much like it's brother restaurant Swish. If you are unfamiliar with either, the concept is Korean fusion food done bar style\/tapas for sharing. The emphasis on sharing is key, but Odd Seoul offers an equal number of dishes under both.\n\nIt's a bit hard to find at first. You know it's somewhere on Ossington between Queen and Dundas. But at the same time you're looking for signage and nothing ever comes up, so your reliance on google maps goes down the drain and you feel like you are geocaching for a lunchbox tucked under a bush behind a fence (if you don't know what geocaching is, it's a good thing). Then you notice an all black, narrow entrance. Is this the place? \n\nWalking in it feels like any other bar on Ossington and Dundas. high bar-style tables and seats, a long bar near the front, small and narrow layout with wooden floors, dark and intimate. So it's comfortable to sit and chat over beers (like Keystone...) while nom-ing on snacks. This is where things get interesting.\n\nI got the Squash Poutine, which subs. squash in for potatoes with kimchi, sauces, gravy and cheese on top. Also had the Cheese Steak, which was one super soft bun stuffed with Bulgolgi. The Pork Bun was like a Asian Sloppy Joe, while the wings were Korean style: Crispy and Saucy with a hint of spice. My favorites were the wings, poutine and Cheese Steak but everything was actually quite good and compliments beer even better.\n\nDespite the mediocre service, I liked Odd Seoul for it's casual atmosphere, well-priced food and location. Although hard to find at first, it's somewhere I'd go back to try new things off the menu.
