A snacking jewel in the Preserve.\n\nDecent food and a surprisingly gorgeous view of the Strip is the main draw of the Divine Springs Cafe. I came here on Thursday for the Happy Hour special which is from 4pm to 8pm and offers bar food and a decent selection of beers. \n\nI went with the tater tots, that were free with a donated toy to \"Toys for Tots\", and the Chicken Nachos. I also sampled the house chips that we're placed on the table as soon as  sat down. This place is by no means a hot bed of foodie activity, but a more a refueling station after exploing the preserve.  \n\nThe food is on par with most bar bites, nothing was terrible, but it also wasn't mindblowing, it was just good. The Nachos are a huge portion and definitely shareable and the house chips were nice salty snack before we were inundated with salty carby treats. \n\nThey only offer Happy Hour on Thursdays and the menu is pretty limited, but it's perfect food for socializing and catching up with the homies. I would recommend coming here during the day, this way you'll have a chance to snack on their full menu. \n\nLearn stuff and eat. It's the American way!
