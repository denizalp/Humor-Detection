I was given a gift certificate for this place and drove 25 miles to get there, not happy about that. But, I spent a half an hour there looking at the HUGE selection of guitars, probably way more axes than any other place in The Valley! They had very few used instruments, which is what I am always looking for, so nix the 5 Star rating there. What they do have is a mighty collection of many brands of guitars you don't see anywhere else- Charvel customs, a plethora of all kinds of Jacksons, and the usual assortment of Fender, Gibson, PRS, etc. etc. Not too many accessories or effects, but a vast, huge, and colorful assortment of guitars... Definitely worth a look!
