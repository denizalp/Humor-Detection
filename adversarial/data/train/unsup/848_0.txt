Best red chile this side of my future mother-in-law's crockpot.  And although my future MIL's tortilla selection abilities rock, there is no comparison to putting red chile over perfectly crunchy, perfectly chewy, perfectly perfect frybread.  And THEN sending it away with a container of their death-red, smoky, spicy-as-hell salsa which borders on near-perfect.  I have to will myself to eat here as little as possible, as I'd like to make 40. :)
