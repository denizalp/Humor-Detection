Can't go wrong with goat meat and basto. Yes, basto. The mango shake is very refreshing and the date cake is a banger. Casual atmosphere and the employees are pleasant. The owners of the restaurant started a YouTube years ago. The channel is called \"Xawaash Foodblog.\" Glad to see that their restaurant is doing well.
