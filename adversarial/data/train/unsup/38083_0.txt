YUM. Breakfast. Wednesday morning around 10ish. No wait. Seated immediately. Party of 3. Coffee, orange juice and the famous build your own Bloody Mary. We all split the breakfast burrito and biscuits and gravy. So delicious. Favorite: the biscuits.... Perfectly seasoned. We killed the food and weren't hungry for hours. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas!
