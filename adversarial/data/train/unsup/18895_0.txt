Its awesome being a girl in Vegas.\n\n1) Never have to wait in line to get into XS\n\n2) Never had to pay to get into XS \n\n3) Free drinks\n\n4) Easy to swoop on a all guys table (Free table) lol\n\nAlthough im pretty much over the club scene, XS has and always will be my fav. the ambiance is just beautiful especially outdoor.\n I love taking off my shoes and dancing in the pool. Plus it gives my feets a break from the heels thats always a plus, and I dont look like a ratchet whose walking around barefoot cause everyone is doing it. lol \nNot a fan of house music but the DJs are pretty damn dope they make me wanna start housing HAH\n\nOkay tho one CON walking through the club is not ideal ESPECIALLY when it clearly smells like vomit. SOME PEOPLE JUST CANT HANDLE VEGAS. YUCK.
