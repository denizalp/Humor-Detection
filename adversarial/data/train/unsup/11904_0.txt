I came here with my co-workers for a team lunch. We do this every quarter and decided come here cause they can handle large parties and they have a big variety menu. \n\nWhen we got here our table was already setup and once we sat down our server was really quick to provide us with our drinks. I ordered the California Burger. I thought that this was really good. Bursting with flavor. The burger was on a grilled sourdough bread with avocado, green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, and ranch. Burger was very moist and perfect. It came with shoestring fries. Half the plate was filled with fries. It was a huge lunch meal but really worth it. \n\nAs for the service, our server was always checking on us. Refilling our drinks and clearing the empty plates. We even had the manager come by to make sure everything was okay. It seemed like they really cared for us. \n\nSo overall, I would say that we had a really enjoyable time. We had a table over 10 people and the service and food came out in a reasonable time. The only regret was that I didn't order their Pizookie. Those are so good. Enjoy...
