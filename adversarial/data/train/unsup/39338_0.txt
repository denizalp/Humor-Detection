I'm sure this could be a 4-star place for me, but I had a good time, not great. A coworker and I came in after work to catch up after HH. We shared the grilled artichoke and shrimp cocktail over a few glasses of wine. The service was good and the food and wine was okay. Might have been just average choices on our part which is why I wasn't wowed. I'd definitely come in again though
