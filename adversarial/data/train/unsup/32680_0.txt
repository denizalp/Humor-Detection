The good -I give them 5 stars for their gel nails and pedicures.  They have always done a great job when getting either of these services.  Their pedicure chairs are comfortable.  The nail techs have always given at least 5 minute leg massages with pedicures.\n\nThe bad- Don't go here for SNS.  They do a gel topcoat at the end and this is the only time my SNS has ever chipped\/cracked.  They say it is for the shine but doing the standard SNS topcoat gives a better shine than the gel topcoat and if you're getting SNS you want to avoid the UV light so it doesn't really make sense to do the gel topcoat.
