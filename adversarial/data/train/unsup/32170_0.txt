Some lady named Rosa is just plain RUDE!! I've called  to make a complaint on her twice already because she absolutely does not know how to deal with customers.  And did I mention she yells at the staff to hurry up with total disregard that she's making a fool out of herself. Whatever you do, do not ask her a question about the ingredients in a salad because she will flip out on you!! Horrible service...breakfast hours
