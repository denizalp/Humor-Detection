Took my kids and nieces here awhile back. It's like the are trying to bring a little bit of Scottsdale to Surprise. Upscale designer food with upscale designer prices. \n\nNot good for kids, over priced. In a bowling alley you need options for kids - families. This isn't it. There should be something for them. The Alley is big enough to have a mom and pop diner among the mix. \n\nGood for dates, couples, over 21 people. Good for those who want to spend $20 on a caesar salad and soda. Which the salad sucked. My bill was over $90 (not incl tip) for 3 adults and 3 kids, for lunch!
