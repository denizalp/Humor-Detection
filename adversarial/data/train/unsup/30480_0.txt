The rolling hills were a new challenge. Definitely needed a car unless you needed an uphill workout. The fairways are long and wide, and the greens are large. Some ground holes and soft spots were noticed, tho overall fairways and greens were very nice. Staff is friendly and helpful. \nThe country club venue is newer, beautiful and a wonderful spot for a large or small event. Service was very good, and food was delicious.
