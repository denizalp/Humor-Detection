I had not visited a Steak & Shake since college (20+ years). When I realized there was one across the street from the MGM Grand I quickly made plans for.dinner. Food was great. Service was attentive but hampered by the lengthy  time between ordering and receiving our food (1 hour, 10 minutes) and then waiting for shakes (35 minutes from time ordered). Restaurant was only about a third full on a weekday evening. I know this location is having a soft opening and may not be fully up to speed (pun intended) but they need to get their act together.
