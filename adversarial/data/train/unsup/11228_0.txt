Believe it or not, up until last week I had never stepped foot in a Yard House at all, at any place, or at anytime. We recently met some friends here and really enjoyed a pleasant and casual dining experience.\n\n(+) Friendly and accommodating service. Our waitress was funny and outgoing and really added to our time here. Our drinks never went empty and we were checked up on periodically. Great service.\n(+) Food was tasty and portions were good. I decided to just try the Classic Cheeseburger cooked medium and it was very tasty! Chicken wings were plump and juicy. Chicken Nachos were outstanding as well! Definitely enjoyed some delicious food here!\n(+) Nice laid back and casual atmosphere with plenty of TV's on sports (+++) and they offer some great Happy Hour specials!\n\n\nThis is a great spot for decently priced food and drinks in a fun and laid back atmosphere. We are already talking of going back in the next few days!\n \n4 stars.\n\nDefinitely a fan and we will be back!
