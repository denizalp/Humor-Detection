Today was my first visit to Los Cucos.  I had high expectations and was excited to try it.  When we arrived the hostess, was nice and seated us promptly.  The ambiance was strange, I felt like it was trying to be an authentic Mexican restaurant, but couldn't quite get there. It was \"cold\" and lacked that home-like feeling one typically would encounter.  The wait staff was nice, though our service felt rushed.  \n\nI ordered the La Bonita Plate (3 pcs) chicken fajita quesadillas, (1 pc) beef fajita taco covered with chile con queso and (1 pc) chile con queso puff tostada.  Honestly, it was lacking and for $16.99 I expected more.  The Chicken Quesadllas were mostly cheese, The beef  fajita taco, was not a taco at all.  It was a rolled torilla with meat in it; That's it meat and tortilla, with some cheese wizz queso (I should have taken a picture).  \n\nWhat surprised me was the chile con queso puff tostada.  This wasnt even a tostada; It was simply a torilla that was blown up like a balloon (hallow and empty inside).  There was nothing inside and some of the wizz on top.  Taco Bell has out performed this meal.  \n\nI will tell you that two of my co-workers ordered the Super Salad and raved about them.  From the looks of it - they were well portioned.  Neither of them could finish their dish.\n\nWhat really prompted me to write this?  Well besides the mediocre food, it was our first time here.  I certainly did not expect anything from telling our waiter this, but I would have thought that he would have had some good recommendations.  His suggestions seemed random and disingenuous.\n\nI may or may not be back, the jury is still out...
