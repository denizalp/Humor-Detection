The worst buffet in my history for the price of 42 dollar!!!.\nThe ambiance is perfect\nThe waitress is awesome\nThe stand chefs are mean!\nThe food was suckssss!!!\nWhy?\nThe prime ribs was tasteless and dry\nThe salmon was over cooked\nThe sushi was taste awful like someone who try to make sushi in the first time with limited selection. I confidence that the sushi chefs are not from Japan. The roll is so much pressure that make the rice sushi became rice cake. Is kind a eating very cheap sushi in getho location.\nI will not recomended this buffet to eat. \n\nThat was my worst buffet dinner experience in history ever!!!\nIf i can, i would like to give negative star!\nWorst buffet for such beautiful hotel!\nBy the way, this is eka's husband.\nWe spent 100 dollar for garbage food!
