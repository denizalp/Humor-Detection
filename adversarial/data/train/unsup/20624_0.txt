Doesn't even taste like pho, nor smell like it.\n\nI had asked for extra veggies in my vermicelli, and it looked like they put in less than most places normally would if i had not asked for extra. This plate was ok.\n\nMy seat had a bunch of rips in it, and when you sit on ripped leather it kinda hurts if you wear a dress\/shorts.
