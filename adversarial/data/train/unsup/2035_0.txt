Came here with my boyfriend and a friend. Was very excited as I love trying new places! I wasn't impressed with the food, and left feeling heavy. We were all very excited to try the vegan cinnamon buns....but they came to our table cold and burnt on the bottom. The rest of the meal was OK. Not very much parking, and if you try to park in the lot next to theirs, you will be asked to move.
