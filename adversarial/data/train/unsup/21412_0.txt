Aw man! This is THE very first time I've ever down graded my rating on a place, but I gotta do it. \n\nI go to Burrito Boyz whenever I'm craving a shrimp and calamari burrito. No change in the process, still quick and friendly. They used to offer complimentary tortilla chips made fresh in house, then they switched over to multicolored chips that tasted like they were store bought, and now none *sigh*\n\nMy burrito was still stuffed with delicious and fresh ingredients but when I unwrapped it there was a split in the middle; no problem,  I was planning to split it with hubby anyway. The tortillas they're using now are noticeably thinner and not as sturdy as before. My half of the burrito split again as I was eating it, making it very messy to finish. Maybe next time I'll try a naked burrito instead. Sorry Burrito Boyz now you're just ok.
