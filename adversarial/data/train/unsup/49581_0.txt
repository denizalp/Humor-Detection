Emily, Nadia and the guys are unbelievable culinary and customer happiness geniuses in a sea of blah and ugh! This is my third visit here and my first visit ever having Greek food. Emily introduced me to everything on the menu with a upbeat personality that you cannot find anywhere these days. The food was exceptional I had the Gyro with their mind numbingly delicious French fries. Possibly the best french fries I've ever tasted, no joke. On my second visit I tried their steak kebab which was suggested by the fabulous Nadia. Another homerun! The meat here is beyond tender, delicious and fresh. My third visit I tried the Gyro #1 again and I am so glad I made the trip back here. Emily actually remembered my nephew and I and of course the guys in the back greeted us with a hearty hello. Place is clean, very reasonable for the amount of food you get and always keeps you hankering for the next visit. Try the Greek pita you will be incredibly pleased!
