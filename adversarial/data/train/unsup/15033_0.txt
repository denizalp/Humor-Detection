Restaurant? or Modeling Agency?\n\nAbout 5 of my buddies and grabbed an early dinner at Culinary Dropout this past weekend. From the hostess to the janitor, everyone in this joint was freaking beautiful. What does this have to do with quality food or service? NOTHING. But its just a fact everyone should know. Boom!\n\nI actually ordered a couple things: Fish N Chips, Grilled Cheese, and The Turkey Pastrami. Without going into details, the Fish N Chips were ridiculously small and the Grilled Cheese was elementary. However, the Turkey Pastrami was incredible. It wasn't as greasy as the usual pastrami and tasty as hell! \n\nDid I mention the employees? No, besides the fact that they were goddesses, the service was fantastic. I like to ask a waitress how something [that sounds gross] tastes. I wanna test their integrity. I love it when they say, \"Don't order that.\" And that they did! I like honesty. Makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. \n\nI'd go back. Obviously.
