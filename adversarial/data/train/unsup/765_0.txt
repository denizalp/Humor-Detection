7\/28\/11\n\nTook Mom here for happy hour, and the whole experience was just 2.5 stars, but I rounded up to three, since the cheese and charcuterie plate was solid, and I was given a second chance at a cocktail (when the first, the mojito, was not very good), so Mom ordered a Bloody Mary, but she didn't like it, either.  We couldn't wait to try the three-hummus plate, but we weren't impressed.  Even the sweet potato tots couldn't cut it.  Just the meat and cheese plate satisfied.  The chocolate chip bread pudding was a HUGE disappointment-- very dry, and not much chocolate flavor.  \n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/tryst-cafe-phoenix?select=52IqPNephB7PRq-6r6dsMA#52IqPNephB7PRq-6r6dsMA\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/tryst-cafe-phoenix?select=uCuB5TKZU4JZVyoerb_CJg#uCuB5TKZU4JZVyoerb_CJg\n\nI don't think I've been back for happy hour...
