Holy slots, Batman. This airport is a condensed version of Vegas and all the the kitschy glory that comes with the city. \n\nSparkling floors, advertisements with half-naked men, and slot machines galore are all in spades. There's definitely no doubt you flew into the right airport. It feels old and what I imagine Al Capone's favorite restaurant looks like, but it's charming and a great way to start your vacation. \n\nThe best part is that they guide you to the liquor stores on site with bright signs as prominent as the baggage claim ones. You're never far from a good time in Vegas, even at the airport.
