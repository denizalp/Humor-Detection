A fun and fresh interpretation on delicious french countryside snacks. Cocktails are given some thought as others have noted and the dishes are rich and interesting accompaniments, and also quite visually inspiring at times - bonjour, le grand aioli! \n\nIt's been open for a few months, but BB still feels like a place that you'd have to know about as it's not immediately obvious from the outside how to enter and what exactly this space is used for. (Although, with that being said, it may be a bit unusual for a serious Torontonain to be unfamiliar with Anthony Rose's spots at this point I would think) \n\nAnyhow, they should probably work on the step situation... perhaps I'm already a senior-in-training but I managed to trip on the way in AND on the way out. Now that's talent!
