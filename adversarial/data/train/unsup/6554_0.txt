Good coffee, lots of flavor choices, and creamers. Usually very clean, cheap gas, lotsa snacks.\n I appreciate the diversity in their COLD soda choices. They seem to keep a lot of choices and replace them as they are bought instead of simply loading 5 choices in the fridge and calling it good.\n The ATM at the gas pump almost always works, a rarity at gas pumps in the hot days of summer.
