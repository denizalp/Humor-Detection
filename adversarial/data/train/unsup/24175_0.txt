This is the worst apartment complex I have ever lived in. The apartments are about 25 years old. The pool was always closed, and they always shut off the water. They do random checks through out your apartment.  Always keep your receipts,  because they will try to charge you for things you already paid for. Don't even bother cleaning your apartment when u leave because they will charge you 100%.\nI definitely would not recommend this place to anyone.  Like I said keep your records. . Because they will try to hustle every dollar from u!!!
