Stopped by today to fulfill the promise I made to myself to try a s'mores pop tart. Much to my dismay the s'mores was not available so I tried cherry instead. I'm going to chalk it up as divine intervention from the pastry gods because it was delicious; it completely wiped clean any thoughts of s'mores. Chewy and flaky and sweet and tart and all other kinds of lovely adjectives. Yum!\n\nI also tried a different roast of pour over that ended up being much more within my flavor preferences. Very good stuff (but sadly cannot remember the name - cipacapa or something?)\n\nAll things considered (see my previous post), I think this is a 5 star joint. Glad to have this new location that's more conveniently located to my home and office.
