$50 a person. Low key disappointed in the dessert choices (I was lookin for creme brulee). Unlimited alcohol is included in your meal. Certain alcoholic drinks weren't included like mimosas and baileys coffee ($6). Overall it wasn't bad. They have a variety of foods like prime ribs, loaded mashed potatoes, dessert bar, seafood like mussels, clams, crab legs, and shrimp. They also have some choices of Asian styled food like orange chicken, and coconut shrimp. Servers were nice and tended to our table often. There was a drunk lad who was in line in front of us. He could barely stand and was about to fall on my friends.... I didn't like that... he also cut a few people in line but no one said anything because he was clearly drunk. He ate by himself and knocked out at the table (he sat behind us) ...... a server came by to wake him up........
