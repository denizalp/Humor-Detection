They are the most friendly staff! So personable and caring and fun while they prepare your meals\n\nThe place is ALWAYS packed so it's hard to get a seat. People are pretty mindful though and turn tables over quickly.\n\nThe price is great and the serving sizes are way too large for this gal, but great for feeding a man tummy!\n\nThe food is delicious! Definitely worth trying!
