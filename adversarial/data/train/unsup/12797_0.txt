Yes, this is pretty much a one-man business; the owner is also the cashier, receptionist, accountant, customer relations rep, and of course, the only shoe repairman; all at the same time! This dude takes no vacations. Wow. Yes, there will be a reasonable wait time and it might take a few days to get your shoes back. The ambience isn't chic or elegant like them fancy hipsters want it, but it is utilitarian. AND these are the exact same reasons why a repair cost here is so affordable!!!\n\nInstead of buying a new pair of $100-200 shoes, my wife simply had the soles replaced for around $18 a pair. The shop is often packed, and patrons come from all walks of life, all saying the same thing: in this economy why buy a new pair? or why throw old shoes into a landfill when its life can be extended and reused?\n\nSo send in your tired leather goods, rejected shoes, broken zippers, damaged bags; and see some money saved in the bank!
