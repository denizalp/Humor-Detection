\"I prefer my Mexican food to have a little bit of an animal that suffered a little bit. That's some of the best food.\" â€• George Lopez\n\nBrace yourself for fierce mesquite meats.  It's like having coal-cooked meat kick you in your mouthpants.\n\nThe smell of meat cooking over coals... oh man!  So first things first, be careful and conservative when using the red sauce because it is hot!  Secondly, get the al pastor tacos.  I always base my taco reviews on how the al pastor is because any time I can get my taco with some pineapple, I'm a happy girl.  Even though I was sniffling and crying from being too liberal with the red sauce, the avocado crema and horchata not cooling down the blazing inferno in my mouth whatsoever, it was so dang tasty.  You can taste the marinade and smokiness even through the heat from the sauce.  Get it on the corn tortillas!  I also got the carne asada, on a flour tortilla, which I'm not mad about.  It was salted heavily and a tad on the drier side so when I come back to BYT, I'll probably get all tacos al pastor.  I also got a bean and cheese tostata to share with my friend just so we can try their beans.  They're were creamy and flavorful!  I like how they put the cheese right on the grill and topped it with beans and another sprinkling of cheese.  \n\nBYT is amazing!  It's probably my favorite place now for tacos.  Parking and seating can be a bit challenging at this location so try popping in at the off-peak times.
