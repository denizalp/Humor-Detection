My mom and I are so happy with our results!!! We can't stop smiling! Tanya is awesome. You can tell she works hard and loves what she does. My mom and I came in for our appointment and she was taking care of us simultaneously. I was always skeptical about teeth whitening because they tend to be pricey and I wasn't sure if I'd be satisfied with my results. I purchased the Groupon and I'm so glad I did. This gave me the opportunity to finally try teeth whitening and I couldn't be happier. Tanya's service is both affordable and effective! I do have some slight sensitivity but it's not bad and should go away within 24 hours. I also love how her products are organic and natural! The office is super cute and well-styled. Tanya's is definitely the place to go to get your teeth whitened!
