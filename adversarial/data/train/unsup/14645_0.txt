So strolling into this restaurant, i was very doubtful they would compare to some of my favorite Chinese restaurants (Pei Wei). We looked over the menu and found that they have a pretty huge selection of different dishes so finding something that we would like was not hard at all and the prices are very reasonable. \n\nWe ended up getting Cashew Chicken and Mongolian Beef, so we took a seat and waited for our food and they ended up delivering the food to the table in what appears to be the only serving dishes they have which is a styro-foam container. So my first thought was oh no, maybe its so bad that they want you to take it home to eat so you wont complain. So we both opened our container and the steam came up and hit us in the face and once the steam cleared out of our face we took in the portion size and were very content since we were starving. \n\nWe grubbed on the food and it was fresh ingredients and tasted awesome. The portions were huge and we ended up both taking the rest of the food home for dinner. \n\nI think I just found a substitute to my Pei Wei since the closes one is miles away.
