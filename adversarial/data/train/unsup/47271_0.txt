For the price ($40) full set medium length with gel polish you just can't go wrong. I've been here a few times now and would definitely recommend Kim or Kevin. Both do a great job! Make sure to call ahead and make a appointment. If you don't there will most likely be a wait however the service is never rushed and they take their time with each client. Definitely will be a returning customer.
