After one year in Vegas I finally tried a famous Vegas champagne brunch buffet ( after spending 2 hours in the gym of course lol) it was amazing. This place has a big variety of breakfast and (not only) food. Everything is very tasty and you can still eat healthy if you want to. Their brisket is wonderful. The service is very fast and friendly. The place is nicely decorated, and it slightly looks like a train station of the 19th century. If it wasn't for a table of little Mexican kids yelling and screaming all over the place without their parents and stuff saying something to them it would have been an amazing experience. 5 stars!
