In Vegas for the first time and we wanted to grab a quick bite. All American was in our hotel.\n\nThere was a brief wait but we were seated quickly. The menu is direct and to the point. Basic breakfast, lunch\/dinner and of course steaks and burgers. The burger choices were good. The messy fries had me SUPER FULL. \n\nI got a free beer upon check in and the manager was AWESOME allowing me to choose a bottle since the domestic drafts weren't any that I drink. The service was very good. Our drink glasses never got low, the food came promptly and the servers checked on us frequently.
