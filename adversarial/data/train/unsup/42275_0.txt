This was one of the first, if not the first outlet mall in Las Vegas. With that being said, it has seen it's better days. With a name change and some renovation it is looking less dilapidated, but it is not quite there yet. \n\nThe new exterior and outside shops hide the eye sore of an inside. The going out of business sale for Harry and David brought me back, but it was a quick in and out process. The new outlets give off a similar feel to the Charleston Outlets, but smaller. With the addition of little embellishments and improvements on the inside, it might go back to it's former glory. \n\nThe shops offer great deals, but driving a little bit further to the aforementioned outdoor mall is a better experience. You get to walk around outside, the cheap deals, the facilities are well maintained.
