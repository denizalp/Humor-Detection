A great little place I frequent for lunch. It's small but the food is fresh and delicious. The Mac and Cheese is spicy which makes it extra good and the soup of the day is always a favourite. They make fresh bread for their sandwiches (so good) and the fresh beverages really just top the meal off! The staff are always friendly and the place is clean! There isn't anywhere to sit so you have to take your food to go but it's always worth it. Everything is reasonably priced which is what keeps me coming back!
