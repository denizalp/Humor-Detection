The guy behind the gun counter was extremely rude and ignorant! Instead of admitting that he didn't know anything about a particular firearm, he pretended that he did until it is obvious that he didn't know what he was talking about. He had a bad attitude and was very unprofessional, with absolutely no customer service skills whatsoever. I wouldn't go to that store again if they were giving away free merchandise! I now see why I was the only customer in the store when I was there!
