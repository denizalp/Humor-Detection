After dinner, we were craving some ice cream.  We stummbled upon Gelato 64 . . . The ipod white atmosphere was sleek and hip as we munched our mint chip & butter pecan.  It was fabulous.  To my surprise they also serve espresso\/coffee drinks.  I was going to get my normal drip, when pumpkin pie latte was starring me in my face.  It was DELICIOUS!!!  And now I am obsessing about pumpkin pie latte.  My husband ordered the ginger spice latte which was also a great hit with us.  YUMMY, YUMMY!!!!!!
