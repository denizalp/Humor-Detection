This was the first time I've been here and if I could give this place less than one star I would. The service was slow. I ordered two tacos and found a HAIR on one of them. When I went back to the bar to let the bartender know he gave me attitude because I found a hair. He proceeded to ask me what he could do to make me happy and then got upset when I asked what could be done. I will not return to this establishment. Terrible service.
