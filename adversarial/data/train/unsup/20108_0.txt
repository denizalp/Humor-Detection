i was hoping for more from this place based on how it was touted in the city paper. when my uncle and i arrived, the place was packed and based on that i assumed the food was at the least....good. what cant i say? the server was gods second gift to all mankind who was spreading the good news  through his skinny jeans, piercings and smug demeanor  was a shining beacon that reflected all that is wrong with the \"new\" east liberty. and now the food: if you read this review after eating there dont say i didnt tell you so. it literally is all smoked salt and sugar for 75 dollars. it was so salty that veins popped out of my forehead and i thought i was gonna have a seizure as my 57 year old uncle experienced the same side effects. i informed our server that i couldnt eat the food due to the high sodium content and as opposed to being apologetic and trying to offer something else on the menu, he looked at me as if i had told him about the nude photos of his mother that i have that give me much joy. he walked and came back with the check without as much a thank you. gentrification.....tastes like chicken.
