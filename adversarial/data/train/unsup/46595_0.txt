I could see why there are so many bad reviews about the Grand Buffett. To be quite frank, I think it wasn't so bad. Granted I got 3 free meals a day at the Buffett as part of a stay package, I think the food was pretty good. However, it paled in comparison to the Wynn Buffett. \n\nI think they had the same stuff for two days in a row, which made me a little annoyed. I was hoping that they'd at least rotate dishes throughout the week or something... \n\nI noticed the prices werent as high as The Wynn, but they it seemed overpriced for what it actually was. I enjoyed the food; however, I cannot see myself giving more than 3 stars.
