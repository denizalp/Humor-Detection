so I'm usually super unimpressed with Arizona contractors, but Bob and his team are a winning combination! I found him on Yelp and contacted him to come out and give me a bid to paint a house I'm selling. He was out within a couple days and gave me a killer price, around $100 a sq\/ ft! he was super flexible in our paint color choices and even got a few sample cans for us to look at before we chose the color! His team was done with prep and painting the full exterior of the house, and the block wall, within 2 days! He even went as far to tell me that if he didn't have a crew available on the days I needed, he'd hire a new one! Overall an AWESOME experience with this company. i HIGHLY recommend them for  painting.
