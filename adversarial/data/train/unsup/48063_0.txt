This is the worst mani pedi I have ever had. Total time was less than 30 minutes. I took my sons girlfriend with me to treat and she couldn't believe I was finished 45 minutes ahead of her. The women I had was very negative, talked about how bad my feet were and was very rushed to get onto the next customer. I will never return.
