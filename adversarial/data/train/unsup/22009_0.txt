Came here on a recommendation from a co-worker and since we are always on the hunt for a good hole in the wall we gave it a go.\n\nFirst let me warn ya...this restaurant is in a not so good area and gave me the creeps even in plain daylight. \n\nAnyways, I ordered the chilaquiles which come with 2 eggs any style and beans.  They come in red or green sauce. The red sauce was supposedly mild and the green sauce was hot so I went with the red. One bite and quickly realized they were simply awful and still too spicy, so then tried the eggs which I ordered over easy, and got rubber instead, so I quickly moved on and tried the beans and they were okay except they used the most smelliest cheese topper which made them uneatable. (this quickly felt like the story of Goldilocks and the three bears) Luckily my husband ordered birria de chivo (goat) which was some of the best I have had in Vegas, and best of all he was willing to share. It also came with plenty of fresh made corn tortillas. \n\nNot sure I'd come back even for the birria since the location is just simply not the safest looking place.  Also don't expect friendly service. .I am sure we can find better.
