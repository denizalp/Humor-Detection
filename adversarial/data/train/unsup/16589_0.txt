I stayed at the Fremont Hotel during my Vegas trip recently. I decided to take a walk down the Fremont Street Experience heading eastbound and noticed a Denny's Restaurant and the International Eatery Food Court.\n\nI walked around the lower level and noticed a few stores. There was a tattoo parlor, Toy Shack, American Sports Trading Cards, Celestial Comics, a e-vapor lounge, a Mediterranean restaurant, the Heart Attack Grill, and there was a stage area. The second floor consisted of the Southern Nevada Museum of Fine Arts, the main office for the Neonopolis building, a bowling lane which is opened after 5pm, a office for architecture design, as well as several empty store fronts. There was a third level heading towards the theaters but it was blocked off. Parking is located underground for customers. \n\nRight in the middle of Fremont Street and in front of the International Eatery food court and Walgreens is also the beginning for Slotzilla Zip line. The adventurous individuals can choose one of two rides. The first one is a short ride that stops in front of Fremont Hotel. The longer ride continues on towards the west end of Fremont Street Experience.\n\nHopefully in the near future there will be more stores added to the Neonopolis shopping center.
