Very rarely am I surprised, and even MORE rarely am I pleasantly surprised. The Wing Company, with its welcoming hole in the wall atmosphere it has done just that.  Blink and you'll miss it, or possibly thinks its a dry cleaner (it's just that small).\n\nInside the layout is simple and effective. 1 counter, 1 open to view kitchen, stools, raised tables and most importantly the menu. Lots of flavours, and the two I had on my first ever visit make me want to try the entire line up.\n\nIt is important to note, I'm a fan of Duffs wings. However I find them pretty greasy. The Wing Company's product didn't feel anywhere near as bad, and the real winner here is flavour. Duff's flavours are pretty basic but very good. The Wing Company's flavours are unique and excellent (based on my sampling). Actually, I don't know if I have a reason to go back to Duff's now.\n\nNow for the best part. I ordered 20 wings on a Tuesday and they give me a bag that must have had 30-35! That my friends is a flirtatious promotion. I'm going to go there every week until I'm too fat to squeeze into my elevator. It'll be pimpin'.
