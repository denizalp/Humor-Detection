This wasn't my first visit at this restaurant! I had a 6:30 Reservation at The Steak House. So as a returning guest I'm very disturbed by the service I received.  For a $285 meal, this shouldn't have happened. I've ordered the 27 ounce Prime Rib Dinner on multiple occasions to share. (the restaurant gives you the option for $20 extra). The Prime Rib has never came to my table from the kitchen UNCUT. I was caught by surprise when the server informed me that I had to cut this 27 Ounce cut of meat myself. It's always came cut from the KITCHEN for me and one of my guest. After the waiter noticed surprised look on my face and requesting that the kitchen cuts the huge Prime Rib for me, my waiter grabbed MY CUTTING KNIFE AND TRIED TO CUT MY PRIME RIB IN HALF. He grabbed my serving knife off the table and proceeded to try to cut my Prime Rib in front of me. He was literally in my personal space trying to cut my meat how he thought it should be cut. I had to literally tell him once more that I would prefer if the kitchen chefs cut it. He looked irritated. I mean WTF, why would you try to cut my damn prime rib for me? He brought the meat back and it was cut in a way that it should've never been cut. Directly down the middle.  When I've ordered this before on different occasions it has never came to my table looking so rock bottom. It always comes actually cut in a way that looks like an excellent cut of meat. I'm so angry that this waiter literally took my cutting knife and proceeded my cut my 27 OUNCE PRIME RIB STEAK AT MY TABLE. And then we only had 1 AU JUS Sauce to share. We asked for a second one and although the server brung it to us, he did it in a way where it seemed like we were bothering him. I'm very disappointed. And as investor in MGM Resorts properties, in very disappointed in this property. I'll never return.
