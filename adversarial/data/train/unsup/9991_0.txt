I came in here after all the buzz and find out for myself and it is grooooooooss. It tasted microwaved, if I wanted frozen food I would've gone to Walmart and microwaved a stouffers frozen lasagna myself! They are so rude and the employees look like hostages I feel so bad for them. These are terrible people and they don't deserve to have a business, will never come here again even if it was free.
