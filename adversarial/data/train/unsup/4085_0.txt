when we walked in we had to go get our own menu and sit ourselves. I got Chile verde with pork and my boyfriend got a huarache de chicharr√≥n. they served us a handful of chips and a sour green sauce. not spicey at all! 15 minutes later our food shows up. the chicharrone was aweful. tasted like old oil and so soggy. on my plate was a row of beans a row of rice and 2 chunks of meat in a pool of the same sour green sauce. they waitress saw our plate and asked if we didn't like it. not to be rude I said it was fine. very disappointed to pay 22 bucks and tip for \"authentic Mexican food \" true Mexicans stay away from this place.
