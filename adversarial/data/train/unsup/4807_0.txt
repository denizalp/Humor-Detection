To find a KBBQ place in Henderson was mind blowing when I first saw them build the restaurant, however; I'd recommend making the drive to Chinatown for something much better\n\nSetting: situated in the busy parking lot with BJs, hot n juicy, brew tea bar, and taco y taco there are a lot of places to dine. Inside is decently spaced and well ventilated.\n\nService: props to the manager(Jihye)  for busting her ass while some of the other servers were just taking it easy.  Do yourself a huge favor and cut the weak links because it's destroying your flow.\n\nFood: the quality of meats here are pretty bad. I think you can go to the Asian market and pick up better pork belly than the ones here. The grills don't filter out the fats and juices that well so it just cooks with the meat making it look steamed than caramelized. Also I've never seen carrots inside of bean paste soup and that's just not how it's prepared. Got the soon dae guk which tasted store bought.\n\nOverall: A KBBQ place in Henderson especially in a busy plaza you'd think would do well but the quality of meat and lack of service other than from the manager makes me rather drive to Hobak and wait 2 hours there
