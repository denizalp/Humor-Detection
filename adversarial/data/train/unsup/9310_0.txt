Whew! This cute and comfortable crepe factory will tempt you like the Devil incarnate. My \"Old Mushroom Delight\";The most savourful crepe in Crepe history had me begging for more and wishing they delivered. All the entree or \"savourful\" crepes incorporated chocolate; With mushroom, eggplant or just a plain old chocolate crepe. Service was excellent.
