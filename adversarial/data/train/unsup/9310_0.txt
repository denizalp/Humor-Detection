Very disappointed! Vera's House of Bridal is very unprofessional. I made an appointment on Saturday January 10th at 2:30 as a return customer to try on a dress that I am interested in purchasing. My bridesmaid traveled over 300 miles from Missouri to join me for this appointment and I traveled 225 miles from northern Wisconsin. When we arrived at Vera's they were extremely over booked. My bridesmaid and I sat in the lobby for over 30 mins...nobody came to talk to us...and nobody apologized for running late. They never even asked if we would like a glass of water. I finally made my way to the desk to tell them that we would be leaving and the lady at the counter said appointments are only tentative. I was so disappointed when I left that I cried all the way home. Completely a waste of my time and money traveling to Vera's. Please be advised if you plan on visiting.
