Monkeyshines is small because of a big, u-shaped bar and a large pool table.  This isn't a problem until it's crowded, which it usually is.  Add in 99% of the patrons smoking, and you've got an asthma attack coming.  Gack!  \n\nReally, though, I've generally had an alright time there, so I don't have a vendetta against it.  I would never choose to go here, but I'll go if others are going.
