I'm not sure whether to give Jubilee 4 or 5 stars but I think because of the value I'll go with a 4.5. The show is truly over the top, as Vegas as it gets. At a given time there are 60 performers on stage in elaborate costumes wth rhinestones, sequins and feathers galore. The stage sets and lighting are just as elaborate. My only complaint is that the stage isn't high enough. Though the rows of seats are slightly stadium style (elevated) the taller gentleman in front of me blocked a lot of the view. If the stage had been a few feet higher I wouldn't have had a problem.\n\nThe routines and music are a bit dated in parts, but since the show is known for being one of the Vegas originals I suppose they don't want to change too much. \n\nThere was a buy one get one free coupon for the show so tickets in the middle were about $42 each after taxes. We went to the early show (not topless) so I think the performers had more energy than they would have at the late show. The show lasted about 90 minutes.\n\n\nRead more Las Vegas and Los Angeles Reviews on my blog- http:\/\/rescuelashelters.wordpress.com\/2011\/07\/06\/the-best-of-the-las-vegas-strip\/
