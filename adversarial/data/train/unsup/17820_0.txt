The owners couldn't be nicer and more helpful! While I was hesitant to visit, because I had a preconceived notion they mainly cater to dogs, I was wrong.\n\nLet me be clear. Most of the shop is dog stuff, but they're expanding their cat section currently, which makes me very happy!\n\nThe owner helped me pick out this special cat litter, Cat Attract, because we're having some bad kitty bathroom behavior... And it's working! \n\nI also picked up a banana filled with catnip that is a VERY popular toy in the Carlson household (the cats use it, not us:). \n\nThey also sell items from local vendors, like handmade collars and dish holders from Reclaimed Things. They also deliver now to the immediate area.\n\nGreat shop worth the visit, even if it's out of the way for you, it's worth a stop in!
