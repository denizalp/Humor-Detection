FnB, hmmm, what does it stand for, I wonder?\n\nFreakin' brilliant!?\n\nFortuitously beguiling!?\n\nFestooned n Bedecked!?\n\nCould it be anything as mundane as food n beverage?\n\nWell, regardless of the name, there is nothing mundane about this dining experience. The best thing I can say about a place like this is that I'm giddy the entire time. With each course, each mouthful of succulent deliciousness I'm just thrilled to be enjoying the experience. We had shrimp, we had squash, we had nuts, we had salad, we had fried green tomatoes, we had steak ... Oh and the bread! We ate so much wonderful bread!\n\nI could go on all night but my mouth is watering and if I keep thinking about that incredible meal - well, the keyboard could get a bit wet. Anyway, the service was beyond compare. The couple who own the restaurant are determined to make people feel at home and they succeed and then some. \n\nOh, hell! I've just got to stop. It's 10:15 pm and there's no way I can get all the way to Scottsdale before they close. Just go! See for yourself!
