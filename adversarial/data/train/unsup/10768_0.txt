I love cafe crepe.  It's a Parisian style coffee shop. They have proper grilled panini sandwiches as well as savoury crepes and sweet crepes. The savoury crepes are fantastic and the sweet ones are even better. How does Nutella, hazelnut, grand marnier and banana sound? It's music to my ears. The decor is hip and prices are reasonable. You can also get the crepes at the takeout counter to go.
