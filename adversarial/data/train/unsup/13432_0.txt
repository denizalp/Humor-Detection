Updated: the owners mailed us a check refunding us completely for the grooming. However, the letter they included with it was still rude! Even if they believed that shaving my dog was a \"miscommunication\", they should accept responsibility and apologize. Instead, the owner said he did what he believed was best....without even calling first to check if it was ok. Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever received. I will never return here, and I will continue to tell my friends to take their dogs elsewhere.\nFinal thought: It's not worth the gamble to take your pup here when there are plenty of better groomers in the area.
