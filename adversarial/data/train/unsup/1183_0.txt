Guys, this is a brand new grocery store that's located in a very underserved part of town, an area that has a very dense population yet extremely limited retail options. Of course a brand spanking new grocery store is going to have some growing pains, so lighten up a bit!\n\nI'm a loyal Smith's shopper but I was excited to check out this new Albertsons, and wow, is it a nice supermarket! It's very well laid out and spotlessly clean, with a large deli and a gorgeous produce section. I was happy to see that this location carries organic wheat grass (it's hidden in the produce so you have to search for it). It's not that I'm a health-nut juicer, but my cat LOVES the fresh wheat grass! I used to have to drive all the way out to Sprouts to find it, but now there's a place that sells it much closer to my home and office. So score one for my kitty!\n\nI'm also an amateur home cook and I was amazed at the variety of items carried at this location. If you're looking for some odd or special ingredient, don't go to Whole Foods: come here. The seafood and cheese departments are things of beauty, with all sorts of rare and hard to find items. If you're a grocery store junkie like me, take an hour or so out of your day to come in and just browse the aisles. You never know what you might find. \n\nLots of parking, but it can be challenging to get in and out of the parking lot due to traffic. Long lines at checkout but again, it's just because this is a brand new store. I'm sure things will calm down in a few months.
