admittance:\ni am, always will be...a gadgetaholic.\ni like things.\nand stuff.\nsometimes these things and stuff involve new purchases.\n\nthis purchase, though the product is not all together bad, is a BIG FAT OL MUTHA FLIPPIN RIP OFF.\n\nlet's talk the concept of rebates.\nmost stupid conglomerate corporate america companies (hereafter referred to as \"The Man\") offer rebates on larger technological purchases.  Wireless providers, be it of the cellular nature, wifi nature, or other, are included in this american tradition of rip off.\n\noops.  getting ahead of myself.\n\nback in the day, if you bought something that had a rebate, and you actually REMEMBER to mail that thing in on time, a few months later you get your check in the mail to deposit into your account thanking you for your little purchase.  or big purchase.  or gigantic holy crap i blew my paycheck purchase.  ooops there goes the down payment on our house purchase.  was that my mortgage purchase.\n\nsidetracked. sorry.\n\nnowadays, The Man wants to make things more effing difficult.  The Man feels that you can no longer be responsible enough to handle a check thanking you for business.  Apparently The Man thinks there is too much check fraud in the world today.  how this is possible, i don't know.\n\nthank you Frank Abagnale.\n\nBecause of The Man's sincere lack of trust issues (go seek relationship therapy, jerkoff), customers are now mailed visa cards in the amount of their rebate to supposedly \"use anywhere visa is accepted\".\n\nTHIS IS BULLSHIT.\n\nbecause i just spent my entire morning trying to use the effing thing at:\nthe salon\nthe mall\na restaurant\nto pay a bill\na clothing store.\n\nNONE of these places accepted it.  and if they thought they did, it would come up \"declined\", though it's never been used.\n\nI called The Man from two of the locations requesting assistance.  The Man said it had sixteen failed attempts in use, and in different sums.\ni watched the dude swipe the damn thing at the store.  maximum?  four times.  and NOT for the amount The Man was claiming.\n\nafter calling back, i received another friendly (lace this with sarcasm, please, since i can't bold it) customer service representative.  this woman was the rudest CSR in existence, who told me that it was my fault the card wasn't working, and that salons add 20% onto the card automatically and the other purchases would not be accepted either.\ni tell The Man Representative to send me a check and cancel the card.  she snaps at me that is impossible and snaps some more.\n\nafter snapping at me that she'll transfer me to a CS The Man supervisor, she hangs up on me.\n\nThe Man.  Holding me down.\n\nI will never purchase another gadget with promises of rebates again if they involve these stupid visa rebate cards.  no one accepts them, the customer service was horrible (and rude)  and now i am out $100 and gained a stupid piece of useless plastic.\n\ncongratulations, AT&T Wireless Rebate Customer Service.  You've just received my Douchebag of the Month Award.\n\n\nEFF YOU THE MAN.\nEFF FREAKIN YOU.
