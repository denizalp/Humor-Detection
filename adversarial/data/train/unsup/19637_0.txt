This is a restaurant that operates on the basis of emptying people's wallets by getting away with very mediocre food under the guise of an amazing view of the city. It holds a sneaky monopoly, in that respect.\n\nOne can expect to receive meagre portions at a high price point, all whilst tasting bland relative to the quality that could be found elsewhere. That is to say, from what was ordered, the consensus of the table was the following: the ribs were dry and burnt, smothered in an unidentifiable barbecue sauce of some sort; the Pizzas were just fine; the Tacos were underwhelming; the Piri Piri Chicken Drummies were laughable in their petite size; the Chocolate Lava Cake was a con in that it resembled nothing of its title; and the drinks were poorly made. \n\nRide the elevator up 51 floors, sneak in some photos, then come back down to reality.
