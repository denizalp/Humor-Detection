We've been avoiding trying Rubio's, but tonight we finally gave it a shot. We think it's great! We tried a fish, chicken, and steak taco and they were all delicious. The chips and salsas were good too. The beans were ok (runny, pretty sure they had rice mixed in them, hence the 4 out of 5 stars). We also tried a churro and it was tasty too. Good food for reasonable prices, plus convenience.
