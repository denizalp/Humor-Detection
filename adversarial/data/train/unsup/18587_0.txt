I hate to sound like a dork, but Inner Bliss is...Blissful!!\n\nI attended two \"Yoga Flow for all Levels\" classes with Gina (who I love and whose class \"themes\" always speak to exactly what I need) and left each time feeling so much lighter, spiritually.  Again, major dorkdom, but it's true.  Yoga in general makes you forget the daily nonsense and just be mindful of the moment, allowing your thoughts to just fade away until you are one with your body and your breath.  Geez, who am I?@?!\n\nAnyway, tried the notorious \"Hot Yoga\" yesterday with Kristen, and it, too, was wonderful.  Something about the heat makes it easier to flow with the movements and stretch deeper.  It was really intense, yet Kristen is so joyful and invigorating that it didn't really seem like we were being tortured.  She kept saying things like, \"Wow, GREAT poses, everyone!\" which makes me think she might have been ignoring my sorry excuse for standing split when she said that.  Hehe.  Generally I go to yoga not because I am \"good\" at anything but because of the feeling during and afterward.\n\nWhile the Hot yoga is considered a \"powerful flow\" (a little more advanced), I felt that it was non-competitive and I would go again despite my inability to do some of the more advanced poses.  I would recommend the Yoga Flow for All Levels class for just about anybody.  I am also looking forward to going back to take classes with some of the other instructors, because their website bios all sound so interesting, and they each bring something different to the practice.\n\nAdd a little extra time traveling there the first time; it is sort of hidden in a corner beneath an overpass, in a building with other offices. (There is a small sign that advertises Hot Yoga in the parking lot).
