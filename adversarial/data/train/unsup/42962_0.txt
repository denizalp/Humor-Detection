Although I have only been to songbird once. I was presently surprised as how easy going the coffee shop was. The second you walk through the door you're greeted with a happy staff and a beautiful atmosphere.  This is a perfect place spot to sit down, relax and catch up with a good friend. Take a seat on their beautiful vintage sofas! Believe me, you will not want to go! \n\nI definitely recommend this place to any local coffee lover!
