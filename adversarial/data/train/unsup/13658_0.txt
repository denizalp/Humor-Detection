Usually we go to Denny's for breakfast...what a mistake to come to Bill Johnson's. In fact, what the heck has happened to Bill Johnson's??? When did it go so downhill?\n\nLocated next to Lowe's on the west side of Dysart.\n\nGreasy, nasty bland breakfast (I don't even want to see who was cooking my food!). Sticky table, accented with lots of crumbs on the table and booth. Appetizing!\n\nService was very slow and the Food Server was very immature (I wonder if he realizes that his TIPS are based on his service??!) Please feel free to pick up the dirty dishes ANYTIME before dropping off the check. \n\nDo you want a refill for your coffee? Forget it, not here...never saw anyone walking around with a coffee pot.\n\nWhy is the parking lot always full? Who is eating here and why?\n\nYou'd be better off eating a processed breakfast sandwich from a gas station than dine here...
