The Dunking Doughnuts of NY! Tim Horton's at every corner and I'm not complaining. Came here everyday when I was visiting Toronto, for their Ice Capps. A delicious, refreshing delight anytime of the day. \n\nMake your trip to Canada memorable and enjoy a frozen, cold Ice Capp during your stay here! :)
