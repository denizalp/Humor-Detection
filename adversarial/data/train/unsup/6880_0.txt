The best french fries I've had in decades! I like my french fries to have a crispy outer shell, with a little bit of potato inside that is soft and steamy. I like them on the edge of just-about burnt, and slightly greasy. Potato \"wedges\" are the bane of my potato-loving existence. These fries were incredible, and the perfect pair to the juicy burger. \n\nI don't usually order a burger and fries, not because I don't like them, but because I really like really good burgers and fries and I have been let down in the past. But this place was great! Once we ordered the assorted pickles, and they were super delicious, I had a feeling the burger and fries would be equally satisfying. And it was! \n\nParking in this area can be a bit hit-and-miss, but 1000% worth it for those epic, incredible, french fries!
