I recently started to have water delivered. I'd heard of Sparklett's, so I looked them up and learned that DS Waters provides the delivery service.  This is my first time having water delivered, and I am so far very pleased with the service. I got a free hot\/cold water dispenser (although I don't bother with the hot tap because I want the cold water to be as cold as possible!).  The delivery guy was very friendly and answered all of my questions without trying to rush me or make a sales pitch.
