Went dinner with my kids on Friday. \nOwner\/manager walk whole restaurant and introduced himself 3 times.\nExcept our table, we were the only color people in whole restaurant. \nThe food I ordered was so bad I could not even eat more than two bits.\nIt was worse dinning out experience in my life.\nJust simply bad all the ways around.\nToo bad!!!
