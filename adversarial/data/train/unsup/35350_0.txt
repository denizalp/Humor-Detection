I took my car in for a safety recall and was very impressed with the entire experience. They were professional every step of the way. Squeaky clean dealership, super comfortable waiting room and they didn't even try to tell me I needed more things done to my car. As a single female, I appreciate that! They did have me talk briefly with someone who asked if I wanted to check out the new Hondas but I can respect that they're just doing their job to sell more cars. The sales guy even followed up with a phone call today even though I clearly expressed that I won't be in the market for a new car anytime soon. Again, that's just good marketing on their part. He wasn't pushy at all. I will definitely go back when I'm looking for my next Honda.
