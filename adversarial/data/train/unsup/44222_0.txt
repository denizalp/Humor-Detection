We try and get out to Oliver Twist on a frequent basis. We have found the food to be very good and service very attentive.  We were out tonight and sat outside .  They had  entertainment  ( Steve Jochum) tonight who is wonderful to go listen to on a summer evening.  Our server Kristen was excellent.  The other server\/bartender also checked on us, along with the manager.  My husband had the sausage stuffed peppers which were excellent.  I had the brisket burger which was cooked perfect.\nWe have never had a bad experience here, and if anyone has you need to give them another chance..
