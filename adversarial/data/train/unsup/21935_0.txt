This Target is a large one with a grocery and a Starbucks. The location is a little unusual in that it is taking up the first floor of what was a department store (Kaufman's?)  Because it is at the mall, there are two entrances - one from the parking lot and one from inside the mall.  I came here for Christmas shopping because I figured it would be well-stocked and prepared for a large crowd.  And I was right! I got shopping done for 5 boys in one trip and was checked out in less than 10 minutes in spite of hordes of people checking out. They had every register open!
