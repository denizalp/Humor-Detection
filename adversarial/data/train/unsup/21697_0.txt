Let me set the stage...Pool party during the day, a small bite of sushi for dinner, clubbing mayhem until 6AM, a couple hours of sleep. Sound Vegas enough for you?\n\nAfter a crazy day of absorbing the blitzkrieg that is Vegas [turned-up style], I woke with one thing on my mind -- BUFFET! How does one choose? From the Seafood Buffet @ Paris, to the Wicked Spoon @ Cosmo, to Todai Japanese Buffet @ Planet Hollywood, there are a wide variety of indulgent options to consider.\n\nBut only one of the hundreds of Vegas buffets has a BANCHAN BAR!!! That's right, @ Kimchi Korean BBQ, not only can wanderers enjoy a wide variety of fresh meats and seafoods grilled table-side, but they also can have free reign for building their own mountains of Korean Appetizers -- MY KIND OF PLACE!\n\nWhile all of the meat was AMAZING, the cow tongue was the undisputed group favorite. It was thin, crispy, juicy and, did I say delicious?!?!\n\nAdditionally, our friendly host was generous enough to help prepare most of the food on the grill on our behalf.\n\nFor being on The Strip, Kimchi BBQ is a great cultural option and the perfect elixir for the blood-chilling effects of Vegas nightlife.
