Ter-ri-ble!  I'm not sure if he was the owner, but I was referred to a younger male when I asked one of the sales associates, re:  Herv√© Leger dress that I wanted to sell.  He was very abrupt, unpleasant, apathetic, and acted as though I was wasting his time.\n\nReality check:  It would be a mutually beneficial transaction, so why not be nicer to a potential customer??!!\n\nDue to his attitude, I decided to take my business elsewhere.  Don't think I'd return here even to browse!
