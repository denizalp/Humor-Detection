This is the main border crossing to get from montreal to ny state. There are other smaller crossings to get to the Vermont side. Like all border or custom inspections it's never consistent. You can get lucky or not when it comes getting pulled over. A few tips is make sure u respect the stop sign at when pulling towards the inspector, turn off ur music!, roll down ur back window   , only talk to when spoken to and know where you're going.\nThere s a nexus lane on the leftt side. It's not 24h. They are open Seven days a week\n6:00 a.m. to 8 p.m.\nThere is a duty free store on both sides, going into the states and leaving the states. The prices are not the same but some say the Canadien side it cheaper. I personally find the liquor on the US side cheaper.
