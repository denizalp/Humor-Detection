Kilana is awesome! I came in after having a friend bleach my hair at home and needed some to add some dimension to the color. The tone was too warm against my skin. I hated it. Kilana totally saved the day! I love the color and cut. She gave me exactly what I wanted. The salon is super cute and everyone is very friendly. I will definitely return in the future.
