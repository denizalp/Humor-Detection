We will be attending an expo in June that is cosplay so we found a Savers here in Henderson that we did not know existed. Yeah! This Savers is so large that we lost track of time while we were in here. It seems to have everything that one needs to get their cosplay on. We found what we were seeking to finish the costumes l, now I get to sew and put the final touches on each outfit. \n\nThis store is so organized and when we visited it was half off orange tags and realized that half way thru shopping. We found a lot of deal here such as they seem to bag there frames and most of what was for sale was orange so I ended up with 8 new frames for about 3.00 . The frames were really nice too.\n\nThe staff is so friendly here too and so are the customers observing everyone's space and waiting for the proper time to go into the fitting room in a nice orderly fashion. When we checked out the cashier continued the excellent service so cheers to new customers.
