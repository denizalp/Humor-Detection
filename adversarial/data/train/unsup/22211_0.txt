Maybe it's the build up that ends up being eh.\n\nI haven't been to IKEA since we lived in the DC metro area over 11 years ago.  It's really not my thing.  Husband, tho, was seriously excited about IKEA coming to town and for the most part it was about the Swedish meatballs.  Since we waited until July to hit this place, the line was not too bad.  Yes, we waited, but it was only like 10-15 minutes before we got into the actual food area.\n\nI am not sure what I expected.  Husband, if he was a hyper and excitable person, would have been bouncing like a child, but it was only his words that were excited.  The kids liked the tray carrier.  Daughter insisted on \"driving\" it.  She went with the kids pasta, a bag of chips, and soda.  The boy had the chicken strips, which comes with fries, and also got a bag of chips, a piece of corn bread, and soda.  (The boy sometimes eats like a starving college student or not, like a 2 year old.  Teens!)  Hubby got the chicken strips with a side of meatballs, so that he didn't have to be bothered with veggies.  I got the BBQ chicken wrap.  \n\nOur bill total was reasonable (I think like $23-28).  The cups for the soda were small.  Thinking it is a European thing.  Explained to Hubby that in Europe, you get small cups of soda and don't get refills.  Those silly Europeans!  The food was all right.  Eh is the best way I can describe it.  Maybe its that it doesn't live up to the hype.  Maybe it's that I am not interested in meatballs or fried food.  Maybe it's waiting in line for alright food.\n\nI would say that the only way I would eat there again is if we happen to be shopping there and it overlaps with a meal.  It is way too much trouble to leave and come back.  It is not good enough to come there just for the food.
