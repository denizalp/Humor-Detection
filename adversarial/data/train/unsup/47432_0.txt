Three of us ate there for lunch today, was not impressed.  There was only one other table eating when we arrived.  One person at the table ordered hibachi, one got the all you can eat sushi for $16, and I ordered bento box.  The hibachi was pretty good.  The bento box.. meh.  The all you can eat sushi menu stated you could get 8 rolls at a time, yes that's alot.  She ordered 6.  They brought her only 4 after taking her order and said she could only get more once she finished so not to waste.  Why not state 4 instead of saying you can get 8?!  My bento box came late so I took a piece of sushi while waiting.  She rushed over and said YOU CANNOT SHARE!  They all proceeded to stare at us for the rest of the time we ate.  It was very uncomfortable and not appreciated. Its not like I didn't order my own food to try to get away with eating half off...  Will not be back.
