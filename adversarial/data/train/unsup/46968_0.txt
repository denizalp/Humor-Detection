Jose's Crew was Great!! We were doing the kitchen and 2 bathrooms with new sinks and new faucets, including a backsplash. Jose said they will be at my house between 8am and 9am. First guy showed up right at 8am. Next guy not too far behind him. They started the tear out of the old counters and sinks immediately.. They worked all day from 8am to 6pm non stop to get the Job done in 1 day. They knew we had family coming into town that weekend and worked hard to get it done before they came. Not only efficient.. It looks Great!!  Would definitely recommend.
