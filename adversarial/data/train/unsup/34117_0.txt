I love you guys so much. My waistline doesn't thank you, however. My friend and I came in, not knowing anything about what they served (contrary to popular belief, I am an Asian who does not understand the concept of food pictures and therefore never checks Instagram for suggestions), and the girl working the register is an absolute devil. \n\nShe suggested that we should try out the Bangkok Brownie and the Crispy Comb. It was...so good. I myself preferred the Crispy Comb over the Bangkok Brownie. \n\nWhile the Thai milk tea ice cream was so good, it was so rich with the brownie layers and chocolate syrup that we got overwhelmed after a few bites. I mean, it never stopped us from polishing it off... I think next time I'll get the Thai milk tea ice cream on its own.\n\nNow...my favourite of the two-- Crispy Comb. They have cornflakes which break up the smooth sweetness of the vanilla ice cream interlaced with the syrupy honeycomb piece nestled oh-so-gently in the soft swirls of vanilla ice cream. Ohhhhh myyyyy Godddddd.
