Stella was awesome!! I had a groupon for a 90 minute massage and it was well worth it. She was very nice, friendly, professional, and EXCELLENT with her hands. If you need a massage check this place out for a real deal massage. I usually do those cheap $20 hour foot massage places and I'm gonna up my game and start going here because it is such a difference and worth every penny!
