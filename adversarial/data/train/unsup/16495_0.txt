Holy mackerel batman! The family styled servings are well cooked and seasoned, satisfying and I absolutely loved the variety.\n\nHad white people safe Chinese dishes, but I am counting the days to return to try the seafood dishes!\n\nOn a serious note, the fried rice was a delicacy, the General Tso chicken was outstanding and the dish of greens satisfied the others.
