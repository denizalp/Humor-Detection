My boyfriend and I will go here when friends are in town, for some reason they wanna go to The Peppermill, for the kitsch factor I suppose. Every time I eat here, my stomach doesn't settle well. I've never had the same thing twice because I hope \"Maybe blahblahblah won't make me feel gross later\". Nope. The last time we went was a Saturday night, but there wasn't a wait and many tables were empty, so they weren't slammed. It took over half an hour to get our simple orders of a club sandwich, burger and omelette. The iced tea was stale. The burger was cold, sent back to be put under the heat lamps, but they made a new one, so my starving bf wasn't thrilled. Then the waitress brought the new burger with a small smattering of fries. She said she'd bring more because that's all they had. My bf said \"Well, I ordered onion rings anyway...\" She never brought more fries or onion rings. This debacle reminded me of another time I ate there and my burger was frigid, like it was just pulled out of a fridge. Considering the prices for food that isn't that great, it always makes my stomach yucky and this last experience, we won't be going back. Small diners that care about repeat business and quality food will be getting our money.
