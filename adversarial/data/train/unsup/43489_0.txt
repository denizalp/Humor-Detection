If you are looking for a meal that satisfies a home cooked meal this is the place to go. You can stuff your face all while you are just eating healthy fresh vegan ingredients! \n\nI got the pad Thai, mock tuna, and a side salad! The pad Thai was spicy but delicious and full of flavor. The mock tuna has the texture of an actual tuna sandwich. It is great in the wrap. \n\nI wish I had gotten a dessert but plan on going back tomorrow to grab one :)
