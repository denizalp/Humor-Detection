5 Stars, really Dik? \n\nYeah - I was as surprised as you...We visited here about a month ago for a friend's wedding and I had really low expectations. I'd cruised through the \"pre-renovation\" Tropicana several years ago just to get a taste of \"old Vegas\". Unmemorable didn't begin to describe it - more like a sweaty detour between Excalibur and MGM into which one would duck to escape the heat.\n\nBoy, what a difference a $180M facelift can do.\n\nAfter arriving around midnight (3hrs later than expected - thank you traffic), I'd worried that they had given the room away to some ravers in town for the Electric Daisy Carnival also taking place that weekend. Luckily, everyone at the front desk was accommodating and the check-in process was very smooth. In fact, everyone we encountered was very friendly and polite - I'm a sucker for good customer service. \n\nWhat struck me afterwards was the bright white decor - instead of having a sterile effect, it felt like it opened up the Hotel - and I use Hotel deliberately here - giving it a different vibe than other casinos in that it didn't feel \"theme park-y\". Rather, the tone evoked a touch of Sunset Strip luxury. Very cool.\n\nThe rooms themselves were nice as well but the beds...I don't think I've had a better night's sleep in Vegas. They were almost too comfy. \n\nThe one thing I found odd was the temperature of the pool - how is it that one can be sweating on the face and shoulders in the 100 degree heat, yet still be shivering with goosebumps from the 62 degree water below? My body couldn't regulate a medium between the two extremes - even after an hour.\n\nAll-in-all staying at the Tropicana was so fun its almost like they paid me to write this review (its still not too late, guys (hint, hint)) \n\n(just kidding) \n\n(kinda)\n\nBut all kidding aside - if this review moved you, its definitely worth a look, but I'd do it soon before the word gets out!
