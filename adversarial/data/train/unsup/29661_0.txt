This would have been a 5 Star review but I was very disappointed with my food. I ordered the honey walnut glazed shrimp. They put way to much of the glaze on It. It was way too sweet to the point where It was unenjoyable. It came with a huge portion of plain white bland rice. This dish is an epic fail and should be removed from the menu. It's that bad! I ended up asking to substitute the rice for asparagus. The asparagus was cooked to perfection with a tasty garlic butter coating over It. That sauce would have gone great with some saut√©ed shrimp. I hope this is an option on the menu when I come back. \n\n Our server Themistocles was awesome. Thanks to him, he made sure that my husband was able to order what he wanted even after It was too late to order the breakfast item he wanted (biscuits and gravy) which he rated a 7 out of 10.\n\nOverall, the service was great which is why I will give this place another chance the next time I'm in Vegas.
