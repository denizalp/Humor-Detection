I knew right away that this was going to be my daughter's Orthodontist.  Dr. D is an amazing Ortho with the credentials to back it up.  However, his staff really puts them over the top!  These are the friendliest staff members I have ever met in any industry, period!  They even beat the pants off the employees at In 'n' Out, seriously.\n\nDr. D is the best and even followed up with a personal phone call on the weekend to make sure everything was okay with my daughters apparatus.  He is highly qualified, very passionate and caring, and spends quality time with both parent and patient to make sure they both understand every step of every procedure.\n\nI can not recommend Team Orthodontics enough; and when I told my daughter's school where she was being seen, they also agreed 100% that Team Ortho is by far the best around.\n\nOh yeah, they also gave me a couple of very generous discounts that others did not offer.  You simply can not beat the friendly service and quality work here, trust me!
