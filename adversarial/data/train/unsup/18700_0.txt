Such a disappointment. The chips were too thick and greasy and seemed like they'd been previously made quite a long time before being served. The salsas had no spice, which I was happy about at first since it meant that my son could also eat them, but the more I ate them the more I was turned off by the strong Embasa-like, cold canned salsa base they seemed to have. Then, the vegetable enchiladas, chicken enchilada, and shrimp quesadilla were all way to greasy not to mention that the vegetable enchiladas were mostly onions drenched in oil. To top it off, two plates and two soft drinks were $50! A total rip off which is way to often the case at hotel\/casino eateries on the strip. So sad. No wonder the Luxor is run-down and practically empty.
