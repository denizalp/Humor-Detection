I usually like Earl of Sandwich but this one was different. We had a coupon so a coworker and I wandered over to take advantage of the BOGO option before it expired. The shop is smaller than others I have visited and they were slower than others as well. There weren't many people waiting for food yet it took a bit for our sandwiches to be ready. Probably because they offer online ordering and delivery so I can't fault them for that. \n\nI ordered the original, which is what I typically order, but it was not good. The sandwich was soggy and the meat was a chewy and gristly. It was very unappetizing. \n\nI don't see myself making any special effort to return.
