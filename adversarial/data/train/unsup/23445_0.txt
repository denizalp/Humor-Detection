I was expecting a few shelves with paperbacks and hardcovers. Instead, I found a massive store with a shedload of great books! This place is ginormous! No, you have no idea. Maybe it's not Wal-Mart sized, but it's sure close or at least it feels like it.\n\nLots and lots and LOTS of books, all organized by section. While the specific title I was hoping to find wasn't here, I still managed to pick up 6 paperbacks that will keep me well entertained for a while.\n\nNote: the shop has a 'house cat' and many signs are posted that you aren't supposed to trouble her. I'm a cat person myself and so I did pretty well. Once she had enough of me, I knew to back off. Her name is \"Page\". Of course.
