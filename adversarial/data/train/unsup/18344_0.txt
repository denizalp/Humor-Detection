The service is COMPLETELY unprofessional I booked an appointment for 2:45 in which the receptionist told me 3:00 p.m. I arrived at 2:55 p.m. Reason being I was given the wrong directions when I called.  A women answered the phone and stated they were across from Big Lots I specifically said in the smiths shopping center she said yes!!! I called back a second time the receptionist answered he said on the NE corner.  This would have been my first service done at the Body Waxing Studio the reason I was given for my service not being done was \"SORRY HE IS NEW\" the receptionist who is a male exact words were we will have to reschedule you because we will only have thirty minutes and don't want to do a HALF ASS JOB!!!!!!! I will not be back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
