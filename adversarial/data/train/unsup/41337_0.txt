My dad and I went to try Union since it is next to his office and he liked his prior experience. I would give a note of 3.5\/5.\n\nAtmosphere : 3.5\/5 \n\nVintage Industrial Decor, exposed light bulbs, woodplanks and metal galore. Are we re-inventing the wheel here? No but it's still a nice disposition. Background music present but you are still able to hold a conversation. Dinning room and restroom are clean. \n\nService : 5\/5 \n\nOur waitress had a shadow apprentice with her and they were both very pleasant, attentive, they came often to make sure we were happy and most importantly; they graciously laughed at my dad's jokes. \n\nFood : 3\/5\n\nWe both ordered the Steak Frites. This plate has potential. On the plus side, the fries and the mayonnaise were very good. I also enjoyed the garlic butter and peppercorns on the steak. The aforementioned steak was cooked as specified and was tender for a sirloin. However, the steak sizes were inconsistent. While my dad had a standard portion, my steak was rather small. There could have been more fries and the presentation slightly more professional. My steak was literally thrown on the fries with a big blank space still on the plate. \n\nOn the recommendation of our waitress,my dad ordered the chef's feature dessert ; the blueberry and basil crême brulée. Oh yes please! I went with her other suggestion ; the Mars Bar brownie. \n\nAlas, my dad's enjoyment of his dessert stopped at the first spoonful. The crust seemed legit, but as soon he broke it, it was more like a soup than a crême brulée. Very liquid, not rich or unctuous at all. Thankfully, the waitress arrived just at the right moment and she agreed, the dessert had to be changed. He instead went for the cheesecake and I have to say it was fairly good. \n\nAs for my brownie, I was pleased by it. Generous portion and a good mix of flavor. \n\nThe waitress was gracious enough to comp both the crême\/soup and the cheesecake of our tab. \n\nUnion has great potential. They only have to work on food consistency and learn how to make a decent crême brulée. Especially since it's the chef's featured dessert.
