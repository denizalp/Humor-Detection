This place is rad. \n\nThe themed games are my favorite. There is a crazy amount of attention to detail, enough for any fan girl (or boy) to geek out to. The Flintstones game uses clunky, oversized balls. Guns 'N Roses has a gun trigger to shoot the pinballs, as does the Terminator 2 game. \n\nVintage pinball machines from 50's-70's are $.25 and they average 3 balls per game. My favorites are the Elton John-themed games. The dinging sounds were piano notes. Swoon. Games from 80's-90's are in the $.50 range. These include Terminator, X-Files. The more popular games are $.75 and they are freaking awesome! These include Lord of the Rings, Metallica, Simpsons. Not just blinking lights and fun dings. I'm talking some serious interactive moving parts and addictive bonuses. Some of the games have deals (eg $.75\/game or $2 for 3 games) \n\nIf you are a fan of video slot machines, you will love these games. \nAfter burning through $50 at the penny slots, I quickly realized that I'd much rather be spending my money playing pinball. The analog, 3D version is much more rewarding. \nPerhaps the only thing missing are signs for a helpline.
