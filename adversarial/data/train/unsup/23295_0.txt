This school is a fraud. Don't allow them to lure you in with their promises of a good education. You will leave with a degree that has no value and thousands in student loan debt. I graduated with my Associates degree and it has proved to be quite useless. In fact, most HR departments that I speak to say if they see U of P on a resume they immediately throw it away. This school should be avoided at all costs.
