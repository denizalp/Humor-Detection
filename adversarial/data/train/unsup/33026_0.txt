I booked an appointment with Yakira for a Brazilian, arm pits, eyebrows, and lower arms and it was truly a great experience. I was scared to death because I wasn't sure of my pain tolerance and I'm a little conservative, but she made me feel very comfortable and explained everything thoroughly. I am going back in 4 weeks to see her for another Brazilian because I loved the results!! Ask for her, you won't regret it!
