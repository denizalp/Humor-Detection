I have a notion that over time the reviews for this place will get significantly more positive.  It just needs some time time to infuse into its new surrounding ... because this is all I'm really gathering why people have the most beef with the Willow House.  The building is interesting and quaint, which is suitable for an indie coffee house and a pretty killer lawn out in front.  \n\nThe coffee itself is above average.  I'm not particularly blown away or anything ... but then, no coffee REALLY blows me away anyhow.  I'll drink motor oil if the place has a cool vibe and is local and is some sort of vehicle for the local arts.  Willow caters to all three of these requirements. \n\nPlus, they DO have a delicious drink -- their Chai Charger -- basically a Chai latte with a shot of espresso ... hot or cold seems perfect for sitting on their patio and smoking Parliaments.\n\nI wish they would bring back their afternoon happy hour.  Those large Chais were $3.
