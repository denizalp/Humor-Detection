This place is super cute and the staff was overall friendly however I ordered the $12 steak and eggs and I am not kidding they brought out a gigantic black burned hamburger patty.....\nI didn't even understand what was going on I was so confused and the hashbrowns were absolutely bland it was one of the worst breakfasts I have ever eaten however my buddy I was with had eggs Benedict and it was OK except for the hash-browns. \nSteak=Burnt Hamburger Patty. ‚Äç
