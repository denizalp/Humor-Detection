If you are in Vegas, you need to visit this place just because it's quirky. One foot in the door you flashback to the 70's. Neon lighting, faux vines hanging from the ceiling and Tiffany lamps at each booth. Who came up with this concept? Entertaining. The food portions are huge and you could easily split the order. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Visit the bar once you're done with your meal. It's worth a visit. Sit by fireplace. You'll be glad you did. I had a Bloody Mary. It was damn good! The great thing about the Peppermill...it's open 24 hours.
