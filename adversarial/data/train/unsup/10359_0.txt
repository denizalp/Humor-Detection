Oh after so many years and so many times I have wandered in, to walk off my meals from the neighboring establishments and ended up buying stuff I didn't need, today was the last time.\n\nBeing followed and asked if we needed anything in  a manner like we were some criminals like out of a bad movie stereotype. Wait... I'm Korean though and my friends are Asian too. Regardless, it pains me to see the dreaded Korean store stereotype  come to life but also for it to happen to me.\n\nAsiana market, yes you are small and have a lot of Korean items I can't find at other places, your prices are higher but it was the convenience I paid for. Not anymore, as of today I will no longer step in your direction, nor look through your windows. Neither this location or the other. I am sad to say you have lost a loyal customer who had always tried to support my local business and community. \n\nThe owner if he were to ever read this or not, sir I am not sorry for this harsh review but today, your actions drove out 3 customers who ended up buying nothing and will never return again. \n\nWill the loss of 3 men hurt your business? Probably not, but all the other Asian grocery stores just gained 3 customers. I will drive farther and longer just for that great service with out the harassment.
