::: Review #100 :::\n\n\nLocated on the 2nd floor in the Venetian next to the shops, this bakery stall is a must stop.\n\nThe more I heard about the macaroons here and how delish they were, the more the anticipation built. Finally, we stopped by before heading to the pool. There was a beautiful selection of macaroons of different colors &amp; flavors. There was also other baked pastries, cupcakes (red velvet), and sandwiches. The OJ looked pretty good too.\n\nI ended up getting an espresso macaroon and a piece of the foccacia du jour which had goat cheese, tomatoes, and basil. \n\nThe foccacia was really good (and they offer to heat it up). It was soft, yet crunchy, and quite tasty. It was like a mini foccacia pizza bread. The macaroon was good as well. The pastry part was slightly sticky crunchy, like biting through a layer of crystallized sugar or something. The filling was like a sweet espresso flavor.
