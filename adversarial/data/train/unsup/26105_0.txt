Yelp really let me down on this one or maybe I am just used to a sushi places that offers favorable food. The service at first I thought was polite and fast but as the time went by our waitress didn't even send to care if we needed drinks or anything else. The trash can in the bathroom was overfilled and was in need of some attention. Now the food, I love spicy tuna and I love it because I like a level of heat in my food. The place we normally go to has excellent spicy tuna but this place was just blah. The texture was more of a mousse and it had no flavor. The wasabi was also one of cheap brand that looked like a paste and again just not something I am used too. I expect to use a little and it goes a long way. This wasabi had no heat. My boyfriend had the teriyaki chicken which he said was dry and hard to chew. The sauce was good in flavor but the chicken itself was not good. Not impress and felt really let down by Yelp . Guess I will just continue to go to my regular sushi place
