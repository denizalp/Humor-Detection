Being familiar with Big O, I decided to take my car in for new brake pads. When I brought my car in, Jay was very friendly. He brought my car right into the garage and took a look at it. When he was done, he brought me into the garage and showed me what was going on with my car. He gave me several recommendations regarding my leaky shocks and my rotors. I thanked him for pointing that out. \n\nWhen he started pricing out the parts and labor, he hooked me up very nicely with good deals on the parts. Not only did he give me those deals right off the bat, he had no problem taking the time to help me verify prices online and over the phone.\n\nOverall, this Big O Tires, its employees and their work were all phenomenal. I plan on going back, and I will absolutely recommend them to anyone needing maintenance done on their cars.
