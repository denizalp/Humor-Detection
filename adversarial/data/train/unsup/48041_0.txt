A good place for breakfast food with eggs pretty much any way you like them and coffee cake as an alternative to toast.  I had the El Vaquero omelette with chorizo this morning and it was excellent.  However, I sat at the bar and tired of watching all of the front of the house staff eat and or drink beverages in between serving customers.  Also, you pay your bill on the way out and are expected to stand in line in the doorway with the customers waiting for tables.  If they address both of these glaring service issues it will enhance the overall dining experience.
