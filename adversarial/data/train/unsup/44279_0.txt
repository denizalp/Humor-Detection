A guest and I had reservations at 6 PM on Wednesday, August 9. My guest arrived on time and was seated by 6 PM. I arrived around 6:05 PM. I didn't watch the clock, but it took a long time for the server to come to our table and take our cocktail order. It took an even longer time to get our two cocktails. One was a gin and tonic and the second was one of their craft cocktails. It was 6:46 PM when we finally got our cocktails. While we were waiting for the cocktails the server asked if we wanted to order. We declined to order before the cocktails came as I was concerned we'd be done with dinner before our cocktails arrived. We ordered the cheese board and two salads. The cheese board was nice, but nothing special. Both the salads were very good, although the wedge salad, which my guest had, was way over dressed. I had the citrus salad, which was very tasty, presented nicely and dressed perfectly. After our salads plates were cleared the server disappeared. We waited a long time and finally tried to get someone else's attention to get the check, which we were unable to do. So, at about 8:35 pm we got up to look for her. The staff couldn't find her, either. The manager or owner comped us for the meal, which was nice, and offered a gift certificate to come back, which I declined as I don't have any plans to go back soon. Saying the service was bad seems like an understatement. It was slower than slow. At the peak while we were there the restaurant and bar were about one-third full at most.
