We've been here a few times and the food is pretty good. Really nice people that work there.  I'm told by my Alex that this restaurant use to be a Pizza Hut, i could see that :)\nI had the Carne asada #8, lots of food, i can never eat it all, nor should i try, i got a tummy ache this last time. My  Alex got a Torta Adobada, requested no pico, because of the onions and tomatoes, the Torta came with a pile of them on top, but no pico. I guess, our only complaint would be listing all the ingredients on the menu. That kind of ruined the dish but he refused to tell them about the onions nor send it back. That is just the way my Alex is, no confrontation. He did however liked the flavor of the meat. \nWe will be back of course, there is so much to try on their menu, we like the place, so we want to give it another shot.  Besides, its right next door to the Theater Works and we like to see shows there.
