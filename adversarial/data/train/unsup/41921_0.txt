If I can give a zero ! I would ! Has been fooled three times ! A friend recommended this company.\n1, summer time , employee complains ac not cool enough, they changed the motor, no results , I paid by I happy And there was no big issues . \n2, I choose to trust again . Winter a gas smell, no leak was found by gas company and ac guy, John was extremely rude , he expanded wS because his last trip was unpleasant,they changed a new part ! No results!\n3,right after he part was changed , Heat is out ! They decided need a new vault! It didn't work !\n\nBtw, the tech really spend a lot of time on the parking lot, I'm saying 1-2hours.\n\nConclusion! What they do is they will creat a problem for you to change parts !! Never able to give a real check or solution! All they want is to to write you a bill ! Lol . To make your life better, stay away from them !
