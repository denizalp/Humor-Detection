This restaurant's customer service is extremely good. Very friendly and very attentive staff - from seating hostess to chef! Chef Rudy has trained his staff well. \n\nFirst the bread (we learned in Italy, years ago, it's a good indicator of whether an Italian restaurant is going to be good) was good - nice and hot. I was a little disappointed in the olive oil with which it was served - not very flavorful. \n\nFor an appetizer we ordered the grilled marinated baby lamb chops with mint served with figs & a wasabi sauce. They were recommended by the chef\/owner as he came by to welcome us to his restaurant. They were amazing!\n\nMain courses: I ordered the Lynn Pear & Cheese which was pear-stuffed cheese tortellini with Rock Shrimp, spinach, mozzarella baked in a tomato vodka sauce. The sauce was just a touch salty, but otherwise very good. Dish was a good balance between the savory and sweet.\n\nMy husband ordered the veal scaloppine and loved it - said the veal was delicious, pasta was al dente and sauce was very good.\n\nNo room for dessert, even though they all looked yummy.
