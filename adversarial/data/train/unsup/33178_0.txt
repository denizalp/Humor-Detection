Definitely one of Kensington's hidden gems, Maison Close is a quasi-pub in an old Victorian home with a Quebecois inspired menu. They regularly advertise a pancake brunch that I haven't taken part in but look forward to when the weather warms. My experience so far has been a pint and a quick bite after work a few times over the past month. The beer list is short but well curated. Same for cocktails. Food changes daily and is brought in from the neighbourhood. French Onion soup is solid, as was the charcuterie plate. I had a bagel\/lox sandwich and it was awesome. Overall a great chill place to spend an afternoon or evening. Bartenders are casual and friendly. Also looks like they have two stellar patios come Summer time.
