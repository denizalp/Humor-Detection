I had an eye examination with Dr. Raja.  On a personal level, Dr. Raja is awesome - professional, knew her stuff, answered questions, and very personable. Loved her!!\n\nMy previous eye exam about 5 years ago was approx. $89 however this time, my bill was $129 and included a retinal scan. Not sure if the price went up or whether i had to specify that I did not want the retinal scan, but no option was provided and I was presented with the bill at the end. Maybe I should have asked up front about the cost before going ahead but I assumed it would be standard since my company vision plan covered up to $84.  If there is anything extra, i had expected them to let me know before proceeding.  \n\nAfter I got there, I waited a good 15 minutes before I was seen as another patient who was there at the same time as me had to go before me.  They had to give me drops and i was asked to wait at the reception for another 20 minutes for the drops to take effect.  Nobody warned me about this too when i booked the appointment. It seems that you have to ask all the questions otherwise, they process you through as per their usual.  Also, they should tell you that they give you drops that screw up your vision for the next 3 hours. This was also not mentioned when i booked the appointment.\n\nWhen the prescription was given, i asked about contact lenses.  Dr. Raja stated that there was a fee of $50 for an assessment and fitting. Not sure if that is the norm these days but i used to be able to get fittings for free at optical stores.\n\nOverall, the location was good, the staff was friendly, and Dr. Raja is really amazing, however in terms of the wait times, the lack of transparancy in pricing, and lack of communication about what is to be expected makes this business a 3 star for me.
