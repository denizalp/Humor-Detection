This is the first gym I have joined officially (except university fitness centres, public community centres, and pan am facility), so I cannot compare it to the other gyms around town. This gym offers a wide range of machines, dumbbells ranging from 5-75lb (small section), 4 smith machines, cables, and plenty of cardio machines. Even at peak hours the gym had plenty of options always free. Locker space is very limited at peak hours though. Thankfully, they've been using the lunk alarm less often lately, which really causes you to loss focus during sets. When it goes off it feels like you have a bad case of PTSD. \n\nFor the price, it's an easy decision to join when you're just looking to get into shape, without the full ecosystem of services the other much more expensive places offer. The biggest benefit personally, is the 24 hour access.
