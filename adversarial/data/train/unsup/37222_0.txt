Blue Agave is the quincentential Mexican restaurant to go to for friendly, efficient service paired with a wonderful selection of Mexican food favorites. One of my favorites is their Spinach Enchilada Dinner. They are great with substutiones and I always ask for their Jalapeno Cream sauce with the Enchiladas. It is very authentic Mexican flavor and a unique special flare of atmosphere to accompany a magnificent dining experience.
