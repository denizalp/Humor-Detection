Red Carpet Vip is a really awesome service. Jeff and Kelvie are really easy to work with. we used them for my friends bacholer party for friday and sat. both days went very smooth with only one little problem at Olympic Garden, but Jeff took care of it and made up for it and sent our group to another gentlemens club with no charge. Jeff is very knowledgeable of the Vegas nightlife, if you looking for honest opinions on clubs or whatever Jeff is the man. i would definitely go through them again.
