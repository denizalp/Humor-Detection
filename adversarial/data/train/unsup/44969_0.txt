This place... I would simply say.. is AMAZING.\n\nI don't enjoy the bar scene too much due to loud annoying music or extraneous noise that would otherwise prevent you from holding a conversation with people.. but this place was just so warm and cozy.. along with absolutely wonderful live music.\n\nThe hidden gem of Las Vegas that is DTM is apart of Vegas that most people don't see. Where most people stay around the vicinity of \"The Strip\"... Going to Downtown Las Vegas.. truly gives you a true sense of old school Vegas.\n\nThis place belongs in downtown, and showcases some wonderful talent. The bartenders sing, and the piano player can be pretty hilarious. It's a MUST VISIT place when you're in the area.
