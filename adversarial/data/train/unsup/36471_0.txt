Came here with a friend and tried the donuts and I got the cookie monster ice cream cone. It's quite well done with a kings of cookies embedded in it. I do  wish it was available on a cup because I had to finish it quick or risk ice cream dripping all  over my hand . While the ice cream had a nice taste what I liked was how attractive it was. I won't mind coming  back to try soft serves since I liked some of the flavours on the menu.
