I just ate at Ranch House Grille 10 minutes ago. I found them very sweet and friendly, all of them helpful. They gave a second glass of tea, which is important to me. I need a lot of water with food. The food was very good. I had biscuits and gravy. price was good if not better. Very generous portions. I noticed the eggs seemed very fresh and looked healthy like the kind I buy. I buy organic,  cage free eggs. I think we all need to start supporting non cruel practices. jmho. lol. I like this place and will be back.
