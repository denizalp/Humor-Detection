Yatai is the the first robata grill, Japanese restaurant that I know on the east side. Food is very, very reasonably priced and for someone like myself who enjoys a few ice cold beers with a variety of skewers, this is the perfect spot. Restaurant is clean, spacious, and designed\/decorated perfectly. Service is efficient, friendly, and you can tell they are putting their heart and hard work into this place.
