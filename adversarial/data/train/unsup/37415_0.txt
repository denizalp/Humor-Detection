First time here, my DH had a breakfast burrito and he really enjoyed it. I had the pile up breakfast which is three potato pancakes, sausage,ham, bacon and cheese sauce and two eggs - it was very delicious .if I ever go back I would definitely order that again .on our way out we bought 4 bagels and cream cheese to take home actually two Bagels & 2 bialy .ironically I was not that impressed with the bagels I felt what we had for breakfast was way better then what the restaurant is known for .but it wasn't the worst thing I've ever had they just seem to get very hard within a few hours the service while we ate breakfast was outstanding I believe the lady's name was Nicole she was fabulous and a really great waitress!
