Beautiful restaurant staffed by a extremely friendly bunch of folks - I hate to say it but this place may be too authentic for most. Having grown up in Louisiana I wasn't expecting the kind of quality this restaurant brings, I could of been anywhere in Louisiana if I didn't know better. A great business starts with its people and they've assembled quite a crew here, it's definitely about customer service once you walk through the doors but like any good Cajun Restaurant the food has to be good and that starts with good quality ingredients and a kitchen staff that understands the culture and what the end results should taste like - there ain't no substitute for this kind of cooking you either know it or you blow it.\n\nYup I admit I could be a little bias, but I grew up on this kind of cooking and I call it like I see it when judging this kind of food because it's close to my heart. It's rare to find a restaurant that can bring it all together when it comes to Cajun cooking, if you hold back I'm not returning if you go all out folks that don't fully understand this kind of food are disappointed- it truly is a risky venture. This group gets it believe me they have found the right balance.\n\nMumbo Jumbo Gumbo - this ain't no appetizer, it's a meal so order the bowl, tonight's Gumbo was created by Ms Tracie from Orange, Texas yes Cajun food overflowed into Texas years ago and they for the most part understand the complexity of this simple dish - it's about the flavor and texture - no short cuts taken on this one it's the real deal.\n\nRoad Kill Grill - go back and look at my photo - who wouldn't fall in love with this dish, the gator was so tender and perfectly seasoned and it was portioned exactly the right way so it could be fried crispy without getting tough, no gator nuggets here - the shrimp seasoning was spot on and the quality of the shrimp makes this some of the best grilled shrimp I've had anywhere and I live in Florida - grilled lobster tail there's no better way to eat lobster when it's done right and let me tell you it's done right here, it was absolutely perfect, perfect I say...\n\nBlackeyed Peas - I just had to try them even though I had already eaten more food than I should have - I really don't know if momma cooked them this good - they melt in your mouth and seasoned perfectly there's no doubt someone in the back was raised on this kind of cooking.\n\nThe service here was exceptional tonight I found the perfect corner stool at the bar to interact with the staff and the owner while sipping on a beautifully crafted dirty martini with stuffed olives. I understand it maybe a little over-whelming for some but for me this place is hands down the best Cajun food in the area.
