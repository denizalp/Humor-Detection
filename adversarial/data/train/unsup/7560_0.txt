Disgusting. Nothing had any flavor, the carne asada meat might as well have been boiled, it was chewy and gross, the tortillas are huge and tough, and NOTHING had any flavor. Tossed 75% of it on the trash 30 seconds ago and my stomach is already upset from the few bites I did eat. If this is the best Mexican food in Henderson, don't go to Henderson for Mexican food. This was atrocious. Never going back.
