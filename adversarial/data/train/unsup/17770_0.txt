Sens redux. Only bigger, cooler lighting, and more bathrooms.\n\nThe only draw back to the move was that it is no longer within walking distance. I have to drive or take the light rail. First world problems. The food is still spot on. The changing choices of beers is great too. Reverse happy hours have taken some money from me. Take a date here. Putty in your hands. It can be a little loud from the DJ, but do you really need to hear what she is saying anyway? I kid.\n\nI will be moving down the street from this place soon, so I see more visits in the future and maybe some long walks home.
