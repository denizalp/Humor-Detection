My experience with CPR Cell Phone Repair (Dufferin Street location, Toronto) began with a free estimate through their website. I received a quick response from Joe, who quoted me a fair price. When I arrived at the store Peter greeted me and discussed my specific care needs. His friendliness and very professional manner put me at ease with trusting my phone to their service. Vir, one of the on-site tech specialists who handled my case, is nothing short of a certified genius. He was able to troubleshoot the challenging firmware issue and correct it to working order with a remarkably fast turnaround. I will recommend CPR Cell Phone Repair to friends and family who require cellphone and other tech-related maintenance. A lot of businesses claim to be professional repair services, but CPR proved themselves to be the definitive Gold Standard.
