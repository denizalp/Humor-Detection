Flavors for oxtail and curry goat combo were cool. Did not like they did not have Roti skins nor did the little guy know what Dhalpuri was!!! And then the tiny little 2 strips of plantain and how about meat with your bones? Smdh... I will go to other places for Roti and head to Atlanta for other things. This will be my last resort.
