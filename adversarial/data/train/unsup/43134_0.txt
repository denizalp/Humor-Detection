I really like Coffee Rush. They have a really clean interior and lots of syrups (Torani brand) to choose from when getting drinks! \n\nThe menu is quite lengthy, so check it over if it's your first time there. Take your time -- there's lots to choose from. The baristas are seriously kind and helpful too, which is really nice if you're having trouble deciding on what to order. \n\nCoffee Rush is usually well-staffed with awesome people, and they're talented at remembering the regulars and their drinks. I've only been a few times and they remember my almond milk coconut chai. They do have coconut milk too I believe for nut-free folks. They have a good selection of teas too. \n\nThis is 4 stars instead of 5, because the wifi expires after 3 hours. They give you a code on a second receipt to log into the wifi network. Sometimes I just don't want to get up in the middle of work to get a new code. And sometimes I'm in the middle of a Skype call and it'll kick off without warning because I've lost track of time. If you're only grabbing coffee or just going for a little bit, (or don't mind a new code every 3 hours), I say go there now! They're open late which is awesome for night owls too!
