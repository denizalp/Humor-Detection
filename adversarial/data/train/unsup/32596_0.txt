Spectacular food served by mostly spectacular staff, in an engaging atmosphere. Sometimes Juan himself is out and about, greeting his patrons. Mom and I have only been victims of poor, inattentive service one time, but outside of that off day, this is our go-to spot for Mexican cuisine. We've been going here for years anyways-one bad day isn't really that bad.
