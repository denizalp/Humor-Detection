This place is great. They have all the authentic Mexican food dishes and Hispanic cooks however, the food taste American. There is very little flavor to the food, but it's still good don't get me wrong. I'm just saying if I wanted Mexican \"American\" food I would go to Chipotle! The street corn is awesome and I love their many selections of salsa.
