On the douche scale of Affliction to Ed Hardy...this place falls at Skater Jersey status.  I didn't have any food so I can't comment on that, but man the atmosphere sucks.  I wouldn't have gone here on my own, but my friend told me he had a Corona Light waiting for me.  Liar!  I had to order it when I got there.  The drinks were fine...you can't really screw up a bottled beer.  But the waitresses looked like they hated life and the doorman was completely unnecessary.  Back the fuck off bro.  You don't own anything.
