The owner is absolutely ruthless. She treats her employees like dirt.\n\nI was immediately accused of stealing within days of working there. I would never do something as stupid as steal from my work. \n\nThe kids that are hired to work there are obstinate and unmanageable. \n\nI was told that I was going to work every single day without a day off, because of \"all the problems\". This was three days after being hired. When I got my shift covered so I could have at least one day off, I was fired that day. \n\nThen when I applied for unemployment, the owner told them that I quit! \n\nThe owner is literally one of the worst people I've known in my life. She looks and acts like a sociopath.
