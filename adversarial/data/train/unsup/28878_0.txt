Best croissants! Great staff!\n\nMy sister and I found this place on one of our strolls on a cold winter day around four years ago. We could smell the croissants from afar, and ever since we took our first steps in the store, we haven't been disappointed. The staff are always wonderful and always serve you with a smile (even if you speak little French). I think the pastries taste so amazon because they all love what they do, and this love seeps into the end product. There is no other place in town that is even comparable in taste and freshness to them.\n\nI fell in love with their Kouign-Amann, but I also recommend their Tarts and croissants. They better have a branch up in heaven; cause otherwise, something will be missing for sure.
