There are only 2 reasons to use the greyhound:\n\n1. You are trying to save cash.\n2. You are going somewhere a plane can't take you.\n\nIf you can afford the extra money to fly, do it.  Greyhound is never a fun experience.  The washrooms are rarely fully stocked, often messy.  The buses are often filled with smelly kids and old drunks.  The times are often delayed.\n\nLook into Via Rail or Porter if you can and you will thank me.
