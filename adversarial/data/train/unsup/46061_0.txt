After a fun night out I was in desperate need of some drive threw yumminess. To start we pulled up to the window and waited and waited and waited. Finally we picked what we wanted and pulled up to the window. The guy inside opened it and we told them there intercom wasn't working they apologized and took our order. They had us pull threw and wait at the front of the place. Once home I opened my yummy burger and took a nice big bite. It was a bacon BBQ burger and it was good but nothing to write home about. My fried were fresh and quite good however Bry said his tasted like they had been sitting for a while. We also ordered milkshakes. I mine was a strawberry shake with a layer of chocolate on top. Well that's what the picture showed it as. What it turned out to be was a strawberry milkshake with a measly amount of chocolate. It was the littlest tiniest bit. So disappointing.  I think it there was a thick layer of chocolate on this thing you wouldn't be able to keep me away. Alas it was not so. This place has potential they just didn't seam at the top of there game this night. Will try again and hope they deliver.
