I love this place.  It reminds me of my trips to Nogales as a kid with family.  The plates are always hot, the food flavorful and the staff consistently friendly and attentive.  Great chips and salsa and they keep them coming.  The only recommendation I have is to double check your bill.  My uncle mentioned that he regularly gets overcharged here so we started paying attention to our receipt.  Sure enough, the last three times we have been here we were charged more that we should have.
