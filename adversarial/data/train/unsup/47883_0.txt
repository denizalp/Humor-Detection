Hunter is the man. He might quite possibly be the happiest and most joyous person on this planet. Well, at least in Las Vegas. I thought I was talking to a scripted, overly happy and excited, prerecording when I pulled up to the drive through. Low and behold, it's this guy who just loves people. He even asked about my car and created small talk during the 20 seconds it took to get my order handed to me. Promote this guy and give him a raise quickly or he will get recruited and job offered before you know it!  If it's due to a high level of training and expectations set, then keep doing what you do! (But still promote this guy) Great job Hunter! Keep putting smiles on people's faces. Sometimes you may be the only reason that someone has a better day. This experience impacted mine enough to make me spend time on here to say thank you.
