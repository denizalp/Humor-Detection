This is my fav restaurant in Toronto\nI hear they are not the greatest with seating times\/reservations- but we've not had a problem getting a table. Once we had to wait 30 mins w\/out reso. It's a very small restaurant, very inviting and cozy.\nThe food is so delicious it's almost hard to believe. Portion sizes are on the smaller side, which I like bc it leaves room for an app or dessert. \nMe and my bf usually order a drink each, and either an app to share and main each OR 3 apps to share and maybe a dessert to share and our bill always ends up being $80 with tax(before tip). So it's a little on the more expensive side, but the value is crazy. I literally cannot believe every single bite I take, the flavours are so delicious and balanced.
