This place has been on my bucket list for a while. It sits in a former bank building. It looks small from the outside but it's rather spacious on the inside with a small bar\/sushi bar to the left as you walk in and one pub table in the bar area. That is where my group sat.\n\nI started out with with a Plum martini which was actually not as sweet as I was expecting so that's a plus. For appetizer, someone recommended the Yellowtail jalapeno which was yellowtail topped with a jalapeno ring. It was beautifully presented but it lacked the spice that I was expecting.\n\nFor an entree, I went with the Mei Fun which is rice noodles with chicken, veggies, and shrimp and curry spices. It was a large portion and was good.\n\nService was spotty here but the staff was quite friendly. \n\nI like the atmosphere and everything is beautifully presented. I'd give this a 3 1\/2 rating. I would definitely come back though.
