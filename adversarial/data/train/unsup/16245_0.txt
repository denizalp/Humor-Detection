This church is all about the \"show.\" Band is \"look at me\" and not at Christ. Hipster doesn't begin to cover it. The music is repetitive, often includes unbiblical lyrics and is disconnected from the message\/service.\n\nSermons can be good but many speakers are more interested in telling stories\/trying to be funny\/cool than teaching the Bible.
