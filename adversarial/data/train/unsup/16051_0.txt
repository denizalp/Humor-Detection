**full disclosure**\ni only came here for drinks, not the food. \n\na group of us walked into carly's after our holiday lunch in order to grab some drinks and get our evening started. we were greeted with a look of disgust (we werent even rowdy!) and poor service. the place was empty save 2 other people but it took about 25 min to get our 4 beers and 2 cocktails. i was kind of disappointed because i really wanted to like the place. there was great music and it really had the potential to be a great hangout spot in the future.\n\nwe left after we finished our 1 drink. sorry, Carly's. you really missed the mark.
