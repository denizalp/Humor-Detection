I attended the Violin Sound Healing with Guided Meditation in the Hammock class here last month and it was a very relaxing hour.  I've never taken a hammock class before, but my friend recommended\nthis studio as she's taken a couple of classes here and was very impressed.  I registered on-line ahead of time because there are a limited amount of hammocks (12 maybe?). The class was led by professional violinist Rebecca Sabine whose musical résumé includes playing for Celine Dion for the past six years and being a member of the Las Vegas Philharmonic. With a background like that, I knew the music would be great, but so was the guided meditation. You don't need to have any aerial experience to take this class because all you do is lie in the hammock and move (or not move) in any you want.  Galaxy Pilates owner Agnieszka comes around and pushes your hammock so that you're swinging to and fro, but it's up to you to keep the hammock moving if you want.  During the class, Rebecca leads you in visualization exercises to keep you centered while she plays her violin so beautifully.  The whole experience is very relaxing and a wonderful chance to just concentrate on yourself. I look forward to trying other classes here, especially another one with Rebecca.
