Chill place. Excellent beet salad (although i was unaware they would be glazed) but definitely great spot for healthy cuisine. You can tell they use fresh ingredients by the flavor. The portions aren't big but the prices aren't that bad compared to other vegan\/organic restaurants nearby. Not cheap though either. Good for a healthy date night.
