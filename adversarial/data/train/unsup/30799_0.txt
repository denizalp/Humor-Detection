Walked up to the bar to buy a drink and was served very quickly. Drink prices were pretty outrageous. I paid $14 for one drink and it was in a tiny glass that you would typically get served on the floor by cocktail waitresses. I didn't stay at the bar very long but it seemed like the type of lounge I would typically hang out at.
