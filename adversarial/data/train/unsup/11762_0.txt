GREAT place to stay for the price!!!!\n\nalthough its not on the strip, it is a nice getaway when you come back from the strip. there are no casinos just a nice bar location on the first floor. the staff is very accommodating. there is a restaurant and spa. pool on the top floor. overall a great place to stay.\n\nSO spacious when you have large groups of people staying together (shhh... we have a few extra people staying with us) there is a pull out couch, full kitchen, really nice bathroom with tub, shower, two sinks, etc., two queen beds, working tv, etc. LOVE. forget the over priced rooms at the nicer hotels... if i go back I'm down to stay here because in all honesty if you're going to vegas just to do day club and night club and be out... you're only coming back to your hotel to sleep so why not save money and stay here and cook your own food and spend that extra money on drinks!\n\nONLY DOWNFALL would be i got desperate and ordered food from the restaurant in the hotel. i was told downstairs we should order from our rooms rather than downstairs on the first floor. so i listened and i ordered a $11 burger and fries... i then receive it missing items i wanted on my burger and so i paid for it and was told the guy who brought it up will bring me my missing onions and tomatoes. i find my total was $22 which bummed me out because i got added on like three different fees -_- never ordering from the hotel again... ALSO when he came and brought the stuff he left out he gave me THREE rings of onion... wtf give me a slice of onion i ordered a HUGE burger and also gave me two slices of tomato but the end parts... not the middle so pretty much got the shitty parts of a tomato. not cool.
