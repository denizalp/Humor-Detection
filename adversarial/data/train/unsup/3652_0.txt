Tasty Ice creams \n\nAs you all know Vegas can get burning hot in the summer, so having a nice ice cream shop where you can sit with a couple of friends and enjoy a scoop or two of tasty ice cream can make handling the summer heat a bit easier. \n\nCream, located in Downtown Summerlin, is a great option. There are plenty of interesting stores in Downtown Summerlin. You can start with taking short walks from store to store and when you get tired of shop-hopping then stop at Cream, order a scoop or two of your favorite flavors and enjoy the scenery! \n\nI am an ice cream purist! I do not want my ice cream mixed with toppings or sandwiched between cookies, even if they are awfully tasty cookies! So, when I go to Cream I just order a scoop or two in a cup and have myself and ice creamgasm!! But, do not follow my example! Cream has delicious cookies to go with their many flavors of creamy ice cream. An ice cream sandwich rolled in your favorite topping(s) can be very satisfying.
