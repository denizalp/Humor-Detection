Absolutely horrid treatment! I have never been so mortified in my life at a restaurant! Took my mother out for a surprise dinner at her favourite place (+ the rest of the family). We had just finished a good meal, and we're talking after paying the bill. A waiter called \"Chinny\" appears out of nowhere and demands what we thought of the meal, and the service. We were quite taken aback at the forcefulness of his approach and said nothing, before he pulled out my bill and demanded to know why I had not tipped a larger amount. I clearly stated that I hadn't because I had no received any exemplary service by any server that night. Usually when we go there, the waiter is patient enough to at least say hello and tend to us with a bit more consideration. But we basically had the food thrown at us this time, and I certainly wasn't going to tip extra for crappy service. He demanded we reconsider and leave some tip. \n\nI never been so embarrassed in my life at a restaurant. Tipping isn't a fixed requirement, it's something extra given to acknowledge great service from a waiter.\n\nCompletely ruined a family get together with his attitude and tip-heckling. I expected better of Congee Queen, but it's just like most average Chinese-establishments in terms of the customer service. Meh.
