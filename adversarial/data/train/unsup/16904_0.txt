One of my worst experiences at a club, not just in Vegas. I've been to Marquee a couple of times now, and every time just awful. Maybe Marquee was popping, like 3 years ago, but not now. \n\nThey let just about anyone in now, no cover charge with great DJs headlining. How they get these DJs? I have no idea. \n\nDouchebags flailing their arms and fisting the air like no other. You may just end up with a concussion after a night out at Marquee. Ratchets are sloppy drunks, staggering around trying to look sexy and dance. LOL, they seriously just like a ragdoll. Hot. \n\nLast time I got kicked out being too drunk. Um okay, why not kick out the douchelords about to knock someone out with their killer dance moves or the sloppy drunk ratchets who look like they're about to fall asleep?  \n\nNo thanks, I'd rather wait in a line for Hakkasan, or just wait for the new Drais club.
