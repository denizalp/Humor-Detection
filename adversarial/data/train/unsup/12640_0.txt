I surprised my mommy with tickets for her and I to Elton John and we couldn't have had a better time.  The theater is beautiful and not a bad seat in the house!  I had to purchase these tickets weeks in advance and I understood why when I realized that there wasn't an empty seat anywhere.\n\nElton is 68 years young and he played for 2 hours straight, no break! Absolutely incredible!  His music is beautiful and he is a true artist.  There is so much love and passion in every word that he sings.  If you like and appreciate his music, this show is a must see.
