Puckett's is a great bar.  I have been once before a long time ago, a  couple of friends were in town and they wanted to go see one of their friends play at Puckett's so we went and then they proceeded to get kicked out for smuggling in Jack Daniels mini bottles.  So, of course, Puckett's is dear to my heart.  \n\nI ventured up the courage to go back without my drunk ass friends! to go see another band that I used to love in Raleigh.  John Howie, of the Two Dollar Pistols.  Yay, great time.  They were having a weekend of Cashbash, a list of bands and everyone sang their own music and  some Johnny Cash tunes as well.  Good times.  \n\nI discovered another band that I loved too, The Straight 8s.  (rockabilly, surf)  Puckett's is a hole in the wall bar, beer only.  Plenty of seating if you don't want to stand.  The stage is really low so if you like to take photos or heckle the musicians you can.  Cash only!  I had a fun time last night.  You know just the kind of night when the stars align, no one got kicked out and a bonus today, I had to be at work at 10a, I woke up and my make up and hair were still intact.  Yay!  Fun night.
