Finally made it out here for happy hour, celebrating the end of the school year!\nSurprised to see that they only had one other table during our visit, so service was fast.\n\nOrdered a Dogfishhead IPA ($3 off during HH), and each of the following dishes for a mere $5 each: bruschetta appetizer, warm beets \"snack\", and the Margherita and Vico mini pizzas. For $25 before tip, this was a filling but light early dinner.\n\nThe apps were delish: bruschetta is my BF's favorite, and here the crostini is topped with bacon and there's a side of pesto for extra flavor, too. The warm beets were divine and flavorful, served in a mini cast-iron dish and topped with peanuts. \n\nThe mini pizzas weren't that mini- don't know the size compares with their usual since this was our first visit, but server let us know that the usual pizzas are 12\" and intended to be an individual size due to the thinness of the crust style. Ordering two mini pizzas (maybe 8\"?) was enough for us to share without feeling like we were going to explode afterward.\n\nMargherita style was my favorite, as the classic tomato-and-cheese combo is just what I naturally crave when I think of pizza, and I love the complementary flavors of fresh basil.\nBF preferred the Vico, with sausage, fennel, mozzarella, moscarpone, and red onions- quality ingredients and good depth of flavor. While he liked this topping combination better, my dude simply didn't love the thin, wet crust style served here and it may be tricky to get him back in.\n\nWill be coming back soon to try the Moscow Mule cocktail and the Emilia pizza- possibly on my own!
