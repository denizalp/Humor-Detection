I'm not surprised at all the negative reviews!\n\nThese jerkoffs have been sending me spam email for over a decade. I attempted to unsubscribe so many times that now I just forward their emails directly to the Federal Trade Commission (yes, ignoring requests to unsubscribe is a violation of federal law. You can and totally should report these clowns to the FTC if they're doing that to you!)
