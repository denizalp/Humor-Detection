Bumblebee did a lot of work to get an old home I just purchased up to date and safe. They did a great job and were very efficient. Two plumbers knocked out a days worth of work in about 3 and a half hours.\n\nOn top of doing great work, there was some confusion on pricing with my wife and I called Mike (the owner I believe or manager) and his customer service was outstanding. He helped explain everything to me, which in turn helped me explain to my wife.\n\nI won't hesitate to call on Bumblebee for all my future plumbing needs. Thanks so much Mike.
