A view from the 48th floor overlooking the Strip and getting to watch the Treasure Island pirate show every night. Truly breathtaking. \n\nThe Bella suite that my buddies and I stayed in was first-class. Two Samsung flat-screen TV's, one in the living room and one in front of the two queen beds. There's even is a flatscreen TV in the bathroom as well.\n\nAnd a huge bathroom it is. A glass enclosed shower and Roman bathtub are on the left as you enter. Double sink vanity straight ahead. An armoir and entrance to the toilet room on the right. Curious to see a phone in the toilet room and no switch for air circulation in cases of severe #2's. I'll have to knock off a half star for the need to light matches to compensate for this lack of foresight.\n\nI slept on the L-shaped couch and it's one of the most plush couches I have ever slept on. A bed pulls out of the couch, but I didn't care. The couch on its own was more than comfortable.\n\nThere's a fax\/printer\/copier for use as well as wireless high speed internet. These are paid uses of course.\n\nTons of amenities like shampoos, lotions, conditioners, bathrobes, slippers, etc. Even small individual boxes of chocolates that were given one night during turn-down service. You feel like you're living the good life when you stay at the Palazzo.\n\nI was truly impressed by the room and the hotel in general. I'm would stay there in a heartbeat for my next visit to Vegas.
