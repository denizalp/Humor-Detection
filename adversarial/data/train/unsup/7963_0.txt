Something isn't right here. When you see this place only at half capacity, you would think it'd be easy to grab a table. NOPE. Apparently that means that they're booked for the whole night. Who the hell are you guys serving?! Ghosts? Bah, whatever, got our frozen hot chocolates from the side windows as a result.\n\nWe ended up trying the white chocolate and double chocolate frozen hot chocolates. I really didn't know what to expect. In my head, I was thinking something along the lines of fried ice cream, where you get that fried and crispy warm batter on top of ice cream, except hot chocolate that's been flash frozen somehow. Nope, mindfuck, it's just a cold chocolate drink that ended up being overly sweet, especially the white chocolate. Probably won't ever try this again.\n\nFun fact, frozen hot chocolates don't give you brain freeze. I was able to fist 8 straws and drink through all of them simultaneously like a champ but didn't succumb to it's mind numbing power. I think Serendipity had the last laugh though because I think I just got a cavity and pre-diabetic status after drinking them.
