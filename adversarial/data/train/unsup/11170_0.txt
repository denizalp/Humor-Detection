A new addition to my favorite area of Las Vegas. After brunch we stopped here  for some treats to take home. \nThe place is small upon entering. There were people congregated around the counters so I wasn't sure where the line began or ended. We made our way to the display case when it became visible and got in line. There is an open view of the kitchen where you see the dough being made and hand rolled and cut.  The woman behind the counter kindly described each available doughnut to everyone ordering. I tried the key lime pie, the root beer, the Mexican chocolate with horchata filling, Nutella with hazelnuts on top.\nHe doughnut itself seemed oily\/greasy in taste, maybe the oil wasn't hot enough when the batch was fried? This was a let down since it was consistent in each one. All the filling and topping were good, not overly sweet. The Nutella doughnut tasted more like chorale and not the Nutella taste that I love. \nThe staff was wry friendly and attentive.they were preparing coffees while you were waiting in the doughnut line to keep a flow going. It is a new place and will try them again. I hope it was just an off day..
