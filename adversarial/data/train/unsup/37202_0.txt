Gotta say this company is the most trustworthy VIP service in Vegas.  From the moment I called them, Jeff M. gave me great customer service with no BS and great suggestions and tips.  I consider myself a Vegas Veteran and I could tell that these guys know their stuff and did not try to rip us off.  I would not normally need these services, but rolling in town with a bachelor party of 15+ guys, you are going to need help.\n\nThere is nothing worse pulling up to a Vegas club with your group of guys and being turned down unless you buy a $3000 table.  That's where Red Carpet comes in, they were able to get my whole group of guys into Marquee on the busiest night of the week without any problems and at the fraction of the price of a table the bouncers will try to sell you.  Jeff was there the whole time and walked us into the club with no questions asked, gotta say that was a great feeling.\n\nBesides getting you into clubs, these guys just give great all around service.  Jeff was able to set up a last minute party bus to a strip club on a Friday night for free, took care of the ride and cover to the strip club.  They also had a great table and section reserved for us inside.  \n\nIf you want straight answers without the BS of promoters and bait & switch, call Red Carpet.  I would Recommend Jeff... he made himself available through the weekend and made sure everything was handled and on time.  He really made my group feel like VIP's in Vegas, without having to spend the VIP money lol.
