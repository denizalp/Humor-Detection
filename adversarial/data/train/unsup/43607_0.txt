We decided to try this place as it's been quite awhile since the North Hills has seen a Chinese buffet. We were greeted with an overpowering aroma of incense and seated promptly. We went up to the buffet and boy was it tiny! 2 soups, rice, noodles, a tray of fried selections and a few entrees: General Tsos, Kung Pao chicken, chicken with broccoli,sweet and sour chicken and pancakes. No salad,no fresh veggies etc..... Once we got to our seat I was pleased to find complimentary hot jasmine tea and wonton chips with dipping sauces. Sorry to say these were the highlight of the meal and the tea was only thing that was hot. Good service but I will not return.
