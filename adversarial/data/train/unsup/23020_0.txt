Simple is best!  You get chicken strips and either choose how you want it made:  Baked, Fried, or Grilled (BFG)!  I prefer either baked or grilled!  Fried is yummy tooooo!\n\nAnd if you go to the gym down the street I heavily recommend BFG's baked or grilled chicken strips pre or post workout!  If you want to something completely healthy then come here (minus the bread). \n\nThe skewered veggies (that must take a while to put together) is made perfectly.  \n\nBecause of a recent intern-yelp-event I was able to sample all of the sauces that you get to choose with your chicken strips.  My favorite is the wasabi and sweet chili!  With the buffalo and bfg coming in 3rd and 4th.\n\nThe reason this place is bumped up to 5 stars is because of Jin and his family that run the place!  Jin is usually seen in the front counter and is really personable and remembers every customer who has ever been there!  If you go I would recommend you put the chicken hat on and take a picture with Jin!  \n\nI do hate the fact that I might be an addict to BFG chicken strips, the store closes around 8 and I'm one of the many that rushes within the last hour to grab me some grub! \n\nDefinitely give this spot a try, it's located left of the Home Depot and right of the comic book store.
