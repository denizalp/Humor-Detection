I REALLY hate it when the menu says one thing but the restaurant serves another. So my boyfriend and I ordered \"Thai Spring Rolls\" and the menu said it has a chicken mixture in it.  When it arrived...me being really hungry just started eating it.. but my boyfriend (and I can't believe he did this) tore the whole spring roll apart cause he wasn't able to taste the chicken in the first bite.  And well...there was no chicken.  It was more like a vegetable mixture instead of a chicken mixture.  He also compared it to the $2 for 10 spring rolls at Foody Mart and said there wasn't a difference. hahaha. Well the waitress came and we told her..and she said...yea we don't use the chicken mixture anymore but we keep our menus like that.  ..Woah wait.. what? WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A BLACK SHARPIE AND CROSS IT OUT THEN like how they crossed out the cheaper prices on the menu and changed it to something more expensive!!??! \n\nOh well... they took it off our bill and quickly cleared our plates cause we said we didn't want it anymore.  We also ordered the \"Dried Red Curry with Shrimp\"..and  some other kind of Red Curry with chicken and peanuts.  Okay I'll admit...their curry is AMAZING :D!! The portion was smallish...you also have to pay an extra $2.50 for rice..which is necessary. \n\nIf I ever go back....which I don't think I will, I would just get an order of their curry :)
