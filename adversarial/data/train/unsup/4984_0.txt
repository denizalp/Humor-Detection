The special is back! $6 sandwich after 6pm...yes! \nEDIT: the special might be 4-6pm. Just tell 'em Bryan G. sent you and I'm sure you'll get the hook up.\n\nHUMOUROUS STORY\nI saw the guy putting up the sign for the special while walking with my roommate and excitedly yelled \"IT'S BACK! YES! THE SPECIAL IS BACK!\" to which the dude (who would recognize us as the guys who used to come all the time but stopped as soon as the special stopped) looked up at me, laughed, nodded and said \"See you soon\" and then proceeded to tell the guy helping him with the sign that we're the motherfuckers who will only come to his shop if we can get a ridiculous deal. Everybody knows the score. Now I'm gonna get me a corned beef sammich...after 6.
