This review is too long over due, this restaurant is how do you say Awesome!!! from the time you walk in and is greeted by the hostess which is a good looking, sexy , hot Filipino lady, the second thing that came to my mind was order your food,the Interior and ambiance was definitely up to par,there is a flat screen TV that was showing Asian news and a large projection screen  TV that was showing a Asian dance videos, teppan style tables,also a sushi bar area in the rear,you can have your photo taken and place on the wall with the others 50 plus there.I had the make your own lunch set, fire cracker chicken, spicy cucumber, chicken basil, rice, and miso soup,the food was season very well and delicious,buy one beer or sake you get one free (Sapporo, Asahi, Hite, Soju, Sake..cold or hot) happy hour is all day long the menu has a lot of tasty Item to offer,Hard Rock Hotel to the west and UNLV is the the east......Recommended.
