My friends and I met here last Friday for drinks and dinner.  The food, service and atmosphere were excellent!  We all got different dishes and everyone loved what they ordered.  Even on a busy Friday night, our food was ready in record time!  Our waiter was great, he was very attentive and kept the sangria flowing.  I loved this place so much I considered going back a few days later.  This will definitely be added to my list of favorites in the South Side.
