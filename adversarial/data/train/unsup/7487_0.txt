I was actually pleasantly surprised with this place since it sounded like in the previous Yelp reviews that the service was bad, drinks weak and food not so good.\n\nWe were greeted as soon as we arrived and the waitress came right over to take our order.  They have daily happy hour specials and the Thursday night we went it was half off apps and half off specialty cocktails and a $5 burger.  Since it was a BBQ joint we had to try the meats so we ordered the  nachos with pulled pork to start and got some margaritas too.  First of all, the nachos came and the portion was crazy huge we didn't think we could make a dent but they were so good and the margaritas went down so easily next thing we knew the nachos were gone and we had another round of margaritas on the table.\n\nWe had all ordered dinner before we got the nachos which meant we had to get to go boxes because we were too full from the nachos. The prices are very reasonable and you get a lot of meat and 2 sides (your choice from a list of 8) with dinner.  Our table got ribs and brisket with a bunch of different sides.  My favorite sides were the cornbread, mac n cheese and waffle fries.  I probably would stay away from the cheesy corn.  The brisket was smoked perfectly and tender and delicious-ribs were super tasty.\n\nWe left full and buzzy and with leftovers for the next day.  We had a great time and will be back, I'm sure, to sample other dishes.
