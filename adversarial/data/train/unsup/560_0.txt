Many options to fit your personal style! \n\nTalk about a huge selection.  We walked into an overwhelming showroom full of variety.  The ladies at the front desk are very welcoming and friendly.  Any questions you have they are more than happy to help.  \n\nThe showroom is bright and clean just as it should be.  The variety of tile is outstanding.  Around very corner I saw something else I really liked.  They will get you samples of any style you like which is great for matching to furniture or paint scheme.  \n\nIf you want to check them out, you won't be disappointed.
