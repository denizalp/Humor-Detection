They turned down business... I got their at 12:28. He said last call is at 12:30. Please change the hours and say that you close at 12:30a so people don't wage their time and gas. Thank you\n\nMaybe he had something else going in and was ready to jet out... As soon as we walked away he immediately turned off the lights. How about if we wanted to grab dessert? Bad biz homie!
