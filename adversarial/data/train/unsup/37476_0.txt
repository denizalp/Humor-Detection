Great small business atmosphere.\nThey remember their customers, and call them by name, you just don't see that much anymore.\nThey have a great deal on water jugs if you need them, or bring your own.\nI was recently advised to use a humidifier in my home, and knew using tap water would be a maintenance nightmare. I also knew grocery distilled water would cost a fortune.\nI spoke to the folks here, and for a fraction of the cost, they got me going.\nOne of our pets also required a special filtered water, not distilled, which I could not find in stores. They were able to provide it at a very reasonable cost.\nGreat prices, great service. That says it all for me.
