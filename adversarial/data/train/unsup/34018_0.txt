I visited Terra Saturday for dinner and overall I was  impressed though they still have some work to do to earn that 5th star. \n\nFood- \nA complementary seafood salad amuse-bouche started the meal off on a highpoint. It was light, fresh, and extremely tasty. Next we moved on to some  french bread which I found to be disappointingly dry though the olive oil and balsamic were high quality.  \n\nThe Ravioles de Veau au Beurre de Truffe (homemade veal ravioli with cream sauce) was outstanding! By far some of the best homemade pasta I have ever eaten, the flavors were both delicate and complex. I may purchase two of these as my meal next time! \n\nOur main course was the filet and  it  wasn't as memorable unfortunately. The filet had a reduction with cherries in it ( though it didn't mention this on the menu) but the flavor was too sweet for my taste. I opted for garlic mashed potatoes which were very creamy but lacked salt (coming from someone who is a known under-salter this says a lot). \n\nThe dessert was the main reason for a non-five star review (since the ravioli absolutely earned 5 stars) we had salted caramel ice cream with puffed pastry and apples. It sounds mouthwatering but honestly the caramel was either burned or their was a liquor that wasn't cooked off...I couldn't even eat it though I will say my boyfriend did. \n\nService was excellent - friendly and knowledgeable. \n\n Wine list - only bottle prices are listed, if you drink by the glass you have no idea what you're going to end up with...which was my case. \n\nAtmosphere- As others have said it was a bit stark. They need to dim the lights, play some soft music (they were playing something you might find at Azteca) and perhaps make it a little more cozy. \n\nI will return for the ravioli because it was THAT good!
