Was so excited this place finally opened at this casino and so, we gave it a try.\n\nHaving tried steam kettle cooked restaurants around southern california, we were excited and curious how it would be.\n\nWe were somewhat pleased. Our server gal was great. Executive chef even came out to our table at some point to ask how everything was. \n\nWe ordered half dozen special oysters, shrimp pan roast level 7 and kitchen sink pan roast level 3. Bread that comes out was tasty with hints of garlic butter. The oysters were fresh shucked and DELICIOUS!!!! We regretted ordering more but as soon as our food came out...all regret was gone. The bowls were enormous! They were tasty and full of meat and seafood. Having tried other similar places, we were just as pleased however, veggies (or the trinity) could be diced a bit smaller. \n\nWeird thing that happened though. At one point throughout our meal, my man and I were using our condiment caddy throughout our dining and some blonde server all of a sudden just took it away and gave it to someone at the counter. Not a word she just took it!!! I mean...wtf?! We don't like to cause confrontation or gripe so we just let it go but seriously...wtf?! Luckily sous chef was walking around and we asked him for another. \n\nOverall, we were pleased (minus klepto blonde server). Just wish hours were like palace station heehee but we understand.
