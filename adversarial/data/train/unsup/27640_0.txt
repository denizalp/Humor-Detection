What a great find! This place is awesome! I was looking for a salon for my two boys and they gave me the best salon for them. It was so easy to schedule (text!) And they were able to take both at the same time which is heaven for any busy parents out there...\nThe team was so kind to the boys and we got fantastic haircuts!!! It is a bit more expensive than what I usually pay for the boys haircuts so that is the only thing I would recommend checking first but I was so happy with them I plan to get my own haircut with them! \nGo check them out :)
