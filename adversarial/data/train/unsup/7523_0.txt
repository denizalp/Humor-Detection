If I had the choice of never having a burger again or never being able to have kids, it would be a serious dilemma. If your children act up on you, you can't just eat them. Score 1 for burgers.\n\nNeedless to say, there are few things that get me more excited than the prospect of trying out a new burger-centric restaurant. I was like a schoolboy on Christmas. I'm not sure that's the analogy but I'm sticking to it. Expectations were high; if you've got \"burger\" in the name of your restaurant, your burgers had damn well better deliver.\n\nI'm sorry to say, but Loungeburger's didn't. It was all smoke and noise, signifying nothing.\n\nSo here's an open letter written with love and care to the management at Loungeburger. Here's how you could have wowed me:\n\n\n1. Y U NO SPECIALS!?\n\nI came here on a Thursday night - not exactly prime time for most restaurants. Usually restaurants recognize this by offering specials. Not Loungeburger. Upon being asked, my hostess said they didn't have any specials \"Because we just renovated. But we'll have specials on Monday again!\"\n\nUh, what? That's possibly the most convoluted explanation ever. You don't have specials because you just renovated? Are you trying to tell me you cant' give me 15% off a beer because you need my chump change to help you pay for the reno's you just did? Why can you do that on Monday, but not on Thursday? Will you have paid off your renovation debt using your undiscounted beer money by then? Do you have some sort of Italian mobster breathing down your neck who gave you a deadline for \"next Monday or else your kneecaps get it\"? \n\nOkay, I guess.\n\n2. Y U SO STINGY!?\n\nOkay, seriously - you want me to pay you to have dip with my yam fries? That's just greedy. I get that your rent is high and that you just renovated, but literally every other restaurant I've ever been to in my life brings out your yam fries with something other than ketchup. \n\nKetchup does not go with yams unless you're some sort of 12 year old. Have a little class and bring your patrons something fancy sounding like \"aioli\". Ketchup and yams. Seriously. It's like you aren't even trying.\n\nIf I want to change my bun, I need to PAY you for that? A bun is a bun is a bun. If I don't put your whole wheat bun on my burger, it's going to go stale in your cabinets because NOBODY WANTS TO PAY YOU $2 TO CHANGE THEIR BUN. Make this complimentary instead of nickle and diming me. \n\nEvery single additional topping also costs as well - which is fairly normal I guess, but it's tragic in a way because their standard line up of burgers come so boringly appointed that adding cheese to them seems more like a necessity than an option. \nThere's your standard \"This burger is spicy!\" burger, and a \"This burger is our classic!\" burger, and then one or two other variations on a theme that were so unremarkable I didn't even find them compelling. \n\nDo yourselves a favor and take a page from Red Robin. They do burgers right.\n\nThe friend I was with ordered a grapefruit juice - only to receive an excessively watery grapefruit cocktail instead. COME ON GUYS. Grapefruit juice should be grapefruit juice. It's like $3.99 at WalMart. Sort it out.\n\nOn the plus side, you DO have waffle fries, so that won you back some major brownie points. Waffle fries are like crack cocaine. They're like the super fun cousin of normal fries that owns a motorcycle and lived in Guatamala for a year. I could have used more of them on my plate, but I was so overjoyed at the fact you sold them that I chose not to care.\n\n3. Y U NO SPECIAL!?\n\nThere is pretty much nothing imaginative about the burgers here. I know this is going to sound like a massive slap in the face, but I've had more compelling burgers at Montana's. \n\nThe burgers aren't especially big. The ingredients aren't especially unique. In fact, maybe the \"lounge\" part of the name is more telling, it's like someone whipped up the idea for these burgers while reclining in a chair and thinking \"Gaaaaah, that'll be good enough\" before trailing off to sleep and snoring obnoxiously.\n\nYour burgers are good. Passable. But they're not special. They're not the kind of burger that makes me think you're a restaurant who specializes in burgers. \nClassic Jack's serves their burgers on a pretzel bun. What do you do? Nothing. NOTHING! You're a burger joint for heaven's sake, find a shtick! You don't even have a \"special sauce\"!?\n\nThe bottom line is that you can get burgers like this ANYWHERE without paying as much for them. \n\nOn the whole, my trip to Loungeburger was exceptional. Exceptionally underwhelming, that is. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't exciting or memorable in any way.\n\n3 stars - the experience was utterly average, but expectations were high.
