I was so excited to see the signage for this new Jamaican spot! I popped in for a solo dinner of beef patty and oxtails. The beef patty was great and I highly recommend it as an app- it's nicely spicy and the crispy, flaky pocket isn't too thick. The oxtails were a good portion, and meaty, but the sauce was minimal and the robust island flavors I was hoping for were toned down. I was excited about the rice and peas, but found that bland and lackluster. Service was polite but location is pretty bare and quiet, needs some sort of decor. I would come back to try another meal of the goat curry or jerk chicken, but will have to ask if they can make it extra spicy or something. There aren't many places in town to get this kind of cuisine, but I was hoping it would be just a little bit better.
