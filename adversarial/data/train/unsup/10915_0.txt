Been here enough to say these guys know how to make a good sandwich.  When ever I have a real NY pastrami craving it's off to Rocco's I go.  I will drive miles out of my way for the real deal.  They pile the meat nice and high and will fix it up the way you like it.  I prefer provo with lots of spicy mustard and a little mayo.  \n\nRocco's is a great little lunch spot but the small dining area can fill up fast, so if you are in a hurry call for pickup.  The pasta dishes I have tried are very tasty and a large portion.  I have not been able to try the pizza yet so look for my review update.  It's just because the sandwiches are so good (especially the pastrami.)
