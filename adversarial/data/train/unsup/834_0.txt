So one day after a meeting, my subordinate and I scrambled to find a place for a quick lunch before heading to our next meeting.  And we found this exciting little organic pizza place, Base Pizzeria.   \n\nThe heavens were with us that day, for it was Tuesday and the pizzas was 50% off.  The pizzas are a pretty penny so the 50% off really came in handy.  The restaurant was clean, and well kept, and the service was fast and friendly, probably due to us being the only ones there at that time.  The pizza was absolutely amazing.  We only got their base, pretty much a cheese pizza with some green things on it.  We only wanted to test out the quality of the pizza and the best way to test is by ordering a plain cheese pizza.  That way you can focus on the tomato sauce and the cheese.  The tomato sauce on it was amazing and organic, you can really taste the flavour of tomatoes.  And the cheese was strong and perfect.  \n\nOverall a great pizza!  Overall a great experience, we will definitely be back, only if it was a lot closer.
