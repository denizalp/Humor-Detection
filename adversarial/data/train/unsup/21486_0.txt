A lunch buffet for $14 with a wide realm of high-quality food from different cuisines? You really can't go wrong.\n\nSome of my favorite items were the baked potato soup, mini spring rolls, chow mein, and key lime tartelette dessert. They have a decent salad bar, two or three options for soups, and a ton of entrees. The buffet even features a small carving station where they had a prime rib (yes, even at the lunch buffets!), chicken, and some more hearty entrees. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give this place five stars is because some of the food (the shrimp poppers and some chicken finger\/nugget items) seemed like they were of the \"fresh-frozen\" variety. Everything else, though, was phenomenal, especially for the price!
