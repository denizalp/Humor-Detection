This establishment is nothing like the original. My family and I frequent the Providence location, but visited the Fort Mill location twice because of proximity to our house. The food of all our dishes have been lukewarm...precooked. The jambalaya was soggy, the shrimp and andouille pasta came without shrimp and sausage, and fried chicken which takes 20 minutes to prepare was cold. This location may damage the reputation of the Providence location. We will not be back but will take the drive. Sad.
