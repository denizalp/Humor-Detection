This is a nice small park with a central lake and ample picnic\/grilling spots.   There are also soft\/baseball fields and a central open area where you can throw Frisbees or footballs.  One side of the park has tennis courts and there is a kid area with a good size jungle gym.  Also, its never very crowded at least in my experience so if you want a smaller park with decent amenities and small crowds give this place a try.
