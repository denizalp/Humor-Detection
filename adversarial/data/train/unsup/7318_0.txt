Why is this place rated so highly??? And why is it considered Mexican food?? Sweet potatoes are not Mexican food.... neither are apples, quinoa, or mushrooms. And please don't bother trying to bring me around, I am a born and raised SoCal girl and will fight you tooth and nail. Just call it something else, you are doing an entire culture a great injustice with your false advertising. Just wrapping something in a tortilla doesn't make it Mexican food.\n\nI honestly cannot name a single thing that I liked about this place. It was completely empty when we went and they were out of chips, the service came off a bit pretentious, they got our order wrong, and the lemonade was so sour I couldn't drink it. Not to mention the cost! It was $30 for 2 of us and we both left hungry and completely unsatisfied. This place has already become an inside joke and a reference against which we compare other awful dining experiences.
