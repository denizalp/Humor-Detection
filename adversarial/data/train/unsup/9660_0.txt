Sufficient, but not fantastic.  I'd give this 2.75 stars and I am rounding up because I feel extra generous today.\n\n+++PROS+++\n1. Can't complain when there's a table full of fun Yelpers to dine with\n2. Portions are lardy.\n3. Prices are reasonable (i.e. $6.25 burger with fries on AAA beef)\n4. They were able to take a reservation 28 minutes before we came in.\n\n---CONS---\n1. They were able to take a reservation 28 minutes before we came in.\n2. Apparently they have valet parking right in front of the restaurant!  The cost is $40 and it's run by the City of Toronto.  Gotta love $70 dinners at a dive diner!\n3. There was this really loud Asian guy there last night.  Dude was super loud, rude, and his jokes were racist.  I can't remember what the joke was, but something about commonalities between Hitler and Terry Fox.\n4. Food is meh.\n5. Steakhouse?  I haven't seen such poor interior design and color choice since Chino Locos.  The atmosphere is blah and you're better off making a steak at home and eating it alone.\n\nOverall, not great for dinner, but probably worth a go for brunch\/lunch.  It seems more suited to that crowd.
