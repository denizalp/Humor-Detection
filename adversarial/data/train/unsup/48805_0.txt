My favorite Barber in town! I come here every 3 to 4 weeks. All of the folks here are terrific, Michael is my barber. He got me out of my rut and looking a little edgier, a little different, but still very clean and professional. Thanks a ton!\n\nOh, and they also cut my little boy's hair here. He loves it.
