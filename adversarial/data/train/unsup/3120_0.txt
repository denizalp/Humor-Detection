Douglas Trattner wasn't lying in last weeks Scene. V's really does have the best fried chicken in CLE. \n\nThere are several different choices for breading. We love spicy stuff but we found the honey crisp to be our favorite over Cajun and seasoned.\n\nSides are also bomba$$.. You should try: rice and greens, baked beans, and mac and cheese. \n\nCustomer service is super friendly. Call ahead. Then give them about 10 minutes more. \n\nYay Collinwood!
