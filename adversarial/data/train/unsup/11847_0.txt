This review is for the breakfast buffet at this Old Country. I came here for Sunday breakfast, really hungry after a long tiring Saturday with very little to eat,  and it turned out to be a good choice. In addition to typical American breakfast fare (waffles, pancakes, french toast, ham, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, etc.), they also offered menudo and had an omelette bar and a taco bar. I sampled most of the items and the only thing I didn't care for were the pancakes, which were dry. Everything else was good, including the menudo which I enjoyed a lot. The restaurant itself is clean and spacious and the staff is friendly and efficient. I'm looking forward to trying their lunch and dinner buffets soon.
