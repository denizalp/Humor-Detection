The DMV is the great equalizer. Rich and poor, black and white, citizen and... non citizen. At some point, everyone has to come in for their turn in the mill. After I drove by the DMV office on Arrowood where the line was out the door and halfway down the shopping plaza, I figured that I had to try elsewhere. So here I am.\n\nWait in line, give your name and reason for being here, go take a seat. And wait. And wait some more. And keep waiting.\n\nNo food, no drink, no smoking. You don't want to go outside, because you might miss your turn. On the plus side, there is a decent 4G cell signal (I'm on T-Mobile) and they do NOT have a television that's tuned in to some irritating nonsense.\n\nEventually, my name was called and I got my vision test and a check of the various roadsigns that I had to identify. It's not as easy as you think - which one is the yellow triangle when they don't put words on the sign? Then another wait until my picture was taken.\n\nEach of the people I interacted with was nice and polite. I have no complaints with the people. It's just that there aren't enough of them! All told two hours of time plus driving up to Brookshire and back.\n\nYes, I've experienced better. On the plus side, I'm now renewed for another eight years until I have to do this again.\n\n#2600
