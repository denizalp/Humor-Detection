Sparkly new Residence Inns are great. For one thing, Residence Inn is a lot like McDonald's in that there's a tight corporate grip on the ship -- if you've seen one, you've kind of seen them all. But this one also gets brownie points for the basketball hoop and synthetic playing surface in the courtyard. (Which for some people might not be a good thing, I suppose.) Yes, the pool is fine and the breakfast buffet is too. And they have that little room with a working treadmill for when it hits 110 degrees.\n\nThe one negative might be that you're pretty much on the border of civilization here. To the south you'll find plush & trendy Scottsdale, and half a mile north of here you might as well be walking on the moon. (Er, maybe the sun.)\n\nI also like to remind myself that in \"bad\" economic times, there are still winners and losers. I wouldn't call myself a great winner right now, but if times were better right now I wouldn't have been able to afford the Residence Inn during peak season. Thanks, Wall Street! (Never mind that my 401-k is in the toilet...)
