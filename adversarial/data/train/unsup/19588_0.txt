Always fresh salad, salsa & quick staff. This is one of my fams favorite locations. I go between my fave steak tacos & chicken salad. They are both always good. The meats are always cooked but not over cooked because that's where fresh Mexican usually goes awry. So if you like healthy food go with Chipotle & make wise choices ie ditch the dressings, sour cream, cheese & the tortilla & your bod will thank you.
