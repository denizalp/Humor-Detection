If you want a place that tells you what you don't want to eat than look no farther than All-American Bar & Grille. All my date and I wanted was a couple of mac and cheese bites but the waiter said \"no you don't\" and wouldn't take that for an answer. We went with the shrimp cocktail instead which we were stoked about paying $17 for 5 pieces, but the lemon came with a cover so I guess it was all worth it in the end. Aside from that we ordered a \"Windy City\" (Hennessy, bitters and champagne) and drank that to get the night going, and take a pic (duh). The ambiance was nice though so 3 stars for you glen coco.
