Disappointing. The food was interesting and NOT in a good way. Dined here with Family after the show at Wild Horses Casino. It's apparently Asian food, supposedly. Yet from what region? Who knows? The rice is definitely not your typical jasmine rice, Asian rice that is fluffy and soft and can take on any flavors of your meal. Their rice is solid, harder and super uniformed. \n\nPASS on the following:\nHoney Walnut Shrimp - it didn't look like anything I have ever had. It had mushrooms in it and had an odd cream brownish sauce that was super tart\/tangy. Strange appeal and so was the flavor.\n\nSeared Ahi Tuna-obviously was thawed out and lightly seared and prepared who knows how long before it was served to us. It was dry and appeared to have been sitting out for hours.\n\nI also ordered coffee to help me keep up. Yet, once requesting a refill I was told by the waitress, \"you don't want to order it, it's not fresh and who knows how long it's been sitting out and we are closing soon.\"  ????? WOW.\n\nSimply put, THIS is NOT Asian food period.
