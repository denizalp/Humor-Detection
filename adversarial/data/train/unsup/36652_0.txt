Our first time here. We came in and were warmly greeted as we sat ourselves for lunch. Our server was such a sweetheart! I can't remember her name, but she boxes in her off time, as a hobby. So if the manager sees this review, please give her a kudos! We ordered the corned beef & cabbage. It was DELICIOUS! My only \"beef\" (lol) was that there were only 3 fairly small pieces of meat. I guess I figured it might be slightly heartier. And it did take awhile for our food to come. Being the Friday special meal of the day, I would think it would be cooking since the morning & fairly quick to whip out to the customer, especially dince we ordered it sans potoates. But that will not stop us from coming back & trying other menu items! EVERYTHING on the menu sounded sooooo good! We are doing a high protein thing, so maybe that's why I wanted more meat....lol *oink* \nWe'll be back!
