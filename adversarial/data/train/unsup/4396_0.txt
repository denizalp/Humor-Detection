My husband and I have successfully used Yelp to find excellent restaurants.  This is the first time it has completely missed the mark.  This place is one of the most filthy, disgusting, unsanitary places we have ever eaten.  Don't even get me started on the bathrooms, they are worse than most gas stations I've seen.  We were uncharacteristically ready to walk out the door before our waters even came.  However, we've been to places that weren't the most beautiful to look at but had wowed us with their food so we decided to give it a try.  We were already there and with 4.5 stars averaged with almost 200 reviews it had to be great, right?  Wrong!  We started with pork egg rolls (they were o.k.) and hot and sour soup (yuck).  We then ordered  different entrees including orange chicken, Kung Pao chicken, and chicken fried rice.  The only thing that wasn't completely nasty was the orange chicken but it certainly wasn't the best I've had.  The rest of the chicken was rubbery and full of fat\/tendons.  We brought three other people with us and we were all staring at each other in disgust.  We will NEVER step foot in this place again!  The reviews have to rigged, it's the only explanation.
