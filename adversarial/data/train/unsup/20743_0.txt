Its sat morning, and I have a full day of housecleaning on the menu for the kids and I, so I thought well lets go get breakfast before the fun starts. Woke up my teens and told them let's go, they have never been so I was looking forward to taking them.\n\nWe got to our table and I noticed from my last trip there, they no longer have the cinnamon sugar covered tortilla chips :( I was looking forward to them! \n\nNow my son, he is a different type of fella, doesn't always go with the group, he ordered a yogurt parfait, I though um really? But when he got it, it was beautiful it had blueberries, strawberries and came with a blueberry scone.  He was happy.\n\nMy daughter ordered the biscuit and gravy, she loved every bite! \n\nI ordered the wild west burrito that came with refried beans, inside the burrito was potatoes, carne asada, eggs, pico de gallo and I had it topped with red & green sauce.  OK no one told me that it was going to be huge, my yogurt eating son had to help me, I gave him  1\/2 of it, and he loved it! I have to say I am a fan of their green sauce! \n\nAnother great meal at Brunchies! Look forward to coming back again!
