Growing up, my Mom was a dedicated gift giver. Cards, gift bags, tiny to\/from note cards and trimming....the whole shebang. Before I discovered Papyrus, I spent a lot of time in Hallmark, perusing the aisles for the perfect greeting cards for numerous occasions. Certain card brands always stuck out to me, for being unique and decorative. One of these brands was Papyrus. When I discovered there was a store, I set out to see what was available.\n\nMore than just cards, they offer gift wrap services, gift bags and tissue paper. Even small gifts to give a loved one or a coworker. I really only buy gift cards for a select few, people that I know who pay attention to detail. Let's face it, some people get greeting cards and they are forgotten in no time. When one is paying around $10 for one, you'd better believe it's only for a special someone. Not all their cards cost that much, I'm just drawn to the 'extraness' of higher costing ones.\n\nThey aren't all stodgy and boring either. Some are a little naughty (nothing obscene, just the type you would give a friend or relative with a great sense of humor) and others are sentimental.\n\nIf you sign up for their email, you will get coupons throughout the year to use on any purchase. These come in handy. I've been a Hallmark customer for years and don't recall seeing many coupons. It's possible I didn't pay attention, but I doubt that. Both are great stores, and Hallmark has a big selection, but I prefer Papyrus any day.
