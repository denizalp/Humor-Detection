I've been hearing a lot about this place but since my wife opted for a vegan food regimen, hitting up a place with counters of steaks and a menu focus on meat is going to make for a difficult date night. So when I was in the area on my own, I popped in for lunch.\n\nNice menu with, of course, a lot of meats. I chose the store-made pastrami sandwich with a side of mac & cheese. Grilled on rye bread, the meat was tasty and the bread was crispy. Maybe a little greasy, but that's to be expected.\n\nThe mac & cheese was excellent. I'm not sure what cheese they put in there, but it was creamy and tangy with a little bit of bite to it. Also a little oily at the bottom and that's also to be expected.\n\nService was good, the speed of my meal was good and the price was acceptable.\n\nLooking forward to returning with a meat eater.
