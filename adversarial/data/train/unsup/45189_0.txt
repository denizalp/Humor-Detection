Ooooook.....so this taco place is in a Delivery Mart which is attached to Ginos pizza. The soda machine was broken, so that was a bummer. The chicken and carne asada are actually not bad, hence two stars however the meat was not hot temperature wise... both were cold. The girl at the register said they were street tacos,  not true.  Regular flour tortillas you can buy at the grocery store, which added nothing to the taco.  Pico was alright. The hot and extra hot sauces are just gross. Definetly disappointed and can't say I would give them a second try.
