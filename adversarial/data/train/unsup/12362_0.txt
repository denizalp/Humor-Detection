I went to this school awhile ago. It's super easy if you just STUDY. The class provides study guides for midterm and final exam. All you have to do is know the answers to all questions. You'll Ace it with no issues. I gave 3 stars because I dislike the director Christine. She is a total witch with a bad attitude. I dislike how she conversates with students, and always seem irritated. She also send students to get 100 hrs of hands-on experience in hospital that are 30 miles away from home, and expects you to complete your training in a short period of time without understanding people have busy lives. She threatened me to finish up my hands on with a deadline, or I could loose my certificate of completion. She could of organized it better since there are only 2 classes with small number of students. It was such a hassle, and dangerous to drive about 60 miles total, and traning starts early in the morning. I wouldn't have sign up for this school if i knew I'd have to drive to a different city just to get training done. She could of just look up our address, and find the closes location for everyone. The only thing that made this class worth of my time is my instructors Patty, I LOVE her. She is very informative, and helpful. She's fun, and likes to crack jokes at times. I never thought I'd look forward to go to school, but she definitely made a difference. Thank you Patty for the wonderful experience.
