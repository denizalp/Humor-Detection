The best derm in Toronto, hands down!!!\n\nYou see, I have been under the wrath of rosecea for a number of years. I've spent tens of thousands of dollars (no joke!!) and tried different skin care, dermatologists, detox, naturopath, even herbal medicine... NOTHING WORKED!!! \n\nIn my desperation, I ran into a young lady who referred me to Dr. Pollack. She said he saved her skin and he might very well save mine as well. AND YES!! HE DID!!\n\nAfter six months of treatment, I'm SOOOOO GLAD to say that I feel much better. I still have rosey cheeks (like I'm wearing blush) but no more rough skin along with patches of redness on my face!!\n\nI cant thank the lady enough for referring me to Dr. Pollack. And praise the Lord for Dr. Pollack.... SERIOUSLY!!!\n\nIf you're looking for a derm, look no further.... Go to see the best in town!!!
