Chilli dogs! They make it in front of the window for you as well. It's not that easy finding a really good chili dog and these guys do it pretty damn well. It's located in the Fremont area of downtown Las Vegas. It may cost a bit more than you'd expect but hey you're in tourist area. Be ready to pay to play. The dog size was reasonable. Not too small and not too big. The oozing cheese on the bun and dog. That was topped with chili onions and a little bit of mustard. Such a simple but delicious treat. I would definitely eat this again. I want a chili dog right now. \n\nI've never been to coney island but when I do I'll be eating tons of these.\n\nRecommendation: Chili dog.
