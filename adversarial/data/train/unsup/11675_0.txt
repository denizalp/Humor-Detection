I really like this place.  I have had most things on the menu (I am a little sad that they took the \"jalapeno\" popper off) and everything is good.  The cocktails are great - I like the whiskey drinks like \"Church on Time\" and \"Remember the Maine.\"  They also have solid wine and beer lists.  Apps like the kung pao cauliflower and egg rolls are awesome.  The mains are good too but I can't seem to stop ordering the burger and fries or the chicken sandwich. (that sounds lame, but they are really good)
