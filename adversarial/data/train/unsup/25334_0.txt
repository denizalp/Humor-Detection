i'm a firm believer that as a girl in vegas, spending should be very minimal - ya the necessities you'll have to pick up (housing and travel) but club entry and drinks should be free esp if you're in a large group!  that said, encore beach is the one event i would be willing to splurge on over and over again.  i went on the saturday of memorial day weekend to see afrojack.  presale tickets for girls were $50.  we arrived around 10:30 and only had to wait in a short line.  \n\nthis was seriously the BEST thing i did in vegas this past weekend.  awesome music, great people-watching, killer drinks.  the only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars is the price.  not only did we drop $50 on tickets but drinks were $15 a pop!  yikes.  the good thing is that all drinks are $15 no matter what you get so after starting with standard pineapple-vodkas we switched over to these really tasty raspberry lemonade drinks and frozen margs for the same price!! :)
