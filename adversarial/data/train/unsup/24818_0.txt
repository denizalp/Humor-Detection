Welcome to Vegas!\n\nI visited their sister store in Chicago last year and was a fan. \n\nI'm glad they finally have made their way to the West Coast.\n\nMy wife loves candy, especially gummy bears.  So imagine how she felt when she discovered their endless jars!\n\nThis place is unique, their staff are friendly and courteous and the place is squeaky clean. I wouldn't hesitate to eat a gummy bear if it fell on the floor lol.\n\nI'll be back for sure, since its in the Fashion Show Mall, just steps from the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nWhen I win, the wife wins too.  That means endless amounts of sugary treats.
