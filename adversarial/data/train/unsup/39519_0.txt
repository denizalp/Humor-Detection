My family and I went to the Bellagio buffet on a Friday night and we paid $37 each. It seemed to be on the somewhat pricey side, but the great variety of food made up for it. The line was took more than half an hour. That was okay since we expected it to be long anyway.\n\nSome of the more memorable, tasty dishes that I enjoyed were Alaskan king crab legs, lamb chops, prime rib, Kobe beef, and sea bass. I especially liked the desserts, such as macarons, bread pudding, and chocolate covered strawberries. Soda and juices were included in the price. Service was good as well.\n\nOverall, with such a price expected at Las Vegas, I think the wide selection of dishes makes this a decent hotel buffet.
