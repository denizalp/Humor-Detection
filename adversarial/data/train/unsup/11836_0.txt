Looked clean.  No wait.\nGreat Eyebrows.\n$8.    I'm happy.\n\nBTW, it is an iffy neighborhood.  I was in there maybe 7 minutes and when I came out, someone had poured a cola drink all over my windshield and front\/sides of car.  I noticed the windshield and wiped it clean, but it was not till the next day that I noticed the cola all over the hood and sides.  Nasty thing to do to a luxury car.  Maybe the fact that people actually save up for a car of their choice annoys some people but I do believe in Karma.  So here I am, waiting for the karma to kick in.  It will.  \"G--d Don't like ugly.\"
