I recommend dr Kim to anybody who needs a ortho . She is so nice and so educated she knows her stuff man! Her staff is so sweet and terry is so friendly helpful she's truly amazing  ! I had a couple other orthos line up to get a second opinion but coming to dr Kim's office made me look no further she's the best terry is too! Her pricing is super reasonable and much cheaper then your other orthos and she's much better! I recommend everybody to go to her !!! Thank you dr Kim and your staff I'm one happy camper.
