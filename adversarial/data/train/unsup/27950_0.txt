This is by far the best restaurant in Arizona. Everything is fresh made and you can tell in the quality. It's basically impossible to not eat a million breadsticks before dinner they're THAT good. \n\nGet the chicken tortellini with creamy pesto, it does not disappoint.\n\nAlways great service and delicious food but the venue is a little small so expect to have a wait time. It's worth the wait. The outdoor seating is great when the weather is nice!
