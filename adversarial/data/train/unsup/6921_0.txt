I love Nutmeg! They have the best butter tarts! (Their competition across the street are good too but I love Nutmeg's version far more). The pastry is so flaky and syrupy filling with pecans is yummy! I also love their croissants, esp the plain (butter) ones and the cinnamon croissant with a vanilla glaze. Megan and Tim are super-nice and friendly. This weekend, I'm trying their pumpkin pie coffeecakes so I will report back about those.
