Too early to make coffee on the way out the door in a rush to get to the airport and certainly not enough time to drive through, gulp it down before security takes it away, I found myself at this point in the airport needing a hit of caffeine and decided to try this chain. \n\nI like my espresso\/latte to start out hot (better flavor in my opinion), so was a little disappointed that it was drinkable immediately, which meant that it wouldn't be drinkable all the way down to the last drop, and it wasn't. I guess they will never be sued.
