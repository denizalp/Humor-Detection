Went here for lunch during the week, i had heard great things about this place from many people.  I ordered the cheeseburger, which came with 2 patties, american cheese, lettuce, tomato and special sauce. I also added pickles.  Ordered the Cry and Fry which is onion rings and french fries, the fries are cooked in 100% peanut oil and there were multiple ways to add toppings to your fries such as chili and cheese, salt and vinegar, and parmesan. Since it was my first visit i decided to go with trying them just as they come. I was happy to see all the options they had for beverages: beer, coke products; including the old school coke out of the bottle, milk shakes, and other bottled beverages.  \nAfter placing my order i was given a buzzer and within 10 minutes or less i had my order in front of me.  The burger was delicious, cooked perfect, and the lettuce, tomato and pickles were fresh and of decent size.  I also enjoyed the special sauce which was not over powering and the perfect addition to my burger. I was a little hesitant since the cheese burger came with 2 patties, but their employee assured me it wasnt too big.  she was correct. perfect size.  The onion rings are HUGE, they only gave me 3 with my half and half order but seeing the size i understand, the onion rings are fries were cooked perfect and very good.  \nBurgerFi also serves custard, chocolate and Vanilla which you can order as a concrete, milkshake, sundae, cone or cup. I tried just a cup and it was so creamy and rich, but very good. Im glad i didn't add any toppings and kept it plain for my first time, adding anything would have made this overly rich and too much after my burger and fries.\nI will definitely be returning to this burger place and will be telling all my friends!  Also have to mention how clean and friendly the staff was, great experience!
