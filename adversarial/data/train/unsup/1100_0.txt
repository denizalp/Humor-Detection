Chose to stay here for the night because of free continental breakfast & pet friendly amenities. \n\nThe room was a good size, there was 2 queen beds, a mini fridge, microwave, tv, and small table. The bed was comfy and clean. \n\nI liked that the hotel was conveniently placed around a lot of restaurants. PF Changs, the Elephant Bar, a bar, and some other restaurants were less than a 5 minute walk away. \n\nMy only complaint would be that the room was hot. We had to lower the AC to 70 degrees to get it at a bearable temperature. I'm from Vegas and I'm used to hot, but not THAT hot.
