Pretty darn nice! Fancy accommodations. Our view was of the palazzo and some mountains, 19th floor and I cannot complain about that. There are 3 TVs...living room, bedroom and even one in the bathroom which was great for Sunday afternoon football and a shower. Tub is separate and took quite a while to fill. But overall a beautiful room.\n\nMy only gripe was that there was no microwave and the fridge is already full of stuff. If you move any of it, you get charged. Which sucks immensely in Vegas if you want to take back leftovers or beverages. I gave this hotel 4 stars based on the room size, comfort of the bed, and ridiculous amount of space. Free wifi too :)\n\nBtw- pool is beautiful!
