The food and drinks here are fantastic! I love all the cocktails and everything I've gotten from the menu is great. The service is sub par. I'd give the restaurant 5*'s if they had better service, but it hasn't improved since it opened. If you go, sit at the bar. The bartenders are FAR more attentive than the servers. Having to wait 10+ minutes to be greeted is excessive, and not to mention how long the food sits in the window..
