In a nut shell the best thing was the music... The manager is sexist however the waitress Sara was very polite and kept apologizing as if it was her fault the food we got was cold.. Don't order the steak bacon wrapped skewers complete waste... The onion rings along with it was burnt to a crisp they crumbled at the touch... And for some reason the pulled pork pasta had fries and onion rings that I assume they tried I pass off as caramelized onions such a shame... I'd never come back it's not worth the money or time I should've went to mc Donald's which by the way is directly across the street .... Sorry BP go back to Boston
