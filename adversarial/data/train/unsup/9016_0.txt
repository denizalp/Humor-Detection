Came here on a whim and happened to land on the 2 for 1 day!  16$ for a 50 min massage who can complain.  Only thing that sucks is theres a long wait for when that happens.  Approximately  1 hour and 45 mins till i could get mine.  BUT i was the guy who sat around the whole time.  You're free to walk out and get some food while you wait.   The staff seemed very friendly and helpful.  I'll admit being a guy i was a little disappointed when i had a guy in his 60's come out to give me a massage but hey what are ya gonna do.   i paid 16 bucks :\/  The guy gave me pointers on how to stretch out my muscles better and the massage was just fine.  I'll definitely come back here again soon.
