Our go to \"arcade\"  in vegas! this place contains varieties of retro pinball machines, shooting, and old arcade games. THE BEST PART IS THAT 99% OF ALL GAMES ARE ONLY 25CENTS OR 50CENTS TO PLAY! $10 would last us about an hr or so ^~^ we come here every time were in vegas to kill time. Highly recommend this place!
