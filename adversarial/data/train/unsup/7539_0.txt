We stopped in to Dillworth because Starbucks had just about zero seating left. I always prefer to give my bonus to a local company anyway so we thought we would give this a try instead. \n\n\nService was extremely friendly and they were very happy to recommend their favorites ( I had the Creme Brulee and it did not dissapoint)! It was just the right mix of sweet without feeling like I needed a tall glass of water to follow. I was a little bummed because I did not realize they offer $1 coffee after 5pm , and I wasn't told about it till my friend ordered the coffee...oh well, next time. \n\nPricing is pretty much what you expect for a coffee house - my small creme brulee was $3 and change ... they also offered a (small) selection of treats, granola bars I believe. \n\nI can see why people don't camp out here and that's because they close a little early for the late-night or even early-night study\/work crowd- 7PM to be exact (6 on Sundays). I wonder how much business they are losing out on because  the Starbucks in the area is insanely crowded and parking is way easier here. \n\nOverall I'd definitely return but only if I was taking my coffee to-go or was planning on being there during the day.
