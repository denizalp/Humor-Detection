I ended up at Yueh Tung because it supposedly is one of the best Hakka restuarants within Chinatown but I would beg to disagree. Though - the shrimp and eggplant with pork was very tasty the chili chicken was disappointing. Sure, there was chicken and there was chili but there were no fireworks. And the space lacked ambience - there was no music and the lighting was way too bright.
