Because of my spa know-it-all status, people often ask me which spa in town is my favorite. I never directly answer the question because truly, it depends on what you're looking for -- atmosphere, customer service, amenities, treatments, etc. But I'll let you Yelpers in on a little secret. Spa Avania is definitely among my favorites. They've done just about everything in their power to deliver a truly amazing upscale resort spa experience. Once you check in and walk down the short staircase to the locker room, you escape into another world. The women's changing lounge is chock full of amenities and has an absolutely stunning decor where natural woods and stone intermingle to create a calm, sedating vibe. The private men's and women's lounges also each feature a relaxation room with doors that open out onto an outdoor patio area with a bubbling hot tub, cold plunge pool (for the brave) and rainstorm showers. The outdoor co-ed relaxation space has a double-sided fireplace and overlooks the French Celtic mineral pool, lotus pond and sundeck. The treatment rooms have an indoor-outdoor feel and the therapists and aestheticians are superb. The music in the spa changes subtly throughout the day and you can pick your own tunes in the treatment rooms. The separate salon is gorgeous too and hides a special men's suite with a mini bar and flat-screen TV. I won't spoil everything for you but I will wrap with this insider tidbit: As a local, don't be timid about asking for special discounts when you book your appointment. During the summer, the spa slashes their prices for Arizona residents significantly. And currently, at the time of this review, the spa is allowing Arizona residents to buy one 60-minute spa treatment and get the second for 50% off. Pretty sweet and so worth it!
