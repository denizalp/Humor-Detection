Whats a trip to Sin City without a visit at one of the more popular strip clubs.  From Signature at the MGM my squad and I called and had a limo picked us up as I believe entrance is free that way (with one of my other boy taking the car and meeting us there, us splitting his entrance fee).  Once we entered we are greeted by a host as she guided us to a table.  \n\nA couple of strippers quickly walked over and asks if we wanted lap dances.  Being my homie Bao T.'s first time he was eager to have one.  The rest of us politely declined as we watched the stage show.  To be honest, there was maybe really one chick that was pulling out all the stops....everyone else was a snooze.  I asked the hosts what was going on and she informed me that we are a bit too early.  The club doesn't really pop off till really late (da fudge we were there at 8pm, guess it wasn't late enough lol).  I will admit she was right though.  As we were leaving it started to get really packed and lots more girls showed up...well damn perfect timing damnit!!  So we stayed another 20 minutes LOL.\n\nLap dances are 20 a song I believe.  You get a dance on the spot or you can take it to the VIP for 100 (don't ask me how I know, you are not ready).
