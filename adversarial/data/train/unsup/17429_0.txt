The dinner hour was very busy. The first impression was a lot of items on the menu. \n\nThe crab cakes were good but could use salt. The slaw could have used less dill. \n\nWith the exception of 1 stake out of 4 meals all was cooked well.  The meatloaf was over seasoned.  All of our food needed salt badly. \n\nOnce we hit the salt the flavors were very good.  For my wife and I. Steak that needed to be salted was a mistake by the kitchen. We had to salt everything on the plate. \n\nThe restaurant is nice inside. Perhaps a little over lit.
