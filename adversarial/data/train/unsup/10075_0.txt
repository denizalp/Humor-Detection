One of my go to local food joints in Vegas now! I usually stick to the medium size plate that comes with two meat options. I have tried the chicken katsu and teriyaki chicken. Both are tasty and the portions are BIG! You also get to choose two sides including mac salad, kim chee, and edamame. \n\nI've also gotten spicy ahi poke and it's not bad at all. One of the better ones I've tried in Vegas. Nothing will ever come close to poke back home in Hawaii, but this certainly hits the spot when I get the hankering for some local food!
