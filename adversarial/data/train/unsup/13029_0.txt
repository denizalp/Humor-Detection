Number one: there's too many hipsters, too many old people, and not enough cool people.\n\nNumber two: why don't the people cooking food wear hair nets or hats?!\n\nNumber three: what's with the stupid maze like layout? People always looked so confused in there as if they've all forgotten how to walk.\n\nNumber four: the worst part of all, why do all the employees always look like they're way too cool to be nice and smile? Where's the customer service?\n\nNumber five: I don't understand the middle aged bald DJ...\n\nNumber six: I miss the old lux from 2006-2009 when it used to be cool.\n\nThe end.\n\nUPDATE: the tea is now magically terrible; it's basically water with food coloring! And the employees are as rude as ever.
