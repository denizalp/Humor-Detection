What an amazing park in Uptown Charlotte. Big flat grassy areas, a huge fountain, lots of trees and shade, super awesome view of the Charlotte skyline. I've been here and seen yoga and fit classes going on, I've seen kids throwing frisbees and dogs playing fetch. It's a big grassy space and it's absolutely lovely!\n\nThe park is named after Romare Bearden, an artist who was born nearby and then moved to New York where he spent most of his adult life. All sorts of art, from painting to jazz. Enjoy Sea Breeze, https:\/\/youtu.be\/Btcm7ErsEmg. I've seen his art here and there, but will be looking out for more of it going forward.\n\nEnjoy the park!
