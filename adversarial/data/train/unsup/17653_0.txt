I always have a great time with friends when coming to the Tempe Improv. I've never had a complaint about the atmosphere and service. The servers are great, very helpful on specials, and check on you periodically during the show. I was last here this past weekend for Loni Love and had a phenomenal experience. Our server, Daniel, took great care of us, the drinks were great, and the Opening acts and Loni Love gave us so many laughs.  Also, one of the managers checked on us to see how are experience was. I will continue to go to this comedy club. They bring in so much great talent!
