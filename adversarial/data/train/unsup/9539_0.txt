My family and I went here for the first time yesterday (Sunday). Must say, it's a great place to hang out and catch up with old friends and family, especially for Filipinos. \n\nI ordered I think, Hotsilog? (Philippine hotdogs, eggs, with fried rice) and oh my goodness they have balut! (something DT's doesn't have). It definitely made me miss the Philippines. For the first time in 12 years, I tried balut again and well, I wasn't really a big fan of it knowing there's a dead bird inside. My parents told me I used to eat them a lot before but I was young then. I only ate the yellow part though. I also ordered fish balls during happy hour, now THAT was the real deal. I couldn't stop eating it! \n\nAfter we ate, my family sang karaoke, like a usual Filipino would do. Overall, I loved the place and I'm positive my whole family loved it too. We will definitely come back! :)
