We came here to meet up with our Vegas peeps who are regulars here. Right when we entered through the door, we were greeted by the staff. We made our way to the bar and ordered the Moscow Mule. It was delicious and came in a cute copper mug. The bartender was attentive. We also ordered meatball marinara, fried portobello mushrooms, and flatbread with grapes and cheese from the happy hour menu; all were delicious. I would come back for drinks, food, and service.
