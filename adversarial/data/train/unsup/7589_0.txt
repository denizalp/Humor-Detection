It's an all suite hotel with magnificent restaurants, beautiful pools and spa, upscale shops, Sands Expo meeting facilities, theaters, and two casinos The Palazzo (smaller of the two) and sister resort the Venetian.\n\nI travel to Las Vegas on occasion and enjoy staying on the strip, The Palazzo is in my opinion one of the best if not the best, Vegas has to offer, opulent and exquisitely decorated, with a 5 star service to match.\n\nThe suites are lavish and generous in size, 750sf plus, very comfortable beds, rooms are exquisitely decorated, bathrooms with double sinks, Roman tub and enough Italian marble to make Michelangelo jealous, there are 3 tv's, one in the bathroom.\n\nI have always been very pleased with their service and attention to detail, room are very well insulated, you'll notice a lack of obnoxious noise from rowdy neighbors, there is a working desk, with printer, and Ethernet connections, sunken living room with enough space for small meeting or party, and a dining table.\n\nCan't even start describing all the wonderful amenities as there is not enough space to enumerate, however, there is one particular amenity I enjoy the best, 4PM late check out, yes, there is such thing, call it a perk if you like, but what a perk\n\nAt this point I have to burst the bubble, it is a solid 5 star hotel with one flaw, the dreaded wifi is spotty, and some rooms don't get either wifi nor wireless signal. \n\nI know, you are crying, not to worry, take the elevator down, get inline and try not to drool over the counter at one of two Bouchon bakeries, indulge in coffee & pastries, and you will feel better
