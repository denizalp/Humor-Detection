Saw that a new eyebrow threading place opened up near my house, so I went to go check it out.  \n\nEyebrow threading is decently priced at $8.  My first time there, the lady I got did a great job with my eyebrows and really took her time to make sure I was happy.  She even gave me a VIP card that included free upper lip threading with eyebrow threading or a free eyebrow threading with eyebrow tint.  \n\nI used the card for my second time and I felt my experience was rushed, she didn't shape them well, missed hairs, and when I got home, I noticed she even cut me where my arch forms.  \n\nNot sure if it was the VIP card that changed the tone of service.  I mean, why offer a free service if you aren't going to deliver the same as if I was paying for it?  I'll give them another try, but for now, I'm a little weary about the hot and cold service.
