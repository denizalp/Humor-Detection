My husband and I had an AMAZING 32nd anniversary dinner here!  The decor was stunning!  My husband had a free glass of wine, compliments of the YELP check in!  I had sangria and it was wonderful!  We started with bread and the zucchini flower appetizer and absolutely loved it!  I had the crab bucatini and my husband had the bolonaise.  Both were fabulous but the bucatini with the Meyer lemon sauce was the bomb!  We shared the tiramisu in a jar and had chocolate shavings in every bite!  \n\nSIMPLY OVERWHELMED HOW WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL THIS RESTAURANT IS!  Service was spot on!  Great waiter!  \n\nWe will be back in a few months when we have out of state guests to entertain!  Will be sitting in the private room next time with our large party!\n\nGREAT EXPERIENCE!!!!!
