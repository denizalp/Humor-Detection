Despite its cheesy cartoon logo and location in a nice stripmall, The Noodle Man is legit. If you've ever had Taiwanese noodles, this joint is as close as you're going to get in this city. I love the large windows where you can view the noodle-making process. It's almost therapeutic to watch them pull, twist, and hand-stretch the noodles that you'll soon be devouring. \n\nThere are several classic dishes to choose from including some great appetizers to share. I loved the Mongolian beef pancakes (2 for $5, but cut in half) to share. We also tried the pork fried dumplings and the spicy pork wontons. For noodle entrees, I got the B3 shanxi knife sliced noodle soup. The beef brisket was so tender and very flavorful. The thick cut noodles were great and it had just the right amount of spice. But, eat quickly because all of the noodle dishes do soak up a good amount of the soup after a while. All of the noodle dishes were $8 and quite affordable. \n\nThe service was quick and efficient. Our waitress was able to split our bill 6-ways with credit cards. They also offer boba drinks, but I recommend heading over to Brew Tea Bar, which is only a few plazas down Rainbow.
