I've never been to a Wahoos before, so I didn't know what to expect. When you walk in, it's definitely has a California\/Hawaiian vibe with pictures of people snowboarding, surfing, biking, etc. It's one of those places where you go up to the cashier and order, then wait at a table for your food. We were probably staring at the menu for about 5 minutes before ordering because we were a little confused at first. I kind of thought they'd just have something that said FISH TACOS, but they didn't because you pick what filling you want (chicken breast, carnitas, fish, carne asada, shrimp, tofu mushrooms, Banzai veggies). They have starters, tacos, enchiladas, combo plates, bowls, burritos, salads, sandwiches, sides, desserts, and a pretty nice drink list. In fact, one of the first things I noticed was their daily drink specials. On Wednesdays, women get a complimentary Mimosa with any purchase, so of course I brought that to their attention when we ordered our two combo plates (2 taco plate and burrito plate). \n\nOn the way to our table, we stopped to get a fountain drink and noticed they actually had a pretty decent selection of freshly brewed iced tea (Mango, Tropical Green, and Natural Black). Our food came our pretty fast and the first thing we noticed was that the plates came with a LOT of rice. Now that I think of it, this place IS suppose to have a Mexican\/Brazilian\/Asian menu and I can see they executed that with the rice, tofu, tacos, enchiladas, etc. I had one grilled fish taco and one Cajun fish taco. Both had a lot of cabbage and salsa, which made them very fat. I really enjoyed the grilled one. The Cajun taco was a little over seasoned for my taste though. I hardly touched my rice because it seemed a little flavorless to me, so I stuck to the black beans. This was the first time I've ever preferred brown rice over white rice because it had more flavor (I tried some of Don's).\n\nOverall, this is a great place for lunch or even some very late munchies since they're open 24 hours! They also have A LOT of drink specials, which is always a plus.\n\nTips:\n-Join their player's club\n-You should try their Banana margarita and tell me how it tastes\n-Don't just stick to fish tacos because it's in their name. They have lots of other tasty looking menu items\n-Happy hour daily 3-7pm: 1\/2 off draft beer, house wines, well drinks\n\nDrink menu\/Specials (You get links because it's too much to type):\nhttp:\/\/s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/3RJy0RiP82cpc4dUPmlV9w\/l.jpg\nhttp:\/\/s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/ghhyIIRkbPgwBmdQXfYkCQ\/l.jpg\nhttp:\/\/s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/Ow-cjc0t88hRimk7IDNXpA\/l.jpg\nhttp:\/\/s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/QPMkvZ6RHuiQEPFBMxyygA\/l.jpg\nhttp:\/\/s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/1VYWQUj4bn-yWMu4-5WX2A\/l.jpg\n-$5 oak and Coke
