Favorite of my family and my husbands friends. This lil Iraqi restaurant is popular with the Pgh Persian community. Iraqi cusine has some similarities to Persian which other Arab cuisines lack. Overall if your in the mood for pretty decent Iraqi cusine its up there. They occasionally have more pan-Khaleeji dishes as well such as Kabsa. Highly recommend. Decent rice by Iraqi and Persian standards. Hummos is very good as is the bread (nan\/khoobz). I usually get a Vimto on the side. Just wish theyd start having KalehPache available 1x per week for breakfasts...
