I hemmed and hawed over whether Cafe Istanbul was a three-star or a four-star joint, but the belly dancer pushed it over the top. Four stars.\n\nBut let's take a step back. \n\nI don't actually like belly dancing, really. I knew these girls in college who got really into it. They were the kind of girls who wore anklets and gushed about how they had studied abroad in Chee-lay and actually used the term goddess when they weren't talking about salad dressing. I'm from Oregon, so I probably knew dozens of these girls. I am not one of them. \n\nNo, the belly dancing is awesome for an entirely different reason -- it makes my gay friend very uncomfortable. This amuses me to no end. While he tries to avoid eye contact, I smile at the dancer encouragingly, using my best \"come hither\" look. She comes to the table, gyrating just inches from my friend's mortified face. I am gleeful all night. \n\nThey also have food. It's Lebanese, and it's pretty good. In addition to the standard \"stuff in a pita\" fare, they have some interesting dishes -- like a pizza-esque item filled with ground lamb and spices. Yumm. \n\nIn terms of Middle Eastern food on Apache, I prefer both Haji Baba and Tasty Kabob. But I'll definitely be back. Just as soon as I can trick my friend into it.
