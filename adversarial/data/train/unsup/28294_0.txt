It's your typical fried chicken. I got the two piece meal and it was super greasy. I could taste the fried gizzards they make in the oil. The biscuit was Delish and tasted homemade. The mashed potatoes tasted like box potatoes and the gravy was peppery and just plain white gravy. The sweet tea was good. The kids got fries and tenders but they said they rather go to canes . Overall it's a fried chicken place. Staff were nice.
