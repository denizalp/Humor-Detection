This was my first time visiting the newest Burlington Store in North Las Vegas. I figure I wait till it died down a bit....And, Well I Can Say that I have Experienced Better at Other Locations. \n\nThis Store is Pretty Much the same as the Others in Las Vegas. Customer Service could be Better, and this Particular Location did not have as much Selections as the Others!\n\nThere was a Limited Selection of Accessories, Handbags, and Winter Jackets for both Men and Women! Their Shoes were Limited as Well for Both Men and Women! There were Tons of Clothes & Clearance Items on the Racks,Though!\n\nDespite all that, I did Manage to Find a Very Nice CK Peacoat for a Very Good Price! =)\n\nYou ask....Will I Be Back? Sure...I'll give it Another Shot! If not, then I'll just Head to Other Locations!
