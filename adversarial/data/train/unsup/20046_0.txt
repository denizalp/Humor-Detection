Probably 3.5 stars for this place.  There are some negatives.  It is very expensive.  Plus, you can get the signature candy bars elsewhere (Bristol Farms, World Market, etc.) so is a special trip worth the effort.  The chocolate was very good and creative.  Vosges utilizes a lot of different flavors and ingredients you don't see in your standard chocolate stores.  Some don't work (the red fire bar is surprisingly bland), but others were very tasty.\n\nThe cashier was friendly, and she even threw in some free chocolate gifts when I checked out (probably because I was spending way more than I should have been).
