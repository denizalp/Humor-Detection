We had a terrible experience with this company. A kitchen remodel that turned out totally different from our print. No phone call with THEIR changes. Terrible customer service. We had to have some things totally remade to fit our kitchen. They accept no responsibility for any of their mistakes. And, since cabinets were altered because of their mistakes, the warranty is null and void which isn't important to us. Just the fact that they don't stand behind their work bothers us.  Use caution if even thinking about using this company.\nUpdate:  They offered to work with us and it looks like they are trying to make things right. The island will never be like our print but at least they are trying.
