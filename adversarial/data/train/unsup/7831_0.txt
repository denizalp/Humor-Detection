I grabbed a quick lunch here.  Tony will definetely help you get your Greek on.  \n\nMy gyro had nice fresh slices of roma tomato, fresh onions, fresh crisp lettuce and a nice tazhiki\/yogurt sauce.  \n\nTony's is basically a quick lunch or dinner spot, a step above fast food.\n\nCredit card minimum is $10 and single items or platters are all under that so make sure you bring cash if you're ordering for one.\n\nJust look for the \"HAIR GYROS\" sign as you drive down Warm Springs Rd.
