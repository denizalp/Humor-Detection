If you're nice park with lots of walking options the trails and softball fields, baseball fields, trees for the dogs and to take a break and a lake as well. Parking can always be a bit tricky depending on construction and which side of the park you want to be on so I would check it out on google and check out the local construction to see if that might be effective. There are plenty of shops around that you can get a sandwich or grab a bite as well as grab a drink. Also there's a dog park connected so if you have a dog you might want to take it to the south end of the park so they can play a little. I take my dog to the dog park almost daily it's very nice because they have shovels and rakes as well as baggies to pick up the poop. They also have a drinking fountain so you can fill up a bucket for the dog. Also, a small and large size dog park to make it a little bit easier depending on what size your dog is.
