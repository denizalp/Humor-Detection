Talk about surpassing expectations. While the dishes look quite plain, the flavor of the curry was simply amaZEN.\n\nTakoyaki -- 6 deliciously crispy balls filled with firm octopus. The batter was perfectly crispy with just the right amount of tenkasu filling. There were tons of bonito shavings on top to give it that extra seafood flavor.\n\nPork Katsu -- Dark brown curry, mild in taste with just a hint of sweetness. They have custom spice levels 1-10 and to be safe per the waiter's suggestion, I stuck with level 5. Their pork cuts are thin and tender, with a satisfyingly thin layer of crust. \n\nAs one who grew up with Curry House, this place blows them out of the water. Their curry is much thicker with much more depth of flavor. If you're looking for warm comfort food, keep this place in mind!
