I knew it was love at first sight when I heard the troubadours belting out risque lyrics to old standards, but little did I know it was gonna be a train wreck of naughty after that. \n\nYes, I was the idiot who actually had the balls to ask Jimmy the bartender if they had wine, anything but Chardonnay (trust me, if I wasn't driving I would have bellied up for some whiskey and a beer) to which he responded \"well then darling, I have the pink one and some penis gigolo\". \nHe had me at the p word. \n\nThis is just a down and dirty saloon of epic proportions. Very friendly place with locals and tourists alike, folksy singers and a laid back vibe. Its super friendly, the staff is fast and the crowd runs the gamut from post dinner suits to cowboys. Kind of like heaven. \n\nNote to singer: get your blues folks and rock and roll folks straight.....Robert Johnson was a blues man and I don't care how much I've had to drink, not buying your story about him being and influential rock and roll pioneer. Word from the home of the Blues.
