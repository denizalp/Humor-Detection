This is the most warm and welcoming place I've ever taken my dogs to. I've seen Dr. Yach for many years and still can't believe how much time he spends with them. The staff is patient and friendly. I also love that they have a dog side and a cat side in their lobby. \nMy dogs are  members of the family, so when I was looking for a knowledgeable, reliable vet I was referred to West Flamingo Animal Hospital by a good friend. I must say I have ZERO complaints! The staff is super friendly and they genuinely enjoy the animals. Their office is newly remodeled and super clean. Really happy with my dogs vet.   Will never go any where else. This is as good as it gets.
