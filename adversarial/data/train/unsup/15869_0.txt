Hey, West Valley! CoolVybz is the place to be if you want to go Jamaican. OMG, you can't get more authentic than CV. From the warm hospitality and Jamaican Pop to the deep and robustly seasoned meats.\n\nAll entrees come with rice and peas and pickled cabbage. I love how flavorful the rice is and the cool crunch of the cabbage. \n\nI ordered the Brown Stew Chicken as recommended by our warm hostess. The stew is slightly spicy with a sweet and savory tang. The bone-in chicken is well marinated and fall off the bone. Watch out for small bony pieces which come with slow cooking with bone-in chicken. They serve up both white and dark meat.\n\nI finished my meal with a side of fried plantain. They were beautifully caramelized. Yum! May I have another order please.\n\nFull of Jamaican clientele, CV serves up nosh that is soul food. Next time, I am getting oxtail and wings. Meanwhile, I am stuffed yet craving another order of plantains.
