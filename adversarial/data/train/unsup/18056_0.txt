Always sucks rating someplace great that, in all probability, I'll never visit again. Went to Caliente for the second time with my son who recently moved out of Pittsburgh. He loved Caliente and so did I. This is your a-typical dive bar with really good drinks, an excellent beer menu and pizza that's well, to die for. They've actually won national pizza contests, something that is abundantly clear upon your first bite. \n\nService is friendly and attentive with prices that are more than reasonable. I also love the Pittsburgh themed wall murals painted throughout the back room. Hell, I even kind of liked the cramped men's room with partially revealing stall door. \n\nLeaving Pittsburgh this time was bittersweet. I'll miss vising my son there and a few really great places to eat and drink. Of these, Caliente was definitely a favorite. Just wish it wasn't a 7 hour drive away.
