Went to pre-drink here before we headed to the Wynn.  It was a Saturday night and were were able to grab a few seats at center table.  The place is dark, the DJ was pretty good, and our cocktail server was really nice and super fast.  One of the guys we were sitting by gave us a B1G1 card\/coupon so that was a nice little deal.  I ordered one of their specialty cocktails:  Raspberry Lemon Sherbet WITH a Vanilla Foam.  It was super sweet but super YUM!  There's some tables if you want to play too.  Pretty decent bar to hang before heading to the \"fancy\" clubs.
