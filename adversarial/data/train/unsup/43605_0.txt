Been going to this old town restaurant for many years. Always had great bartenders great service and the best margaritas in old town Scottsdale. Every time people come from out of town we go there and I've had company events there spending thousands of dollars. Live 40 minutes away in North Scottsdale and still go there until today. The last two times we've gone there in the last two month we left. Our service was slow and unusual very poor service. One bartender overwhelmed sat at the bar 20 minutes without anybody taking an order. I mentioned it to the girl in the reception area and response was \"oh really?\" must be under new management or no management. Will not return.
