The view was amazing and the DJ was pretty good, but Ghostbar is past it's prime and is in need of a little TLC. We got in for free thanks to a promoter--I would not pay to get in after my experience. \n\nThere were some odd signs and notices posted prior to entering the club which were mildly concerning.  The bouncers frisked our male friend before letting us up as well which made me think this place attracts a rough crowd.\n\nOur free entrance came with a \"complimentary drink\". They wouldn't give us the free drink at the main bar and told us to go to the bar outside for our drink. When we found that bar and ordered the bartender was pretty rude in letting us know we didn't have a choice for the free drink- we ended up with the rum punch drink they gave us (actually pretty good) \n\nThe glass floor made famous on the real world Las Vegas is filthy and looks like it has a crack\/ water trapped inside. A bouncer is always standing right next to it which made me think they weren't confident in the construction.
