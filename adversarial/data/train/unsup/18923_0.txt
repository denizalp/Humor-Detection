So, true story: I always think for some reason this location is on S. Kings. This results in me driving around and actually thinking, did they move the bank? Fail. \n\nThis branch is convenient if you're in the Metropolitan\/Target area just outside of uptown. It's also close to the Farmer's Market, so if you are over there and forgot you need cash here's your savior. \n\nI rarely go inside this location, but the few times I've been in here the workers are all really nice. Granted, I go during off-peak hours, but it's never really busy or a long wait. The ATM is not a drive-thru, so you do have to get out of your car to use it. I'm always super paranoid about this and try to only visit this ATM during business hours. I watch a lot of SVU and I'm pretty sure it's convinced me that I'll be kidnapped one day. \n\nWhoever runs their social media is pretty on point. I checked in here on Yelp during my visit this afternoon and someone Tweeted me back from the Twitter account pretty quickly to thank me for coming in today. Brands, this is how you do it.
