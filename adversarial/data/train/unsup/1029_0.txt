I emailed three t-shirt printing companies within UNLV's vicinity and 3Nuts was the first to respond and coincidentally, was offering the best prices. I ordered twenty-five shirts from 3Nuts for a student organization. The ordering process was seamless. The employees were quick to respond to my e-mails and expertly handled adjustments I made to the original design\/quantity.  For a small logo with 3 colors, the price was $8.81 per shirt. The design came out exactly as it was supposed to it and the order was completed on time. I'll definitely use 3Nuts again for my club's t-shirts needs!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #114
