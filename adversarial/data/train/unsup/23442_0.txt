After shopping around at the Aria Hotel, our stomachs were rumbling and we were in dire need of food. Since Wolfgang Puck had a reputable and popular name, we felt safe coming here to eat. \nWe arrived just as they opened and HH was all day long! Ordering some beers, caprese salad, bruschetta, and pizza, we were stuffed and still had money in our wallet. \nThe decor is nice located right in the middle of the mall with beautiful wood chairs and tables. \nIt was a nice find for a famished family, leaving satisfied and not ripped off.
