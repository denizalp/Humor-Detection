Yes, I had another Groupon and I'm sure glad I did. \n\nI've heard about this place for a while, but I have never ventured over to the Riviera to check it out. We finally made it. I even braved the Riviera parking and lived to tell about it. Hehe.\n\nWe walked into the Queen Vic and were pleasantly surprised by the decor. Nothing like you'd expect for being located in the Riviera. We were seated in a back booth and I think this is where we went wrong. Our server was not very attentive and it took her forever to even notice we were there, despite attempts to get her attention as she wandered by. She finally came to get our drink order. When it was time to order, we again had a hard time locating her. The place wasn't packed, so I really don't know what was taking her so long. She finally took our order and we waited...and waited...and waited. \n\nFinally our food came out, after what seemed quite a bit of time. I ordered the chicken curry pie which was yum yum. My fella got the chicken and mushroom pie and my friend ordered the Cornish Pasty. We all agreed on four stars for the food alone, but I had to drop one for the lousy service. \n\nI have to say, I think the service was an anomoly, since no one else seemed to be having any trouble with service, so I tend to blame our server in particular. \n\nI definitely look forward to trying this place out again. The food was delicious, I'll just be careful not to be seated in this particular server's area. Hopefully I can make it a four star review after my next visit.
