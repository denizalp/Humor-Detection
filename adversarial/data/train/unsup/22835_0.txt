One of my favorite things about living in Vegas is checking out NBA Summer League! Plus, I got to watch my Golden State Warriors take home 2013's championship (perhaps the only championship I'll ever see them win in person in my lifetime haha) 2014 was definitely more packed, especially with the stacked draft that just happened and Lebron announcing his move back to Cleveland, a ton of people had their Lebron Cav jerseys out that they didn't set on fire. To maximize enjoyment, I highly suggest buying tickets at the box office a coupe of days before the event so you aren't left waiting in line and missing out on the action. If you know for sure you are going to want to attend a game on any given day, just buy the tickets ahead of time. This is a great event for kids who get to meet some well-known and up and coming players, but it can be draining if you aren't a true basketball fan. \n\nRant: To the girls attending, wearing their Steph Curry jerseys, trying to look cute, and just walking around hoping to run into an NBA all-star and never actually watching the game, but constantly updating your FB page or IG page saying you are at summer league, please just stay home. \n\nOne thing I really love about this event is the interesting sports fans you get to meet and the conversations you get to have with folks. People come from all over the place to be here since it's such  a great opportunity to see so much great basketball up-close. There's also one guy, who we refer to as \"Farmar jersey\" (he was wearing a Lakers Farmar jersey the first time we saw him), who sits really close to the front at games and calls the game like he's a sportscaster. I've seen him piss off so many people and guys actually want to beat him down because they were so annoyed, but he actually is pretty good at calling the game. I take it as one of the funny\/exciting things about summer league, but just be warned!
