Food and service was very good years ago. To many children working there now. Service is slow and food is way over priced. Theres one waitress with blondish hair that wears it up who is rudest of all. She shakes the bar as she STOMPS past. Her brother used to cook there which surprised me as he was around 18. $40 steak cooked by a kid with no credentials. \n   We ordered Filet at the bar and when it arrived it was rotten. The smell was unmistakable. They took it away with no apology. We had to go elsewhere as that was the last one they had. Still had to pay for the one drink we had before we could go.  For several months we ate there three times a week. Ive watched it go down down down. And wheres the owner? Not there. No wonder. Its being run by children. \nNo thanks. Ill go to Sullys Irish pub. Right across the ally.
