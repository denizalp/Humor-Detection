Finally made it to Mastro's Ocean Club in Vegas, as I always go the my Newport Coast location..\n\nConsistently delicious Mastro's quality and posh interior decor. Stellar service, bomb seafood tower, A5 wagyu was LICK!!!\n\nThe chic architectural design of the spiral dome nest inside The Crystals mall makes this an uniquely edgy location. I luv that it's next to Van Cleef & Arpels, Christian Louboutin, & Fendi. Eat, then shop to the 9s to work it off...\n\nBy the time the ice cream butter cake & choclate cake circulated, I was FBR (full beyond recognition).\n\nOur group was sooo stuffed, we shut down the restaurant and literally popped out of our dresses.\n\nThanks goodness I wasn't wearing one of my Herve Leger dresses, hahaha LOL.
