I can't seem to understand why this place has as many stars as it does because it should have much less!\n\nI visited Angels after searching Yelp for a nail salon near a vacation rental Where I was staying and Angel's had good reviews. It turned out to be quite a disappointment. I went in mainly wanting a pedicure but decided to also get a nail color change. First off, Angel's is expensive compared to the quality of service. The nail polish on my hands chipped off within hours and the nail polish on my toes wouldn't come off at all. Ironically it was the same polish on both hands and toes. The only reason I gave the extra star was because if he massage they give your legs with the pedicure. They even use hot stones. Other than that I would not return and I wouldn't recommend it to locals either.
