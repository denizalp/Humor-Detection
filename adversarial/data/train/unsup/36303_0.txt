Never had a problem with Hollo's in the past and when I come back to Brunswick, I am sure to have the same awesome experiences that I have had way back then.\n\nIf it is paper you crave, it is paper you shall get. They carry any sort of paper products you could imagine from simple construction paper to envelopes and a wide selection of envelopes. Their items if I remember were availabile in bulk size...or singulary. Prices here are some of the best you will find...inexpensive with sales galore. \n\nNot sure there are any other paper stores like Hollo's elsewhere in the U.S.A but I commend this store for delivering a unique paper treat that will leave me cut-free as I journey back to home.
