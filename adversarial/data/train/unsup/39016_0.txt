Went in for lunch.  They have a lot of specials to choose from.  Had the 2 slice special.  Pizza came out nice and hot.  It was cheesy.  Crust was doughy but not too doughy.  And it was crisp but not too hard.  Overall, pretty good slices and I'll be back to try the Sicilian style pizza and the garlic knots.
