I love walking around in this store. The people in it are always super helpful too.  I have not participated in one of their cooking lessons but think that would be fun!\n\nYou can get really great gift ideas here or you might be like me and are looking for something totally different. Last time I was here I was on the lookout for silicone pot holders, which they had. I had seen cute ones made into animals that you put your hands in. Although they had silicone pot holders, they weren't the animal ones, but I still love to browse this store.\n\nLook for the clearance shelves!
