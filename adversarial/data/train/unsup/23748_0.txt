There is nothing world class about the place. The owner is a HUGE FAT COW BEEYATCH and the staff is new about every week because she pays them like crap and treats them even worse.\n\nThe baked goods are mostly miss with a few hits. Nothing terrible, but mostly average at best. They can't even afford to fix their bread slicer which cuts razor thin slices except for about 3 of the saw blades which are broken and therefore you will get double and triple-slices in every loaf.\n\nThe best thing is that you can sit and steal their wireless signal but i'd rather do that at starbucks. Should be renamed World Ass Bakers.
