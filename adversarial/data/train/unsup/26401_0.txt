I was referred to calfo by an online service, and I contacted them next day to make an appointment. On the day of the appointment, I was running late getting home so I gave them a call to let them know that I would be there. The person that I spoke with didn't seem to know that I had scheduled an appointment. They did show up although quite late. After I described the problem, the tech said it sounded like the control board, went downstairs and plugged the fan output into the 120v in line and confirmed that it was. I was then quoted $900 for a control board replacement. I didn't know how much this should cost so I made an appointment. After checking online, the highest price that I was seeing in my area was around $500 for the same job and the replacement part alone was $46. I cancelled the appointment, ordered a board and figured I would install it myself. It was about a 30 minute job. When I cancelled the appointment, they told me that it was $140 for the diagnostic which still seemed a little high, but I said okay that's fine and gave them my credit card info so they could charge me. When I received the bill, they had charged me 149.99 for the diagnostoc plus a circuit board restocking fee of $80. \n\nAll in all, I would say save your money folks. There are much better options.
