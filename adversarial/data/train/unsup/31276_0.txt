Service review only\n\nI'm not commenting on the prices, because it's pretty standard for dealers to charge at least 150% versus independent mechanics. \n\nMy main complaint about this place is the waiting time after dropping off your car. Of all the dealers I've been to, this place easily has the longest wait due to their strange procedure. \n\nI'm used to just dropping off my car where someone will then take my details (At the car itself) and then I'm good to go. However here you have to go inside, then wait to talk to someone and then talk to them for a while. It takes waaaay too much time. And then on top of that you need to wait a really long time for the shuttle too (loaner cars are usually booked well in advance). I've given up on the shuttle and just take a bus now. \n\nOn top of that when I went to change to my winter tires (with an appointment), after I waited about 30min for the shuttle, they told me that the tires weren't in yet so I'd have to return. You'd think they'd check that before confirming the appointment. Or when I arrived. Or at some point while I was waiting. But no. \n\nOverall though they are not too bad... They don't hard sell their services. And it's close to restaurants, ttc buses, and shopping.
