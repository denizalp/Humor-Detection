I now understand why this place offers a Groupon and has 2.5 stars (3 stars too many). \n\nTo start off our night, we had a reservation at 6 pm. Apparently they know how to take a reservation, but have no idea how to honor them. At 6:45, we asked the hostess what was taking so long, instead of being accommodating, she offered attitude. We asked to speak with a manager, but was told no one  was in the restaurant. How on a weekend night, is there not a manager\/supervisor on site? \n\nAn hour after our reservation, we were finally seated, but we waited another 15 before anyone was by to greet us. We asked the hostess if we could get a sling or high chair for our sons car seat and she was confused. My wife changed our son in the restroom, but they do not have proper equipment to do so. Once the waiter took our drink order, it took another 20+ minutes before he came back and took our food order. \n\nWhile we waited and waited for food to be served to us, we watched the hibachi chef from behind having fun with the large group across from us. When he did finally come to our side of the grill, he started with a couple jokes, but then seemed to just want to get out of there. We order a couple NY Steaks and some scallops only to have to have him put it back on the griddle because they were still raw. \n\nLastly, the place was absolutely disgusting. Food everywhere on the floors and even large shards of glass as well. Be careful when setting things on the ground or having little ones around. \n\nAll in all, we will never be back again! A dinner we had reserved for 6 became a 3.5 hour adventure we'd like to never take again.
