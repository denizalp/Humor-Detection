I've been wanting to come here because of the trash can nachos. I'm so glad I did. I came here in part of my birthday celebration. We ordered the caliente margarita, the pineapple habanero, and the trash can nachos with all the meat. They call it the extra trashy. Lol. I'm so glad we didn't order more food. These nachos were spectacular. OMG. Phenomenal. Every bite was loaded. Shrimp, Lobster, Chicken, Carne Asada, Chorizo, and Carnitas. Holy Cow. \n\nOur drinks were amazing. Cilantro was delicious in that margarita.my habanero margarita was delicious. Our server was Adrian and he was wonderful. On top of our table,very welcoming, and just great. Sal, the manager was my fav. Like literally. Kept coming by asking us how everything was. He is awesome. Made our experience even better with his amazing personality. I would definitely be back because of the customer service, food, and Sal. \n\nMake sure you come and enjoy.
