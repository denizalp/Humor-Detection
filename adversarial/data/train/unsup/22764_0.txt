I have to laugh, this place not so great ratings. Greeted at the front area by a chubby  little round face something. I was carrying my alkaline water bottle and she raised her voice I cant bring that in. I tried to explain it was alkaline and she said they serve water at the bar. She got the manager, then metro showed up. Wow all I can say. I am a person that follows rules. I was just wanting to have my water. They got me a glass so I could pour the water in. I took my water bottle to my car.\nWe ate here, food was what I expected, just okay but thats okay. No disappointment. The server was sweet.
