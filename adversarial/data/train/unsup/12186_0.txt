My bf and I decided to be old and go to a pub for St. Patrick's Day NOT in the downtown core. To this end, I have always passed by this pub on my way to the gym, but I was really excited to try it out for the first time.\n\nIt definitely is a local pub. Small, and charming when you first walk in, but the place is actually quite big. On my way to the washroom, there was another huge room with a pool table. I couldn't wait to start celebrating the day by ordering a Guinness. We opted not to get the green beer, however, our kind hostess offered to make a green four leaf clover on the Guinness. Yeah!\n\nFood is your usual pub fare. My bf and I ordered a pound of wings for appetizers, and then moved on to traditional pub food. I really wanted the Bangers and Mash, but opted for the all day breakfast and my bf had the Beef Pie which was nothing special. By the time we left (around 7-pm), the place was very busy but I still saw some empty tables. I really liked the atmosphere of this pub and the service was very homely. They do have a patio outdoors, but not sure if its a \"working\" patio...when we left, only smokers were on the patio area.\n\nThey have lots of beer on tap, plus lots of big tv's to watch any game playing.\n\nDefinitely a pub I will come back too!
