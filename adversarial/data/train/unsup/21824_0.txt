Meh.\n\nThe past few times of contacting this dealership about the car we wanted to order...we were not impressed with this dealership.\n\nThe internet managers need to get their act together because on SEVERAL occasions I called about a certain car and they had either sold the car or the information was incorrect. I asked them why old info was on their website and they said \"I don't know!\". Well isn't that your freaking job?!?!? \n\nOne time my husband and I went in to speak to someone the minute they opened...the front desk tried to get one of the guys out of their offices for over 30! minutes we sat and waited for service. Ridiculous. Like I want to waste half my day waiting on these old crusty salesmen. Maybe they were all late to work?\n\nThe sales guys are unorganized, do not have knowledge of the cars, and seem miserable about life. Two of the internet \"managers\" do not even return calls! \n\nWow. Anyway we called Henderson BMW and my husband bought me a car that day. Sorry about your loss Sahara.\n\nDon't deal with these crusty crabs, call Henderson BMW, don't waste your time.
