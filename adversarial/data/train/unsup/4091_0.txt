I love Angels, the poutine (I believe they call it The Mess), is fantastic, I actually have dreams about eating it, its that great.  We also had the chefs special which was different meats and pickled vegetables, it was also very good!  I can't wait to go back on a Tuesday and have a TV dinner and I'm still waiting to get a homemade pop tart!!  It really has something for everyone, as I don't even drink beer and absolutely love it there!!
