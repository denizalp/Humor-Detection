An overall pleasant experience. At the end of the day I would prefer to walk away with a fabulous product even if the service was just meh. I brought in a wool and recycled cashmere winter coat with a faux fur collar and a sweater, both Ann Taylor Loft, and was sure they were going to cost me a pretty penny.  I was quoted $25 and they ended up charging me $18!  Even if it had cost me $25 that is a very reasonable rate for dry cleaning and especially organic dry cleaning.  I will admit that my heart stopped for a minute when I had to sign a waiver for the fur coat in case anything happened to it - the coat is a loaner from my aunt to take with me to D.C - but to my much grateful surprise it was fine and looks fabulous! I dropped it off yesterday afternoon and was told it would be ready after 5pm today but I found myself in the area at lunchtime and called to see if it was ready. They told me over the phone it was ready but when I walked in said it wasn't. I asked them to check and sure enough it was ready. So, all in all, a worthwile investment.
