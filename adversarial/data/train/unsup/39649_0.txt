Was looking to hire a painting contractor to paint our great room, kitchen and dining room. We had scheduled 3 estimates and KB was the first one. We Instantly felt comfortable with Brian who was not only professional but courteous and gave such a fair quote that we cancelled the other two calls. We decided on the spot to add our master bedroom as well. They showed up on time each day and completed the job in 2 days with excellent results. Couldn't be happier with their work and attention to detail. Besides being happy with the results they also took care to leave the house clean and were a pleasure to have. If I could leave 6 stars I would and would recommend them to anyone
