Stelagtites.\n\nI could make this review just that one word, but I'll explain my night a little more indepth to please the yelp gods. It started at exactly 11:01pm on Friday night, three of the whitest dudes around looking for trouble. After being told there was no cover until 11 (a couple minutes earlier and perhaps 9:58?) and one dollar drafts by the staff, and then waiting in line to get in until 11:01, they tried to charge us a cover. Wait a second, we were just told there wasn't one, and we were in line before 11PM but bouncer mcbouncy over there was doing 35 second ID checks presumably to take longer?\n\nWe ended up paying $12 for the three of us, such a negotiable price that I felt like I was in rocky point at the donkey show. Still though, $1 draft beers, thats all I was looking for. Finally getting into the place, it was dead, with maybe 15 people in there, but at least the bar was empty so we pulled up and ordered our beers. They came in the little dixie cups that the hospital gives you to take your meds with when you dont really want fluids. Ok so it was a little bigger than that, but it was an 8oz disposable plastic cup. I had 5 of them which is 40oz and cost me $5. That was approximately 3 regular beers and would have cost me $6 as bottles were $2 each so it was still kind of a deal. \n\nWe hung out in the back area mostly as they had some nice cushy chairs and the music was a little quieter. I also noticed the abundance obscenely overweight women didn't go back there much, maybe it took too much effort. It was our sanctuary. \n\nOut of nowhere I looked up and saw stelagtites, what the fuck is that all about? They were cut into the ceiling, in lieu of 3 ceiling tiles. Mystified as I was, I was also drunk so I shrugged it off. But looking back, it really was a cheap ass place full of crappy attitudes and tackiness. Yet another bar for kids to shoot each other in.
