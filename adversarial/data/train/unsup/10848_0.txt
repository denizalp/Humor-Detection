Holey mother of awesomeness! I've been here twice now and am just as enthusiastic about the joint as i was the first time ( I didn't review the first time because I had been drinking all day and, well, everything tastes good after that). In my quest to ensure my kids are total foodies like me,  I took my little 5 year old daughter to dinner here. First off, let me tell you that you'll pass the place if you're not careful. It seems small, but is suprisingly roomy. On to the good stuff, er should I say GREAT stuff. The menu is focused, probably 20 items on the menu. They range from tacos to tortas, tamales etc. WE ended up getting 5 tacos (fried fish (2), pastor,lengua and tripa. I also got a Oaxacan hot dog and a horchata. The dog was out of this world. It had beans, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, jalapeno and crema. Killer. The tacos are great too, and only $1.25 which is why I gobbled so many of them. the horchata was BY FAR the best I've ever had. Total damage...only $17!!!!! Say Whaaat????  Just a super awesome place, great service with a super proud owner (I assume, big dude. Nicest big guy in the world). He even let my daughter look in the kitchen!! Go there, now. Drop what you're doing and go. I can't wait to go back to this awesome joint!!
