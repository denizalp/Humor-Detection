We were so excited to stay at the Talking Stick Resort but ended up severely disappointed. I'll keep this review short and (probably not too) sweet. \n\n1. The food is horrible. I'll review the restaurants separately, but we highly recommend avoiding the Black Fig.\n\n2. Dim lighting in the rooms. Good luck finding anything. \n\n3. The place reeks - and I mean reeks - of smoke. The entrance is more Vegas than AZ. Cue slot machines and suffocation. \n\n4. Bed and shower were nothing special.\n\n5. Poor value for the price paid ($$$)\n\n\nThe redeeming points :\n1. I'm too tired to list more negatives. \n\n2. We had a very nice girl at the check-in counter. \n\n3. There's a cool exfoliating soap in the bathroom.\n\n4. That sunrise!!! But you could see that standing on the street.
