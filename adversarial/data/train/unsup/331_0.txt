I am a pizza snob...I had stuft pizza while growing up and the original Round Table Pizza as well - you have to love the Bay Area.\n\nI never found pizza that was comparable to Stuft Pizza in all the places that I lived - okay, aside from Vegas -- there was North Side Nathan's.\n\nThe crust here at Barro's is very close to Stuft Pizza and that is why hubby and I love it so much. It doesn't taste over processed and from a mix. It tastes like it's made there every day - a bonus!\n\nTheir wings are pretty tasty and a bit bigger than we expected, which is a good thing.  :)\n\nWe prefer having them deliver or going to pick up the pizza ourselves. It's clear that it's a very loud place...and I don't do loud places too well. ;) Well, that and I dislike little children running around me trying to beg for food off me.\n\nDefinitely a thumbs up from hubby and myself!\n\nNow if they only had pesto pizza on the menu...
