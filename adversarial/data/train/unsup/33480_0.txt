Have been here once or twice a week since I don't live too far away!\n\nWhile my main favorite is the Pad See Ew, I've also enjoyed the Pineapple Fried Rice and Pad Thai! Everything is made fresh to order! I get a takeout most times and the food comes out in less than 15 minutes.\n\nI usually get a 4 (out of 10) for the Pad See Ew and its just right on the spice! Enough spice to elevate the dish but not spicy to the point that my eyes are watering. I think the only negative to the dish is that for me there is more broccoli compared to noodles. (Might just have been on most recent order, I don't keep track of this all the time.)\n\nI look forward to trying more things from the menu. Thats if I don't break my Pad See Ew habit!
