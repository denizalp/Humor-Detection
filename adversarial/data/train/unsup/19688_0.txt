Yummy!\n\nGot some of their \"Dirty Vegas\" flavored popcorn, its a mix of spicy, sweet, and savory flavors.  So good!  Some are caramel coated, some chocolate, some are hot, i swear one of the flavors is curry too, but somehow they all work together.  Its a party in your mouth.  They make nice gifts to bring back to coworkers.  It was cheaper than the cinnamon sugar bagel chips i usually bring back from Vegas and more innovative and interesting flavors.\n\nThere were many other flavors to choose from but i thought this mix of flavors was the most creative and interesting.  Maybe next time the \"505\" Caramel, red and green hatch chilies, white chocolate, and ground pepper.  How do they come up with these flavors?  Very Willie Wonka-esq!
