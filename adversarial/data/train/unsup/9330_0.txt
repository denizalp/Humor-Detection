For some reason, I can't take this place seriously...I think inside the atmosphere is cliched the wine list is large, but pricey, and the servers seemed to have an attitude. I felt as if I wasn't supposed to be there,  Since it's so \"secretive\" location-wise. We had to ask the burning bush for directions, and then find the key hidden by the singing swordsman,  and the door required a secret word to open. I mean really, just put up a sign, please..this isn't 1920's Prohibition Chicago. \n\nI guess if you want a full Scottsdale experience this is probably a good place to go. I feel like I'm spoiling all the reviews from my fellow yelpers, but I am not a big fan of this place. The food is great, and if you want  a cozy atmosphere, than you'll get it here but  If I could give 2.5 stars, I would....based on the obnoxious factor.  To measure the obnoxious level of any place, multiple the weight of all silicon implants, by the number of face peels, divide that by the number of nose jobs, and square that = obnoxious rating.
