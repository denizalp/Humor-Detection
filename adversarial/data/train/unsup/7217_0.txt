Downhill this location has gone. Nothing like listening to the sounds of what could be a microwave. How could an enchilada be soft yet stale? We've come since the moment they've opened...they're pretty much the reason why I got on the Mexican fare bus. I know, right? I'm from an island where Taco Bell was as Mexican as it gets. Lol. I can say from experience if you go late at night as we would do...it's a hit or miss. Service is iffy too. But hey, if Robertos is your man...by all means. There is a reason I don't own a microwave in my home, and if I'm in a food establishment that uses it especially with me knowing so...eeeeek!\n\nNeedless to say, I know that Taco Bell isn't as Mexican as it gets and have frequented many Mexican restaurants to know. Hahahhaa. And what I also know is, I've got to be super drunk to want to come here because nothing would matter and the food would just be outright delicious. Microwaved and all.\n\nEnjoy!
