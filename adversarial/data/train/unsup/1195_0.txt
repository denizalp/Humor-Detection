My bf& I havent been here in a while so we decided to look at a menu , the girl at the register yells across to us \"YOU ORDER OVER HERE!\" We tell her were looking at the menu first & she looked annoyed. We decided what we want & were waiting at the register while the girl is conversing with her buddies behind the counter ..\n\nSo we order the Matcha ice cream milk tea & i order a medium & he orders a large with both no boba & dudeee our total was 14 dollars for those two drinks!!  it should not be that expensive but anyways\nwhile we were ordering the same girl was STILL talking to the other employees in a different language & she was literally yelling right next to our ears. I like talking to my coworkers too & i like seeing people enjoying their jobs but she was so damn loud & the place was filled with customers & their friends sitting down talking! \nThe employees loud talking drowns all that out & if you want people to sit down in your place it should have that  welcoming vibe.\nCompared to all the other boba businesses around here their customer servie deserves no stars but their tea will always bring me back
