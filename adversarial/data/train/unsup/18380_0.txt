Back home I use to walk into Carolina Herrera just to smell the store!  The scented candles should be on your high-end luxury gift list for sure!\n\nCH perfume which I have is lovely and also makes a nice gift. It's a sophisticated scent with hints of citrus, rose, bergamot, melon, praline and some woodsy notes, cinnamon and leather at the end gives the fragrance that slight edge. I don't use it daily-perfect for those special classy evenings or daytime boardroom scent.\n\nI seem to come here and buy other people nice gifts.  One year I bought my mother in law a gorgeous purple stone ring then I bought my sister a gorgeous CH handbag, which at first she refused...but it didn't take her long to say, \"Thank you!\"\n\nComing here on this trip looking at all the beautiful bags made me think, \"Why didn't I buy myself a purse?\" But with the $600 pricetag...luxury personal spending is not something this mommy can justify!  Somehow it's easier to spend on those I love.\n\nLovely designs and bright colors to choose from.  Scented candles, clothes, shoes all fabulous but designer prices can be intimidating...so wait for a sale!
