Nice clean store!!! I love the displays that look like the target baskets. Those are so cute. Big store with plenty of people working. This location has a small grocery section. \n\nThe self checkout area is quite handy and I liked the $1 or should I say $3-$5 section. It was pretty well stocked. While it's not as big compared to other Target's it still meets the needs of the people. I like that it's in a convenient area with plenty of restaurants around it.
