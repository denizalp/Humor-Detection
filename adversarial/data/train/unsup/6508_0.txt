Taco cravings never stop... even while on vacation, so while in sin city, I had to do a Yelp search for \"best tacos in Las Vegas\" and Tacos El Gordo was at the top of the list. Luckily for me, it was walking distance from our hotel so we moseyed on over. And doubling our luck, it wasn't even crowded (maybe we should have hit the card tables with all this good fortune, but I digress). What's weird is that there are different windows for the different types of tacos. The guy at our (pastor) window was super nice and grabbed us some asada tacos from the guy next to him. But I can't imagine standing in line multiple times for multiple tacos. The pastor tacos were deeeeeelicious, topped with a verde salsa and pineapple. The asada tacos on the other hand, were just meh in my opinion... not a lot of flavor and topped off with a huge dollop of guacamole... and this is coming from a someone who is obsessed with anything avocado. In this case, it just didn't work because it was just as bland as the rest of the taco and made a huge mess. Overall, I would come back for the pastor tacos for sure.
