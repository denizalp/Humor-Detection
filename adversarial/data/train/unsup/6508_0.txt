The Blue Martini Lounge enforces a silly rule that does not allow camouflage t-shirts. However, there are no signs on the wall that says \"No Camouflage Shirts.\" We walked in today and the hostess quickly gets off the phone and prevented us from going any further because my buddy had a camouflage shirt on. I don't get it. What's wrong with a camouflage shirt? Flip flops and sandals are acceptable but not a camouflage shirt? They need to put up signs saying dress code is enforced and be particular about what is acceptable and what is not.
