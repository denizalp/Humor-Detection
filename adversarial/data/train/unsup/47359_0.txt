First experience was a bit disappointing, I had gel mani and pedi. The girl was nice and friendly, took her time and we even had a nice convo but she barely scrubbed my heel and gel mani was bumpy with bubbles! I decided to give this place another chance because their designs seems pretty on point. \n\nDuring my second visit, I came in for just gel mani with design and I had two girls do my nails. One just did the regular gel and another girl took over for designs (and I'm glad she did!). I believe the girl who did my designs name is Erika, it was a little rushed but I was pretty impressed! Overall, this is a nice and clean nail shop. I'll come again for Japanese gel\/designs with Erika.
