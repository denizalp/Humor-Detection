I love to support Hawaiian businesses, but Judd was right on the spot for his review.       Malasada should have a very slight crunch, and soft interior when bitten, not a Andagi-like exterior.     Anyone who had a malasada from Hawaii would understand, this not the way to make them.    I have to admit, the fillings are very good, but  when I'm buying malasada..  I'm buying them for the malasada..not the filling.    I hate saying this, but they need to reformulated their recipe.    Hawaiians need to represent...not to disappoint in the ninth island.
