If you want a quiet night, check this place out. Wifey and I were in town for a \"staycation\" business trip. We decided to stay away from the Strip and chill in Henderson. Our toddler loves Japanese food, so we yelped and found this place. \n\nHidden Gem!\n\nVery authentic Japanese food. At first, we wanted to do Omakase, but they were done for the evening. Instead, we ordered a bunch of other dishes ranging from sashimi, ramen, agashi tofu, fish collar, etc. \n\nSashimi sampler was decent. Super fresh, but it came with the classic sashimi such as salmon, tuna, yellowtail, albacore, etc. I was hoping for something different, but that's just me being a sashimi snob. \n\nThe ramen was cooked at the table. It was was definitely very different from most ramen places. It came in the sweet pork broth, but chef kicked it up a notch by adding scallops and shrimp. He also added the most perfectly cooked cabbage I've ever had. The soup\/broth comes first, then when you are done eating all the goodies, the server will bring the noodles to top you off. Definitely a must get!\n\nAgashi tofu is something wifey always gets at every Japanese restaurant. I was excited to try theirs, since the tofu is made fresh in house. \n\nService was excellent. Restaurant was small, so make reservations. Parking is a breeze. The cost was very reasonable for the quality. We will need to plan ahead in the future and try the Kaiseki. Will be back!
