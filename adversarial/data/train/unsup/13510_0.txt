6-11.   \n\nThat's what this should be called because on weekdays those are the hours it's open.    This is a super convenient place if you're staying at the DoubleTree and they have a ton of food, snacks, drinks available to satisfy nearly every urge.\n\nIt seemed like this one guy was working every time I went in and he was very cool, friendly and professional.  The place is pretty clean, although there is always cheese residue on the nachos machine, which just sort of looks gross.\n\nI can't bump this up to four stars because they do not have seltzer or club soda.  I need my fizzy water and it drives me nuts I can't get it at convenience stores outside of NYC.\n\nBut overall, this place is good.  Thanks for letting me give you the 411 on this 7-11.
