Guy at the deli: \"What are you doing tonight?\"\nMe: \"Netflix and chill.\"\nGuy at the deli: \"By yourself?\"\nMe: \"Yeah, the only meat I want is this turkey reuben.\"\n\nThe meat is that good people. Try the Philadelphian and a side of Bacon Ranch Potato Salad! The gentlemen behind the counter are friendly and helpful when you're trying to decide what to order (but they didn't know that Thirsty Dog is a local brewery in Akron even though they sell it, I forgive them).
