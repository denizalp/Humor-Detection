We've been coming here for our morning coffees for a few weeks now and always love the energy and vibes there. The staff makes an effort to know you and remember your order. My flat white and his americano are always made to perfection. The maple oat scone is delicious. Sometimes they'll cut up pastries and have the samplers up. A nice treat!\n\nThank you for your amazing service and delicious coffee!
