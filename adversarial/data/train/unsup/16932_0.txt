I give this place one star for a manicure I got done four days ago by Jennifer sorry calling her out but damn. (Btw the hair people are great) anyways ok granted I don't have the most beautiful nails LOL and my expectations aren't high when it comes to getting a French tip. But seriously I was shocked at how disappointed I was when leaving this place. \n\nI got a Shellac French tip and if you take a look at the picture I posted:\nNUMBER ONE The French tip isn't even EVEN and\/or smooth... Like its freaken lumpy cos she didn't clean it with a brush. She told me she js holds her breath so her hands don't shake but ....Not that great of a job............. She cleaned my cuticles with great care don't get me wrong, but from a manicurist who has been there for more than five years, i was hoping for a clean French tip. I didn't want to question her technique or interrupt her and be rude about it so here I am writing this review wishing I had said something before I paid $100 for this nonsense. \n\nTWO: It's been like four days and my index finger nail already chipped and I barely even do anything with my left hand. \n\n3: she didn't ask me how thick or thin I wanted the white line and I've been to many places and I've always been asked. She examined my nails for a longass time after telling her I wanted a French tip like it was impossible to do. And yes yes I know they're short but u know wut I was born with short nail beds and sometimes a girl js wants a classy French tip ok. I would've liked it to be a little thicker but lowkey glad I didn't ask cos then it would've been even more noticeable. \n\nAnyways THATS ALL. Just overall very disappointed in the outcome and wish I could've gotten my money back or at least part of it.
