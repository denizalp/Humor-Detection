Wow! What a happy find.  Been awake since 1:30 am flying out of Boston.  Been bouncing around East Coast airports and now I'm here in SC.  Fantastic server recommended a local brew (which I wasn't thrilled about), so I went with a ShockTop.  For breakfast, I had the fried chicken (tenders), on buttermilk biscuits.  You get two w\/3 tenders and a side of home fries.  Sooooo good.  Very reasonable prices too for the airport.  Nice whiskey selection as expected.  You got time, stop in.  I'm sure you'll be happy.
