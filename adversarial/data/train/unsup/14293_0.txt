Tons and tons of beer here. It's pretty much the same format as compared to other one's I'm used to. But this place also has some nice seating outside as well. And for a relatively cool evening in September, the views were much better from the outside.\n\nBesides the views, the beers came a close second. Had 3 different ones on this evening. Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Blueberry, Pyramid Apricot and Papago Orange Blossom. Yah, I wanted to make it a fruit themed beer evening.\n\nFor food, I chose the full rack St. Louis ribs with fries since my co-workers ate all the appetizers. And I was a bit hungry. Yes, this plate is huge, however the meat a bit dry. They did include some extra barbecue sauce, but you definitely needed more. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/RtnTbhWYw4QjKhoTBV37OA?select=DNj4vVlJ1eD9XjT8ZlYGLQ\n\nThey accidentally gave me some beans and corn as well for whatever reason. So they just piled on more food for just one person. It was like a feast. And again the views from the outside was great. It's like a mall here so you see everyone walking by visiting other restaurants or do some shopping here. Plenty of free parking too.
