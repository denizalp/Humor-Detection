I wish I would have read these reviews before ordering my very time sensitive materials. I placed my order on Monday morning and the package was picked up that afternoon (off to a good start). Then they \"attempted\" to deliver the package at 4:28pm, \"but nobody answered the door\". Please note that it was to be delivered to a business that has people working on the loading dock till 9pm. Finally they delivered the package on Tuesday, NOPE. It is now Saturday and still the package cannot be found. They have no proof of delivery, other than the drivers word. Fortunately we have 30+ cameras facing all entry's and after reviewing 4 days of film, the driver has not been seen. Don't bother calling either, you would be better off smacking your head against a wall. Maybe use a ouija board or magic 8 ball for answers. Is the driver invisible, did he dig a tunnel under the building and sneak the package in, maybe he is a ninja or a member of seal team 6? Now after wasting a week of my time, I am forced to place a new order and pick up the package myself. In short, I will never do business with this company or any other company that uses this (cough cough) \"delivery company\".
