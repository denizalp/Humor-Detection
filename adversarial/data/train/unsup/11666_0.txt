This was my first place to pop my pho cherry and will be my last because it is an all-around pleasure to eat at when I get that perpetual itch for Asian cuisine.\n\nWhat I love the most is the atmosphere. It may look tacky and strange outside once being a diner, but inside is a gorgeous purple interior with eastern paintings to emphasize its cultural integrity. \n\nI love their seafood pho here, it's pretty much what I get every time. Other places has added their own unique assortment of the seafood ingredient part but I've always found Lemongrass to be way simpler and always cooked to perfection in the type of fish they put in there, and they hold the boiled eggs thankfully.\n\nI love love love springs rolls! While theirs is a bit on the small side, they give you three that are cut in half which seem to last much longer than rival pho restaurants who only serve two huge ones intact. Because for such a tasty appetizer to cost around $5, it better feel like it never ends! \n\nTheir peanut sauce for the spring rolls is more on the watery side, but they make up for it in so many other ways. Not only is their Jasmine Tea DIVINE, but it's complementary with your meal! I'm somewhat of an iced tea connoisseur and their tea is like liquid candy crack to me.\n\nOn top of it all, their staff is very friendly and patient, making the overall experience relaxed and fulfilling. Emphasis on filling. \n\nAnd so relaxed that even though the cashier woman checking me out had to charge my card twice because she undercharged it the first time, it was absolutely no big deal. Though I must say my face got a little Kermit when she suddenly hissed \"Shit!\" after swiping my card the first time. But that definitely won't be the last time my card is swiped here because it's definitely my new regular spot!
