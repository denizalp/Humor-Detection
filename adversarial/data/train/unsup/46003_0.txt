Why am I so alone in my love for Blue Velvet??? Here's some of the reasons why I will gladly choose it over many other Madison spots for a Saturday night:\n\n1. Great music and space to dance without sweating your butt off. Bring your whole group of friends! \n2. Not overly collegey. Don't get me wrong I love college bars, but sometimes we want something different. \n3. Fun, well priced shots.\n4. You can still have a conversation even with the music. \n5. Usually no line to get in.\n6. Those lights. I love them.\n\nI have friends who think BV is seedy but I disagree. I always have the best time! Definitely a place to go in a large group.
