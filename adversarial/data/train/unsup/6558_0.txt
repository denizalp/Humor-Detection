Big Daddy's Donuts, what a weird and wonderful place. The people who frequent this place at 7 am are a collection of colorful people from the Crafton area. Let's start with the lady who walks in still wearing her robe and slippers, the old man who sits at the counter and complains about everything from his neighbors, the people who park in front of his house, even though he doesn't own a car or drive anymore, and the police who took his chair that was preventing people from parking in front of his house. Actually come to think about it, this is the first donut shop where I've yet to walk in and see a cop. Maybe Crafton police are health conscience. Good collection of donuts and a great cinnamon bun. The coffee is so-so. Funny I normally would pick a family owned business over a chain, but in this instance I choose Dunkin Donuts over Big Daddy's. Two stars for the entertaining customers, you can't get a better show at Heinz Hall!
