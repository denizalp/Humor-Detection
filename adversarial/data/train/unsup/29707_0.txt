Best souvlaki in montreal hands down! And they don't do it by being creative or fancy. The biggest compliment that I can give them is that the food has been exactly the same for 20 years, probably longer, dating back to their first location in laval. There's never a surprise. You get what you expect every single time. Best souvlaki in the montreal area. Don't let the amateurs tell you differently. You can take your Marvins, Village Grec, and Arahova and stick em where the sun don't shine because that's where they belong.
