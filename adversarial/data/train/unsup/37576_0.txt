I was blown away when I went here. This is my first review, and I had to do it because these people are amazing.\n\nI never felt like I ate somewhere where what I was eating was such art and had a lot of passion behind the making of it. They care about what they make. Of course the service is great and the hosts seem very humble about their great product.\n\nI got the veggie stack. There was room for dessert, so I got the vanilla vean custard crepe. I am blown away by how great this place is. I hope they keep up their passion for producing a great product.
