Scary things to me:\nParis Hilton has a career. \nSarah Palin. Really. She's like the new Anita Bryant. \nMy fathers' overgrown eyebrows. Trim, daddy, trim!\nDroves of high schoolers leaving school just as I'm trying to find Barrio Cafe. \n\nSeriously. Like thousands of them. And I couldn't find the damn restaurant. What was I gonna do? Roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, \"Hey, squeeze me fellas, I'm going to a wine tasting at the Barrio Cafe. Y'all know where that is?\" Since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me. \n\nFinally. I found it. And entered. \n\nCute. Cozy. Middle of the day, so empty. Great, vibrant art. And a very attentive and friendly staff. Often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. No ball dropping here.\nI had La Paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. Think Squirt and Patron! And after a couple of these babies I was in el bano squirting out that Patron. Dee lish however. \n\nI ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar. Enchiladas of the Sea for my non Spanish speaking peeps. You know what? It was good. Not great. And the presentation was somewhat messy. I couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). They were lost in the sauce and the cheese. But I devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. My friend had a chickent torta. Big and rustic. Like Janet Reno. She loved it! \n\nI will most definitely be back. Hopefully I will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl I will pick that Barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off. \n\nOh. That's blow my socks off. BTW. Adios for now mi yelpitas!
