Supporting great local small businesses\n\nI have always been a supporter of locally owned small business. So, I am always excited to find new businesses I haven't been to before and Copper Star Coffee was no exception.\n\nUnlike, the chain coffee shops , Copper Star Coffee actually makes you feel welcomed.  The artwork on the walls grabs your attention and gives you something to look at while you wait on some of the  very best coffee you have ever had.  \n\nTrust me, when I say, I love coffee. I am always trying out new coffee spots and Copper Star is serving up some of the very best.  Copper Star has the best Americano, hands down, the perfect mix of rich espresso and a light layer of crema. They also offer a  20 ounce drink sizes, so for the professional coffee drinker.\n\nIn addition, to a large variety of coffee and tea, Copper Star has a delicious display of muffins, brownies, scones, cinnamon rolls, cookies, and breakfast sandwiches. On my next visit I'll be sure to try a few.\n\nIf you're ever in the neighborhood, please check it out\nand unlike that chain coffee shop, this is a local shop and you know you are supporting the local economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.
