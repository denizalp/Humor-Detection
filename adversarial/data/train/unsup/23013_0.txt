Sometimes when you're in Vegas you just have to get away from all the crap that is the STRIP and head downtown.\n**Downtown\nWhere the folks are broke.\nDowntown\nWhere your life's a joke.\nDowntown\nWhen you buy your token,\nyou go\nHome to skid row**\n\nMy friend has been to vegas sooo many times but he never had been to downtown..\n**Downtown\nWhere the cabs don't stop\nDowntown\nWhere the food is slop\nDowntown\nWhere the hop-heads flop\nin the snow\nDown on Skid Row**\n\nSo we headed down there.  If you have been to Hollywood and seen all the knock off weird people who dress up as second rate children's characters (ex. Sponge Bob , Batman..etc)...then you are right at home since its almost the same here.\nThere are some sketchy characters here.........\n\nWe went to the Four Queens Hotel because that was where my friends' parents had gotten married and stayed about 35 years ago and he wanted to check it out.\nIts a decent hotel.   They have blackjack switch!!\nI won $100- here.\nThat alone makes this hotel worth my time!    The dealer was very nice!  \nIts nice to see cheap tables.  $5- blackjack as opposed to $15+ on the strip!
