This place is a disgrace. I have never seen a more disrespectful way to treat the dead. The actual grounds and facility are disgusting. They clearly take no pride in their property. While I'm crying over the loss of my loved one during the memorial, their staff are literally lounging on the furniture next me acting bored out of their mind. Don't get me started on the way they basically dropped the casket into the plot. And forget about them marking the grave. Unless you've paid out thousands of dollars for a headstone they won't even bother to mark the grave. Not until then. The next day I returned to say goodbye to my love, and as I am kneeling at his unmarked grave with dead grass tossed over it, I am watching a lady with a shopping bag steal trinkets off of headstones. Disgusting.
