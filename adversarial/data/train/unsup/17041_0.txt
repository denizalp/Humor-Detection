12.5.13.\n\nThrowback to Thanksgiving vacay...and everytime we hit up downtown Vegas, a stop at Lappert's is a MUST!!\n\nHands down, some of the best ice cream ever with some unique flavors too! If you want the full, Lappert's experience splurge a little for two scoops AND the waffle cone; you won't regret it! (~$7)\n\nFav flavor is the Kona Coffee (I know, generic)...this past time they ran out and had to settle for Kauai Pie?--sort of a coffee rocky road, which I sadly did not enjoy as much as I hoped. I knew I should have gone with the Matcha (green tea)!\n\nI believe they do close a little \"early\" for Vegas time...so make sure you take a break between the gambling to have a treat ;)\n\nYelp 365 Challenge: #338\/365
