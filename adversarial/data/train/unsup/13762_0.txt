ugh.. not impressed.\n\nI absolutely dislike when companies claim \"natural\" and \"safe\" ingredients yet have done no basic research on the ingredients they claim are natural and up the price on their goods for those who don't know enough to do their own research and don't know they're buying the same unsafe products.\n\nOKAY, don't hate me, because I know there are SERIOUS devotees to Lush.  Good for you.  Don't get me wrong, I am willing to spend good money on good products when I have confirmed they are indeed \"good products\".. so I'm not a \"hater\".  I'm just a factualist... if that word even exists.\n\nTake for example their soaps and shampoos and lotions which contain several ingredients that are known to be harmful.. I won't go through those ingredients here as I don't have the space, but I just want to mention it so you are informed of the \"natural\" products your paying a premium for that aren't so natural or safe.  If you want to read more, google search it.... it'll open your eyes.\n\nInteresting to note their website no longer contains a link to their ingredients.. \n\nOkay, so now that I've explained why I give them low stars for advertising quality at a premium when in fact it isn't... I'll comment on the rest of the store and services.  \n\nStars diminish for: Staff personnel were very pushy to me and my sister the whole time.. she never left our side and kept pushing us to try this and that out and even applying samples to us.. we seriously turned around a few times to lose her but she kept coming back... she also didn't even know any answers to the questions we had about the ingredients, so she deferred to her boss who told us that, yes, parabens and SLS was safe and so was FDA food colors in their soaps and shampoos... umm, yeah, obviously any research on that will show you that clearly is not the case.\n\nalright.. now for the good...I do have to admit that they DID have *some* clean and very safe products... a lot of them had simple and natural ingredients that, if you do a query, are not unsafe and used by a lot of pharmaceutical grade naturopathic companies.  THOSE I will buy and will gladly pay for...  they did have some freshly made cleansers they kept in a fridge that had some very raw and natural ingredients... I think I would try those products for sure.
