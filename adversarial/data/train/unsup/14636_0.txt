VEGETARIAN BRUNCH. \nTop three things to love about Zenith:\n1. Out of this world decor\n2. Elaborate veggie dishes\n3. $11.50\n\nI realize to the average bear that might not get you going, but breakfast has a lot of fatty meats in it (sausage, bacon, grits, whathaveyou) and it makes brunch a lot less fun when you don't partake in those items. \n\nEasily a vegetarian brunch could just mean a Comfort Inn Continental Breakfast. This is not the case. The buffet is made of couscous, broccoli salad, vegan cakes... Really 75% of what's going on those tables are raw and clean foods. Super healthy. \n\nI ordered veggie burger. Admittedly I was recovering from a doosie of an evening that my friend group called \"Galentine's Day.\" At any rate, this was just what the doctor ordered. And all those veggies replenished my vitamin supply. \n\nIt's regularly an antique shop from what I gather. It's very over-the-top, dancing on the line of creepy. Millions of angels, a few mannequins, and an oddly placed Santa doll later and you've got the Zenith deco scheme. I dig it. \n\nIt's a hidden gem just off of Carson Street and one worth making a trip to uncover. \n\nP.S. The coffee wasn't amazing, but Big Dog Coffeeshop is just a hop and a slip away to complete your Sunday morning checklist.
