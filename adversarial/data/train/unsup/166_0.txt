Yet another great location for breakfast in the Valley. We decided to give this place a try because there had been so many great reviews about it. I had the Baja Omelet with no bacon.....rosemary potatoes......and multigrain wheat toast. Everything was absolutely delicious. I tried my wife's pancakes and they are the 2nd best pancakes I have ever had.....so all the reviews about the pancakes are dead on they are awesome. We will definitely be back because the service.....food.....and location are perfect. Now be advised they have a lot of organic products here.....homemade items.....and only raw sugar, splenda, and sweet and low for your coffee. That's right no white sugar which was a first for me.....LOL!!!!!! Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!
