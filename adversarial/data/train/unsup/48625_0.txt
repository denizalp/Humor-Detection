I love coming here and I've never had a bad experience at this location. The outdoor seating is not as nice as other locations but usually eat inside anyways.\n\nI go here for the burgers really. They have a vegetarian burger that is great, sometimes I order that even though I'm not vegetarian but usually I get beef. I would avoid getting the gluten free bun though, that is a disaster.\n\nNice environment, a bit loud but fun on a weekend.
