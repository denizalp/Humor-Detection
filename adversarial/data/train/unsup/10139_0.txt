OH MY GOD!!! I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! this is the new hot spot in Vegas. \n\nLines were ridiculously long.. good thing we purchased our tickets in advance and only waited 10mins. \n\nAnyways... this club has a futuristic theme. The pyramid lights that move up and down in the center of the dance floor, the performances, the drapes, the view, the music, people, EVERYTHING!!! its just beautiful and entertaining. Its like you're in a whole new city. i was more focused on the decor than dancing and drinking. I'm very impressed! \n\nLOVE IT!
