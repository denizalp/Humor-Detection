mediocre at best. \n1. we were seated with my ten year old nephew next to a painting of a naked woman. \n2. the waitress didn't bring all the drinks we asked for till the second time around (\"and water\" was a tough one) \n3. when our food finally came out we still hadn't got any silverware so we got to stare at it for a bit. \n4. when we finally got to dig in the cheese was already re-solidifying. kind of like a tv dinner...
