Alright well I will attempt to make this review as Raw as possible, My boss is on this Go Raw kick and decided that we were having Go Raw Cafe for lunch. The menu was put on my desk and I took a close look and needless to say I picked the closest to normal thing I could find on the menu which to me happened to be the house salad. He mentioned they make the salads gigantic so just order a half. \n\nWhen I arrived at the Cafe I walked in and I must admit it smelled a little odd. I put that off that I am used to walking into places that cook the food you are eating and that have a smell of some sort of meat or fryer. Unfortunately I cannot pin point what the smell was. I then ordered the salads, which yes, they were huge. The lady that was working on our salads guaranteed me that I would love it and I would be back. Now, Let me take just a moment and acknowledge that she was very enthusiastic and upbeat when it came to pitching the company, but I wonder if I ordered it to eat in instead of to go, would the pitch had been the same.\n\nLet me just break it down why I am only giving 2 stars. \n\n1. Yes the salad was huge, but sometimes quantity over quality is not a good thing\n\n2. The overwhelming smell was a huge set back for me\n\n3. The salad was overly plain, nothing spectacular\n\nThis place is just not for me and it is one of those places that I think you need to be fully into the Vegan lifestyle to truly appreciate a place like this. I am in not saying that this place all around sucks but I am saying that I will not be back.
