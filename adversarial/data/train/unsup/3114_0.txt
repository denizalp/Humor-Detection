Even though VIP cinemas costs an arm and a leg, I think it's worth it once in awhile. Treat yo'self, ja feel? Ever since the markham cineplex changed, I haven't been in to watch a movie. The upstairs section is so big, with movie theatre priced food and this huge arcade section. The VIP section... damn, I really felt like I was VIP there, like some character in 007. \n\nThe service there was phenomenal, with smiling employees that guided us to wherever we had to go. Let me tell you.. you really do feel like some kind of VIP. (Better be, for the $25+ you're coughing up) The theatre was gorgoeus. Luxurious and comfy seats with soft armrests, boyfriend claimed his seat smelled a hint like B.O. though (I refused to smell it). The female working the theatre was super duper nice and took her time in checking the vegan options for me, which I really appreciate. There were also a lot of options to choose from, which was surprising because I didn't expect it from a movie theatre.\n\nThe movie was comfortable.. despite me spilling the popcorn and desperately trying to clean it.. TWICE.. I really enjoyed it. It's nice drinking beer while watching a movie outside of home. My boyfriend had the pulled pork poutine & he liked it until the bottom, where the fries were dry, free of gravy (which is completely animal-product free btw) and stale. \n\nAt the end, I went to the washroom and holy crap... VIP status there too. Individual rooms within a huge bathroom? Alright, alright.. I can roll with that.\n\nI liked the experience overall and will probably go again! The only thing I was not a fan of is the fact that there is NO TIMEPLAY............... how am I supposed to show off my vast knowledge of random movies if I don't get the chance to?
