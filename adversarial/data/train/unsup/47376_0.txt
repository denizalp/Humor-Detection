Service HORRIBLE...STAY AWAY...Go Across the street to Harolds, or down the street to the Hideaway....Took 45 minutes to get a beer...food never camer. Server RUDE BLONDE. Tried to enjoy my Saturday off with a beer and a salad....NO BUENO!!! Was told that she was busy...I actually waited for my 50cents back on my beer!!!! That is how bad the service was. Asked for the manager was told...We dont know where he is.\nGreat idea, horrible follow through. Hire new staff and manager...NOW!!!
