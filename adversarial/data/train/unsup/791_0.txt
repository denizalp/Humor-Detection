They just don't make water hot enough to scrub off what I experienced here. I'll just settle for cleaning myself with steel wool and Ajax to clean myself this time. With an address with that many 6's, I should have taken that as a sign. \n\n    One of my buddies invited me out for a reunion of the ol' gang from like what? 8th grade?\n\n     I love dive bars as much as the next person but this place was all dive,in fact high dive into the deep end. The service was decent on a slow night and I seem to recall no free pool. Not that would break the deal entirely but definitely makes looking cool a lot easier when leaning with a pool cue. One wall was an orgy of neon lights of domestic beers that about gave me a damn seizure every time I looked over there. \n\ntl;dr No free pool, feels like a tacky midwestern bar (no lounge by any means) and avoid if you have epilepsy.
