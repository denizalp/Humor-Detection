We love the SLS and are staying here for our second time this summer. We usually leave the hotel for dinner, but tonight decided to stay put. Great decision because we wound up at Cleo. Everything was so delicious! We ordered Babaghanoush and Labneh with Feta with veggie sticks. Also the Lamb Shawarma, Longanisa sausage, and Quinoa salad with Roasted Vegetables. My boyfriend who is Lebanese and familiar with real authentic Mediterranean foods said that Cleo tasted like Lebanon to him (that's a great compliment!) \nThank you Cleo, we will be back!!! Your service was great too! All the staff were friendly and nice. Our server was very knowledgeable. It was a great dining experience!!!
