This address is actually for the sugar factory in the miracle mile shops. I see a lot of people reviewing the restaurant sugar factory American brasserie here, I don't know why they would do that.\nThe red velvet cake pop I had here was amazing so moist and good yum.  The service was goofy guy didn't seem to know what he was doing.  The cake pop was $ 2 after tax, I didn't think that was so bad.
