Great location and I like the menu. Just make sure you aren't in a rush since PJ's gives you plenty of time and never are in a hurry to take your order or prepare your food. If you have kids they will enjoy sitting at the table inside the vault. (This was a bank back in the day so they cleverly incorporated the vault into the interior design.)
