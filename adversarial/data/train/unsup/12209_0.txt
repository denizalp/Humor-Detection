Not impressed to say the least.  I don't really understand what the hype is all about.  Forequarter did not live up to expectations!  I started with a house made bottled drink called Paloma (tequila, lime, etc).  Not very tasty.  I've had better margaritas at a crappy Mexican restaurant.  My group also ordered the cheese\/sausage platter, fried shitake mushrooms, buckwheat cavatalli, and scallops.  Mushrooms were decent.  The buckwheat cavatalli and scallops lacked flavor.  Portions are small, prices are high!  I'm ok with that if the quality is there.  This is not that place.  It is unlikely that I will try it again.  \n\nOh, and our waiter made a stink about dividing the check.  Apparently he was above figuring out how much each person owed.  We ended up dividing the check ourselves.  Then, to make it worse, the waiter hovers over you after he swipes your credit card, and waits for your tip and signature.  (They use the Square payment method)
