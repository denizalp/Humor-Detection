I won't be employing their services.  I simply called because I need an estimate from a company that restores smoke damaged items.  My old apartment complex is trying to collect a fine from me for moving out of my apartment before the lease was up, but my apartment was being infiltrated with cigarette smoke and everything I own was damaged.  I tried to work with the apartment complex but they refused.  Obviously I have to prove that my things were damaged and show the cost that it will be to restore them, so I was looking for a company that could give me an estimate.  When I called, I spoke to \"Bob\" (Sunday Feb.22, 2015, a little before 4 pm).  Bob refused to let me tell him what I was looking for and without knowing what I was seeking told me \"We can't help you\" and hung up on me.\n\nI called back and immediately asked what his name was, the voice was the same as the person I spoke with before.  He told me \"Bob\", and I asked if he would hear me out.  I tried to explain that everything I own was damaged by cigarette smoke, he told me I needed to deal with the apartment complex.  I tried to drive through his apparent, thick skull that I didn't live there anymore and was trying to get an estimate to restore my things, he suggested I take them to the dry cleaner, I asked him if he was referring to my couch? He continued to try to dodge my question, which was; can I get an estimate for restoration?  He spouted off random things like \"You need legal advice\", just anything to not answer my GD \"Yes\" or \"No\" question.  My legal advisor told me I need to get estimates on the damages!  I've been through a traumatic experience that has rendered me, an only parent, and my 7 year old daughter homeless, and this guy thinks he needs to be a jerk to me?! Seriously?!\n\nIn the end he referred me to Service Masters.  You should probably go there too.
