This review is for their coffee only. I don't eat much baked good because I'm a vegan, however I love some good coffee. Nova has great beans and a wide selection of fancy caffeinated drinks. After going here for the first time, I have been coming back just about anytime I need a good coffee fix.\n\nThe staff has always been very friendly. The seating is never too crowded, nor is the parking lot. The place smells great. Also, they make one of the best chai lattes in town. Definitely worth checking out if you are a coffee lover.
