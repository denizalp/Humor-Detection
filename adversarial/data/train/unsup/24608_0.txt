Food was excellent, you have to try the pancakes!! You can get them on the side in place of toast, so that is pretty awesome. Their coffee is probably the best I have ever had at a restaurant, so you should try that as well. The food came out super quick which is always a plus. I would highly recommend checking this place out. The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because the hostesses were NOT friendly at all. But, it was early Saturday morning so I guess who could blame them? Anyway overall it is a great breakfast place to hit up if you're in the area.
