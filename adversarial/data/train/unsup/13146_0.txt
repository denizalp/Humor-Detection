I've been here almost for 5 years. My husband bought an engagement ring here and wedding ring too. I like here because they have a lot of refined taste and great design of jewelry and watches.\n\nService is good too. They are always polite and friendly and funny.They make me laugh and very nice.\n\nSadly one point is small stones are come off my rings sometimes, but they can fix in a week always and I can check new great jewelry at that moment by a happy chance.
