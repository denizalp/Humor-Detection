After my usual hair \"stylist\" of 4 years disappeared I was left wandering the pages of Google and Yelp hoping to find something close to work that was good AND cheap. It's located in a plaza that is easy to get to and I always find parking.\n\nI've been here for the past 5 haircuts now, about once a month, and have yet to be disappointed. On my first visit I got Andy, who takes care and time to give you what you're looking for. The place is clean and organized and never felt \"dingy\" even for the rock bottom prices they charge.\n\n2nd time I went I booked an appointment with Tina after reading all the rave reviews and she also gave a great cut. \n\nAfter that I just go and get whom ever is available as both are fully capable of giving a great cut.\n\nBoth Andy and Tina understand English just fine so not to worry if you don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin.\n\nOne tip is call in and book an appointment as they do get busy.
