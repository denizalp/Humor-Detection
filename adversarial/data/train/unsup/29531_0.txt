Pros:\n1. Affordable prices, pay for color on the plates\n2. You choose what you want to eat by looking at it (on the conveyor)\n3. Fun place for kids (and adults)\n4. Lots of variety and constantly being replenished\n5. Lots of parking space.\n\nCons:\n1. It is so busy, you will wait if you have more than 4 people in your group.\n2. For picky eaters and folks who don't know much about sushi, it is difficult to know what the ingredients are just by looking at it.\n3. Definitely not the best sushi place around, but they said they were.\n4. The colors on the plates are not as obvious as they used to be.
