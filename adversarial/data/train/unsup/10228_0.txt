Loco Ahi Poke is made at Loco Patron so l ordered it of course! I was very pleasantly surprised, it was very good. It comes with a spicy slaw, dent greens and cubed ahi.  This was a nice salad for lunch, light and fresh.  Ron had a grilled chicken salad. Dido! It was fresh, well presented and he loved it.  The restaurant was decorated with Halloween theme and even had a Halloween movie rolling.
