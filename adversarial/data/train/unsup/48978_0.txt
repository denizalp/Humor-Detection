I came here twice this autumn, once with a friend and once with my siblings. I got a chicken breast with potatoes and shrimp entree and I got a couple of appetizers with my siblings during happy hour- wonton tacos and beef quesadillas. Food and service were average, I usually don't find Applebee's to be my first choice to dine out at.
