The food was as great as I remember Schlotzsky's being (the location near me sadly closed a long time ago) but the female (no name tag) employee was EXTREMELY rude and glared at us the whole time and only grunted out responses. My friend didn't receive the cup for the drink she ordered and the employee let out a huge dramatic sigh, as if my friend was bothering her by getting what she paid for, as she handed her the cup she forgot to give her in the first place.\n\nThe bathroom in this place is also pretty gross or at least it was that day. Another thing is that although there were a few other patrons in the restaurant it was DEAD SILENT in there the whole time, kind of awkward.\n\nI'd go back but I'd hesitate if she was working and I'd get my food to go next time!
