This is my VERY first \"build your own yogurt place\" and I must admit that I LOVE it!!!!!\n\nI got four different types of yogurt: oreo, vanilla bean, raspberry, and a \"tart\" one with sprinkles and all sorts of other goodies.... it was soooo delicious.\n\nPlus we had a 1\/2 off coupon.  I don't think it gets much better than that!!!!
