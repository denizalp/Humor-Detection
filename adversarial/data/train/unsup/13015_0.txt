a good, clean, safe budget option - I spent 7 nights in this motel in Aug 2015.  The room was very clean as was the lobby. A basic Continental Breakfast is served every morning from 6-10 AM: Eggo waffles, bread, cheerios and frosted flakes, Danishes, small powdered cake donuts, coffee, and orange juice. My room was comfortable, at the end if the second floor facing a line of trees. There is a wetland and wooded area in front of the motel. There are several restaurants within walking distance. My one complaint was that the wi-fi did not work reliably  in my room (222) so I went to the lobby to do work on my computer as wi-fi worked well in the lobby. The mostly Indian hotel staff seemed friendly and customer service oriented. Conveniently located near major highways easy to access Cleveland or Akron from here.
