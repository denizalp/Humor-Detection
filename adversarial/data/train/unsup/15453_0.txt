I would be CAREFUL of the food purchase here, it may ruin you're whole night, now after reading some other bad reviews I understand why. In Vegas for a friends Bday, she wanted wings I wanted pizza and this was down the street and looked decent, so we ordered take out for lunch.\n\nWell the pizza tasted good and the wings were just alright nothing to rave over\n\nNow I'm guessing the wings were just alright, reason being most likely undercooked. Resulting in both me and my friend having food poisoning within hours of eating the only thing we ate that day. \n\nHours later both shitting our guts out, super nauseous and then later in the night puking up everything left in our stomachs, couldn't eat for the rest of the day\n\nWouldn't think so much if it just happened to one of us but to two people at the same exact time? Idk \n\nWell thanks Naked Pizza on paradise
