WHAT THE F*CK.\n\nThe portions here are TINY.  Yes, I know this is an upscale place but still.  You really need two or three entrees to feel full.  Our server said the sides were big enough to share.. not really sure what he was talking about because these were also super tiny.  My seared tuna was literally three little tuna ovals.  I wanted to ask where the rest of it went.\n\nThe menu is very boring also.  There is nothing risky about it.  You would think for such a nice place they would offer something a little more daring.  Nope.\n\nYou can find MUCH better places in Vegas for cheaper.  Hell, the all you can eat buffet was better than this place and half the price.  So yeah, I would not recommend this place.\n\nGot a huge ice cream right after leaving.
