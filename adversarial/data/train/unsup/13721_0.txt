My First and last time. I have been referred to by a friend to check out the shop. Let me tell you, the owner Akbar Sharifi and his wife are the most racial owners I have seen. I am a Jewish descent and this owner went off on me when I have told him that the flowers that purchased are dead and I would like to exchange them or refund them. He started accusing me that I have switched the flower\/ roses with other roses and I trying to pull a quick one. I said: What...? Then he started to verbally abuse me and started mocking my Kippah (Jewish Hat) and started to call us racial slurs about our descent and how cheap we are. Terrible customer service. Stay away from them. I well tell everyone about this experience.
