We were looking for a great drink in an awesome atmosphere.  We found it at The Sparklings. We started with the Amethyst (Violet Colada) and the Citrine (Orange Crush).  This was followed by the Tuna Tartare and Sea Diver Scallops.  These were both excellent choices.  Service was great and food was excellent.
