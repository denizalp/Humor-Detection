This place is a little old school..aka out dated. The pool was on the ghetto side. I wanted to lay out after my massage but no lay down lounge chairs were available nor could fit in the 3 foot perimeter surrounding the pool. I gave it 4 stars because the yoga class and massage were one of the best I've ever had. Services A+, actual salon and amenities C-.
