I enjoy this park! It's very clean, and very beautiful! I've only done the Windcave Trail, and it's an easy-moderate hikes. If you're simply hiking for the scenery, I'd recommend going slow, because the gravel is very slippery. The view is okay, but the shade is the real winner at the end. \n\n*once the main trail ends there are signs posted that say \"hike at your own risk\" stress that! I chose to explore beyond the main trail, and ended up climbing onto a rock that housed a beehive below.... bee's fly faster than you run, trust me.\n\nPlease pick up your dogs' poop!
