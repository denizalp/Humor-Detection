In no way is this place a buffet like it used to be. I completely agree that their new concept is utterly confusing. I heard many people complaining about that while we were there. Whatever consultant told them to go to this format needs to be fired ASAP. Why any business would deliberately shoot themselves in the foot like this is beyond me. I had been to this Sweet Tomatoes numerous times and I have never seen it as empty as it was then (which was noon on a Saturday). The Soup & Salad accross the street from them must be ecstatic.
