I live here and can say that the only two good things of Elysian is location and cosmetics. \n\nFirst and foremost the staff is very friendly but once you get to live at the Elysian you'll understand that the staff are just pretty faces. \n\nCommunication is a BIG issue here! Twice I thought I was getting robbed because the maintenance guy comes in the apartment unexpectedly. Thank God I didn't have a gun at the moment. \n\nThe apartments looks beautiful but that's just the surface because the quality of the appliances are low in comparison with non expensive appliances. \n\nI live on the third floor. It's understandable that it is still in construction state but for the love of peace and quiet I should not have to hear people's foot steps and conversations. In other words sound barrier here is a mythical unicorn. \n\nI have stopped buying furniture because I'm ready to move out. \n\nThings that would make me stay: relocate to a different unit were I can enjoy peace and quiet. People who work nights will understand that. Last but not least better communication between staffs and between staff and residents. \n\nThis place is like having a beautiful boyfriend\/girlfriend that doesn't give you love... lol\n\nLet's update the review... My AC just broke down and the office didn't even know what, when, where, which for solving it.
