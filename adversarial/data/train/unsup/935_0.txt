We choose this facility after the great reviews. My son was cutting his hair after 7 years of growing his long hair. We had asked the stylist that we wanted to keep my sons pony tail, he then proceeded to cut my sons hair with a razor and the hair was all over the floor mixed with the past 2 clients hair on the floor. Very disappointing. He was running behind and was preoccupied during the whole hair cutting process. This was my sons first experience at a facility and it turned out to be a bad one. The cut we asked for was not the cut we received it was a lot shorter on top than the picture. The stylist was a bit of a pompous person if you ask me and I would not recommend them to anyone!
