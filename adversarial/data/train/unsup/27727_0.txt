Passed by many times and this is the first time to try.\n\nThe dim sum is really average.  The wrap for shrimp dumpling is too thick.  Taro dumpling is only warm inside.  Not impressive at all.\n\nThe dining room itself is clean but very horrible in the washroom.  Full of toilet paper on the floor and wet.  An old lady behind me could not tolerant the smell and has to leave!  It is totally not acceptable!\n\nThe price is very similar to other Chinese restaurants in Richmond Hill.  However, in terms of dim sum quality and washroom standard, I don't think I will go back.
