My Bf has been raving about this place since he first went a couple of years ago. We had been meaning to go together, and I'm glad we finally did. I had the most phenomenal cheeseburger of my life from here. I ordered a Simple Susan but it was cooked so perfectly. \n\n I was so overwhelmed (in a good way!) by the menu; everything sounded so unique! The fries on the side were perfectly seasoned, which is always a plus. They had a fun beer list to choose from too. Service was fast and friendly. I'm looking forward to coming back here soon.
