First impressions are key in any situation, and sadly our first impressions of Sunset Station were not good. We reserved a non-smoking room; however, the woman who checked us in insisted that we actually reserved a smoking room. Seeing as how we never reserve smoking rooms because we don't smoke, this did not sit well with us. However, rather than arguing with the woman, we just accepted the room. \n\nThe room smelt like someone smoked in it only a few seconds prior to us walking in. The bed was comfortable, the shower worked, and overall the room was clean, so at least there is that. \n\nFunny story time. Whenever I stay in hotels, I usually get a midnight soda craving. I went to ten different floors of this hotel, and every single vending machine I came across was sold out of EVERYTHING. It's was a little unbelievable. \n\nThe hotel offers a lot of extra amenities, including a bowling alley, movie theater, a gym, and of course a pool. They also have a caf√© that is open twenty-four hours, so if you're looking for something to eat but don't want to shell out the extra cash for room service, you're in luck. That being said, there are no refrigerators in the room, and I overheard that food is not allowed to be brought up to the rooms in general.    \n\nThe hotel does offer added security for those staying in their rooms, in the form of a security guard in the lobby by the elevators. He checks hotel room keys, making sure no one is going up who is not staying there. \n\nThis place has its ups and downs, but if you're looking to have the Las Vegas experience without staying on the strip, this hotel is an option.
