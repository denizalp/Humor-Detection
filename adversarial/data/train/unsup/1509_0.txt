Just like its namesake, this spot is loud, wild and crazy. If you come here before or after a sporting event, it's sure to be jam packed from floor to ceiling. I've seen every type of person here from the out of towner older gentlemen entertaining .... younger ladies.... to families taking down the super gigantic hot dog that Adam Richmond dominated on Man Vs Food to college student drinking the entire bar up before the game. It's a fun atmosphere, the food is generic bar food with the exception of some ginormous food options and overall just an exciting and enthusiastic crowd and seen. This is definitely a spot to keep on the list if you're in Downtown looking for a fun spot to stop into before or after a game.
