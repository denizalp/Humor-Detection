Owen's is hands down my favorite place in Charlotte! Im obsessed!  Best bagels in town with the friendliest staff around and an awesome vibe(& tunes). The bagel sandwhiches go from pretty normal  (bacon, egg, cheese), to create your own, to super creative, with toppings  like crushed Doritos:) Prices are perfect.  And don't sleep on the loaded potato salad\/grits or hashbrowns they are all SO good!
