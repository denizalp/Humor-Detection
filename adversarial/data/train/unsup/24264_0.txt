Growing up as a young geek in the west-side, Excalibur was more then just another small comic-book shop, it was a part of my life on a weekly basis and acted as a home away from home for many of my formative years.\n\nThe owner Robert runs a great store and is hands-down one of the friendliest people I've ever met. If the specific volume or issue you are looking for is not available, he will literally move mountains to help you get your hands on it. The care and service available at Excalibur is leaps and bounds beyond any other store in the city. Great selection of everything from comics, trade paperbacks, collectible card games, figures, and much much more.\n\nIf you find yourself on the west-side of town, and are even remotely interested in anything geek related, mosey on down to Excalibur. You definitely will not be disappointed.
