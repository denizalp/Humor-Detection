Las Vegas Custom Cakes was our choice for our wedding package at Bear's Best last month. They made choosing a flavor and cake design so easy! We had requested a couple vegetarian samples to try for our appointment and the strawberry shortcake was amazing! I am pretty sure that with all of the adrenaline and excitement, I only ate my piece of cake the whole night, which made it all the more memorable!
