PF Chang's ain't bad.  Granted, it's not the best food I've ever had but there is a lot to like about this chain and the food IS of good quality.\n\nI like the following:\n\n1.  The lunch bowls are really inexpensive.  You can get a decent lunch bowl and soup for like 8 bucks ($7.95 to be precise).  That's pretty cheap, man.  I mean, come on.  8 bucks rarely even buys you a 12-pack of beer anymore.\n\n2.  The to-go containers are awesome.  I bicycle around and, to date, no hot soup has spilled down my back.  It snaps together and, VOILA, you're good to go.\n\n3.  Overall, it's pretty fast.  If you work close to a PF Chang's, call a little bit in advance, get it to go and, man, you're set.\n\nSometimes the people who work at this location think too highly of me and don't realize I'm a fatass.  I'll order my food, the lunch deal and sometimes two spring rolls and they'll give me two forks and two fortune cookies (actually I got three fortune cookies today).  They either think I'm ordering for two or that I need two forks to shovel the food into my mouth twice as fast.  If I were ambidextrous, I so would.\n\nCelebrity sighting!  I saw Frankie Muniz outside of this location, too.  I looked at him as he walked by and I was like, \"Is that the kid from Malcolm in the Middle?\"  I cocked my head like a dog who heard a whistle and he looked a little panicked, like he thought, \"Ah shit.  This guy knows who I am.\"  I didn't say anything cause he was with his chick and I had to fart.  \n\nBut, hey, Frankie, that sweaty guy who had to fart used to watch your show when he was in school.
