Lived here for less than a year and every day was awful. Management changed numerous times. It happened so often that it didn't even make sense to make a complaint because a new face would be there the following week (and on cue, each new person would moan about their predecessors and how they screwed everything up, never taking responsibility). \n\nOnline bill pay NEVER worked. Not a single time. We had to mail in checks every month. Even though we always mailed them before the deadline, they would be slow to cash them, then would try to charge us a late fee. This happened, no joke, every single month. \n\nWe complained numerous times but still the late fees came. We never had to pay any, but having to keep on top of it was exhausting. \n\nThey entered our apartment one morning without our permission. \n\nThe gym was being remodeled before we moved in. They promised us it would be 24 hour access, which was one of the big factors for us choosing this complex. Eight months later, the gym still was only open during office hours. \n\nSomeone broke into the mail room, destroying an entire wall of mail boxes. Fortunately, our box was undamaged, but it took them MONTHS to fix it. In the meantime, they refused to take mail for the residents, forcing them to visit the post office. They also refused to fix the lock to the mail room door. It never worked once while we lived there. \n\nA couple of cars were crushed when the standing shelters collapsed in heavy wind.\n\nI could go on, and on, and on. It was truly a foul place. Do not move here.
