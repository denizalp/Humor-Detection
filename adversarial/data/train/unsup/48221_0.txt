The owner came to my house to provide an estimate, so I was pretty confident his estimate would be accurate.  He quoted 3 guys packing and moving, but on the move day, 5 guys (including the owner) showed up.  They hustled the entire day but were very careful with all the furniture.  They hooked up the washer and dryer and frig, moved a frig out to the garage and a washer\/dryer back to my old house.  Very professional.  Definitely recommended.
