I am making it my personal mission never to voluntarily using Coop Cabs again! In a city with no shortage of taxis, not one, not two but three cabs managed to piss me off within a 30 minute!\n\nGather around children, as I tell you the tale of bullshit that had lead to my inevitable rant!\n\nMonday was my office \"Booze Cruise\" and I was on the planning committee. This meant that I had to go to the office and grab all the prizes and decorations for the event and get them down to Yonge and Lakeshore. The task at hand was relatively simple: use a cab to get the stuff from Parkdale to Queens Quay in time to do setup. We have taxi chits for Coop so we ordered three cabs to help us out.\n\n10:45am - two cabs show up and take my co-workers down to the docks with no issues... the third cab we ordered is nowhere to be found.\n\n11:00am- late cab shows off but refuses to backup the cab so we can load the trunk... instead he says I have to bring the stuff to him... after some strong words on my part the cabbie drives off, leaving me stranded.\n\n11:05am- we call another cab.\n\n11:15am- Still waiting for our cab! While waiting, we realize that we may actually need another cab so we hail one passing us by. The cabbie says he won't take us because in his opinion we need a van... we explain that we have another cab on the way for half our load but he just drives away.\n\n11:20am we call Coop to order a second taxi and tell them about our cabbie woes. They apologize and say our cabs will be there soon.\n\n11:45am our cabs show up (finally) and we got to the venue super late! \n\nHonestly I have never had this much trouble with a cab company in my life and unless I ever have to use a taxi chit from work I will NEVER use Co-op again!
