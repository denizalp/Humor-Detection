My friends say Chicken Shack is better, and they're right. This is still pretty good though.\n\nRaising Cane's is a chain featuring fried chicken and various accompanying sides. I've opted out of trying them for a long time despite their convenient locations all over town, but my co-worker ended up with an extra combo after using some sort of buy one get one free offer through their rewards program.\n\n\"The Box\" ($7.19 regular price as best as I can tell via business photos) consists of four chicken tenders, a small order of crinkle-cut fries, a small side of coleslaw, a slice of \"Texas toast\" and a drink.\n\n- The chicken is pretty good and has nice breading, and it's very reminiscent of what you'll find at arenas ir theme parks, perhaps slightly superior because it is purportedly made from chicken that's not frozen. However, they're not as plump and juicy as Chicken Shack's.\n\n- The Cane's Sauce is a flavorful and creamy accompaniment, but the alternatives are scant if any; they simply lack the variety of Chicken Shack.\n\n- The fries are good and taste best when fresh, but they are not anywhere near the spectacular shoestring fries of Chicken Shack.\n\n- The \"Texas toast\" is a buttery piece of bread which is crisped to a golden brown. This and the creamy slaw are lovely and don't have  comparable counterparts in a standard combo order at Chicken Shack, but I don't really need more carbs than the fries, and I'm not desperately in need of slaw with this food.\n\nI would definitely take advantage of special discounts at Raising Cane's or visit for convenience's sake, but they're not quite as enjoyable overall as my favorite local fast casual chicken tenders and fries.
