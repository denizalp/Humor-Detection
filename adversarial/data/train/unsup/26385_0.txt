Went here for lunch with a friend. As a always do before eating is go into the restroom and wash my hands. As I am washing my hands I see a RAT TRAP under or behind the toilet. That killed me. Will never eat here and will be calling the health departments. I wish I would have gotten a picture of that trap.
