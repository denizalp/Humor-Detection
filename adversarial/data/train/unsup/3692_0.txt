Wow...either all these previous reviewers are liars, getting kickbacks, associated with this place or they are numb to good food.\nThis BBQ shack is anything but what I thought it was! It was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, so I thought it had to be good.\nUnfortunately...it is just a make-shift hole in the wall, that is part of a larger ranch style butchering operation in a residential neighborhood.\nThe set up is rediculous too...it gets very crowded in the ordering area.\n\nThe employees were very nice, the prices were ok and the side dishes were right out of a hospital cookbook and the BBQ meats were absolutely tasteless. ZERO FLAVOR!\nNo distinguishable seasonings, on anything!\nThey give it to you in a styrofoam container and you eat outside in a wooden seating\/standing area. They give you plenty but plenty of tasteless food is not BBQ!\nI am sorry if I have offended anyone but the ribs and beef brisket was void of any flavor!\nI can think of 10 BBQ places that are easier to find, more comfortable to enjoy the food and taste like a BBQ joint should.
