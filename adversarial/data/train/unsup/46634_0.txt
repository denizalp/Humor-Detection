I have enjoyed staying here very much. Right in the center of downtown. Plenty of restaurants nearby. Very clean and up to date with furniture. Lobby is nice and the front desk is helpful. Doesn't hurt that there is a Ruth's Chris downstairs. I can hear the plates a sizzling. Beds are comfortable with soft white linens, fluffy feather pillows and great blackout curtains = great sleep. When I ordered things they were sent up to my room quickly and with a friendly attitude. Only thing I wish.. there were more outlets next to the bed. Great job Hilton you didn't disappoint. Thanks for a relaxing 24 hrs.
