This was my first time eating here. It was amazing! While at home we were able to get put on the wait list through yelp, which saved us about half an hour. My family had visited Oregano's before, so they ordered a pepperoni pizza, O'riba pizza, Chipotle Chicken pasta, Spaghetti and Meatballs, Garlic bread, and Calamari. The calamari came out first and it was so crunchy and delicious with the marinara sauce. Next came the garlic bread, and then the pizzas and pastas were brought out. The pizzas were delicious! I enjoyed the thin crust, especially the crunchiness at the end. The pastas were great with cheese, served hot, and both sauces were incredible! I also liked that the Chipotle Chicken pasta came with garlic bread. The service was also amazing. Overall, delicious restaurant, and I will definitely be returning!
