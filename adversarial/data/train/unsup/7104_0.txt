FINALLY a authentic chinese restaurant in South Vegas and believe me this place is POPPIN!!\nDef Recommend making a RESERVATION. They have about 20-25 tables- ranging from 2-8 people, good for big families\nSame owners of Boba Hut and Ohana BBQ- both places have excellent service and quality products. We were probably the least Asian people there and both me and my husband are Asian. Mostly everyone in there was speaking Cantonese. \n\nLive tank- lobster, crab, talapia, eel where you can pick your own \n\nBlack tea- served really hot and not too bitter and UNLIMITED- perfect palate cleanser for all the amazing food you are able to eat \n\nWE ordered (see pics)\n1) 5 spice marinated beef shank- served cold- spice level 1- served with sliced shallots and cilantro - NOT RECOMMENDED- not a lot of flavor\/bland and a lot of fatty pieces with little meat \n2) Egg flower soup- no veggies- VERY BLAND- Not reommended\n3) Curry dungeonous crab with buns- THE BEST FREAKING THING EVER!!!!- I AM ALREADY CRAVING this- curry seems coconut milk based with a delicious earth flavor similar to yellow curry. A whole crab is served to you and the shells with the meat and that flavor is to die for!\n- you can also get this fried, stir fried, or boiled with many flavors. Def recommend the curry way!\n4)Black bean shrimp- normal served with green bell peppers and red onion\n5)Schechawan eggplant- NOT SPICY- which was disappointing, and the eggplant was a little bitter- my hubby loved it\n6)Side Rice- 1$ for large serving of jasmine rice\n7)Dessert-Tapioca red bean soup (Free)- not my cup of tea\n\nOverall the food here is amaZing!! and I will be back esp for that CRAB curry. \nPortions are large and def served family style. A great place for families!
