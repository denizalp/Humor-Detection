Horrible place to eat! Don't go there!!!!! I ordered a plate of fried noodles with different kinds of fish and the fish was so smelly, it was unbearable and impossible to eat! I am sur it was perished and besides, when I asked the waitress if I could switch with another dish because I was not able to support the smell, she refused! First time in a restaurant that I cannot switch and that I have to pay for something I didn't eat. DON'T GO THERE THEY SERVE PERISHED FOOD!
