Horrible communication and service. Dropped my car off at opening then went across the street. The staff asked if I wanted to wait or for them to call me. After an hour and half, went back because it seemed to be taking long. Everyone who was in front of me and one person who was behind me that morning had been serviced. When I inquired about the time I was told it would be another hour and half. What had happened to my guess is they served the people in the lobby but because I did not stay in the lobby they pushed my vehicle back. The manager refused to admit this, though his offer of trying to get me in right away was an admission at best or worst just more horrible service.
