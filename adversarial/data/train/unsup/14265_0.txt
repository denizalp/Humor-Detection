I am a member of L'Occitane.  L'Occitane sends me coupons which I have full intentions using.  Ironically, I visit this store location, but to my dismay, the sales clerk bluntly informed me that L'Occitane Outlets do not accept L'Occitane store coupons.  \"Why?\" I asked . . . The sales clerk replied, \"We are an outlet already selling products below normal price; go to Fashion Show Mall and redeem your coupons there.\"\n\nOk-so I left and drove to Fashion Show Mall . . . whatever!
