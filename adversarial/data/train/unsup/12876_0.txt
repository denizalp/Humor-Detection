Since Hurontario Street can be reviewed, I am sure Highway 7 is worthy of its business listing.  Highway 7 is a major street in the York Region.  I can't tell how long it really is, but all I care is that it takes me from Pickering to Brampton.  \n\nThe fun part is it is a pain to drive on in the far east side, so it becomes a fun road to drive on *fast* at night, using an old car that you could care less.  :-)    \n\nThe pains are so many.  It is constantly congested between Markham and Richmond Hill.  When will the construction after construction end?  It is loaded with police patrol between Leslie to East Beaver Creek Road on weekends, probably because of the pubs, bars, bowling alley around the neighborhood.  Hwy 404 doesn't help either.  I am not drunk driving, but I am forced to be conscious of my driving speed.\n\nAlso, the spa I used to go to can thank Hwy 7 for losing my business.  I could no longer put up with the 40 minutes drive to get to it which is right on Hwy 7.
