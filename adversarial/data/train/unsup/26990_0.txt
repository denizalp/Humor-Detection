Today was our second visit . delicious noodles , steamed dumplings that were perfectly cooked (still had a bit of chewiness to the dough) and wonderful sweet potato pancakes . we also had the lamb skewers which as mentioned by another reviewer are a lesser cut of lamb , lots of fat and gristle but great flavour , lots of cumin and chilies . i love them but my spouse is not a fan . we'll go back for sure , there are still many dishes we want to try on the menu !
