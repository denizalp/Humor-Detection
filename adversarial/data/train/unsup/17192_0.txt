After months of battling Israeli street food cravings and refusing to eat Middle Eastern food in the US, I finally gave in. This place was recommended to me by Israelis, so I figured an Israeli recommendation was the next best thing to eating actual Israeli food again. I was correct.\n\nThe people are super friendly, and they don't give a shiz that the place is a total dive because the food will speak for itself (until you inhale it). It's all made right in front of you, the ingredients are authentic, it's cheap, and everything is slightly too delicious to be considered healthy. I was immediately transported back to the streets of Jerusalem, and all was well in the land of my stomach.\n\nI'd recommend ordering a falafel wrap or a gyro, depending upon your carnivorous inclinations. Both will rock your world. If you're vegan, the falafel has some kind of ranch-tahini thing going on, so just ask them to leave off the ranch bit and you're good to go. Then, ravage your tin foil-wrapped treasure with the passion of a thousand suns.
