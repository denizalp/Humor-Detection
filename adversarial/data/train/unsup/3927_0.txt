Stayed here for just one night, on Memorial Day, before heading out of town to visit 4 National Parks.  I'd put my husband in charge of making our Vegas hotel reservations for this single night, and ultimately he chose Treasure Island because of relatively low rates, the Las Vegas Boulevard strip location, and the fact that this hotel-casino hosts Cirque du Soleil's Mystère.  Mystère was great, by the way!\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised.  The value here is pretty darn good.  Was especially pleased by how clean and modern our room was, and staying on the top floor was another nice surprise.\n\nThe one thing that really bothered me during our quick stay?  The overly perfume-y (vanilla?) smell throughout the ground floor.  Even the thought of it makes my stomach turn a bit.\n\nLet's not forget that Treasure Island, with its big ship outside, features the \"Sirens of TI\" every night (weather permitting), the first show beginning at 7PM.  The show is mildly racy and incredibly corny but is worth seeing for the cool special effects.  Gosh, I still have one of the cheesy songs in my head over a week later!\n\nBang for buck, I'm giving Treasure Island 4 stars.  Anything one can't find within this establishment--better casinos, better dining, better shopping--can be found within a couple blocks on the strip.\n\nSorry, no photos.  It was more important for me to fill my camera's memory card with photos from the National Parks we visited.
