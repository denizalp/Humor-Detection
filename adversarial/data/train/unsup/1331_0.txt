Do you know how on TV shows, when a character sees the love of their life, there is a sudden glow of white light and the sound of angels making that \"ahhhhh\" noise?  That's what happened to me here.\n\nMore practical information:\n- Two tacos make a decent meal.  I recommend the blackened mahi mahi, although I've still not tried one that I didn't like.\n-  Roughly $5 per taco.\n- For those of you who have read older reviews before this one, Seven Lives is no longer a stand inside a building with other restaurants on Augusta - it has a stand-alone location now at 69 Kensington Avenue.  Seating is very limited though.
