Having never been a big fan of that other ramen place in town that everyone seems to love, I was excited to have another option open up just down the street. It took  me a while to get there after they opened, but it was definitely worth the wait. \n\nWe came in around 7 on a Friday and the parking lot was packed. Luckily the restaurant has a good layout and there was plenty of seating. We were greeted warmly, seated and our drink orders were taken swiftly. I ordered the spicy miso ramen. For an extra dollar you get 50% more ramen, so that decision was a no-brainer. \n\nThe food came out quickly and upon first taste I practically did a happy dance. The broth was perfectly seasoned. The flavors were well-developed, flavorful and had juts the right spice level. The noodles were the perfect texture and I slurped my meal happily.\n\nService was solid. Our drinks were refilled regularly and the servers were extremely attentive, always asking if we needed anything else. Definitely a five star experience. I can't wait to go back again soon.
