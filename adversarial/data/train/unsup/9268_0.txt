The woman i corresponded with was so friendly and accommodating! I called with only a week in advance to rent a Rockwall and a bounce house for my son's birthday. She helped me decide on the perfect bounce house, and made the process so easy. \nThey brought the bounce house early to set up, and then brought the Rockwall early too! All the staff was so respectful and kind to my guests and I. Bounce house was clean and kept the kids highly entertained. \n\nI will be using this company for many years to come!
