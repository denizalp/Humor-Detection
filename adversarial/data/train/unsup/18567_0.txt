Mason- Dixon.\n\n  Montreal has been hit by southern BBQ like a red headed step-child but only until Blackstap BBQ opened it's doors, was it being done right. You want authentic, they even run out of meat, like, you know, authentic BBQ joints.\n\n  Low and slow, seasoned to perfection and with a mouth watering, smokey smell. To boot, they even sell beer now. There is nothing bad on that menu. I am, however partial to the pork the brisket and the chili.\n\n  Last but not least, the burnt end poutine. A perfect  combination of 'the south' meets 'La Belle Province'. I hear by nominate it for 'best poutine en ville'\n\nWaka Waka
