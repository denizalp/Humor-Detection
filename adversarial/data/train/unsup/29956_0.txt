My Fiance and I just spent a few days in Vegas and what a great time we had. A friend of ours told us we MUST try Border Grill when they found out we would be staying at The Mandalay Bay Hotel. We are thankful that we listened to the recommendation, what a great place full of ambiance, delicious food and impeccable service. Our servers name was Jessi and boy did she ever make our experience unforgettable. Welcoming us to the restaurant and asking if we have dined with them before. She started us off with a Holiday Margarita and I will be honest I had my doubts about this \"holiday\" drink but boy was she ever correct in her recommendation.\nTo be honest I normally brush off entree specials that are suggested by servers but Jessi described the Mahi Mahi special so well that I could not turn it down. (it may have had something to do with her deep Mid West Accent that sold me but whatever it was I am thrilled I took her suggestion, what a great dish!) My Fiance had the Yucatan Pork (another suggestion of Jessi's) and he could not stop talking about it! \nJessi made us feel as if we were her most important guests, we never had an empty glass, never had a dirty dish sitting in front of us and I personally felt that Jessi anticipated our each and every need.  Being that we live so close and visit Las Vegas quite often we have decided that we will make this our regular spot every time we visit. Way to go Border Grill,with so many options to eat and drink in Vegas you have managed to gain 2 new fans of not only your food and drink but your staff!!!
