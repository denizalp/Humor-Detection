I was torn on this place. I've been 3 times and thought they were good. I really like Bob because he gives great massages when he gives manicures or pedicures. \n\nThe problem is they make big deals out of little things that definitely give me the impression they don't care about their clients. \n\nOne example is they have a punch card for each visit, after 5 visits you get $10 off. Oddly enough, they won't let you combine cards but don't tell you that until they give you a new card. Last trip I started to pull out my punch card when they said \"it's ok\" and gave me another one. This trip they tried to hand me another one and I said \"wait, I have 2 already\". They let me combine today's with one card but only after pushing them to do so. I can't combine the third card because they would \"have to throw it away\". What? Each card had one stamp. The card isn't dented, scratched or bent so why would they have to throw it away? I pointed this out but they said its against the owners policy. \n\nIf the cost of a stupid business card is worth less than my business, why would I continue coming here?  \n\nAlso they advertise a $15 mini mani\/pedi. The price is for each, not combined. Ok fine. Then she proceeds to go on and on about not getting a massage with $15 pedi, only with the $30. Fine w\/me since I was in a hurry and didn't have time for a massage. Her response was to get a little huffy because I didn't buy a $30 pedicure. Seriously? Then don't advertise something you don't want to sell. \n\nSince the initial post, 3 nails broke off. They fixed them without a hassle but I don't want to keep coming back to have nails fixed.\n\nTo put the cream on this debacle sundae, while I'm getting my third nail fixed I hear her asking people to write 5 star reviews because of my review. Here's a crazy concept, how about giving such good service that people WANT, of their own accord, to write you a good review and not because you made them feel sorry for you. \n\nI wont be back. Unfortunate, because I like Bob but I want to at least FEEL my patronage matters. Here, I don't.
