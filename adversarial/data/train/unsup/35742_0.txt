Hole in the wall but usually the ones with the best food. \n\nSo the taste of the lomo saltado is good but the meat was tuff and they were very stingy with it too . They also gave me a small portion of fries. I had to stop at Wendy's for extra which is not ideal. Next time I'll try a different place.
