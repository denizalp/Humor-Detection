This place is absolutely horrible. You never know what you're going to get based on who works there that day. The middle aged Italian woman actually tried to sell me a \"leftover\" pizza after claiming they were unable to make new pizzas. When I asked how long the pizza had been sitting there she said \"no idea\". There are too many other great pizza joints in Akron to waste time with this shady place. They most likely won't be in business very long.
