Davis Home Furnishings was a pleasure to work with!  I went in for 2 sofas for my new home and the Designers Chris and Michelle were so helpful selecting the perfect design to fit my style and space.  The sofas arrived right on time and in perfect condition.  I cannot express my happiness with my entire experience with Davis Home Furnishings.  The delivery even went without a hitch.  Next time I'm in the market for more quality furniture, Davis H.F. is my first choice.
