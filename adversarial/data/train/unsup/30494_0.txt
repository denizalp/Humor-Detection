We were notified that our flight was cancelled 3 hours before our plane was scheduled to departure.  It was cancelled because they didn't receive the aircrafts they were expecting in time... a new set of aircrafts (or some B.S.). We were notified THREE HOURS BEFORE OUR FLIGHT. There was an article posted 1 week and 1 day before our flight about this issue, that stated that they were cancelling flights all the way up to the day before ours was to take off. We were notified THREE HOURS BEFORE OUR FLIGHT.  We did not have enough time, obviously, to get a flight out of Charlotte-Douglas Airport without spending $1K\/person, no rental car company would let us rent a car and leave it in Tampa so we couldn't even get at least a one way back to NC, we lost $$ on an Airbnb we had reserved because we cancelled hours before our reservation (rather than days, which is expected) and no reimbursement whatsoever from Allegiant (except for our flight) for any of the inconvenience they caused us.  All because they waited THREE HOURS BEFORE OUR FLIGHT to tell us it was cancelled. DO NOT FLY THIS AIRLINE - you risk missing your entire trip but still paying for half of it.  Thanks Allegiant, for making my 30th birthday so memorable, I salute you with both middle fingers.
