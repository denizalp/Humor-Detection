What a unique dining experience!\n\nFor my last dinner as a single woman, I made reservations for Rose. Rabbit. Lie. due to all of the positive reviews. Even though we were ~30 minutes late, they were able to honor our reservation and we were sat at a high top table with a good view of the speakeasy portion of the restaurant.\n\nTheir menu is... random. It ranges from caviar tacos to steak stroganoff (my entree of choice) to pho (I had a taste of my girlfriend's and it was bomb!), to chocolate terrarium (it looked too pretty to eat... but we definitely went in). They also had an extensive cocktail menu. The service was friendly throughout our meal.\n\nI really liked the concept of the roaming performers. It made the dinner entertaining and there were many Snapchat worthy moments. The performers also made an effort to stop by each table so everybody is included. Our experience went from singers to tap dancers and several different outfit changes!\n\nThe restaurant itself is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino. I would definitely recommend it for a change in your dining options while you're in Vegas!
