Recommending the Fat Tuesdays inside of the Stratosphere is kind of hard for me. It's the easiest place in the world to get super messed up but that's the whole problem. My last night in Las Vegas was capped off by a few last call drinks made of 151, than the puking started, mass amounts of vile red slime that caked the bathroom floor. Sorry for the graphic description but it was bad, funny and sad. I'm a veteran drinker but this weird little drink stand knocked me down hard with their sugar and Everclear.\n\nThe cherries soaked in 'moonshine' (or so the amazingly awkward bartender said) are brutal. No joking around, they will hurt you. Still, puke and pain aside, Fat Tuesdays is the most amazing chain bar I know of; perfect for tourists and pool rats. Better put, it's like getting drunk at Wendy's, every mall should have one.
