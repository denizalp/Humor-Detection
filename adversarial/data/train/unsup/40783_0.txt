The buffet at Bellagio is excellent.  The big decision was whether we wanted to go to Bellagio or The Wynn's buffet.  Well, we ended up eating at both.  Went to Bellagio on Friday, the 29th of Jan, 2010.  My wife and I enjoyed the sushi, beef carpaccio and the Kobe Sirloin roast.  Service was efficient and courteous.  Our only complaint was the quality of some of the food.  The prime rib and lamb chops (especially) were dry.  Our conclusion was that Bellagio had a better variety, but The Wynn had slightly better quality.  BUT, we ate at Bellagio on a Friday, which is a \"gourmet\" buffet, for an extra $7 over their regular weeknight buffet.  We had The Wynn's regular weeknight buffet on a Sunday.  In all fairness we can't compare The Wynn's gourmet buffet because we didn't have it.  The Wynn's dessert selection was bigger!  We would definitely return to both.
