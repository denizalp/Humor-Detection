How much wich would a which wich wich if a which wich could which wich?\n\nNow that we have that out of the way, let's talk about one of my favorite things: sandwiches. Which wich is a joint that I've visited several times and I have no qualms about. The location is pretty great with it being next to my gym, movie theater and several stores and it's right off the freeway. \nThe sandwiches are well made with a nice courteous staff with no complaints. The prices are fair, there's never too much of a crazy wait. In terms of sandwich hierarchy I'd put it above subway, port of subs and jersey mikes  but below Capriottis, firehouse subs and Jason's deli\nOverall, they're a good sandwich place that doesn't disappoint, but they're more of a \"if you're in the area\" and less of a \"I'm going to make a drive\" type of sandwich place
