Finally had the chance to try this place out... Here are my thoughts...\n\nThe legend says that the portions were humongous and the food is great...  I'm gonna definitely give the portions 2 thumbs up while the food itself is decent.\n\nOur party got the following...\n\nSteak and eggs\nCornbeef\nFried chicken and waffles\nMushroom and swiss burger.\n\nThough that the food was decent perhaps due to the enormous size of the plates, but when I wanted to go back and have the rest, it was already cold...\n\nSteak and eggs were exactly what they are...\nCornbeef is a little on the dry side\nMushroom and swiss burger is slightly salty, but I'm sure it had like 3 lbs of meat on the single patty... crazy!\nThen the fried chicken and waffles, 3 towering sage fried chicken residing over 4 bacon waffles...  Flavor was ok but I didn't know how to deconstructed before engaging....  Yes.. it was that huge!\n\nSo here are the pros and cons...\n\nPros:  \nPortion size!\nBang for your buck!\nRelaxed atmosphere\nGuarantee leftovers\n\nCons: \nSize:  Is too big a problem?\nFlavor, seems to be just like any other breakfast joint\nPrice:  Slightly pricey for those people who have a small appetite, but if you are hungry I'm sure the price will be very reasonable.\n\nWill I go back... I don't think out of the way but if friends wanted to go back and have breakfast together I'll probably make a visit.
