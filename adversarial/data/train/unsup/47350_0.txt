We went on a pretty quiet day.  Much to my surprise, the prices weren't bad at all considering the area, and the prices charged at other places around there.  The food was really good (especially the salsa!). The only thing is that the waitresses were SO SLOW.  Not only with bringing out the food, but with the bringing the check AND with ringing up the check. There were only 3 tables of customers, including the group who was wrapping up as we were leaving.  Anyway, we were hoping to catch a movie, so time was of the essence.  Two stars were subtracted for the odd slowness.  But, I'd go back for the food and salsa.
