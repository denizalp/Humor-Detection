Super friendly and amazingly quaint, little spot on Grand! Great beer and wine list with fantastic service, Corey was a great bartender! We're so happy that something has opened in this area and the art gallery is also a fantastic spot. I have high hopes for this place and advise others to come out to support this local establishment.
