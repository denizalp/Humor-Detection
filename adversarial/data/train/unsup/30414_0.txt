The food, drink and service are all great!  The shrimp on the happy hour menu is so tasty.  The lettuce wraps are better than any I have ever had.  The crisp on the happy hour menu was a good surprise, as it was not greasy and it had a lot of flavor.  There are mahi tacos that are great, too.  This is a comfortable and friendly place, and I look forward to returning.
