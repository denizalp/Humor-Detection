Flies everywhere up front. Seriously, at the bar, there must have been 20-30 buzzing around. Put up some damned flypaper, or get an air screen. Something.\n\nHorrible waitress. She poured my beer till it overflowed, then just let the foam settle, then handed it to me, without topping it off, or wiping the glass.\n\nWe moved to a table, because we didn't want the flies to get in the wings we ordered.\n\nOn the way to our table, the waitress dropped plate, which shattered, causing broken shards of plate to hit me in the face. Seriously. She didn't say a word.\n\nAfter we ate the wings, which were good enough to make me not hate having to give the one star, she came and asked if I wanted more water. I said no, I'm ok. She took my water! It wasn't empty, and I didn't ask her to remove it! WTF?!\n\nAlso, the men's bathroom was in disrepair, and smelled awful. The toilet appeared to be non-functional, there were tools and parts all over the floor, no sign on the door indicating a problem, nothing.\n\nWhat a disaster that whole experience turned out to be! This place is definitely going on my \"Never Return\" list!
