Eton is a funny little place where the women think they are on a mid-west version of The Real Housewives. Too bad its CLEVELAND and not a posh hotspot like Miami or say...ANY OTHER REAL CITY! If you find yourself wading through the masses of bleach blond hair extensions, collagen, augmented breasts, and labels worn from head to toe by the women who frequent the center, and get yourself a table at Paladar, you will enjoy some fairly tasty Latin eats. \n\nWe started with the short rib empanadas, which were delicious. We both really enjoyed the appetizers and drinks (they do make a great mojito). The tacos were good, but I wished they were spicier and had some more flavor. I'd like to come back and try the guac, which I heard is delicious. I don't think I'd wait more than 15-20 minutes for a table, however.
