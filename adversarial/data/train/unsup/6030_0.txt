Horrific, filthy -- mostly empty on Valentine's Day! -- and far from having college kids around drinking beer, it was full of nasty crazy drunks...the kind you would mostly find at passed out in a gutter, or in the City Mission. I mean, the kind who spend the evening screaming \"I'm going to KILL THEM ALL!\"\n\nIt's cheap, but the food part is nearly non-existent. Must just have a menu for \"show\" or because of liquor laws that they must have food. We waited TWO HOURS for two burned burgers on stale buns, no water, no menu, no silverware, no napkins, chipped plates and filthy bathrooms. The few patrons were riled up because their food orders were not being filled, even HOURS after they had ordered (and pre-paid).\n\nAnd yes, it seemed the sole \"cook\" running the frylator and the bartender were drunk, and totally distracted on their cellphones.\n\nIt is BEYOND HORRIBLE, even if the drinks are cheap -- I'm sure about 100 health code violations, nasty drunks, dirty, awful food, non-existent service, sticky tables and floors. Also it was FREEZING COLD.\n\nWeird, because Coventry is a laid back area of grad students and young professionals -- and there are plenty of nice bars and hangouts, including a WInking Lizard just steps away (which were all PACKED on V-day).\n\nWe had a coupon from Restaurant.com, and never heard of this place, and stupidly thought it was an actual pub. NOT.\n\nAvoid, AVOID...AVOID. Also, I am pretty sure this pathetic place is in the last stages before just closing down entirely, from lack of business or health code violations.
