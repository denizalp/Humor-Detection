Have been to see Sandra for three Brazilian waxes and a HARD CORE awesome chemical peel.\n\nYes, waxes can be painful, but ladies, this is as close to painless as it gets! Scale of 1-10 is a 1.5, maybe a 2 in certain spots still holds from my first appointment review.\nI am really picky about salon services and can assure you that Sandra is super detail oriented down to finalizing any strays with a tweezer if necessary. \nNo bumps, no soreness.\nGo see Sandra and you won't hesitate to make this part of your regular beauty routine.\n\nShe also did a great chemical peel on me. I am Mexican and have dark spot sun damage in places.  She evaluated my skin and used her expertise to choose from a variety of chemical peels she has available. \n\nYes, I was red, raw and shiny for about a week after, but then the new, \"baby\" skin came through and my skin has remained clean and really healthy looking since.
