Don't waste your time seeing Dr. Nahkle. He might be knowledgeable but I never saw it. His bedside manner is deplorable. In spite of medical diagnosis, he tells you that your symptoms aren't related and that basically you're a head case. I waited 2 weeks for nothing. Worst experience with a doctor. Period.
