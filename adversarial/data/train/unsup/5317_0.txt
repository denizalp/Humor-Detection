It's like people in Mississauga really don't have much to do. Go on a weekend and you'll feel like you're trying to find parking for a Justin Bieber concert!\n\nAnyway, what's really cool about this mall is, even though it lacks a forever 21, it's attracted some really good stores over the past few years - Coach, Michael Kors, Lacoste, Zara, Express, Hot Topic and a well-needed H&M. You'll never find good sale prices at any of these stores though as their businesses are obviously thriving in Mississauga. Zara Man doesn't even have a discount section. I find that stores at malls like Eaton Centre and Yorkdale have better sale prices. \n\nDisappointments: The new Target is not all that it is made out to be, the pet store lost the dogs and cats, and Club Monaco closed down.\n\nExcitements: The food court is being renovated, The Walmart (lol) and the Bulkbarn, whoop dee doo!
