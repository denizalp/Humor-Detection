Very friendly and very helpful group of people. Let's just put it this way, most vape shops are only after one thing: selling you stuff (kits, e-liquids, cartos, etc...) when it comes to doing that \"extra\" step (like help me build an atomizer) for a customer most if not all fall short. The Lair Vapors however did not disappoint. I was pleasantly surprised at the level of help I received from A.J. and his staff when I first walked in with a un-assembled RSST tank for my Provari that I purchased from another local vape shop. I explained that this was my first genesis style atomizer and needed help setting it up. A.J. (owner) explained that there may not be parts in the store to complete a build but he'll try looking for the parts anyway. A.J. took the time to look for spare parts from all the parts bin to complete the RSST. After gathering the needed parts they began doing the hybrid mod while they allowed me to observe and learn. The RSST came out perfectly built!\n\nDuring my visit, the product selections were low yet still very adequate (it was explained to me that they had a busy week with a rush of customers during Memorial day weekend). Good selection of e-liquid flavors with some flavors that are crazy good! They seem to carry more mechanical mod related products than APV's.\n\nThe store itself is amazingly clean and well organized. There's a bunch of comfortable and inviting couches to just relax and chill, a flat screen with a game console and a table with a chess board game. This along with the great customer service adds to The Lair Vapor Lounge calm and easy going atmosphere. It doesn't try hard to have a \"cool relaxing hangout\" look and feel, it easily achieves it.\n\nOverall, it was a very pleasant experience. it's a no pressure sales environment that immediately makes you feel welcomed. The owners are also very in touch with the vaping community (which is good). Kudos to A.J. and staff for getting it done right!
