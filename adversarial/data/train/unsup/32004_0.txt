I'm surprised this place got such mixed reviews.  I went and all the food we ate was dee-lish.  We took the advice of our wonderful server, Jill (definitely ask for her - she's great!).  She recommended Fire Rock Pale Ale, the Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll, Jewelled Beef Noodles and the Surf and Turf with Vegetable Fried Rice.  Everything was perfectly spiced and sauced; the beef was very tender and veggies were fresh.  It can be a little pricey, but check out their daily specials.  I'll definitely pop in here again!
