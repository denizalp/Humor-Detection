I have had a lot of different waxers at European Wax Center. They tend to come and go. I've been getting waxed for over 10 years and Racquel is the best I have ever had. She took her time, did an amazing job, and never once did the waxing hurt. Not once. That has never happened to me in all my years of getting waxed. Please keep Racquel. She's so good - I'd follow her to any location she worked at.
