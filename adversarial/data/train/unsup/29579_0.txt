OMG what a fun time! Took my 30yr old nephew and his 8 yr old son. They LOVED it. Pay the extra $12 to take you up higher, well worth it. I had so much fun just watching them. Kids as little as 3 to adult kids at heart in there 70s were flying. For the two of them it was $150 ish with a tip to the great staff. They were super friendly, helpful and had great interaction with the flyers and crowd. Very nice facilities and equipment. Well worth such a fun experience they will never forget!
