We have gone to the Season's Buffet at the Silverton many times simply because it was closest to where we were staying at the Oasis RV Resort. We get in and have dinner on Friday. Some nights are more than 3 stars but overall it rounds down. \n\nThey dinner on Friday is called the Harvest Buffet (?) for  $22.99 regular price and $19.99 with the casino rewards card. It's not a bad deal considering you get all you want to drink (milk, soda, coffee, tea), appetizer, soup or salad, entrees and dessert. The thing I like about a buffet is that I can try many things but the bad thing is the quality isn't high. You might find some things you really like but most is just ok. \n\nHarvest buffet means fresh food from whatever season it is (I'm told) with different stations of Soups and Salads, Seafood Station, Carving Station and American, Italian Stations. It was regular food-nothing I could say was seasonal and the Dessert Station seems the same as always-pies, cakes, etc. \n\nWe tried the Polynesian Buffet once but it was right when they first starts it (way back) and I wasn't happy they replaced something we liked. So I don't think I gave it a fair shake-though my husband loved the pork. We will try it again after reading the reviews. I'm not sure why it's more expensive  but it's $23.99 regular price and $21.99 with the rewards card. \n\nSunday from 10am - 3pm they have a Bellini Brunch which is a nice treat for breakfast out. They have the regular breakfast foods with some that are a bit more special. Just the Bellini cocktails make the meal. It was \n$19.99 regular price and $17.99 with the rewards card.\n\nSeafood Night is Thursday (which is odd since I always expect it on a Friday).  It seemed high for what we got at \n$32.99 regular price and $30.99 with the rewards card. The seafood was pretty generic and nothing special for a Las Vegas buffet. \n\nWe have gone on Mondays for the 50+ Buffet Day since we are over 50 and get 50% off a Buffet all day. The small print is is not just for your age. You must have Gold, Platinum or Diamond Silverton Rewards Club card which means playing a lot. Then you have to get a printed coupon from their machine and show a valid photo ID. I don't play that much. My husband qualified for the Golf so he would get half off and mine would be full price. The meal was good for half off but not so great at full price. \n\nWe were a bit disappointed with the buffet. Casinos used to bring you in by offering good buffers at a reasonable or cheap price. Now, the price on some nights is high enough so I expect more.  Considering you get a full meal, it's pretty good.
