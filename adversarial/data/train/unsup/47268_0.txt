Visiting local vapor stores has become a recent habit of mine when I travel.  This past weekend I thought I'd visit Pink Spot Vapors while I was in Vegas.  Girl that assisted me acted as if I was bothering her by asking questions and my wanting to try various flavors.  Perhaps she didn't like helping me nice I wasn't a local.  The juice I got was okay but I certainly wouldn't mail order it but it wasn't bad.  The places attitude towards customers was unimpressive.  Like I say perhaps they don't like dealing with out of towners.
