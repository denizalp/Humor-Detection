I'm not even a member here but I've gone on an extensive tour of it and this place is legit. Why am I not a member? Because it's not close enough to my house. The fees are high for individuals but are decent value for families, which is why other reviewers have seen a lot of youth around. The outdoor pool looks like a resort. The hours are great. The whole facility is very CLEAN. 3 floors. If you're in the area I strongly suggest you take a tour and see it for yourself (just try to avoid weekends). If Lifetime was closer to my house I'd sign up despite the $$$
