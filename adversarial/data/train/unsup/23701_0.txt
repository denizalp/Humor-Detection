There is not much more to say that others have already stated, it would be like beating a dead horse blue, then returning to beat it some more the next morning, because you got so damn tired and passed out the other day from beating the horse...\n\nThat stated, this is likely one of the best Restaurants around! Fresh food, made from scratch, no bull crap fillers, and a menu that changes its face like Micheal Jackson (RIP MJ)..... Simply a pleasure to eat! You will not be sorry for stuffing face here!
