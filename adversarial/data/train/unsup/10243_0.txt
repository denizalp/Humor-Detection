We had been looking for a hearty country type of breakfast place like this for a while now, one the best things is that you get breakfast at any time you walk in, It is very appealing to know you don't have a deadline. Place is small, cozy and practical. \nThe wait is a bit long considering the food is great and eventhough the location is lowkey you still get lots of clientele. \nThis place is always clean the the staff - although busy, are friendly and courteous as well as efficient and patient .  I love the banter between the staff and the regulars.  They will always find time for you even though the place is packed. \nThis is a rare place that does fresh squeezed orange juice.  It is done by a machine, but you can watch the process up-close since the juicer is displayed as soon as you walk in.  Along with a great display case of desserts and treats.\nOverall I fell in love with this place and look forward to coming here for a memorable experience every time.
