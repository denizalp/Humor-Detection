If looking for a great italian restaurant outside the las vegas strip and hotels? Ventano Italian Grill & Seafood is one of the best options in Vegas. You will be surprise but at night the view of the Valley is pretty cool from anywhere in the dining room. If you really want make it romantic and embrace the view they have patio area outside that you can dine. I have been here few times for dinner and other times just hanging out at the bar drinking talking stories with my roommate. Another five star point I really like fact the restaurant has been there for years and has lot of old school Vegas nostalgia. Rat Pack. Italian mobsters\/Italian restaurants. Lol! The dining room is in no way run down it very modern and even the bar area. The bar area with all the booths, the bar counter, and feels old school to me. The bartenders are awesome. Richard is one of the best bartenders in Vegas. Friendly and if your endurance junky the guy can talk stories with you all night. Also learn few training tips along the way. Just like the servers everyone is very attentive too your needs, never empty glass, and makes ones dining experience great one. \n\nMy last visit had the spaghetti bolognese. Awesome. It was nice hearty. The tomato sauce was delicious.What I like the most was the balance between both!!! Nothing worst then have overload of meat or sauce. It was tasty till the last noodle. I have tried the grilled shrimp and scallop on the hot plate. I love the presentation on both. Different. Thinking just shrimp or scallop on hot plate. Both well seasoned and once add fresh lemon juice very much refreshing light dish. \n\nI feel most of the menu is reasonable price. Not doubt cheaper then going to Italian restaurant on the stip. Just wish not on the opposite side of town so could stop by more often. If am on that side of town. Ventano spot would hit up in heartbeat get my italian food on!
