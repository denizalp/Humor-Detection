The Friday Fantasy seafood buffet on Friday night is now $23.99, even for children.  I ate here many times. Price used to be $14.99.\n\nHad to wait half hour in line. the food was VERY DISAPPOINTING now.  The raw oysters are tiny and stale.  They have been open at least a few days. There is no taste left.   The clams are obviously frozen and recooked, had sand in them and tasted bitter. must have been spoiled. The crab legs were small and tasteless. Shrimps were the same way.  \n\nI used to like their roast beef here.  This time the brisket was over cooked or recooked, way overdone with no taste of flavor left in the meat.   The pastas and sauces were uninspiring.\n\nTo order a  $4.75 beer, had to give the waitress so she can go to the bar and get it.  It took close to 20 minuted before she came back, at which time I had eaten over 80% of the meal.\n\nDid not try deserted which there seem much smaller selection than before.\n \nTasteless stale food for high price. i will not be back.
