My family and I have been going to Mona Lisa for 3 years now. I had a terrible infection when my wisdom teeth we coming in. Dr. V and Dr. Menna both took great care of me. They removed the infection and the wisdom teeth without causing further pain. The surgery work Dr. V did couldn't have been better. Never taking our family anywhere else. BEST DENTISTS EVER.
