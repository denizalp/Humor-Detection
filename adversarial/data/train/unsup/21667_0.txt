From the outside, you'd never know that such a nice, authentic Mexican experience awaits you inside this unpretentious little joint situated roughly halfway between Eglinton and Davisville subway stations on Yonge Street.\n\nUpon entering, we were greeted with a warm smile and were told we could seat ourselves - which we did, in a cozy booth, surrounded by Mexican decoration on the walls and even the tabletops.  So far so good - and the delicious aromas emanating from the kitchen plus tasteful Mexican music added to the great first impression this place creates.  Anticipation for the meal was running high by this point.\n\nService was prompt, efficient and very friendly - we had drinks and chips with guacamole within 5 minutes of sitting down.  The guacamole, by the way, was deliciously buttery and arrived in a mortar and pestle - extra bonus points for the nice presentation.\n\nThe menu selections were well thought out, clearly explained and un-fancy - which is exactly right for this kind of place.  We weren't looking for some pretentious chef's interpretation of Mexican - we wanted actual Mexican food!\n\nOrdered the Mole de Pollo - which came quickly if simply presented (but again, not complaining - nice and simple does it when the food tastes this good).  The portion size, while initially looking a bit small, turned out to be exactly right: the chicken came with a small salad, refried beans and - the only knock against this place - some Uncle Bens-ish looking rice.  Still, the combination of flavours was great, so really, thumbs up.\n\nThe bill was maybe a tiny bit expensive (dinner for 2 with 2 soft drinks & 1 beer was $53), but the place reminded me so fondly of my time exploring Mexico (the non-touristy parts) that I didn't mind forking over the dough.\n\nYou know when you sit down to dine somewhere new and everything goes so right that you know as soon as you get home you're going to Yelp the shit out of that place because you want everyone to know how awesome it was?  Well, I just got home from Mariachi's and here I am.  And I can't wait to go back.\n\nPS There's TWO patios - one out front on Yonge and a secret one in back...
