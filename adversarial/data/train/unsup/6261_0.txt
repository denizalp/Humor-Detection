Hired them to come snake a slow drain a while ago. Arizona is hot but the man smelled horrible, like extreme body odor, cigarettes and bad breath. He walked through our carpeted home with his dirty shoes on, walked all over my bath mats before I could move them (and obviously did not move them himself or put on shoe covers like most nice companies do). He then tried to say that the drain could not be snaked and the flooring needed to be pulled up with extensive plumbing repair ($$$). When we told him we would have to think about it and it was not something we could do today, he was suddenly able to pull up the clog and solve the problem. I do not trust this company and would never hire them again. I feel bad for the innocent people who are tricked into their upselling, scheming ways. Yes people write bad reviews when they are upset, but there is a reason there are mostly bad reviews on here.
