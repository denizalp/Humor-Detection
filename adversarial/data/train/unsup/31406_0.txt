I am very unhappy with the service we received at the hound huddle, we have a puppy and we were told that she has too much energy and we shouldn't bring her anymore. I think that is very unprofessional and rude. You run a doggy daycare, you should be able to take puppies who have a lot of energy. I will not go back
