OMG KoMex! Korean-Mexican fusion? Genius! KoMex is quite a ways from my house but their food's so good I don't mind driving half way across town for it. The restaurant is a little small and the decor is just regular, but that's not important. The food is what's important. They offer chips with salsa and FRESH guacamole to snack on while you wait for your order. I'm a big fan of carne asada fries so when I tried their bulgogi fries it was just heaven on earth. It is the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. The bulgogi burrito is also very good but I rather prefer their fries. Every one needs to try this place, it's inexpensive and it's just really that good!
