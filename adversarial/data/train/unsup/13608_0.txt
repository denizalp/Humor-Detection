The person taking our order looked like and spoke as if she hated her job. She said she was unable to use the mango flavor dole whip for a float. She was also unable to sell the pricier pineapple souvenir cup. There were also no spoons available. I ate my dole whip with a straw. I would give one star but maybe this was just an off day? I had a very confusing time however it was kind of funny. My group and I had a good laugh because of the horrid service and the food was regular which is better than bad so two stars for you. \n\nAlso, there's a blue bell sticker by the ice cream display.
