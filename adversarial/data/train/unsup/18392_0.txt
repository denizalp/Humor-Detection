I went in for a simple trim. They get an extra star for offering me water.\n\nIf you're Asian and used to getting your haircuts with Asian styling - AVOID AT ALL COSTS.\n\nThis lady cut off 1 1\/2 more inches that was necessary because she didn't know what layers was for Asian hair. By the time I got to tying up my hair I'd realized the hair cut was as if she was just chopping it off for a donation to Locks of Love.\n\nI had to go to Beauty2Beauty to get it fixed.\n\nThey have a nice atmosphere in the salon and would encourage everyone who doesn't care for the style of cutting to go - but ASIAN FEMALES, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
