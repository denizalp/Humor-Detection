Choose your own raw ingredients such as meats, veggies, spices, sauces and starch from a buffet style setting to fill your bowl. They cook it on this large round grill for you and deliver it to your table. Oh my goodness, was it ever delicious!!!  \n\nWe had a restaurant like this in Stone Mountain GA back in the '70's that we would go to at the corner of Rays Rd and Memorial Drive called Kubla Khans Mongolian BBQ. I had always missed it and wished that I could find another one.  Here it is!!! \nThe service was fantastic. The staff was happy and singing together. \n\nTry the raspberry basil limeade. It is wonderful. The unique cookie butter filled wontons for dessert are to die for with the chocolate drizzled on them and standing up in vanilla ice cream. Awesome!!!\n\nHoly smokes this place is good.
