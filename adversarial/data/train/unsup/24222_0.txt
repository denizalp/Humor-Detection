With all honesty the first time I came here I got very good service with a guy that works here I got my food he told me which one was better tasting with good quality and good proteins and he gave me what I wanted it was really good and he also offered me a cup of water which I really respected and liked the place I respected the hospitality and I expected the next time I come around it would be the same respect but I just walked in here today and I got the same thing but this time a girl was working and she never asked me if I would like a cup of water or anything so I went to her and ask her if I can have a cup of water and she said no we cannot do that I wish she gave gave me a cup of water because I really like this place but now I am never going to recommend this place to anybody they should start giving free water cups because I'm paying for an expensive plates
