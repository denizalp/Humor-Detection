Came here after reading a couple of reviews raving about their fried chicken. Drove over 45 minutes just to get here. Yes, I had a mega urge for fried chicken that day. \nI had known by reading the reviews that there's at least 20 minutes wait for their fried chicken. I was too lazy and stupid to call in before so I ended up waiting over 30 minutes in this unairconditioned tiny store for my fried chicken, gizzards and liver. (There are some sealing fans so wasn't that bad.)\nThe guy that took my order was very nice. He warned me there was going to be 20 to 30 minutes wait. (Yeah, I know. My bad.)\nWhen my food came out, I was so exited I had to taste a few pieces of gizzards and liver before I headed back to home. Mmmm, they were so good!! They were coated with some kind of peppery tasty seasoning. They were deep fried but it didn't taste greasy at all. I especially loved their gizzards. They were so addicting I finished the whole container off. (I couldn't eat anything for 24 hours after this.) Can't believe they are only $3.29 each family size.\nThe fried chicken was also very tasty. It had different coating than gizzards' and liver's. It was worth the wait and the long drive. Definitely hit the spot. Thanks to the Yelpers for great reviews :-)\nGreat fried chicken shack in the hood. I will stop by here again if I'm in the neighborhood but I would not come here myself at night. Next to a liquor store.
