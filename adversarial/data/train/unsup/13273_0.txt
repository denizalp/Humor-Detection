Foreign visitors, please be advised that Royal Ontario Museum has no visible connections with the royal family, has nothing to do with Ontario (except for location) and is not that much of a museum, but rather a set of exhibition spots, occupied by unrelated collections.\n\nYou may wish to visit ROM if you have skipped one of the \"travelling\" international exhibitions, or have a specific interest in Asian, African and Middle Eastern civilizations. Dinosaur fossils and especially the minerals collections are quite decent, too.\n\nOntario itself is barely present and pretty much faceless in the Royal Ontario Museum. And if you have ever been to something like Louvre or Hermitage, there will be no reason to spend your time in ROM.\n\nI personally detest how the building looks like, but visiting people should be happy to snap some cellphone shots of \"me and that weird thing in Toronto\". To each his own taste.
