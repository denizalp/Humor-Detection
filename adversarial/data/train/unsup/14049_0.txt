First off I was dumb enough to buy a time share so I'm an \"owner\". I did sit through the ridiculous long \"presentation\" and was compensated with comps and cash. If I was to do it again would I have bought one? It's hard to say because when I'm not there, I hate myself for buying it. When I'm there I am 100% happy with the mistake I made 6 years ago.\n\nSome of you readers require the nicest view, nicest location, the best this and that when it comes to hotels. I personally just need it to be clean and quiet so that I can sleep. I don't need a view of the strip. I don't need to have a penthouse. So this place works for people like me. I stay here AT LEAST every year for a week during CES and it's been good to me. If you need to go to\/from the main strip to this location, make sure you take the freeway, save at least 15 minutes of stop and go at the lights.\n\nThis place is 7 miles or so off the strip. for ME it's fine. I live in southern California and like many others, I've been coming and going to Vegas my whole life. Playing there is fine, but after a whole day, being able to get away from that traffic is relaxing. Some of you reading this may have an issue that I will never have...and that is not being able to get back because you are drunk off your a$$. I don't drink and I drive to Vegas so I never see this as a problem.\n\nCleanliness - This is where I see a minor problem. If you stay here for a week, they will only clean your room on Wednesday. That is it, if you want housekeeping to come by again it's an extra charge. They do send over house cleaning once you check out so that the next patron will have a clean room. Once again, not a problem for me since I always put the do not disturb sign outside anyway. Think of it this way, Do YOU have someone clean your house daily? I don't, I just keep my stuff neat and clean up after myself. What makes you think you shouldn't make your bed in the morning or wash your dishes? I see this place (and any hotel) as an extension of my home so I keep it neat, and I think as functioning adult YOU TOO should be civil.\n\nI would have to say that their cleaning crew should have a schedule to \"deep clean\" the rooms a few times each year. If you look at the A\/C and exhaust fans\/vents you will likely see dust buildup which can be disgusting.\n\nSo if I like it why am I giving this place a 3 star? Well according to Yelp, that means it's \"A-Ok\" which is what it is. It's nothing fancy, it's like a small one bedroom condo. What is there to make it over the top right? Parking lot seems like a problem. the rear buildings have a structure so that helps, but if you wanted to walk to South Point (casino next to it) it's a long-ish walk depending on the heat or cold and which building you are in.
