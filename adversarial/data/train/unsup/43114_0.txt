Came here with my brother and mom on one of our family Vegas trips and it was delicious! My brother always gets the Sam n Emma since he likes the large variety of meats in the sandwich and the thousand island dressing. I decided to split the turkey club with my mom and omg it was so good. You get your choice of bread and we both got French roll, slightly toasted, which was perfect. The turkey was shaved thin and piled high, the bacon was crispy, the lettuce and tomato wasn't too much and the mayo was the right amount. I can see why my brother is a fan of this place and now I am too!
