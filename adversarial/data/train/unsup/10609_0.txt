I really wish I had been able to sit down at a table and eat lots of stuff all afternoon long. There could be a menu item called \"Jewish girl from Brooklyn Sampler Special\" or something. This is what I would have wanted to try bites of:\n\nCorned beef, pastrami, roast turkey (with all 8 kinds of mustard)\nPotato knish\nStuffed derma\nMatzo ball soup\nPickles of all varieties\nBagels, lox, whitefish salad\n\nBut anyway, that didn't happen. Instead I hopped in for takeout after a dentist appointment down the road. Once again, I almost got sideswiped by an old lady in the parking lot who really shouldn't have been driving. I ordered two sandwiches on rye (turkey and corned beef) and two potato knishes. I grabbed two cans of Dr. Brown's for the nostalgia factor.\n\nMy husband went apeshit over the corned beef. I had two problems with the turkey. First, it was that slimy processed deli turkey, not the roast turkey these delis are famous for. Yes, it was my fault for not clarifying, but when I ordered \"turkey\" from the guy who must have been slicing sandwiches for thirty years, I would expect him to say, \"roast turkey or sliced?\" to let me know there were two options. Second, there was lettuce on the sandwich, which i didn't order, and which, when I got home, was soggy from the thousand island dressing. \n\nThe bread was great. The pickle (dill) was crunchy and good, although I prefer sours or half-sours.\n\nThe knish was, sadly, a disappointment! Hard, dense, and overall, just difficult to eat.\n\nI'd like to try other parts of my Jew from Brooklyn sampler at a later date, but for now, my preference is Jack's over Corky and Lenny's. What I appreciated more about the deli was the sensory experience walking in, as opposed to the food itself.
