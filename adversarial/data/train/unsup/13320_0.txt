Nothing else like it in Charlotte.  The best juices and living food within 100 miles.\n\nI was quite dismayed when I pulled up today and Luna's was no longer there.  Then I turned around and saw they just moved across the parking lot.  A much better location with more outdoor seating.  Still the same love being put in to all the juices and drinks.\n\nSo many amazing options to choose from, but this time I just went with the chillied chai.  I should have gone for a berry smoothie, after I tried somebody else's, but no complaints on my end.  My chai was smooth and almond milk creamy.  Just the little kick I needed to continue my day.\n\nNot to much to tell ya on this one as I didn't get any food, but will be back soon!
