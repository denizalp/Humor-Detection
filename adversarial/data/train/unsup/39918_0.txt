It's so nice to find a good Mexican restaurant. This one is Mexican, with a twist. What I loved about this restaurant is that they have a gluten sensitive menu. Their chips are gluten free, and have a dedicated fryer for them. The chips were phenomenal and addictive! They give you 3 salsas.  I loved the green sauce. We ordered guacamole, and it was very fresh. Ask for lime to squeeze on the chips and guac. We ordered the Baja ceviche, which had a jalape√±o aioli. That was not so good. The fish didn't seem fresh.  I chose the gluten free chicken enchiladas and split it with a friend. Delicious and citrusy. Had some margaritas and i felt like there was no alcohol in them, but they were tasted good.  Would probably save my money there! Go to happy hour at Hussong's Cantina nearby in the hotel for a good margarita that is properly tequila'd!
