So Disappointed!!!\nMy girlfriend and I talked all day about trying out the bloody mary's at the bacon bar after a full day of shopping on Saturday 11\/9\/13.\nWe got there - sat at the bar - received menus and then nothing...\nWe waited probably close to 10 minutes and the server never came back.  She was busy talking on the phone over by the kitchen...  We saw her get off the phone, but still hadn't made it back to us, so we left.\nWe walked ALL THE WAY through the restaurant to get to the door, not a single person said thank you, and she didn't try and stop us either, even though we walked right by her!\n\nSo - we ended up going up the street to Viola's.  Great service, Amazing Food, Awesome happy hour specials.  Will definitely make Viola's a regular place to go!!!
