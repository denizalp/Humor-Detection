A...mazing. This is a neighborhood gem. Started out with the bacon and date wrapped meatballs. I had the filet and partner had to salmon. Perfection. The menu is VERY eclectic....  there is definitely something for everyone. If you aren't into a steak or seafood, the sandwich selection is pretty good. Next time I am going to try the turkey and cranberry sandwich. We ended with the vanilla creme brûlée. Again, perfection. Great bear and wine selection, and I definitely recommend the signature cocktail the Chandelier, especially if you love bubble gum vodka! \n\nGo see Jason. He took AMAZING care of us! Will definitely be going back!
