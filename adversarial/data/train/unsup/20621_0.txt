Franchisees of The UPS Store have numerous products and services such as Shipping and Packing, Mailbox and Postal Services, Copying, Finishing & Printing, Packaging and Moving Supplies, and Business Services that include fax, notary, and office supplies. The Mail Boxes Etc. concept was launched in 1980 as an alternative to the post office. In 2001, UPS purchased Mail Boxes Etc., Inc, and in 2003, the two companies established The UPS Store brand. These businesses are based on services and what they can sell you 'outside' of the UPS shipment itself. It's cheaper to go online and print your own label and drop it off. Don't get confused with what customer service they offer. They're NOT UPS themselves and have little to no control over that end, but do pay for the insurance when asked. UPS is not a perfect business partner.
