My yoga teacher told us that we were all going to die during savasana...  Uncool.   I came to yoga as part of my New Years resolution of 2000 and zen.  I don't think you need to talk about dying during class.  The entire class laughed uncomfortably after she said this, but the overall mood was almost entirely ruined.  \n\nThe studio has also canceled their 7:40 class on Thursday.  That is serious bummer for those of us who get out of work after 5 PM.
