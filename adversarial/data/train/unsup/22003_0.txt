I'm so surprised at this restaurant inside of the HyVee! They have an amazing daily happy hour and daily specials too. The beer and wine selection is great. They have some nice pairing options for your meals too. They have a great brunch on Sundays. \nOne thing to note is the amount of employees that sit at the bar to eat\/drink before or after their shifts. We have been in to grab a seat at the bar for a quick happy hour and weren't able to get a seat because there were HyVee employees hanging out there instead. Maybe they don't have an employee break room for employees to grab some food before or after their shifts. They hang out at the bar and talk about work and it's a bit too much. Maybe replace your work clothes with street clothes before sitting at the bar?\nI do like their sushi options. The tuna roll and the salmon roll have been VERY SPICY lately though. They must be using a new sauce inside the roll with the meat or more hot sauce than before. I love spicy, but it has gotten to a level where it's inedible!
