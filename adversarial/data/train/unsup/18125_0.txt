I walk out into the heat and stand in the stupid line of people because I needed to withdraw a certain amount of money and I needed a direct deposit form for my new job. There are 2 tellers on a Friday with 8 people deep. Not bad except that one of the tellers was running the drive through as well. So it was taking extra long. It was finally my turn; I hand her my withdrawal slip and she rudely says, \"you know you can use the ATM for that.\" Yes, I'm aware that I can use the ATM!!! You think I would stand in a long ass line for JUST a withdrawal?! I tell her I also needed a direct deposit form and she says she can help with that. Thank you for doing job without being a dick about it! Kudos for the cold water in the lobby.
