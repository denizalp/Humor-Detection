Updated review, 11 months since my first review and been here a total of 27 times! Service is still great and the food as good as always.\n\nToday I stopped by a special of some fried spam musubi 5\/5 and an order of chicken karage with their signature hand ground sesame seeds and barbecue sauce 5\/5. I also enjoyed a bottle of the Mio sparkling sake with my meal, very crisp and refreshing and served in an iced carafe to keep it chilled. They still have the Yelp check in offer for a free Japanese potato salad. \n\nThank you for another great meal. 11 months, and every time when I leave I can't wait to come back! Thank you Meredith, for offering such great food! See you again soon!
