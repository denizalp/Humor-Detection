My friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday. Once 7pm rolls around, more people start to arrive - available seating and parking reduces dramatically. Also, I would come before 7 on a Wednesday to take advantage of happy hour 5-7pm. \n\nOur orders took a while to come out. I ordered the Big Jim [$11], which was great. Fried chicken, bacon, gravy, biscuits, cheese. With random pieces of watermelon. The poutine [$9] just with the  gravy on top was meh ahahah. The fries weren't that great. \n\nThe beignets were pretty good, except all of the honey sauce pooled into the bottom so the bottom beignets were overly drenched and way too sweet. \n\nThe neighborhood is kind of sketchy, but Welcome Diner is on the same street as JoBot and Melt, so you can walk down and enjoy your time there.
