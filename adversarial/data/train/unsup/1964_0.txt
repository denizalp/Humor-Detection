Food quality not that great. Ordered the carne asada bowl. But their carne asada was more like ground beef. Meat was very salty and way too much beans.. the beans overpowered everything.\n\nTheir shrimp bowl is very lemony and salty. Flavor isn't balanced with the portions of rice and lettuce and beans.
