We stopped in after having lunch at Postino (next door) for a margarita. We have heard plenty from friends and our waitress and had to check it out. We walked in, ran into a couple friends and joined a table on the patio. We were then greated by the hostess, who \"greeted\" us with a \"so you guys just seat yourself then? I guess I will get you some menus\". She then came back warning us that \"next time you would be in big trouble for this\". Safe to say we abandoned ship and walked out. We returned to Postino and all is well. Welcomed with open arms and a drink prepared.\nSidenote: the manager came over to not only apologize for the insensitive hostess but also to offer free tacos for the terrible experience. She deserves the 2 stars. The hostess however, deserves the zero star review. She was rude and being someone that works a 100% costumer service position, she would be let go considering how we were treated. She isn't doing you any favors. Better luck next time.
