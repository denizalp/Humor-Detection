exceed my expectations!\n\nI was kind of worried about going here because of the different variations to the food, but everything I tried was amazing! \n\nit was worth the hour+ wait since we had a group of six and needed a larger table. \n\nwe shared some of the food, and my favourite was the poutine! definitely will return again! \n\nps - the service was amazing, on point, very friendly staff!
