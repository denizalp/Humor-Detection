The following review is based on an actual conversation (if by \"actual\" you mean \"embellished for literary panache\").\n\n\"Primanti's is the best! It's a Pittsburgh institution!\"\n\n\"It's terrible.  The sandwiches are over-rated.  It's a novelty act!\"\n\n\"Screw you!\"\n\n\"Bite me!\"\n\n\"I can't believe I married you!\"\n\n\"I can't believe I ever asked you to marry me!!\"\n\nThis type of argument seems to abound on Yelp.  So just try Primanti's and decide for yourself.  I do agree that the cheesesteak isn't that great, but I would highly recommend the capicola.  The spiciness of that meat works well with the coleslaw.
