The Wrongbar is slowly growing on me for a live music venue. They have a good sized dance floor but I find the spaces for seating a little small. The booths near the front doors aren't a bad place to sit if you want to chat with people but the music is generally too loud unless you like yelling at your friends. \n\nThe stage is a good size and you will have a clear view of it anywhere in the room which is a bonus because sometimes it's hard to get back to that sweet little spot you staked out earlier if you leave for a drink or the bathroom. \n\nThe acoustics and sound system are surprisingly good for such a \"live\" room. I've been there for DJ performances and live bands and both sounded better than I would have expected based on the shape of the room. The close proximity of the stage to the crowd is nice and seems to foster a lot of interaction with the crowd. \n\nThe staff are attentive and nice. I haven't ordered anything other than beer there so I'm not sure how deep their knowledge of mixology extends. Most people seem to order the bog standard rum and coke or 7 and 7 which are impossible to screw up. Even with a busy bar though you will usually have a drink in hand very quickly at either the front or rear bar. \n\nThe crowd is pretty mixed but there is a high hipster ratio to be sure. What I find interesting personally is the amount of people in their mid to late 30s that you can tell were ravers in the 90s based strictly on the way they dance. I'm surprised I haven't seen any white gloves, fun fur or soothers yet.
