Four Peaks is the most well known brewery in Arizona, but it is certainly not the best.  The 4.5 rating on here actually breaks my beer-loving heart.  There are good, and even great, breweries in Arizona -- this just isn't one of them.\n\nThis location of Four Peaks is near the University, so parking is hard to come by.  I went when school wasn't in session, thinking it would be less busy...wrong!  Not wanting to wait for a table, we sat at the bar.  We should have known something was wrong when we ordered a beer flight and everyone stared at us.  You people are at a brewery and you've never seen a flight?  The guys next to us actually asked what it was....\n\nThe flight is a great deal at $10, and comes with a ridiculous number of beers.  I can't say that any of them were better than a 3 out of 5 star rating.  I actually left a few beers standing at the end of the night, the Hefeweizen and the Peach beer. The IPAs were not good either.  I've had their pumpkin porter in the past, and that is probably their best showing.\n\nI can't speak to the food, but look at the photos...does this look like 4.5 star food?  The place is loud, the music is terrible, and the beer is cheap.  I suppose this is every college kids dream.  This brew house was built with a certain demographic in mind, and I am definitely NOT part of that group.
