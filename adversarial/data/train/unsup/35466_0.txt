It's just okay. My husband had the California cheese steak and it was dry. His coleslaw was bland.  I had the cinnamon French toast and it was mediocre. For the 4.5 stars it was rated when we went we were expecting something a little better. We could have made this at home ourselves.  Not impressive but also not bad. We probably won't be back.  \n\nEverybody who worked there were friendly and attentive though!
