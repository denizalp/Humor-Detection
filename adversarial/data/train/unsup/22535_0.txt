OMG.\n\nYou know that sensation when you burp up the great flavors of an awesome meal you just had? I enjoyed it all the way on my long drive home from this awesome restaurant.  It was the aftermath of a red curry with beef, which totally blew my mind in spite of my half-full stomach.  The star of the dish was actually the pumpkin, which works great in this sweet and savory environment.  My only regret was asking for a spicy level of 3, which was hot for me. Yes, I'm a wimp, but I had a 3 pad thai just fine at Archi's. This was like twice as bad.\n\nLike my friend said earlier, if this was located on our side of town, we'd go there every day. Mr. David Wong, if you think you can replicate this beautiful bistro in Henderson or Southeast Vegas, we would be ever grateful.
