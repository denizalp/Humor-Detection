Love the name, but the actual place...well, not as much.\n\nI don't know a whole lot about Vegas as I have only visited twice so far in my life. I do know this place dates back to the 70's and was kind of a big deal. They used to have cheap table games, $1 hotdogs, and was always busy. Now, there are no gaming tables, they still have hotdogs but they are no longer $1, and busy...if what I saw on the visit I made was any indication of the norm, then I would say not at all.\n\nYes, they offer cheap beer and snacks comparatively as well as some cheap souvenirs in their shop, but this place looks dark, dingy, and very tired. I think I read \"seedy\" in another review and that fits as well. I will say the drink service here was good, but I can't say the same for the actual drink. The majority of the slots looked very old, but they were cheap so I guess you get what you pay for. Remember, if you have a players card from neighboring Circus Circus it will work in the machines here as well since CC owns this place.\n\nSlots A Fun does indeed have slots, but whether or not they are A fun is really relative. If I find my way to Circus Circus again I would stop by here for a few minutes, but I wouldn't go out of my way.
