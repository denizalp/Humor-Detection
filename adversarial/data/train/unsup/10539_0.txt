We went in today to look at mattresses. We have been searching for a while and we were happy to find some good mattresses at great prices. While we were there we found a couch and love seat that we really liked. Our salesman Albert went above and beyond to help us get both within our budget. I also really like that it was not a high pressure sales situation. I would say that this purchase was one of the easiest most stress free purchases that we have made. I would suggest if you are looking for furniture I would stop in and see the great selection of beds, furniture and tables that they have. Great customer service and awesome prices.
