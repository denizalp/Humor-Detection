Today we tried this location for the first time. We ordered two of the fajitas for two.  My husband and I shared one n my kids shared the other. It was way more food than we could eat. Very pleased with the portions of food for our money.  The food was delicious.  The service was great.  This will be our new go to for Mexican food close to home. We will definitely be coming back.  Thank you for a great lunch and a great dining experience.  Thumbs up!
