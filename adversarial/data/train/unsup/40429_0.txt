One of our family traditions when we're in Vegas. You can't go wrong with the Nutella crepe. My husband and I split it. One of my daughters had the Banana's Foster crepe and loved it. The other one had the mixed berries crepe. While she liked the flavor, she was expecting something to be inside the crepe itself. It didn't stop her from eating it all!
