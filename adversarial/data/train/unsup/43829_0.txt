Waited for my battery to charge, because it won't start my engine. The mechanic give an estimate of 1 to 1.5 hours to complete the charging. The battery warranty of 5 years bought it last 11\/2015. The auto care center decided to have it replaced he said it taking to long to for me to wait. And I drove average of 100 miles a day. It's better to have a reliable battery at work.
