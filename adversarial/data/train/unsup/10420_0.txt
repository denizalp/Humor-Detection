It is with a great deal of trepidation that I write this review, not because the food or the drinks were bad, but because they were amazingly good!\n\nWhy you might ask do I have trepidation, because we were able to walk in sit down and get served immediately by a wonderful waitstaff. The ambience is cool and the clientele diverse. The reason I have trepidation is because there were no Fedora wearing hipsters or foodies with cool glasses in the place at all and I would love to see it stay this way.\n\nHowever this tiki bar is too good of a joint not to share with all of you.\n\nIf you are into boat drinks this is the place to be in the northern hemisphere. You will not find a better tasting or more diverse group of tropical drinks outside of Waikiki or the BVI's. \n\nIt's at this point I need to make you aware of something, if you're looking for their phone number...they don't have one. If you're trying to figure out if they serve food, it's a limited menu but the tacos totally rock.\n\nSo I guess what I'm telling you is leave your Fedora and your cool glasses at home and get your butt over to Porco's you will be amazed. The only thing it's missing is a hotel across the street, because you shouldn't be behind the wheel of a vehicle after two of their drinks!
