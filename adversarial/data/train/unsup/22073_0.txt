How disappointing. 20 minutes of sitting at stable and not a single soul ever came by to take our  order. The only reason we were able to even try some of the beer from this place was because we walked up to the bar before the hostess found us a seat.\n\nWhen we got up to leave, the hostess told us to have a nice night.. How do you not realize a table that you sat hasn't been attended to? Especially when your hostess stand is literally right next to where I'm sitting.\n\nMy final beef with this place is the clientele. Nasty hipsters and people who look like they haven't showered for weeks.
