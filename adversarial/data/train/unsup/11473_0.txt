Barmasa was a little bit of a letdown after my boyfriend kept telling me how good the one in NYC is. He's also a bit of a sushi snob. \n\nAnyway, we had 7:30pm reservations, which we figured would be enough time to eat light and head to the Rio for Penn & Teller at 9. Little did we know that it would take 30 minutes from the time we placed our order, to the time we received our first dish (Kobe Garlic Soy Steak), then another 30 minutes before we received our Sashimi Tasting and plate of 6 Nigiri sushi pieces. Everyone around us, who got seated and ordered after us, got their sushi before us and much faster. Service, nonetheless, could have been MUCH better. Granted the place just opened 10 days ago, for the price we were paying for the food, we expected better than average service. This was unacceptable. \n\nThe food, on the other hand, was high-quality sashimi\/sushi. Sure, the pieces were small, but there are not many places you can get the selection of fish they have outside of Tsukiji fish market in Japan. The prices are what they are because of the environment you're in and the quality of the food. Don't go in expecting the same mediocre rolls you see at the corner Japanese Sushi bar run by non-Japanese. The other commenters below (except for Jen L.) had ridiculous expectations. This is a high-end restaurant in a high-end hotel. If you're going to try Barmasa (or Shaboo for that matter), expect a significant price tag and a menu of different kinds of high-quality fish (and meats -- kobe and wagyu) that you won't normally see. \n\nAll-in-all, I hope that the service becomes more polished fast. The food alone would have warranted a 4-5 stars from me, but the fact that the waitress didn't know what she was talking about and our orders took considerably longer than it should have keeps me from rating Barmasa greater than a 2. I'll stick to the one in New York City.
