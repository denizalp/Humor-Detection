I used to go there a lot after working-out at the Y. About 5 years ago, however, I went in with my daughter and we each ordered a smoothie. When he (i think he was the owner) poured mine into the glass, a lump of frozen yogurt fell onto the counter. He picked it up with his bare hand, squished it in his fist so it oozed out between his fingers, then put it back into the blender and poured the liquid back from the glass. I watched horrified as he re-blended this concoction, re-poured it and tried to hand it to me. I was so disgusted that I walked out and have never been back.
