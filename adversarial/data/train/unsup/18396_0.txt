Good Cheap Eats with Downtown Atmosphere!!\n\nAfter reading the other reviews I really don't know what NEW I can add!!\n\nThis place is NO frills, Cheap & OK fair with OK service-Nothing memorable but the atmosphere and CAST of characters you are sure to run across here.\n\nIf you don't wanna wait in a long line, pay alot of $$ for little \"gourmet\" dishes and you like a little pie with your meal-Give it a go.\n\nWARNING: Sit at the counter at your own risk. High traffic and it's kinda gross they put all the dirty plates,etc in bus tubs right under the counter in front of you as you eat!!!
