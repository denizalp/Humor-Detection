Never have I been left with such a churning in my stomach. I had eaten at Coyotes only once before. To my surprise, it was better than I had expected. Recently, I went on another venture to this restaurant only with an extremely different experience. Not only were the prices ridiculous, the place looked like a ghost-town. I cannot stand when I go to a restaurant and there are no other people. Not to mention the fact that I nearly couldn't make it to school the next morning. I would recommend this joint if you wish to have a legitimate reason for missing work. If, however, you are looking for tasty Mexican food, you are looking at the wrong place.
