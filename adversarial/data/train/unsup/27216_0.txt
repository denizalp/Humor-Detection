Came here with a few coworkers for Friday lunch - i think everyone had a decent experience. \n\nI ordered the beef short ribs + spaghetti + hk milk tea. \ni recommend not getting the hot hk milk tea - it didn't taste very good (i've definitely had way better). but the short ribs were really good. \n\nSomeone ordered a duck + bbq pork combo + rice and veggies - it was $8.50 but came with only 3 pieces of duck and less than 10 pieces of bbq pork. \n\nthe deep fried pork + curry was fairly good.\n\nDon't know if i'll come back - mostly because i feel that there are better choices that are just as close by :)
