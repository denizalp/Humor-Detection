I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE APARTMENTS!!! The Management is the worst. I have been harassed non stop from them since I moved in. The office manager John is the biggest jerk around. I used to have a truck and I left 3 perfectly good tires in my parking spot for less than a day, they didn't even give me a warning and when I got home from work they were in the trash. Than when John has a problem he comes knocking on my door with no call or nothing. He is unprofessional and needs to get over himself.
