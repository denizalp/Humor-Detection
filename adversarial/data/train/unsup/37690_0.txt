I work right in town and I order lunch here maybe 2-3 times a week. I am in love with this place! Their sushi is so fresh and so delicious. I can honestly say this is the best sushi I have ever had. I have been do many sushi places and this one beats them all! Their Bahama Mama is my favorite, nice tasty lobster on top of their shrimp tempura roll. ahh so good! consumer service is also amazing! wish they were open on Sunday!
