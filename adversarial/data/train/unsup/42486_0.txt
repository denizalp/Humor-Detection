I went to get my eyebrows waxed and a shellac manicure.  It is a cute spot.  The young lady who did both was nice enough but didn't seem very confident about doing the brows. She did a good job on the nails.  It just felt a little unfriendly (except for the couple people who came in and out who they seemed to know well) and it was a bit pricier than the usual places I go to.  There was not a noticeable difference as to why it is more (other than the cute d√©cor).  Also, I heard afterwards that there is a 20% discount for the first visit which no one told me about.  So overall good, but not really feeling like going back.
