Went here today for lunch, very disappointed. Chips were stale and salsa was watery and bland. I'm a huge Mexican food fanatic. I got two tacos: the Korean BBQ steak taco and the bang bang fish taco. The BBQ steak taco tasted like it came out of a can. The meat did not taste like real meat. I will not be back!!! Expensive for the quality.
