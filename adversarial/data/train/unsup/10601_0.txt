I'm a native of  El Paso, TX, so my love of this place is by no means new.  I can remember when the only place I could get their food was in Juarez, Mexico, which is literally a hop, skip and jump away from El Paso.  My friends and I usually made a day of it; a little shopping, a \"little\" drinking, and a lot of tacos.  This was probably like 18 years ago.  Imagine my excitement when they opened their first restaurant in El Paso.  It was right next to the university I went to (UTEP), so as a \"starving\" student, I used to fill up on their cucumbers and guacamole salsa at their condiment bar. \n\nMy husband I moved to Phoenix back in 2000.  Needless to say, I really missed the food from El Taco Tote.  Holy crap!  I was ecstatic when they opened a restaurant in Tuscon.  I'm famous for saying that I'll go anywhere for food, this was certainly no exception.  A little two hour trek for DELICIOUS tacos was well worth the drive.\n\nOK, so obviously, I just about shit my pants when they opened one in Phoenix on Camelback and 35th Ave.  I went on their grand opening week and relished in their amazing, hot off the grill, beef fajita tacos.  They have something called the \"Taco Tote Pack\".  It comes with two tacos of your choice and a gigantic baked potato.  I agree, that's a little weird, but that does not take away from it deliciousness.  You are seriously getting incredibly fresh ingredients, as you can even see the ladies making fresh tortillas as you wait for your food.  Where this place gets even better is at their taco-topping wonderland.  You have every conceivable salsa and topping that allows you to have your tacos \"your way\".  \n\nI agree with the last review by John V. that the place a bit chaotic, but I think that's part of it's charm.  So if you're in the mood for an unpretentious place, with fantastic tacos, El Taco Tote will definitely  hit the spot.
