Watched the National Championship Game with some guys from work and loved it. Had the deep dish and it was just like in Chicago. Not doughy and crisp crust even with the deep dish which was perfect. A lot of TVs so everyone in our party had a great angle for the game.  Really enjoyed it and we will definitely be back.
