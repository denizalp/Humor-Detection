Meh!\n\nI'm not sure how this Starbucks could mess up a Flat White but this was the first time I've received something that was \"not the same\"\n\nOne of the best things about SBux is that no matter where you go, your drinks always taste the same......but not here\n\nFor some reason, the coffee was bitter - it was still drinkable but not up to the standards I've come to expect from SBux\n\nSo given I went back the next day & would return again since other closeby options were nonexistent, have to say I wasn't necessarily a fan but this was A-OK
