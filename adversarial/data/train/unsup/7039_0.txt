Unfortunately for those who work within the walls of the DES main building, there are not a lot of options, there are not a lot of decent places around to eat without driving.  \n\nThis place is mediocre on a good day and is also very overpriced.  I don't know of many other places that will nickel and dime you for condiment packets and plastic silverware. Their grill items are greasy, the salad bar is boring without much variety, the pizza is tasteless, and the burgers are cooked the night before and left in a pan of water then heated up when ordered.  I actually got ill a couple years ago here, and then after some things I saw behind the cook line I filed a health department complaint, but I don't think it has helped.\n\nSo, if you're in the neighborhood, beware.
