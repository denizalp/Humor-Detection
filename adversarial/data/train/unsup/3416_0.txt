Wouldnt go back, thats what one star is worth.  \n\nThe Dennys of Palazzo.  \n\nLet me just say this, Im the kinda guy who will eat leftovers from 2 weeks ago.  I couldnt eat my sandwich it tasted so nasty and old.  The cubano roast beef and pork were disgusting. Trust me, i know disgusting.\n\nFries were good.  But I mean, who can f up fries?\n\nThats about that.  The place offers 25 bucks off a 50 dollar bill.  Sadly, if they offered 49 off 50 i still wouldnt go. Made me feel sick.
