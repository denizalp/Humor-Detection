I've always liked Andrew's BBQ, and ever since they closed down the one near me a while back, I've quietly missed them.  Last night I finally made it to this location and it was awesome!\n\nI liked how this one's decorated.  They have upside down BBQ grills hanging from the ceiling as light fixtures, plenty of tables and other decor that really seemed cute.  I swear the menu was bigger then I remember!  The girl at the register was really nice and helpful, and took our orders after answering all of our questions.\n\nI went with my usual, BBQ beef brisket with garlic mashed potatos as my side.  My friend went with the bbq chicken sandwich with the mac and cheese.  Both were tasty, and we had a really good time.\n\nLove Andrew's, and will be back when I get a chance!
