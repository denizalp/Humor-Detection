We've been several times and always leave pleased. But personally I love the Brunch with mimosa special! The brunch pizza is delicious! The patio sets it apart from other places in DTS when weather permits. The kids mac and cheese is Divine. Always great, friendly service too. Everything tastes real fresh. Looking forward to a brunch soon.
