No service, long wait, no seating... First of all the line was wrapped around the building of probably tourists that liked the cheeky name.  It's not worth the wait.  Drinks\/food are overpriced and no seating at all at the venue, like 10 bar chairs and a strip of bar.  We ordered and asked for a OJ.  The guys said they were out... Ok, so we get a can soda instead.  He sets it on the counter and there's black stuff all in the rim of it.  We give it back to him, by this time he's on the phone and gestures for us to give it back and hands us a new one.  Next minute someone brings a tray of OJ.  We asked if we could change the soda for OJ.  We never opened the can.  He says \"nah, that'll mess up the numbers so. We count for everything.\"  Ok.  Have you heard of returning?  For your mistake?  They also have the audacity to have a TIP jar at the register.  For what service?!   The food was mediocre.   And if you don't want your eggs or burger medium, too bad.  It's undercooked.  They don't even ask.  The service was terrible.  And the tables were dirty and under serviced (no napkins, no salt, nothing...). Our bill was about $30.  I would say spend your $30 elsewhere.  They have some work to do here.
