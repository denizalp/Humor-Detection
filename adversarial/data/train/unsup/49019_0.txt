As I ambled into this fine establishment by myself, I opted to sit at the bar, so that I could be seated immediately.  This simple decision gave me a beautiful vantage point of the kitchen, and all the food that came out of it.  Believe me when I tell you that EVERYTHING that came out of their kitchen looked AMAZING.  I was hungry when I sat down, but by the time my food came, I was drooling on the counter.  The portions are big, the prices are fair, and the food is to die for.  It's centrally located on the Strip, so it should definitely be a stop on your next LV visit.  Service was great, and the atmosphere was wonderful.  Will definitely be back again....and again.
