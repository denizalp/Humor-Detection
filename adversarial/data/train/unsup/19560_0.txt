With a name like \"Players\" I was expecting everything BUT a lovely, romantic and fabulous restaurant. \n\nLike what, you ask? \n\nWelp, more like a chotchy sports bar filled with extremely scary townies and convicted felons. \n\nWhat I actually walked into was a beautiful dinning spot with a huge patio covered with ivy and little, white, twinkling lights. I discovered my secret pick for the most perfect, romantic date night. I've been recommending it to everyone since!  Considering most people venture downtown or to Tremont for fine dinning, I love having this little Lakewood sneaker in my pocket.\n\nTheir menu is fantastic. Fancy, but not too pretentious. Fresh salads, seasonal picks and decadent entrees. I love that you can build your own pasta dish just the way you like it. Pizzas are also made to order here and ready for take out too. Players is just such a versatile restaurant. The perfect mesh of laid back, comfortable vibes--but fancy and uniquely upscale enough to impress! \n\nI could go on, but I won't. I'll end it here with this last thought:\n\nListen here, gentlemen... and listen good. You want to do something nice for the lady in your life? A romantic night out perhaps, but sick of the same old places? Don't want to spend an arm and a leg on a great, upscale meal and a cocktaill? Take a moment to re-read this review and let it sink in.
