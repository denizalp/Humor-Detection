I found myself in this part of town unsure of what the food scene was like. My trusted yelp app brought me to this place..  no lie I missed my turn because it looked like a residential street.. I circled the block & found it located next to a corner store \n\nThe cashier was super friendly and literally explained the whole menu to me.. she showed me a frame with a picture and article of the pollo salad.. even though the vampiro tostadas sounded amazing I went with the salad\n\nI was pleased to receive a huge, fresh, crunchy salad.. it barely fit in the container .. lots of finely chopped chicken, cucumber, lemony pico de Gallo and egg.. with a green creamy dressing. I could not finish this salad \n\nThis hole in the wall is not fancy but they put out good food and the service is top notch \n\nOn my way out a new cashier asked how everything was .. and she sounded sincere like she really wanted to make sure I enjoyed my meal.. next time I'm in the area I will be back for some of those chicken & pork street tacos
