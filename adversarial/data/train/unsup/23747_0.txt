Do NOT look through the photo gallery for this show. DO buy some tickets. I meant like now... stop reading!\n\nI came across absinthe only because it was on the caesars palace property. Literally just outside in a little circus tent. Looking for something to do on yet another solo adventure, 100 bones for some live entertainment seemed appropriate in vegas. \n\nYou will be seated \"intimately\" - not in the genital rubbing way but in the you'll be shoulder to shoulder way. Big people may want to opt for the VIP tickets because those seats allow for some shifting. You will probably be offended, the show is very raunchilicious. Overly sensitive people might want to bring earmuffs. You could still enjoy the visual aspect of the show. No boobies or winkies shown. I think the acrobatics could have been better if the performers didn't have all that drag from their clothing. Aerodynamics. Just sayin.\n\nThe host, \"The gazillionaire\", is a hilarious and a role model to the children of the world. He has a few skits throughout the show but a lot of it is improv. Most of his jokes come at the expense of the audience. No one is safe... except for nerdy looking black dudes - he might want to blow you. There are a bunch of other performances revolving around acrobatics, feats of strength, and random sideshows. I was impressed by literally everything but then again I've never been to this kind of show before so it was all new to me. \n\nStaying at caesars ? You're a dummy if don't sit in on this show one night. Really entertaining and well worth the bucks IMO.\n\n\nTip: There is a bar just outside of the tent. You can bring drinks in. Slight buzz is recommended. \n\nSide note: 8========D. ( o )( o ). Just getting you ready.
