I use to come here when I worked nearby. \n\nSchlotzski's wasn't my favorite place for lunch, but it was so much better than the fast food options nearby. I mean, how much Taco Bell can one eat, right?  LOL\n\nSo we decided to take a chance before grocery shopping and we're glad we did. As we finished our meal, we looked at each other and said almost in unison, \"well it's a lot better than the last time we were here.\"\n\nIf UR familiar with Schlotzsky's, it is a Austin, TX (photo) take on east coast deli. Is it like Katz's or Carnegie or 2nd Avenue, heck no!  But they do serve Tom Carvel ice cream and Cinnabon. LOL. If UR from FL, think a deli version of Miami Subs. \n\nWe've enjoyed the Roast Beef, Pastrami, BLT and a some of the other sandwiches. All were good, just don't think NYC deli and you'll do just fine. Expect to pay $8 to $12. \n\nSo Three Stars, A-Okay.
