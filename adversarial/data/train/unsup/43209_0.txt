My review is only based on my experience with the all you can eat lunch.\nStopped in for the \"all you can eat\" lunch buffet, at the suggestion of a friend whom said it was good. The food quality was not too bad, service was pretty good, and it seemed like a nice clean place. \nThe lunch deal is $14\/person, and not really a buffet, but you can order unlimited off a small menu. It was a pretty slim sushi roll selection, and about 8 different nigiri choices. Only about 4 fish options for nigiri. They also offer rice or spring rolls which was cool, and the spring rolls were good and came out fast.\nNot amazing, but the fish tasted fresh, and the service was good. Will I be back someday? Sure. I would like to try them for dinner sometime, with a more expanded menu option.
