The Good:\n-Amazing views of beautiful desert nature including the wild horses (at least for now, and hopefully it stays that way...).\n-A great floating picnic opportunity. Bring your coolers, Bluetooth speakers, suntan lotion and a hat! They rent out cooler-sized tubes, but you could also bring your own.\n-Multiple start and end points to manage your time. The longest you'll be out on the river is approx. 4 hours, and the shortest approx. 1.5 hours.\n\nThe Bad:\n-There are some super strict cops around here in terms of tracking speed. Make sure you're not speeding down the road to the river not even in the slightest.\n-There are the occasional rapids which can be fun until your butt scrapes against the rocks as you rumble over them. Just keep an eye out and you should be okay.\n-There can be a lot of trash at times. Please practice packing in and packing out!\n\nRecommendation: Buy your own tube at Walmart and come with a group\/2 cars so one person can park at the ending point and one at the starting point. You will need to purchase a Tonto pass to park, which can be found at the local Walgreens pharmacy.\n\nOh, and bring plenty of marshmallows. Don't ask, you'll figure it out.\n\nHave fun and enjoy!
