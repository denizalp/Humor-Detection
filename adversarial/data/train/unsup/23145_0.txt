Incredible performances by everyone, especially Kristi Holden (Christine Daa√©). I've seen Phantom of the Opera both in London and Las Vegas.. Although both were great, the Vegas show is certainly the more outstanding.\n\nResist the temptation to sing along. ;-)\n\nP.S. Aim for seats in Orchestra Center - book early to get seats as close as possible to the front.. it's always so much more exciting to be able to see everyone's facial expressions close up!
