Last time I come to this location. Quality of customer service is poor. First visit I waited a long time to receive smoothie and my special request was forgotten. So I refrained from coming for awhile and visited other locations. Today I decided to give another chance to this location. I get to the window and had to make a slight correction to my smoothie. I waited 5-8 min for a cashier to come to the window. I asked if it was too late to make a correction to my order. She replied yes because my smoothie was made before I had the chance to purchase. I thought it wouldn't be a problem to make a correction because there was no one else in the drive-through. I paid for my drink and drove off unhappy. Needless to say I won't return to this location
