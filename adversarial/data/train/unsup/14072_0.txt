Hate to be the lone negative voice here, but I was not impressed with this pie.  My Slice appears to have replaced Slice of Sicily which was a neighborhood mainstay for the last twenty years or so.  My daughters grew up loving this pizza almost weekly on pizza night.  I only found recently that the name has changed, so I assume new owners.\n\nOne reviewer claims Arcadia is a hotbed of good pizza.  Maybe I'm just too picky, but I think the pizza around my neighborhood is mediocre - that is since Slice departed.  But I'm a trooper and I'm always hopeful that a new place will wow me with awesome pizza.  My Slice comes in under the \"wow\" factor and arrives at \"just another pizza place\". \n\nI made the same pizza order I've ordered here for the last twenty years, a large pepperoni with black olives and a dozen hot wings, as hot as you make them.  The pizza only comes in two sizes, 12\" and 18\".  They also have \"Traditional NY Style\" or \"Southwestern Style\".  I went with the traditional.  Base price is $15, when you add two items, you are now at $19.  The wings have three flavors, \"Sweet and Sassy\", \"Old School Frankie\" and \"Pina y Habanero\", I assume this correlates to mild, medium and hot.  At $12 for a dozen, these ought to be awesome wings.  Also, if you want extra sauce, it will cost you.\n\nThe pizza was okay.  The crust was tasty and NY style.  The sauce had a slightly sweet tomato flavor, but tasted fresh.  Not much from the sauce beyond that. Cheese was basic and thin, not a lot of flavor there either.  I suppose you could jazz up the cheese base by adding \"premium\" cheeses, but this racks up another $3 on the large. The pepperoni is sliced thin and is tasteless.  Black olives were spread sparingly across the pie.  This pie was just okay.\n\nThe wings were tiny and appeared either over-cooked, or as though they had sat under a heat-lamp too long.  Dry and crispy, not much meat, so not much flavor.  The pineapple-habenaro sauce was not apparent, although the wings did have an off-putting \"sweet and sour\" note.  These wings were an embarrassment, and at a buck each, border on ripoff.\n\nI am not at all wowed, or even impressed with this first-impression. The pizza is too expensive, with the nickle-and diming for the toppings, I would easily top $20.  For this kind of money I would expect all premium toppings generously applied.  \n\nAddendum:\nWell, I got a very nice message from the owner, who appears quite concerned about his product, and was very nice in explaining why my experience may have not been up to his expectation.  Given that My Slice is relatively new to the neighborhood, they have some kinks to work out.  This is not unusual, so keep that in mind as you consider my review.  To be fair, I support local businesses like this and I would love to see it successful.  I\"ll give them a bit to work out the kinks and try again in a few weeks.  Thanks Randy, and Good Luck!
