My dog always returns home happy and healthy and being able to watch the \"pup cams\" while we are away gives me piece of mind . The staff has always been friendly and they also do a great job grooming him . The best part is he always runs back in to the Dog Stop when we take him back , so I know he has fun and it alleviates any guilt I have about leaving him
