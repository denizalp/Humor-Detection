Husband had a work conference at Caesar's, so that's how we ended up staying at this hotel. The package included a Palace Tower room (at $200\/night). Knowing how much it costs probably (does) factor into my rating of the room. \n\nI attempted to get an upgrade at check-in, but for $50 extra a night, no thanks. Also, no non-smoking king rooms available, so husband and I got to squeeze into a double bed together, how fun! Haven't done that since college. \n\nUpon entering the room, husband immediately said, \"This is probably the worst room I've stayed in in a long time,\" if that tells you anything. It's not necessarily that the room was BAD, it wasn't, it was just dated. And for $200 a night, it's ridiculous, compared to the deals I can find in Vegas for that kind of dough. \n\nThe television (maybe 22\"..wtf) didn't work when we arrived, but a quick call to guest services and the tv was functioning again. Damn, I wanted a better room.\n\nI was hoping for two queen beds since we were forced out of a king, but nope. Double beds it is. \n\nThe room has two bathrooms essentially, connected by the shower. I thought it was cool at first. Then I realized how convenient it would have been to have double sinks next to each other. You see, we only brought one tube of toothpaste and face wash. I had to retrieve it from the other sink every time I need it. There's also a bidet in one of the bathrooms. I wonder who uses them? \n\nWe had a half view of the pool and that was about it. Pretty disappointing. \n\nOverall, just not super impressive. I'm sure if we had been able to stay in one of the updated towers things would have been different. I wouldn't stay here on my own dime, that's for sure. \n\nI will say having the forum shops so close is convenient. I can appreciate having Sephora right downstairs, as well as a plethora of restaurants and other shops.
