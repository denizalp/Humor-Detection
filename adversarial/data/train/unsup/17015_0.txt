My friend and I stopped in here for lunch recently and were impressed. I had never been, and he had never been sober so it was a new experience for both of us. McCaffrey's is a great place to grab lunch and a beer. It appears they always have lunch specials during the week so prices were reasonable.\n\nWhat I like about McCaffrey's is they offer a pretty wide selection of Irish beers. I find it funny that a lot of Irish pubs have Guinness and sometimes Harp, and offer nothing else. McCaffrey's offers Smithwicks, and a few others I can't recall the names of in addition to the basics. They also make great whiskey drinks according to my friend. \n\nI had the turkey bacon melt with fries (lunch special), as did my friend so I didn't have the chance to try any of their Irish fare but what I had was great. I'll definitely be back for dinner someday to try some of their more traditional food.\n\nIf you're looking for a good, long lunch with Irish beer or good whiskey, I'd recommend Seamus McCaffrey's. It also looks like it would be a fun place to drink at night, I will be back.
