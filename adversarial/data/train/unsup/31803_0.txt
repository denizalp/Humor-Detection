We have become semi regular customers and I hesitate to let the secret out, but I can't keep quite. This place is a must try. The menu is awesome they have something you want and it is diversified. We had a egg roll, Cesar, and a pork ribeye. Wow! I am hard on restaurants and they may make a mistake but everyone is human. Give them a try and come hungry. Just stay away on Friday that's our night lol!
