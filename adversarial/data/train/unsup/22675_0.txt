This location is perfect for a cold winter evening located centrally downtown (right  by the atwater metro-walking distance). I came here on a Monday afternoon around 4:30 pm- I didn't need reservations-as the place was pretty empty. I was served right away with menus\/water- which was nice. When we were actually ready to order- nobody came by to check up on us- so I literally had to flag down someone behind the counter to tell them we were ready to order.\n\nWe ordered the : the savoury waffle (4\/5) that came with ham, 2 sunny side up eggs, roasted mushroom, onions, white cheddar, bechamel sauce and maple syrup. This was plenty for a 2 people or a very hungry person (like me). The egg was a nice touch balancing out the maple syrup - sweet and savoury; the strawberry goat cheese salad (3\/5) presentation was beautiful, but the portion size compared to the price of the meal was too small-salads are suppose to be filling! This would work as a side, not as a main course.\n\nFor drinks: I had the champurrado (3\/5)- a spicy dark hot choclate with a kick of cinammon topped with whip cream. It was a very nice drink, but since I am not a fan of dark chocolate- I couldn't finish the drink.; my friend had the tea- which was generic tea.\n\nThe prices were reasonable with service tip.\n\nI am looking forward to trying out there dessert pizzas during my next visit!!
