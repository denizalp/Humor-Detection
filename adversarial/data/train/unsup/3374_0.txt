Prices seemed reasonable [notice I didn't say good], staff was friendly, but not very helpful. I mean it's clear that sales outweighed their desire to inform customers. I felt slighted after they sold me a set up that they pretty much walked me through putting together. They didn't explain the marginal price differences and it lead to a waste. I was sold a tank that continuously leaked or had some crappy seal... bought 3 bottles of juices that ended up being spilled more than vaporized because of this shit tank. I live a state away, so nothing reasonable to do about it. It would've been nice to be informed that 5$ more on a better tank could've saved me over 20$ in spilled juices. I will not forget the sales pitch when he picked up the tank and suggested we purchase it, \"you can't go wrong with this one!\". That was a good line... sold me on it.\n\nWhat they do here is great and all, but the low rating is because there are many other vape stores [which I realized too late] which offer superior service and less bull...\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if its because they don't have their minds on straight or they were too busy to greet... but, I walked in at least a minute before my GF did, and that's when we were greeted. Can't blame 'em I guess, I like her more than me too, but I'm holding the wallet...
