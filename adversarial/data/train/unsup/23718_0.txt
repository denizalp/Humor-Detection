La Boiled Crawfish. It's complicated. They're closed and they're moving (two doors down) and they're reopening with a new name. I look forward to trying the new place as it's going to be a much clearer name that is less \"Huh?\" and more \"Vietnamese food!\"\n\nI did stop by this afternoon after having read the reviews and wanting what I heard was great pho.
