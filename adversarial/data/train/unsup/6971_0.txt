I'm not sure what it is about this place, the food is very good especially the protein pancakes but the manager doesn't seem to acknowledge you unless you are of Caucasian descent. This is my best guess coming from a social behavioral science background. I noticed as I watched him greet all the customers he slightly skipped over the darker shade of brown. I'll keep going back though, the protein pancakes and coffee are on spot. I would also love to know I'm wrong.
