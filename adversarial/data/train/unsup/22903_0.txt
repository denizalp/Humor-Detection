I am not sure what happened since my last visit to Altar Bar, but the staff was downright mean and nasty. I went for the Combichrist show, and while all of the bands performed really well, and it was a night to remember, the staff made me think twice about coming back. I don't fit the \"image\" that Altar Bar attracts. I needed a water bottle on me for medical reasons, and they told me that I had to throw it out. Fine. When we asked if we could leave it up front, they rolled their eyes. Hey, there are people in this world who can't afford clean water - and I am not about to waste a $2 bottle. After the show, we went to grab it and the guys up front howled with laughter. I don't find it funny that we wanted to take what we paid for, and what I personally needed. \n\nI should have spoken up about my medical need, but I didn't want to deal with the embarrassment. \n\nSide note: What kind of bar sells water bottles and doesn't even offer free ice to non-drinking partiers? \n\nI am frustrated and disappointed.
