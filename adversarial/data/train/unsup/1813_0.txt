SHAME ON EXCALIBUR HOTEL\/CASINO.\n my fianc√© and I checked into this hotel on Saturday for the first time ever. We were just starting our vacation, this same night we came back and I placed my purse on the dresser which is 2 ft from the foot of our bed, we went to sleep about 1am. We were woken around 4am-5am to our door being slammed (strange as I ensured our door was closed before bed) as we checked our room everything seemed to be ok, we assumed it was just the neighbor slamming their door, still unsure of why our door was cracked open, we went back to sleep. we woke up in a few hours later and started to get ready and then realized my purse was missing. It all came together, we were robbed in our own hotel room. And to make this worse... the robber was in our room and robbed us as we were sleeping. I'm scared and very disturbed by this situation and I want to make sure as people as I can tell know about this. I reported this to the casino security and they showed us how to properly lock the door that has no dead bolts. they promised follow up the next AM as their \"risk management\" is not there on weekends. I still have not heard anything. but someone out there stole my purse and my wallet in it. including credit cards\/cash\/ and my ID's. I will be taking this up with an attorney. as I came home to research this incident, on many travel sites including yelp have reviews from many other people that this exact thing happen to them and the hotel did nothing, and they are still pending a response on their incident. PLEASE BEWARE OF THIS CASINO. ROBBER ON PREMISE, AND CASINO DOES NOTHING.
