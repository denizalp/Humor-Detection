Well we've been sitting here for over and hour with no drinks. Would leave if it weren't a fight night and impossible to find a seat at another bar. The nachos we had weren't fully cooked with raw unmelted cheese underneath. Not to mention there is someone in our section (inside) smoking, which I'm pretty sure is illegal, but we have no server or security to complain to. Good times...not so much.
