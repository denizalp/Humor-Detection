The concept is quite simple. It's a teen to young adult store looking for gently used name brand\/in style items. They pay you a fraction of what it's worth and turn around and sell it for cheaper than what the mall would charge. It's awesome when it's time to do some closet trimming or if you just need some extra cash. I've been here a few times to sell clothes that I've grown tired of. In average, I've gotten about $60 for 20 items. $3 an item on average...which is better than the piece of clothing just sitting in my closet not being worn.\n\n One thing I don't get are the girls who decide what's \"stylish\" and what isn't. I work in retail, so I think I have some sense of style. On my last visit, I had a pair of Paige jeans which run about $100 retail price. They didn't buy them back because it's not a popular brand. Um what?!? If anyone knows designer jeans, then they should know that brand. Ok whatever, but then I was shocked to see some pretty beat up items they were selling (knitted sweaters that were ratty, shoes that were clearly dirty, dress with a hole in the armpit). If you guys are going to deny items, but choose to sell other pieces of garbage, I think it's time for the staff to get retrained.\n\nTip: things aren't that cheap. I'd just rather pay the few extra $ for brand new.
