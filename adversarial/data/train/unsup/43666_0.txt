I have been staying here for years! I love it. Its home away from home. I just have to go grocery shopping. We share the utilities because there is always at least two 2 bedrooms are more that we book. I have gone to the dollar stores and purchased pots but that is not a big deal for me. The staff is wonderful. I will be going there again this year for my yearly vacation to Las Vegas
