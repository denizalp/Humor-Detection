Snapdragon is a fantastic salon!  Everyone is welcoming and friendly and all of the stylists work together to make sure the customer gets the best haircut.  Jenny McLain is particularly fabulous.  I found her at the Kohler Academy in Scottsdale and she gave me consistently great haircuts, even when she was in school!  Talk about a phenom!  She took me from long, blonde hair to short, brunette hair flawlessly.  Not only is she hip to the newest techniques and latest products, but she is also a wonderful person.  I really enjoy chatting with her at the salon and she remembers the little details of my life from my last appointment with her.  She is personable and makes my trips to the salon enjoyable.  Ask for Jenny for your next haircut; you won't regret it!
