Naked Fish Sushi!!\n\nOne of the many reasons I love living on this side of town. This place satiates my cravings without having to drive down to China town.\n\nMy absolute favorite dish on the menu is the Grilled Sea Bass with Miso Butter. The sea bass just melts in your mouth. Grilled to perfection, it is juicy and tender...absolutely delicious. So good that I took a bite before snapping a photo...such a bad yelper. I flipped it around and made a photo happen regardless though ;) The miso butter sauce compliments it perfectly but is great without it as well. \n\nOverall the quality of their fish is very fresh. Prices are reasonable. You can get an amazing meal here for the price that you would pay at an AYCE sushi joint but enjoy an overall hands down better meal.\n\nService is great. The sushi chefs and servers are very accommodating. They will make you anything that you are craving so just ask if you don't see it on the menu.
