The Rogue Bar is awesome. The owner is the best.\n\nThere's a pool table, there's booze, there's adorable booths for you to sit in and think about the choices you've made. Or whatever. Whatever you want to do.\n\nComing from a band perspective, this is my favorite place to play in the Valley. It holds around 100 people, the sound system is awesome, the sound guys (ESPECIALLY ANDY) actually give a crap about your band. Which is rare. The stage is raised, and there's a door to load in from the side. Like, everything you could possibly ask for as a local band.\n\nParking lot is small. My solution would be to park around the corner and not complain about having to walk for five friggin seconds. Jesus.
