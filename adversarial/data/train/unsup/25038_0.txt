Really great food! Be sure to start with the Bacon Candy! The menu is very diverse with several interesting small plates and appetizers! The Brussels Sprouts are amazing even for people who aren't fans. Next time I will make a meal on shared apps and small plates! That being said, the Bison Burger was fantastic and don't miss out on the sweet potato tots! Service was very good and when the manager found out it was our first time, he brought free homemade potato chips! Our waiter, Homer, was excellent and we had a party of 8! Will definitely come back!
