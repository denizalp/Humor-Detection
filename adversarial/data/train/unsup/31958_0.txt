Had lunch here today.  Noonish.  It was pretty busy.  Service was pretty bad.  Food arrived at table in a seemingly reasonable period of time.  Fries on one plate were absolutely cold.  Fried on other plate hot.  Ordered some onion rings that never arrive.  When server was asked she said she forgot to put the order in.  Never even an offer to refill drink glasses.  Food was no more than average.  Not was we've experienced at other Red Robin's.  Will likely pass on these guys in the future.
