Wanted to try a new coffee joint. Wasn't sure what to order so did a iced vanilla latte. Figured that was safe bet. Mentioned it was my first time here and then the guy was so welcoming and asked if I lived in the area. Believe I got an extra punch too. Woo hoo! Coffee was great think I was pretty jazzed up for the day. Yay! Excited to see what the food is all about soon.
