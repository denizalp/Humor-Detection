Restaurant Chez Parra is a great little French restaurant in Longueuil, Quebec, which is a suburb of Montreal on the South Shore, just across the waters form that thriving international city.\n\nIt is long and narrow, with a Salon Prive (private room) in the rear, which our party of 6 occupied, amidst original art decorating the walls. The ambiance is simple, understated, casual elegance and cozy. \n\nThe menu has traditional French specialities, such as Foie Gras for appetizer, and mains like Duck l'Orange, Veal, and even Rabbit. There are a few other mediterranean infuences like Canelloni and Carpaccio from Italy and  Paella from Spain, and they have several seafood selections like more than one salmon and a trout dish, as well as other popular meat favorites.\n\nThey have a very affordable 3 course daily  evening special, with appetizer, main and dessert for under $24 CAD (under $20 USD at today's exchange) and most of the entrees a la carte are $18 - $24 CAD,with appetizers in the $6 - $10 CAD range.  They have an adequate wine selection appropriate for their food offerings. \n\nService is very attentive, with the owner\/manager  providing personalized suggestions and service. \n\nThis is mostly a hidden, affordable gem for locals, but if you are ever in Longueuil or along the south shore of Montreal, this would be an excellent, affordable choice for good local French food.
