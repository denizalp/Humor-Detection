I heard so many good things about this place and was so disappointed. The crowd was super lame; a buncha trust fund babies comparing their over the top designer purses and girls that tried to look like they fell out of a sex and the city episode. \n\nLine up was way too long (I waited 45 min in a fake VIP line lol). Plus there was really nothing special about the music. There are far better spots in the lovely Montreal.
