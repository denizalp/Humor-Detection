I met my girlfriend at the Living Room the other night and we had a blast. The food was really good and the drinks were AMAZING. The staff was pushing wine but I wasn't in the mood for that so I tried one of their \"skinny\" cocktails. I was a blueberry martini and it was soooooo delicious. It was the perfect place to relax after work. The decor was very nice, similar to that of a large living room:) Leather couches, long drapery, dark wood furniture, etc.They also have live music. Usually I'm into it but not that evening. His amp was up way too loud for an acoustic performance and we had problems having a conversation, but other than that it was a pleasant experience.
