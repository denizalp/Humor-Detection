Food is bland and portions are really small for the price. They charge way too much for a portion that will not make you full. The butter chicken comes in a small bowl ($14) and it had like 5 pieces of meat. It was so bland. The other dishes we received were just as bland and horrible. All their prices are way overpriced compared to the amount they give you and especially the long wait you have endure to receive your food. \n\nHonestly wouldn't recommend this place, you can get BETTER TASTING food and especially MORE FOOD for a cheaper price. Spent around $35 and it wasn't worth one penny.
