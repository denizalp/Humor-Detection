The sweet cream pancakes here are absolutely delicious. This is my go-to place for pancakes. So far, the best I've had in this city. I sit and daydream about these pancakes during my off-time.\n\nOther food is traditional fare for a local diner: They taste as expected and food is generously portioned. They should have a little something that should satisfy any craving on their menu.\n\nIt's a bit weird eating a meal with surrounded by hundreds of stuffed bears lining the ceiling though. All of that creepiness  is usually  forgotten once that sweet cream pancake hits my tongue.
