How in the world would anyone in the right state of mind give this place anything more than one star? This place was a freaking ripp off! The window latch to my room was broken and this place was so shady! Then the TV didn't work and one of the two light bulbs were out? Really?! The front desk associate was so overwhelmed in the office because he was the only one and we weren't the only guests with issues. He kept on eating chips and you could see the seasoning from the chips build up on his fingers as he pigged out im front of us! The night ended with a broom securing the window. I should slept in the streets for free! Freakin ghetto!
