Good selection of knives, although very cluttered.  The help is hit or miss depending on the day, also.  Don't bother calling the store to ask basic questions about store inventory unless you enjoy being rudely corrected on your knife tastes by an attendant whose knowledge of current knife models is not fully up-to-date..
