Went into this establishment one day when I was hungry for lunch.  There seems to always be a bunch of cars in the parking lot, so I thought it might not be a bad place to try out.  Walked inside and had to wait only 5 minutes for a seat.  The waitress staff at the establishment seems to prefer regulars rather than people that just walk in because it took them almost 15 minutes to come take my order.\n\nThe menu is very basic with not much variety; I decided I would try to play it safe and go with a burger and fries.  Once my order was taken, the food didn't take to long to come out.  The burger was completely bland; it tasted almost like they pulled a patty out of the freezer and grilled it without any seasoning or effort; at least the fries were half decent.\n\nThe prices at this restaurant are a COMPLETE joke only because the food is so terrible. Granted, I only went there once; however, upon telling my friends about the place, they all agreed that it was one of the worst locations for breakfast, lunch, and\/or dinner because of the service, price of the food, and taste.\n\nSTAY AWAY
