About one month ago I called this shop to get prices on brake adjustments on two mountain bikes. My wife has a specialized Enduro and I have a specialized stump jumper .  Both bikes have professional disc brakes. My wife's bike front brake would barely work and The brakes on the rear wheel stumpjumper out what to get stuck and not release the pressure on the disc brakes. I was quoted $12 per wheel for adjustments. When I took the bikes in for service I was told I needed major cleanup and service and it would cost anywhere from $70-$85 each bike. I wasn't happy with the price but I was already there so pretty much I didn't have a choice. A few days later they called me that my bikes are ready.I was charge just under $150. When I got home both my brakes on the stumpumper would get stuck front and back. I took the bike back to the shop and they told me that I left my bike in the heat too much and that is the reason they are getting stuck. I stored the bike inside my garage and I took it back in inside my SUV. They agreed to do an additional tuneup at no extra charge.  The service person called me and told me that they accidentally put some lubricant on my brake pads and they replace it for free at no extra charge. A few weeks later I am was trying to use my bike for the first time just right in my neighborhood along the sidewalk . First time I used the brakes got stuck again. I ended up pushing my bike back home, it was that bad. I am up camping in the woods right now, it is Labor Day weekend and I wish I had my mountain bike here to enjoy the cool weather. \n  I will take my bike back to the shop the third time, as soon as I get back in town. I don't think they did anything wrong they just couldn't find the problem with my bike. I hope they can find the problem this time or I will take it somewhere else. \n  I will update my review and let you know If they did a good job or not.
