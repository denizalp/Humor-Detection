I was excited to find a PGA Grill in Terminal 1, Gate B. I've been to others before and had high expectations. \n\nOpting for Fish & Chips, the meal was disappointing. The fish just lacked the flaky flavor, the few chips were lack luster, and the cole slaw was bland. The meal came with two dipping sauces, dill and aioli (I guess?).\n\nDenny's and my billiards parlor bar, The Broken Rack are much better. \n\nIf not for the kind server, I would have given less stars.
