We were just in Vegas on vacation, and eight of us went to Kabab and more for a late lunch. I admit I was a little hesitant and it didn't look to be in the greatest section of town, down on the strip Toward Circus Circus.  I was very pleasantly surprised to see the menu, literally something for everyone which was difficult with our party. They were for children ranging in age from 5 to 13, and for adults. The menu accommodated everyone with two of the kids getting standard American fare of a hamburger the other one got chicken fingers and french fries. Both of those meals were excellent by the way not cheap frozen nuggets, and the burger was made very nicely with condiments as well as lettuce and tomato, it was very juicy and my son loved it. I was so happy to see Indian food that I love, I got the paneer tikka  masala, along with a side of yogurt and garlic Nan bread. It was very good, not too spicy but plenty of flavor. Or friends each got Biryani rice dishes. My husband got a gyro, he loved it. It's a small place, you go in order your food, pay for it and then sit in the dining room and they will bring it to you when it's ready. The staff was excellent and very accommodating and patient with us and all of our questions. With all the options of places to eat in Vegas I would definitely make another trip to this restaurant because it was delicious, affordable and the choices were many. They also had everything from pizza, to Middle Eastern and Indian foods. I really wish them the best of luck and success with their business because we were very happy and I hope everybody in Vegas has a chance to stop there.
