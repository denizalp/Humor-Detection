You can't go wrong here with everything from sandwiches, salads, pasta, tacos, grilled cheeses and more! You can even choose \"the perfect pair\" which I combined a salad and pasta which was AMAZING. I chose the Wild Chop Salad with their house kale mix (which wasn't too rough as kale can be) and paired it with Toni's  Perfect Pasta which was surprisingly not too heavy as alfredo sauces can be. My friend got the Pesto grilled cheese with sweet potato fries (a lovely no up charge for these!!) and we were both impressed by how beautifully the romano crusted bread was..not just on the crust, but instead the entire slice! \nThe prices and the service are always beyond reasonable and the happy hour looks great too! It's one of our favorite places to hold get togethers when everyone is in town! We all look forward to coming back year after year!
