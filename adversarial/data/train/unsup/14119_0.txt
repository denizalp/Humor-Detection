Adesso Cafe is a small grab and go that carries many of the food and beverage offerings you would find throughout the Pittsburgh. The coffee comes from Commonplace coffee and the espresso comes from LaPrima Espresso in the Strip District. The inside is very small so it is really designed for grab and go.\n\nGrab and go vegan food is available from Reed and Company in Lawrenceville. Baked goods come from LaGourmandine in Mt Lebanon and from Truly Wize bakery in Greensburg. Truly Wize carries both gluten free and some vegan desserts. Check the box carefully if you have concerns.\n\nThe ice cream comes from Millie's in Shadyside however, it is served in small cup containers with a spoon or 4 oz containers. There is no scooped ice cream. Selection was limited since there was a big rush after Memorial Day. They now carry Leona's ice cream from Wilkinsburg.\n\nI have had pretty much all these things on previous visits to these stores and I will admit all of them are very good! Therefore I decided to get the chocolate gluten free vegan cake from Truly Wize bakery. For $3.00 you can't go wrong. The desserts are carefully packaged for take out. Outside there are a few tables and high tops if you want to enjoy your purchase while in the area.\n\nI must admit I loved every bite of this cake and was very pleased with my selection. I love the fact that this little cafe gives a great composite of some of the best coffees, teas, pastries, and food the city has to offer in the Sewickley neighborhood. Located on Walnut St in the town's business district metered street parking is available.
