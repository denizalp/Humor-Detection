I took my mom and daughter for surprise manicures for special occasions and was pleased with the manicures themself. However, my daughter had a male who made her feel bad about her nails and the condition they were in as she has a nervous habit of biting them and he made a point to make fun of them to the technician next to him. He also told her to \"stop biting!\" In a way that made her feel bad. He told me when paying that he had \"worked a miracle\" on her nails as if I should appreciate it. It was not said in a nice way. I will take my business elsewhere. We have been here before, but no one should make a young girl feel bad about the condition of her nails when she comes in!
