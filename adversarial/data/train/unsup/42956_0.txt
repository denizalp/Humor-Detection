I'm writing a second review because my first one doesn't show up. Maybe I needed to be more concise. So I'll just say this - they quote you one price over the phone, make up additional charges once they show up and then make up even more charges once they have all your belongings in their truck. They literally held my belongings hostage until I paid their ransom amount (they didn't provide any kind of itemization of the charges they made up - I have no idea how they came up with amount they charged me). They wouldn't unload anything until I paid (in cash). The invoice they gave me had AZ City Movers listed on it (with their website) - which is a different (reputable) company. I found out their actual name after I filed a complaint with the BBB. On the advice of another yelp reviewer, I also filed a complaint with the AZ Attorney General's consumer complaint dept. Of course, they haven't responded to any of it because they do this all the time (based on the other reviews). I don't understand how they are able to impersonate other moving companies and get away it. Or how they are able to commit consumer fraud and get away with it. The sad part is that this review isn't going to help anyone because his company isn't using its own name - it's only after someone gets screwed by this company that they'll find out how many other people have experienced the same thing.
