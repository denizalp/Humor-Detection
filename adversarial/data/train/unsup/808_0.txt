I've been hearing a lot about True Foods and so we decided to try it since we live so close by. \n\nThe restaurant is modern deco type of place with wood floors and wood tables with lots of green booths inside. Seems like the place is warm and welcoming. The only thing about the inside is that the air conditions is on low and was blowing right at our table. So it was a little cold for our liking but we survived. \n\nI had the bison burger with sweet potato hash. The burger was cooked just right and very juicy. On top of the burger was mushrooms, unmelted provolone cheese, and greens. It was really good. The sweet potato hash was different. Potatoes cut in tiny chunks. I thought that was pretty good as a side with the burger. My wife had the Brown Rice bowl with chicken. It had a lot of green vegetables and was very tasty. My wife said the greens weren't overpowering and just right. Not too much salt. She really enjoyed the bowl. The one thing is they don't give out too big of portions. I would say on the medium side. We all left still a little hungry but to food was very good. \n\nThe service was pretty good. The waitress greeted us once we got to our table and she really knew the menu. She was able to tell us what was the most popular and what she liked. She always made sure we were okay and filled our cups but she really didn't have a personality. Can't blame her cause she was very busy with other table. \n\nOverall, the meal was good and we enjoyed it. We'll probably be back but when who knows.
