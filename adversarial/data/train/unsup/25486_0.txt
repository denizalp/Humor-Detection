My father's birthday is this month and he's visiting from the northeast.  I called to see if they had a strawberry-rhibarb, the pie that was in season when he was growing up. Tonya answered the phone and was able to bake the pie and have it ready that afternoon!\n\nWe brought the pie to a local restaurant to enjoy after a meal. Not only did my kids love their first taste of a strawberry-rhubarb's tangy- sweetness of the fruit with the crunchy sweet crumble topping, but we offered a few pieces to the waitstaff.  They had never had a strawberry rhubarb and loved it! Yum!
