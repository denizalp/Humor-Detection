** Ok so after reviewing my photos I took and refreshing my memory, I bumped it up to 4 stars. The decor is just sex and fabulous. Very hip and modern**\n\nSo from my fellow SPG members, I hear this is one of the top faves. I disagree.\n\nThe hotel is beautiful! Hip, gorgeous decor and a sexy feeling but it's missing that W Hotel nightlife. It's dead here! \n\nThe room is so dark it's ridiculous. I love nice dim sexy lighting but when I say dark I mean DARK. I had to request 3 stand up lamps for my suite and still couldn't properly apply my makeup. I only saw 1 little ceiling light and then the little tiny lamps on the desk. Thats it!\n\nService is ok. I can't comment for sure if they were being rude or just look rude because of their French accent and demeanor. So I'll stay mum on that. The room service was ridiculous. I ordered pancake(s) with some toast. It was around $40 USD. When it arrived it was literally, NOT JOKING, 1 thin A** pancake (as thin as paper, swear!) cut into four pieces. A side of one toast and some fruit. I would need to order 12 of them to get full. Maybe it's just the American in me that is super-sized? Doubt it.\n\nThe decor is beautiful and I had the Extreme Wow I believe (the highest suite), with my own private wrap around balcony. I have inserted pictures as well as indoor pictures. Very beautiful, just needs more lighting! \n\nSPG Customer Service when I checked out on the other hand was fantastic. They refunded me all my room service charges and gave me 10,000 points. The manager there is very hospitable. \n\nWould I stay here again? Unfortunately yes. Why you ask? Well in my opinion its the nicest hotel in Montreal. It's the most hip, centrally located and has the standard W service (I sound contradicting a bit now huh?). But since I have no plans on going back to Montreal and really didn't like the city (yup I said it...gasp!), I don't think I will be needing to make this decision.
