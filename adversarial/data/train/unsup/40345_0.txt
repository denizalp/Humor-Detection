Food is decent but serving is so little. I feel that the dishes are over priced. The ambiance is very cute but it doesn't seem very authentic. The service is good and attentive. I got the salmon panini and strawberry fried toast. Both were good but I really feel I can find a different restaurant that offers better quality and serving portions for the same price. Nonetheless, I don't regret going and trying their food out.
