Except for the Wynn, I've stayed at just about all of the hotels on the Strip over the years.  The Venetian had by far, the most impressive hotel room\/suite I've ever stayed in.  I'm talking about the standard-sized rooms since I'm not a high-roller with the penthouse suite perks.\n\nThe room at the Venetian was huge, about 900 square feet, with a separate, sunken living room.  The bathroom was fairly large with a jacuzzi tub.  The decor was pretty nice and included two flat-screen TVs.  Outside the window was a view of one of the swimming pools which was a bonus.\n\nIf you needed to, you could seriously squeeze 20 people in this room to sleep.  It would be noisy and a bit uncomfortable, but you could do it.
