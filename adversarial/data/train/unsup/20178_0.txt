09\/08\/11\n\nGreat place for gourmet burgers, but pricey!  I was in the area, returning an item at Bev Mo', when I noticed that the burger place I'd been reading about from so many Yelp friends was right next door.  I had just noticed a Now! Groupon deal that morning where $12 bought $20 worth of food there, so I went in and had a look at the menu and decided that the groupon deal was worth checking out.\n\nLooking at the happy hour menu, I see that it's 3:30p-6:30p Sundays (beer \/wine) and Mondays (domestic beer\/sliders) and 4p-close Ladies' Night Tuesdays and Wednesdays (1\/2 off apps and drinks).  I'll have to check HH on a Wednesday soon!\n\nAfter poring over the menu for a few minutes and asking lots of questions (organic and local produce and meats are used whenever possible), I decided to customize a Kobe burger w\/ gruyere, mixed greens, sprouts, grilled onions, and pepperoncini, on an oatmeal-topped wheat bun, with an apricot chipotle sauce.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=7HkjJq2083qp9TxBduhkTw  I upgraded to sweet potato fries for an extra charge.  Sounds great, right?  And it was!  Loved everything on my plate!!  The bun is from a local bakery and made fresh everyday; the veggies were either locally-sourced or organic; and the beef used here are all-natural (no hormones and not GMO).  The sweet potato fries were perfect!!  And the sauce!!  Very tasty- sour-sweet from the apricots, and very spicy!!  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA&select=x6pvF_xqhv5mseBAvyEV6g  I also tried the Mac 'n cheese, w\/ ham (extra fee).  Very, very cheesy, and very, very good!  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=R2QAn4cH5v9Is0CtRpTvew\nDecided to skip on the apps, but what do we have here?  Complimentary homemade parmesan potato chips!  Next time, I'll have to check out one of the \"adult\" milkshakes and remember to make room for dessert!  :))\n\nCan't report on the noise level, since it was pretty sleepy indoors when I stopped in at 345p.  The place looks like it picks up a bit later at night, though... The servers were a bit too cool for my tastes-- warm up the room w\/ a few smiles and courtesy, please!
