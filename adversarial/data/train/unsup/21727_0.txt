I have been to Aunt Chilada's a few times in my Arizona days. \n\nThe most memorable, however, was when one of my friends and I pulled a Little Mermaid and combed our hair with plastic forks before dining here. and i believe we combed our hair with a fork shortly after making a hillbilly joke. ironic :) I don't remember why we looked so horrible but we obviously thought it was bad enough to need to comb our hair with a fork. \n\n\nanyway, the food here has never been memorable or terrible. more like a 'i won't complain if you let me sit on the patio and drink margaritas' \n\nit is definitely a 'meh' experience, but not gross....and probably the best mexican restaurant option if you're in that area. so for that, i am giving it 1 extra star.
