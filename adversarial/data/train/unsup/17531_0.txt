He may be fat, but he is a charmer. \"Charming\" is not a word I use regularly, but it is the perfect word for The Fat Greek. Regardless of the food, the bright blue interior here is the perfect respite from the blazing desert days of Vegas. Right down to the chairs, everything is perfectly coordinated in a blue and white color scheme that makes you feel like you are in a cooler climate. \n\nThe service is also charming. Everyone is personable and easy-going. You can see that there are regulars, as the staff takes time to check up on the happenings in their lives. It definitely has the \"I could be a regular here\" vibe. It's just so darn charming. I simply can't think of a better word!\n\nThe menu has a broad range of Mediterranean offerings, not exclusively Greek, but I would expect a fat Greek to eat a lot of things, right? I shared bean soup, a falafel pita wrap and a Greek salad with some gyro on top with the husband. The portions are generous. For example, the small Greek salad was enough to share given the other items we had ordered. I loved the bean soup, and the salad was fresh with a nice dressing. The falafel pita was beautiful and prepared in a way that made it easy to eat. My husband really liked it, but the falafel had too much parsley for my taste and seemed a little overcooked. I probably would not order the falafel again. However, the soup and salad were winners! Looking around, the kabob plates looked tempting, and it is probably worth exploring some of the authentic Greek options. I just couldn't resist trying the falafel! \n\nNext time, I'm going for the appetizer combo plate.
