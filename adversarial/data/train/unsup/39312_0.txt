Do not rent from Peachtree! I rented an apartment sight unseen (lesson learned) only to find on move in day that it was infested with fleas. When I called the office, they told me that I was lying because there was no way that there were fleas and that if there were any fleas its because I brought them in!! I literally spent 2-3 minutes looking at my new apartment before I got bombarded with the little buggers. Needless to say I wasn't thrilled being called a liar before I ever even moved in and was definitely not paying for pest control service for a place I haven't even lived in yet. I am still waiting to hear if I will get a refund because I am not moving into a place that's infested and the management isn't willing to treat. Really poor office staff full of attitude!
