Not bad, it's a small restaurant amongst the casino and race and sports book area in the Venetian casino. They have a bar area and several tables, but overall, it's a small venue. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table of 5. No biggie, but the number of tables limits the customers from doing what they do best in Vegas...eating.\n\nUnlike some of the other restaurants in a casino area, this one has some great views of the casino floor and the sports book tv's. So you get some entertainment as well.\n\nI got the roast pork and roast duck with rice combination. For a Chinese owned, Chinese cooked, Chinese restaurant, I was a bit disappointed at the roast duck. Not one of the best ones I've had. The roast pork was decent and the white rice...well it's hard to mess up white rice (unless you give me the crusty, burnt up ones that stick to side of the rice cooker) But no...I didn't get the crusty version. It was nice and flaky. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA?select=bX7Hbk4GbIEsYuQGoh4TRw\n\nI'd probably get the fried rice next time. My compatriots in crime got the combination fried rice and they liked it!!!
