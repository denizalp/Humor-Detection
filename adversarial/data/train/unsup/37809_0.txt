Stop by after the Diamondbacks spring training game for drinks & fish tacos. The Hostess sat our party of 4 outside on the patio with Emily as our waitress. Emily was a gem and recommended the the shrimp & cod tacos. Great choice, they were extremely delicious and went well with our margaritas. Emily was exceptional pleasant and always made a point to check on our table no matter how she busy she got. My nephew was in the area and stop by for a drink and a quick bite to eat so we pulled up an unattended patio chair to our table. As we were relaxing and enjoying our conversation the hostess interrupted and pretty much scolded us that we are not allow to pull up an extra chair to our table and stormed away mad. We all could not believe what just happen. The hostess turn a pleasant 5 star dining experience to the worst by choosing to be rude, distasteful and ruining our Diego Pops restaurant experience. Sadly, my family & friends will not be returning as there are plenty of restaurants to choose from who will treat customers as 5 Stars. Why should I settle for less.
