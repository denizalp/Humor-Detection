I absolutely love this place. Simple, real, and beautiful. Everything is fresh and authentic, and the service is always great. Their bistec is to die for, especially in their deadly-fried but awesome quesadillas. A little beat-up atmosphere-wise, but the people make it great. The attached market is a nice stop for bringing flavors home with you.
