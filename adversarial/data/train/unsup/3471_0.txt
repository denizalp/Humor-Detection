I came here with family for a late lunch.  Chelsea's kitchen sounds like a casual kind of place but was pleasantly surprised at the fountain outside, sea salt cookies upon arrival and the cozy vibe inside, equipped with a fireplace. The wait to sit on the patio was almost 30 minutes for our party of 6 so we sat inside because we were hungry. The patio looked beautiful and it was a beautiful day so that was disappointing.  Instead, we were seated in a booth that barely fit everyone,  very squishy and uncomfortable.  I got the dreaded corner seat. We immediately order a pitcher of sangria,  which was poured for us table side. Very delicious, easy to get a few of these down. Service was nice and attentive.  We got the chicken nachitos to start and a huge plate of deliciousness arrived before us. The plate was filled with chips, rotisserie chicken,  guacamole,  salsa, sour cream and jalape√±os.  Needless to say, they were a huge hit.\n\n As I looked over the menu to order an entree,  nothing really sounded good to eat. No sandwiches were on the menu,  which would have been a nice lunch option. Salads, tacos, burgers and an random selection of appetizers are the choices down this one page menu. Prices were outrageous, anywhere from $11-30 for a lunch entree. For an LGO concept, this was a disappointment. My sister and I settled on splitting a caesar salad with chicken. Salad came split and was delicious.  I also heard the howie burger was amazing from a family member who ordered it, but didnt try it. My aunt ended up only ordering sides because nothing appealed to her. So, the food we ate was good, absolutely no complaints.\n\nWould I come back? Probably if I was invited. I much prefer LGO down the street though.
