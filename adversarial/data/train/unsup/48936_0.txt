I can't say enough about my favourite lunch spot in Charlotte. Is the sushi the absolute best? No, but it is delicious! and for the price, incredible. I like the variety they offer and service and staff are always friendly. Their spring rolls are incredible and I love the bite-sized cakes too. My only tip would be to go early!! I can not stress enough how packed this place gets. They open at 11:30 and there were people waiting in their cars at 11:00 am - it was like feeding time at the zoo.
