Absolutely love this location. I used to frequent the one on the eastside when I worked down there, and this is a huge step up! Though I do love the small \"taco truck\" feel of the east location, the one in Henderson is great. Huge building, upscale look and feel, and a bar! The lines can get a little confusing if you're new, but just know if you want tacos, stand in the line for the meat that you want. If you want burritos or bowls, stand in the line to the left. Once you get your food, move on to the register. Their jalapenos and onions at the salsa station are to die for, and there are so many salsa options as well. I'm doing low carb, so I got a barbacoa bowl with no rice or beans, but previously loved their Grande Tacos. Two corn tortillas with melted cheese in between, and double meat. Their carne asada fries are pretty massive and loaded as well (though again, low carb... so I didn't touch them lol)
