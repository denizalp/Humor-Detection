I went with my friend to Ink Therapy for her 18th birthday to get her first tattoo. Her appointment time was 6:15. At 5:15 she got a call saying something came up and her appointment would now be 7:30. We weren't concerned, things come up, no big deal. So we got there at 7:30 and were told it'd be at least another hour. At nine a asked the counter girl if she could get an estimated time because it would only be my friend's birthday for another 3 hours. His answer: \"Not my fault, not my problem.\" At this point, we were both irritated. Her appointment was now 2 hours later than anticipated and her other plans were being postponed. Finally, her artist was ready for her at 9:45, a full 3 and a half hours late. And boy o boy, was he friendly. \n\nHe started by saying he wouldn't hesitate to kick me out without legitimate cause. While working on her outline, on her ribs, she experience some minor involuntary muscle spasms. Not her choice, not preventable. Justin, the artist, then told her that if she twitched again, he'd kick her out with half an outline. When he was finally finished, my friend was in tears from being threatened and insulted and I was livid. He said, verbatim, that \"septum piercings are so ugly and girls with them are gross\".\n\nHi, my name's Julia and I have a very obvious ring in my septum.\n\nHe finished up with aftercare and calling me annoying. The only thing I said the entire time was telling my friend that the tattoo was coming along well, looking good, and that she could handle it. Good to know he finds compliments and encouragement annoying. Maybe he'll like this review better.\n\nThe result of this? She's going to another shop for her color and, despite the quality of their work, I will never send anyone there to be insulted and ridiculed.
