The product is easy to use and set up, but if you need Customer Support, clear your schedule for the next week and make sure your cell phone charger is near by, I spent most of the past 3 days on hold with these idiots and when I finally get through I got disconnected. Their web chat can't do anything, until I threatened to pack up the system and ship it back and go to their competitor, now I wait for an escalated customer retention support call back. I will update when and if they call me back.
