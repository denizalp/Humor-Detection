This is a review I could not even imagine I would be writing. At least I know this will make for a good story later on.\n\nI visit Ka Mei a few times every month because the Cantonese food is subtle and really tasty. It's the real deal. Her congee is good, her noodles are good, and her snow pea greens are good. I love the food. I even appreciate the lady behind the counter who takes her business and food very seriously.\n\nToday when I went in to pick up my order, there were two other customers waiting for their orders. The place was very busy, and the owner was handling a lot of stuff in the kitchen. I paid for my order, grabbed the bag, and as I was walking out, I heard the other two customers talking about the picture menu the restaurant has on its wall. They were trying to puzzle through a dish that was there, and I offered one idea since I had had chinese broccoli before. Out of nowhere I feel (and hear) a smack on my butt! I wish I could say I was joking here, but obviously the owner thought I was saying something wrong, because she had run past the counter and smacked me square on the ass (I guess as if you would spank a child?). She then pointed to the bag in my hand, the door, and only said \"your order is ready.\" No other explanation. Dumbfounded at something I didn't ever foresee happening while I picked up some takeout, I just left.\n\nI am a frequent customer, but I don't think I've reached a level of familiarity with any restaurant owner such that I would be comfortable being spanked. If it was done in jest, it was done so in very, very poor taste. I am sad now because I really enjoy their food, but don't ever feel comfortable returning. It goes to 0 stars for the battery, but gains 1 back because the food really is delicious. Good lord.
