If you're driving by looking for this place, you can totally miss it. It's a very small, cute place located downtown on 7th & Carson St. I got to known of this place through a friend. \n\nUsually the wait for this place is pretty long & people are hanging out outside waiting to be called in. Fortunately, today the odds were on our favor! No wait to be seated! \n\nWe first had ordered strawberry cinnamon biscuits which were to die for! They were biscuits swimming in this strawberry jam sauce. It wasn't too sweet but decently sweet enough. \n\nI had ordered the Shrimp & Grits! Which is, hands down, the BEST, grits I ever had. Usually restaurants over cook or under cook grits but this place makes it to perfection. It had picco di gallo on top which added a Little kick in your mouth. The bacon on the bottom just added the necessary flavors to this dish. I finished the whole thing! & could've licked the bowl but controlled myself.\n\nOnly thing I really had an issue with was the wait to get our food. Due to the table next to us of 3 men that practically ordered the whole menu, we had to wait a long time for our food. The men were extremely entertaining because one guy would net pick the dishes to the waitress-- \"this needed more salt\" or \"would have tasted better seared\" LOL! But anyways, it was defiantly worth that wait!
