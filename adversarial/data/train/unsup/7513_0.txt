DON'T GO TO HAKKASAN! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! IT'S NOT WORTH IT! WASTE OF TIME & MONEY!\nI wish there was negative stars to give...\n Went on 5\/5\/13 Cinco De Mayo to see Tiesto & the experience was Horrible from the beginning, a lot of ass hole bouncers that don't really know how to do their job right, a chubby short white bouncer was checking my ID \"California's Driver's license\" & he didn't \"THINK\" it was valid!! he tried to act all tough & smart ass in front of the ticket girls and he wanted to see another ID I didn't want to give him another ID because he didn't make any sense, he asked me to step outside & I asked him to get me his boss & then the manager let me in right away after he saw my ID  & he even asked the bouncer \"what's your problem\".\n \nThat was just the beginning, then going inside you have to go up the stairs for like 2 levels, I'm sure it's fun for everybody with a buzz specially girls with high heels, then inside the club it's a different story, the club is too small for all the advertising and DJ line up, those DJS deserve a better venue, no matter where you are you won't be able to see the DJ unless you made it to the dance floor through all the squished people, it's mostly made for bottle service tables all around the club, you can't stand anywhere to see whoever is spinning unless on the dance floor, the dance floor was super packed to the point that you can't move a muscle or dance & bouncers keep pushing people in to keep them off the bottle service tables!!  I couldn't stay on the dance floor for more than 5 mins then anywhere  I went there's a bouncer asking to keep walking, to where I didn't know, went to the second floor though it might be a better place to see Tiesto spinning from up there but it was also all surrounded with bottle service tables, also the second levels speakers weren't working!! so you only listen to the music playing on the main floor!!\n\nI also had a cigar they asked me to put it out saying you can't smoke cigars but you can smoke cigarrettes!! I've never seen or heard about something like that any where in the world!! Even Tiesto when he got on the stage he didn't look happy at all, probably cause he got stuck with his residency there, without really knowing what is he getting himself to... I've been to Tiesto in different Venues in Vegas & LA & hes always smiling & in a good mood, the club was way too CROWDED for anybody to enjoy I guess even Tiesto himself.. couldn't stay there more than an hour & then me & my friends left...So far nothing beats XS & Marquee...I'd never go back to Hakkasan even if it's free!! That's how bad my experience was!!
