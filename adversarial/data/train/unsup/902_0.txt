I went to this salon to bleach my hair for the first time. They let me talk to a color tech. for free and they gave me helpful advise before I was even a customer! Everyone at the salon is really kind & seem open to having a conversation, which is nice when your bored at a hair salon for 2-3 hours. You can ask for tea, water, or coffee which is rad too.\nThey have different stylist you can go too and depending on their experience they cost less or more. Honestly, even if you go with someone who has less experience they have experts beside them who they can consult. I personally go with a newer person to cut my hair & an expert to bleach it. \nThe only problem I have with this salon is that since they've been bleaching my hair it has this unintentional ombr√©, that I really don't like. I've been there 3 times since I've complained about it and each time I leave with it still being in my hair!!  Also I asked for my hair to be blond and currently I think it looks really yellow and it has with grey-purple streaks...\nOverall the place is nice, the staff is nice, but my hair doesn't look so great. For a hair salon that's a problem...
