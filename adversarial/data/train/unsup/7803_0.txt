This is one of my favourite Canadianized Chinese restaurants (I know, I know....I probably need to return my Chinese card for saying that I actually LIKE a place like this).  Their fried rice has a decent amount of egg in it - unlike many Canadianized\/fake Chinese food restaurants - and the chicken balls are not just about the batter.  They're a very generous size, too.  What could be a bit better is flavouring in some of their main dishes (especially chicken with mushrooms).\n\nNote:  I have never eaten in the restaurant.  This is based on delivery via Just-Eat.
