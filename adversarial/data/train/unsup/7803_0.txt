I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich and it was SOOO good. It was hot and fresh when I received it & it was in a pizza type dough bread. Very different. The sandwich was so big I could only eat half and took the rest with me. I highly recommend the sandwich!Yum. Service from waiter was just \"okay\" as he didn't seem to know the sides when I asked him. Although he seemed to know when he was going over them with the other table - not very consistent. I had to ask because I didn't seem to see the types of sides they had. \n\nAs far as decor, it needs updating. Looks kinda old school. Had a decent lunch. However not really impressed with anything.
