Olive and Ivy is a solid choice in the Scottsdale area for a decent lunch and a glass of wine. I probably wouldn't wait more than 25 minutes for a table, there are other restaurants in the area I would prefer to eat at. \n\nI had a business lunch here the other day, we split the bruschetta (the pear and avocado options were delicious). I ordered the Mediterranean salad (much larger than I was expecting but a decent salad). \n\nWe were lucky enough to have good weather and could enjoy the patio and view of the canal.
