They said 15-25 minutes for wait and it was on point. The nuts and rolls are to die for, per usual. Friendly and upbeat server. The kids were given an upgraded drink with lids, perfect. Oh and when one decided to throw a tantrum during ordering, the server was calm and didn't skip a beat. Salads came out promptly and were tasty. The steaks and kids meal then took about a half hour to arrive. The manager apologized as did our server. Honestly, wasn't that long but kids were restless. Food came, it was consistent Texas Roadhouse and we were satisfied. The manager didn't give us a discount but actually gave us the entire bill for free. I'm shocked because we didn't ask for anything and he was generous and just a real pleasure. That act is something that will keep me returning to this restaurant, time and time again. Kudos TR, I'm forever a fan.
