I have many of their titles, but wasn't expecting a lot when we bought tickets for our Anniversary trip to Vegas in May, 2013.... Boy, was I surprised! Had front row seats, right at the foot of the steps where Sean gave out roses.... I didn't get one, but got hit over the head by a woman behind me, trying to grab one.... WOW.... FOR A ROSE?..... But I digress.. The show was fabulous! During their Motown tribute, they sang \"Reach Out I'll Be There\"... Wanya walked down the steps and sang directly into my cellphone! What a treat! Yes, I posted to youtube... Don't even hesitate... This is well worth the money... I have a very memorable souvenir... Much better than that rose I got hit in the head for!
