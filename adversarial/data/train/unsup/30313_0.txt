Service was OK, food was terrible. Wife and I were both starving, and I made the mistake of letting her choose this place because she liked the ambience.  Wife ordered chicken salad and Burger was awful had no flavor. I orders Mac n Cheese, and fish and chips. OK didn't expect the best fish & chips, but how can u screw up Mac N Cheese! The box from store has more flavor. Everything was bland, no spices or any flavor and chicken in the salad was not fresh and we couldn't taste any dressing. For the price!!! Never coming back here again.
