The food is good (check previous reviews), but my most recent visit was very bizarre.  I had the same server as I have the past 10 or so times I've been in here, an older woman.  There was one other customer in the restaurant and Fox News was on the TV going on about the Trayvon Martin case.  \n\nThe server started talking to the customer about how casinos don't put up with people wearing hoodies, how there was a \"weird Asian kid\" who came in yesterday who wore a hoodie and baseball cap, and there's a reason so many black people are in jail.\n\nMeanwhile I'm sitting like 10 feet away, wearing a hoodie and cap, and I'm half-black (very visibly not white).  What the hell?\n\nI'll never be going back again, that's for sure.
