My husband suffered with lower back pain and sciatica for over  2 years. It became impossible for him to do the most ordinary things, riding in a car, walking in a grocery store. He explored pain management and went through 2 series of expensive injections with poor results. His insurance changed with a  change in employment and he started over again with Nevada Orthopedic and Spine Center. He took his MRI's to Dr. Patrick McNulty. He showed us that his spine had curved, causing it to pinch the nerves within the column.  Dr. McNulty was very thorough in explaining what the condition of the spine was and the procedure that he thought would give him a better quality of life. My husband had 6 hours of surgery, fusion of part of the spine, and 2 rods put in on either side to keep the spinal column straight. My husband is now living the life he only dreamed of. After a stint in rehab, he went home pain free and he is enjoying good health. Dr. McNulty is a skilled surgeon and consummate professional. He cares for the patient's  complete health, not only the orthopedic part. As our primary physician told us, \"Only a handful of surgeons in Las Vegas are able to do what Dr. McNulty can do.\" We are so grateful to him and his staff.
