I purchased a vehicle for my daughter as her graduation present. Prior to me picking up the car I was told it didn't pass emissions so it was being repaired. The part that was repaired was the catalyst converter. The vehicle passed emissions however, an aftermarket part was used so the wiring of the car had to be rigged. I took it to a Nissan dealership as well as a local repair shop. They advised the repairs were done incorrectly and done so to save money. I spoke with the owner Jack who told me his job was to have the car pass emissions and that's it! I didn't agree with the repairs and asked to return the car but he refused. I didn't feel the repairs would be safe enough for a first time driver. Jack told me he would guarantee the part. It hasn't been a year and the car is experiencing issues with the so called new part they installed in the car. I contacted the dealership as he guaranteed the part and now Jack advised he never promised me to warranty the part. The warranty he referred to was 15 days or 500 miles. Who guarantees a new part for only 15 days when the standard warranty is usually a year or two. Now he's refusing to assist with the vehicle he sold me which from the beginning had the issues. When someone tells you their only job is to make the car pass emissions, that statement alone tells you what type of business they are running. Unfortunately, I found out the hard way.
