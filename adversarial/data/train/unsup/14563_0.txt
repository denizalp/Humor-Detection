$5 per person to hike. Very confusing, not paved. You pay at the deposit\/fee box at the entrance of greenway. For a precise address, go to the website and select visit. You will find the exact address with directions for all the sites, diary farm, horsebarn, trail, dog park etc. The horseback riding is $15 per person. Poop bag at the entrance of trail. No trash cans. No water source, so bring plenty. The trail gets confusing, so hike with a partner. The plus is that everyone here is very nice and most people follow the rules and are respectful. We came in the winter so it wasn't thats scenic. The trail can be better marked that way you know how far you have gone and how many more miles to go. The maps here suck, it's not of the park\/trail, instead it's directions on how to get to the park...seriously if i am here already i dont need to know how to get here
