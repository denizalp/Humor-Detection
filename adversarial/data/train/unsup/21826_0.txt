Well Patty you're right!  There are lots of bad things to share about the Golden Palm.  But I feel we should shed a tear for the end of an era. (All be it short and not really an era.) And a 5 star salute to trash.\n\nThe Golden Palm is talked about frequently and frequented for it's lack luster Karaoke nights.  Frankie Almost has quite a following there, I wonder what will happen to his Kroaking minions?\n\nSo let's bow our heads and say good night to the best place in town to get a pitcher of Pabst and sing Pat Benetar while checkin' out Tranny Pro's at the front door.\n\nSuch color, I wonder what it's next incarnation will be, most likely knocked down to make way for a new condo high rise that most of us \"common\" folk won't be able to afford.\n\nWeep, weep. OH,and ,yeah Patty, a $125 weekend stay would have been awesome, I weep for the passing of that also.
