I didn't even get any food here. But let me tell you why I'm writing a review.\n\nMy friends and I had traveled into Toronto from America and parked in front of this shop. We had never been to Toronto before. We walked around and checked out a few stores in the area before deciding we were ready to go. When we got back, our car was gone. *gasp* So we walked into the store and asked if they had seen what happened to our car. Next thing we heard: \"ohhhhh that was your car? Yeah, they towed it.\" *sad face* okay so we sadly walked out of the shop. Apparently Toronto tows your car if you park on the street during rush hour. So anyways. As we're heading down the street, one of the guys from The Hungry Butcher (I later found out his name was Nikolai) ran out to us and asked if we would like for him to call the tow company. Being from America, our cellular plans were not ideal for international phone calls.\n\nLong story short, he called around (even stayed on hold a couple times) and found out where our car had been taken, got the address for us and told us the best way to get there. Nikolai was soooo nice and really went out of his way to help a few strangers who obviously don't read signs. This place has GREAT customer service and I would for sure shop here if I ever find myself in Toronto again.
