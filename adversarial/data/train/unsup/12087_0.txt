61B Cafe was an impulse stop in my life, and I am still unsure of my overall feelings months later.  It is a cute little cafe style store with indoor and outdoor seating.  My friend and I ordered a raspberry pastry ($2.50) and Pellegrino sodas.  The raspberry pastry was ok but not too special.  There were a variety of soda flavors, which was nice.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the service is a tad off-putting.  It is cash only, and they are definitely rude about it if you don't notice the tiny sign.  Still tbd on my feelings.  I guess it was just OK, but I don't know that I would come back.
