Sitting next to the head chief and his family. Sweet, he has given us a guided tour of the menu. No time limit on AYCE! Love the sashimi it came on a platter with salmon, albacore, tuna and yellowtail belly\" not on AYCE\" melt in your mouth delicious. Pictures of AYCE food and desert included in all you can eat. \n\nI trust your dinning experience will as great without Ryan Akagi Head Sushi chief leans over see you Yelping and introduces himself & family and recommends his personal favorites. Vegas is all about personal service Jamie and the staff provided in readable service. \n\nHe works at the one on Rainbow but lives close to Sahara. In on this day off that is know the fish is fresh and the atmosphere is mellow.
