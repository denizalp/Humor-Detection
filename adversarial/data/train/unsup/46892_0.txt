This is for Dr Jason Morris, who is an endodontist in Shalev's clinic.  I'm terrified of dentists and have had negative experiences with several.  I've had root canals -- one not so bad, one not so good, and one that was full on brutal.  I had to have another root canal and after having been recommended by a dental tech, went to Dr Jason Morris in Henderson.  He has a kind and comforting manner (which in itself is a big plus), and he did a root canal that was pain free, as in, completely and totally pain free.  And for me, that's a particularly big deal because I have heart issues and cannot have epinephrine, which means that regular novacaine, with it's long-lasting-hyper- numbing properties is out.  Dr Morris used carbocaine, and even with it's both lesser numbing ability and not being terribly long lasting, the root canal was neither scary nor painful -- I felt nothing that hurt, and none of that horrible sensation when they hit a nerve.  NONE.  I cannot recommend Dr Jason Morris highly enough -- he's FABULOUS.
