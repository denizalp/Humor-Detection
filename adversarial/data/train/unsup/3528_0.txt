Going a few more times since last review, I think that the banality that is this place drags it out of the 3 stars range. If friends suggest Guido's, which they often do, because it is a vanilla compromise place, I cringe. I still go along, but my heels drag on the way there, and my feet get itchy after half a beer.\n\nThere are a million places just like Guido's on the North Side of Chicago, and I think that a high proportion of the patrons here represent next year's crop of Chads and LP Trixies. Guido's isn't 100% a Campustown bar, but its on the way. Teej T.'s observation re: the crowd is 100% accurate, and unfortunately asshats like this are more the rule than the exception. \n\nFood is pretty decent, prices a little on the high side for pub grub, but a good value for lunch. The place gets pretty crowded on Thurs-Sat nites, and the service gets understandably slow then. Good, but stingily-portioned onion ring sides. I say if you're gonna upcharge me for onion rings, I want a lot of 'em.\n\nObjectively, the place is 'fine' in a ho-hum way. Subjectively, the intangible anti-culture, anti-intellectualism, anti-anything that is novel, interesting, and unique in favor of everything that is popular, faux-hawked, slutty, and top-40 brings this place down a peg.
