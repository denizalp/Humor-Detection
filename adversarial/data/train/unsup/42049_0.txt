I came here twice, once for lunch and second time for Sunday brunch with guest on wheelchair. The place is right on the water edge, both indoor and outdoor seating with unobstructed view.\nDeco is modern, quiet, food is good and service is nice. The location is great for taking a stroll along the waterfront with lots to see close by. Definitely a hidden gem in Pickering!
