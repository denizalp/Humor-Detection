Staying at The Palazzo makes me want to come to Vegas more often.\n\n* Huge room with sunken living room, desk with a fax machine, a big sectional sofa & a round dining table with 3 chairs\n* Great views of Treasure Island across the street (and the fireworks at the end of the show) & the mountains in the distance\n* Three TVs (living room, by the bed, & in the bathroom)\n* Big jacuzzi bathtub & separate shower stall\n* Private-feeling door-ed off toilet enclosure \n* Vanity table in bathroom & double sinks\n* Bathrobes & slippers in the closet\n* Remote controlled window shade & drapes\n* Refrigerator (note: it's stocked with stuff that, if you move any of it, adds charges to the room)\n* Easy walking to shops & restaurants as well as bars & the casinos on both The Palazzo & The Venetian sides\n* A Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf just downstairs\n* Gracious & friendly service throughout the hotel\n* Free wifi\n\nMy one suggestion would be to offer more outlets next to the bed.  Why don't all hotels just use bedside lamps that have outlets in their bases?  Regardless, this has definitely been my fave Vegas hotel experience!
