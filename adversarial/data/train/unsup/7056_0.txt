I discovered Soma three years ago and haven't bought bras anywhere else since. The ladies that work at the boutiques understand that their jobs require a certain amount of forced intimacy and take their duties both seriously and with levity. They'll do a fitting for you if you want (I highly recommend it, we're almost always wrong in what we think we should wear) and if you don't want, they'll fetch what you need if you need it.\n\nThe sales are always excellent and if you belong to their Passport program, you can receive up to 40% off on occasion. Sizing is for everyone, from a's up to double and triple letters. The bras aren't cheap, but they are the best quality of any I've ever experienced. It's well worth the drive to Crack...er, Crocker Park.
