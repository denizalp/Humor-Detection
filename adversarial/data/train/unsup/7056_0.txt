We go to Nacho Daddy every other Wednesday for trivia night. We couldn't ask for better service. Johnny and Angie are always there right away to take our drink order and then continue to come back throughout the night to check on us and get us what we need, before we have to ask. I highly recommend Nacho Daddy for Johnny and Angie's service alone!!!
