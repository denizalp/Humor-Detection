The majority of my reviews are generally not \"positive\" ones. However, my recent visit (this evening) to Ping Pong Thai was a very pleasant surprise. Here is the lowdown: \n\n1. Well received upon entering\n2. Drink orders taken promptly\n3. Courteous and genuine \/ sincere service\n4. Server touched the table 3 or 4 times \n5. Thanked for doing business there\n6. Invited back \n7. Prices are about right (not cheap \/ not too pricey)\n\nAreas of improvement recommended: \n\n* Music to set some sort of mood \/ atmosphere \n* Server could highlight some of the specials \/ recommend some specific dishes\n\nOverall, I was very pleased and definitely plan on returning.
