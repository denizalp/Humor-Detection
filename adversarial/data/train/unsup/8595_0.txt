(I can't believe I'm writing this...) \n\nMore funny than arousing. It's fun to watch them dance just to see it once. Almost all the girls called on stage were celebrating their birthday or their last days of singledom. And almost all were wearing a tiara or sash of some sort. Hahaha.\n\nI've seen the road show and the Vegas one is much better. More dudes, better dance numbers, and more crazy to watch. The crowd has more young fans, too. But even the Vegas show had its fair share of cougars. Ooh lawd.. \n\nThe bartenders are awesome. They bring the drinks to you. And same as the road show, the cast gets off stage and might dance with you. \n\nNow for the kicker, you won't see anything unless you are one of the girls chosen to sit on the stage. (My friend mumbled grumpily afterward, \"Tease...\") So all you nymphos get your sash and tiara on!\n\nAs for me? The guys were ok. The Latino motorcycle mohawk dude from Zumanity looked way better than anyone here. But the Vegas dudes looked better than the road show ones. Hahaha.
