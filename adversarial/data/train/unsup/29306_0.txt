Bottiglia Cucina & Enoteca is an Italian cuisine restaurant located in the green valley ranch casino and hotel. The restaurant provides rustic Italian food, fancy cocktail and wine as well. \n  I love the décor very much in here. The restaurant has low table, high table, bar sitting as well as a private dining area. I had seen someone hold a private party at the dining room, so fascinating. On the outside, they also have a Italian countryside style bicycle, which is perfect for photoshoot.  \nWine and cocktail are so great at here. I ordered white sangria and endless summer.  The ice on the wine has flower in it, the server told me that the ice are not made from pure water, after the ice melted into the wine, the wine will have another flavor. As for the endless summer, it has a very fresh taste, great drink on the hot summer time. The coconut and pineapple fresh your mouth; the citrus gives the drink a little sour and bit taste. A great cocktail to start the meal.\nFood is amazing. I would say it is the best Italian food in town, for me at least. Wood roasted tomato soup has the sour and salty flavor. The flavor is really impressive to me. Some people may think that it is a special, even wield taste, but I really like it. The bread serving before the meal is amazing. The bread includes parmesan crispy flake, French baguette, cheese bar and cranberry walnut bread. The flake is extra crispy and tastes fantastic with the butter. Butter is honey-lemon infused. The taste is fresh and great. The cranberry walnut one is my favorite. It is just fairly sweet. The main entrée I chose is the braised short rib. I chose medium for my rib. The meat tastes fresh and oily. It smells fragrant. The shape and decoration of my dish is attractive. I really enjoyed my entrée. The portion for the short rib is really big. Even if the rib tastes really good, I cannot finish it by myself as a girl.
