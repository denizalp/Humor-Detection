Had a great experience here.  My waitress was wonderful.  Started with the charred octopus....best thing I had.  Wanted to try the uni (sea urchin).  I got the sashimi version...3 pieces with a grated jalapeno and strawberry chip.  It was perfect.  Followed those with two sushi rolls.  Very good, Not sure I think they were that much better than what you would get at any other sushi restaurant for less money.  I would definitely come back here.   I loved that I actually saw Chef Moonen at the restaurant.  Hoping to come back in May.
