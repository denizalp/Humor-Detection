The food is great, but the dining area is unbelievably loud, the indoor seating is cramped and they are incredibly busy. Half the time when I come here, I end up waiting for 20 minutes for a table, giving up, and going across the street to Lao Laan Xang. If you have the time to sit around for half an hour waiting for a table, and don't mind a loud environment, you will at least enjoy some pretty good \"elevated diner food\".
