So we brought our kids here for breakfast before hitting the road to Tucson for a college graduation. We were all really pleased with the food. Biscuits were soft and humongous! The pancakes were great, my son said his omelette was delicious. The wait time was short and the waitress was on top of things. Overall it was an above average experience and I can't wait to go back again. If it's just as good of an experience I will probably put up an extra star.
