Absolutely love the NoDa Company Store! Laid back, perfect place to just chill and have some drinks. \n\nIt's a cozy old house in NoDa. Great outdoor area in the front yard, fantastic large patio area in the back with picnic tables and a little stage. On the side of the house, there's a line of porch swings. I love it. \n\nThey have housemade sangrias, local beers on draft, and bottles of wine. There are different food trucks throughout the week. On Sundays, the owners do free lunch. That's already super cool, and this makes it even cooler: they do a Facebook live on Sunday morning while they are in the kitchen preparing and cooking the meal. \n\nMake sure to follow them on FB so you can keep up with special events and food truck schedules. Thank you Joey and Scott for opening such an amazing community oriented spot in NoDa!
