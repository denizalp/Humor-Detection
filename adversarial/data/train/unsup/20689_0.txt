First time using the company. Was initially very apprehensive since it was the lowest priced option. Was AMAZED with their service! No high pressure sales on all the extras, free upgrade for the \"inconvenience\" of a couple extra minutes of waiting at the counter while they would find a car, super fast and high tech (ipad) car pick up and return! Upon return person inspected car and sent receipt and proof of no damages to my email. Will from now on only rent from Sixt where available.  Oh and they are a european company that has been around for 100 years!!!:)
