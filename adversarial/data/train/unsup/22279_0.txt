The AAA affiliate of the New York Mets is know as the Las Vegas 51's.  A pretty competitive team in the league the last few seasons with several players getting called up to the big leagues.  The Baseball team provides some great family friendly entertainment during the summer months.  Their calander is filled with give aways, promo nights, fireworks displays and my favorite  $1 beer night on Thursdays.  These game nights can get pretty packed.\n\nThe 2016 season is over.  Some tips for next year though, park at the Government building across the street and walk over to avoid costly parking fees.  Check your mailbox often for those mailers to get BOGO ticket offers. Fill your pockets with peanuts and cracker jack before entering. Beware they offer a Yelp check in offer for a free 51's hat that they will not honor. And will complain about how they have been contacting Yelp to have it removed. \n\nOtherwise these 51's games are alot of fun.  Prices start at $12 for adults and kids 4 and under are FREE!
