Smoke n Go can be found in Huntersville at the Cashion's at the corner of Sam Furr and Catawba on most Saturdays. Not sure of the rest of their schedule though. \n\nMy hunger and their appearance never seemed to be in synch until today. To celebrate, I had a chopped pork sandwich that was HUGE. I'm not kidding. Could have easily been two sandwiches. It had a good smokey flavor, all meat, no fat, good bark and was served with a Western North Carolina type sauce and some coleslaw on top of a sesame seed bun. I have to say that it was pretty damn good and I look forward to another visit to try some more of their fare.
