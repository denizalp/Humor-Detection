Sooo Disapointed!!\n\nI gave this salon 2 chances.  My last visit was very disappointing. My hairdresser was running behind so her assistant got me seated in the chair. Then my Hairdresser began the color, that was it!!  I was taken to the hair dryer and sat there Forever!  \nThen the assistant washed my hair, and took me to a corner chair with no mirror. Honestly it was terrible. I had to ask for my purse back, because someone else was already in my hairdressers chair. I guess that client was worth more money.\nThen the assistant attempted to dry and style my hair. It was a mess, no style,not even dry. \nWhen she was done the hairdresser came over to check and trim my bangs. I said \" I'm not done am I\" my hair looked like I just woke up. \nShe apologized for her assistant and said \"she was still learning\". Really??? \nShe was in a hurry to get back to what she was doing, and was not interested in correcting the problem. \n$100.00 later, I went home trimmed my bangs and washed my hair and thought why did I ever go there.
