Thank you Minit Lube for just being helpful and kind! I was driving home from work with low pressure in my two front tires. I saw it earlier and I could feel it as I was driving. And since I had gone to this location a couple times for oil changes and the service was great I decided to just drive in and see if they could check my tire pressure and maybe top it up with some air.\n\nThey did it no problem. They suggested what was open around in the area in case I need more service. The staff was kind and easy-going and helpful. The kind woman working there just checked my pressure, filled it up with a smile and told me to have a great weekend.\n\nReally cool. I've only had good experiences here. They've always only ever been truly helpful. Plus it is a convenient location. It's right off of Macleod Trail. And the store set up is equally as convenient. You just drive in and the equipment is set up for them to work on your car right there and then.
