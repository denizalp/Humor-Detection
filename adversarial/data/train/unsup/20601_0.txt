Best buffet on the strip!!\n\nDidn't like paying Holiday prices on a Saturday-2 days AFTER the holiday. We paid $59.99 a person for brunch!!\n\nI had a whole bunch of things! From Dimsum to Pizza! From Salad and to Mexican food! Beef lasagna, mac & cheese, biscuits and gravy! I was in carb heaven!! \n\nLoved this place! I would visit here every single time I'm in Vegas!!
