Came here on the night of Trevor Ariza's birthday bash..& was looking forward to get a possible photo for the bf....\n\nWe arrived & they gave us free drink cards& the place was nothing special I've seen clubs in LA that are bigger & better..place was packed but for the obvious event going on..one of my friends got invited some seriously creepy & I mean creepy dude @ his company's vip table...had 1-2 glasses of the goose & cran..finally Ariza comes out & is sitting with a bunch of dirty girls from the club who can't dance for shizzz.......so we walk up & try to get a pick being Lakers fan & all .....\n\nAriza is a big douchebag!! He saw us & was distracted by the blonde ho that was opening her legs all spread eagle in front of his face wtf...hells no I'm not about to get down like that for a damn photo... this followed by our group to chant \"trader\" & of course \"Ron Artest! Ron Artest!\" yes & then as we go back into the vip some dude sitting at the table ..told my friend as she was trying to refill her cup ..\"hey what the hell are you doing I dont know you this is our bottle\" & literally took her empty cup of ice away from her wtf dude & the guy that invited the group didn't even say anything...the nerve of these loser dudes that save up their paycheck from cvs & think they're  ballin!\n\nso we left & as we left the bouncer\/ promoter then literally came running after us in the hotel asking stupid questions like \n\nQ: \"how was your experience at jet?\" A: it sucked a**. \nQ: how can we make the club better? A: how bout getting better people to come instead of loser dudes that swear that they have money..oh ya & trevor ariza is a douche!\n Q; will you come back\n\nA: hell no..plus I yelp so JET you're getting 1 star b*tch!\n\nThe End ..hate this place..don't waste your time
