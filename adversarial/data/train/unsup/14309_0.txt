Updating my review.\nGood news:  \nConsistently good service by the wait staff (fast, cheery, personable)  and great rock-n-roll music upstairs.  \n\nBad news: \nInconsistent food quality from great to not-so-good makes me not want to return.  The ribs were dried out as if they'd been sitting around.  And, what is with the yellow runny liquid on my ribs?  I'm gonna assume it was mustard but, honestly, I don't think it was appetizing to look at and I've never had yellow \"stuff\" on ribs before.  The quality of the meat, even with sauce added was just below my standards even when I'm doin' the cookin'.  And, even the slaw, which I usually like, was sub-par this visit.\n\nNo draft beers?  \n\nAnd the unisex one-stall restroom upstairs?  Oh, don't even...  The cleanliness (or, rather, lack thereof) reminds me of a college bar -- no mirror, urine on the seat, and an air freshener that's been plugged in way past its time (as in, it's older than my toothbrush).  If the restroom is like this, then, what about the kitchen?  Mind you, it's 6:00pm on a Friday, not like it's near closing time and there's been a rush and maddening crowd lined up...
