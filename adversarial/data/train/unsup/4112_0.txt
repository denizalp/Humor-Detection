I am glad I read the latest reviews. We were going to bring a crowd of 16 hungry adults to celebrate combined birthdays. After learning that Tin Tin no longer serves 'all you can eat' crab legs in the buffet price, no thank you. \n\nIf you are the proprietor reading this and understand enough written English....\n\nSad choice you made. We have witnessed the same decision made by two other restaurants in the Asheville NC area. They have since closed and sold. Their demise was slow and painful. Watching their customer base slowly disappear must have been painful. But that is their dagger in their own back. \n\nLesson learned for restaurant owners:  Once you have reached a high point on your menu items, never back down or reduce. It is suicide. \n\nSorry Tin Tin, you were once great, like the Great Wall of China. But, like the Great Wall, it no longer serves a purpose.
