Solid stadium.  We caught 2 games here against the Cardinals.  We went on my actual birthday which was sweet.  The Cardinals won 5-2, my wife got me a birthday surprise by announcing my birthday on the jumbo tron, and there were Friday night fireworks.  A perfect night!\n\nThe stadium is easy to get to, parking was cheap ($7 bucks right across the street from the stadium), prices were fair for a ballpark and the fans were mellow.  I guess they have been named the family friendliest ballpark in the majors and I can see why.  Ushers were nice and helpful etc.\n\nThey had the roof open on my birthday.  Its amazing how that works.  Like 15 minutes before the game they decided to open it up.  Its awesome just watching it open and then seeing the night sky above.  Quite a site to see.  It opens super fast too. \n\nOverall a super nice stadium and one of the best ones I have been to.  I could see myself picking up some kind of season ticket plan if I lived out in AZ.
