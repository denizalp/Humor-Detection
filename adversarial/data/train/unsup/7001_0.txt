I attended a party for Viva Radio upstairs.  First of all, the bouncer wasn't much of a bouncer.  I felt like I could poke him over with my pinky finger.  Then, there was no Guinness at the upstairs bar.  However, the bartender poured a generous drink.\n\nThe dancing was fun.  I liked looking at the crazy Jesus figurines.  I couldn't figure out the decor, but it was kind of like \"Diner meets the Last Supper in Neonville\" or something.\n\nPeople like to throw this word \"hipster\" around.  I feel like I saw a lot of people who could be classified as \"hipsters\" -- but only if you use that term hatefully.
