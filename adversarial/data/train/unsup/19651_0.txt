***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 20\/100***\n\nFINALLY I get to cross off Soho from my bookmarked places. Got off work early on Friday and with no solid dinner plans, I told my husband I wanted to try Soho's HH. It lived up to the hype, the service and quality of food was top notch. Our server Julie was very knowledgeable, giving us the background of the place, its specialties and dishes and Chef John. Although I've read here on Yelp most of the info that she's given, it was very much appreciated that she took the time to go above and beyond. \n\nThe dishes that we tried were deliciously satisfying and melt in your mouth goodness, it's nice to know you can go to a place and have 5 star quality without the price. We ordered all the tadas and of which I liked the tuna and octopus the most. The firecracker roll was a favorite as well but the star was definitely the yellow tail sashimi with yuzu soy that Chef John sent for us to try, it was so fresh and flavorful and melted like butter. I wanted to order more but I was stuffed and wanted to save room for dessert. We got the green tea tiramisu and green tea crème brulee, both heavenly but the crème brulee stole my heart. No doubt we will be back to try everything else on their menu. Kudos to Chef John and staff for doing such a great job!
