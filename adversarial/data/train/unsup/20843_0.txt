I want to give this place a higher rating because of the fabulous young lady that took our order, but unfortunately the food wasn't that good.\n\nQuickee is located inside the ARCO gas station on the corner of Rancho and Craig.  Believe me....this is a prime location for some people watching...if you know what I mean!\n\nThe menu is limited to cheeseburgers, fries, can soda and a \"black and white\", which is their version of a shake.  The cheeseburgers are small, like White Castle.  They have onions, pickles, cheese and mustard on them. \n\nFor fast food, I guess they were ok.  They don't hold a \"fry\" to In&Out burgers for sure.  The bread got too soggy and the patty was pretty flavorless. The fries came out lukewarm and weren't anything above average in taste.\n\nThe service was great though and we were in and out within 10 minutes.   The best thing was the shake.  I would go back for one of them, if I got the hankering for a shake again.  I wouldn't return to this location after dark, however.  :\/
