The Hotel Nelligan is right in the heart of Old Montreal, with old world charm and service. The 6 story building is brick with a nice facade, and the interior has been remodeled with washed brick and wood accents. The rooms are decent sized and furnished handsomely with understated luxury. There is a small bar and dining, and most room rates come with breakfast included. \n\nYou'll pay about $175 to $250 depending on room and season. You can step outside and walk the quaint narrow streets with their shops, bistros and drinking establishments.
