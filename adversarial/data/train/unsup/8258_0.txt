Listen - all I can say is that Toronto has been craving a place like this since the dawn of time.  Thank God, Praise Jesus, Bless Allah, Kiss your Budha, hell burn a cross ...  do what ever you gotz to do and get your ass down to see this bar.  I am beyond happy and finally satisfied at some of the building and thought out architecture, location and intelligent city planning to bring together this venue (capacity 1000) just steps into the ACC holding 19,800 for 41 (+5 pre-season) Raptor and as many Leafs games a year.  Not to mention every other Rogers Centre event and Jay's game.  \nI don't really know where to begin - so bullet points from walking in the door:\n\n- gazing into a giant room probably 40 feet high with what they term the largest HD screen in North America ...\n- surrounded by what seems like hundreds of other screens ... all varieties of sports yet seemingly symetrical and appropriately dispursed for viewing pleasure\n- large cushy booths with private screens\n- a second level with a long curved balcony overlooking the floor below.  i'd guess 20 wicked lazy boys staring into a pure floating glass bannister to view the big screen and entire wall of TVs\n- private TVs in a layer above, also OK to link in any laptop (and given High Speed Internet wired or wireless), or gaming console ..\n- golf simulator game $35\/hr (says takes 2.5hrs for 4 drunk guys to play 18 at Pebble Beach)\n- of course the bathrooms are riddled with electronics and displays\n- private leather couch lounge areas with fire places and of course their own TVs\n- apparel store outside (blah, blatent cash grab ... but hey why not)\n- floating walls to seperate and enable private bookings and parties \n- there was a small rush of people as we arrived (maybe 10 groups of 2) and they amply had 2 hostesses, a server AND the manager seating people quickly while a smiley and friendly doorman\/security\/dude greeted you and said 'hey man just a quick moment', but the reality is was that i needed that time to take it all in and gaze in wide wonder, at the joy i had found ... dinn dinnn din din.\nso ... my new and improved rating system (please feel free to send me notes on this - i.e. categories or groups of categories)\n\n- food  9.5\/10\n- style and decor:  10\/10\n- ambiance and vibe: 7\/10 (obviously this one is hugely dependent on volume of ppl, i.e. go before\/after any game or event and busy crazy ... i popped by on a rainy Sunday afternoon)\n- cleanliness & presentation: 9\/10\n- service & timing: 8\/10\n- company (as in the people you're with companions) and conversation: 9\/10 :)\n\nSee pics at:  http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Real-Sports\/139336102759549?ref=ts&v=wall#!\/album.php?aid=25287&id=139336102759549 \n\nThis will be my new home before and\/or after every game.\nUFC - hello.\n\nI'm so sorry I hadn't checked this out sooner (as I just don't dig on the Jays) and hockey\/basketball seasons haven't started quite yet.  \n\nSensational!  Dammmn.\n\nOh - shit - what we ate.....\n\nThe Voodoo Shrimp appetizer was out of this world.  Minced veggies in some crazy, lasting, tangy spices with 6 large peeled shrimp and a couple toasty twisted breads for dipping goodness ... i lapped the rest up with a spoon right out of the hot plate.\n\nBit boring, but weren't hungry, pulled pork sandwich and spicy chicken sandwich.  The chicked was literally dripping with delicious sauce yet the bun had a magical outer shell that was soft enough on the pallet (unlike that evil but delicious Captain Crunch) but hard on the sauce.\n\nNOT typical bar food.  Healthier versions and chef prepared foods you love (and cook yourself like all the way to slow roasted baby back ribs) and yet not crazy stupid ridiculous gourmet restaurant prices.  Like Keg level at most ($30-39), and still fine dishes in the $13-20.\n\nI won't even get into the beers.  Cocktails and the rest sure - a whole menu ... but this bar makes you want to drink beer.  The only menu in the city that rivals it is Bier Market.  \n\nThe only loser in all of this ... Harbour Sports.  I hope there's enough business willing to dart across highway traffic in the bitter cold Canadian winter to keep you afloat.  Your pyrmaid of chicken balls just ain't looking so crash hot anymore.
