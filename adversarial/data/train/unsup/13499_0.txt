Woohoo to my 500th review - and a very well deserved five star at that! My Yelp tag line is \"I feel that 2016 is going to be a great year...\" and it definitely was - because my beautiful daughter was born and I owe a lot to Shea Women's Care for that! \n\nIf I can think of the best doctor I've every had, it would be Dr. Carter. Being pregnant and having a baby can be stressful, emotional, and along with the ups, there are definitely downs and Dr. Carter helps you get through every step of the way. He never rushes you, answers all your questions and makes you feel better when you're worried about something. There were times I felt like I was in a therapy session and I would leave feeling better and that I know I chose the right doctor. \n\nUnfortunately, Dr. Carter did not deliver my daughter but Dr. Martin stepped in and she also was wonderful! If you're pregnant and looking for a great OB Gyn, you found two here!! All of the staff are great too- so friendly and willing to answer any questions or requests you need. \n\n2016 is coming to an end and it was a great year thanks to Dr. Carter and Dr. Martin!
