I am so happy that my friend recommended I stop into this place. I am an avid tea drinker, even in the summer, and was thrilled to stop into a shop with such a variety and broad selection. They have everything from my (favorite) low-brow 'breakfast' varieties, including Scottish, Irish, English, and more, to really nicely spiced chais, a dizzying amount of herbal tisanes, greens, whites, etc. I suggested they start hosting classes so that peeps like me can step up our game. I got great recommendations from the staff and they introduced me to new teas I am really getting into!
