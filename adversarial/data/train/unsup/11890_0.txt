This place isn't a cutsey-adorable as I thought it would be. It's a in a rather ancient looking building, hidden behind a ice cream and print shop. If you didn't know it was a ramen place, the drab decor, empty snack cooler' and the smartass (albeit awesome) \"Burger King\" sign would've hinted that it was a quaint All-American cafe shop that specializes in coffee and corndogs (Note to self: Make a coffee and corndog shop called \"Cafe Le Woof.\"). Obviously I was new here, so the owner (I believe) came to the rescue and helped me pick a ramen-- very friendly and professional.\n\nI got the (the name escapes me) \"Hawaiian\" ramen (with fresh ramen). The fresh ramen itself was legit-- now is it truly fresh and authentic ramen? No, but I didn't expect it to be. Lower your standards. I came to the realization many years ago that I will never eat fresh and authentic ramen outside of Japan, but Doodles fresh ramen tasted more like fresh ramen than other ones that I tried, and that's all I really wanted. The soup, spam, and quail egg were amazing, though the cilantro (I think) was straight up overkill. No me gusta, amigo. However, for what it's worth, Doodles fresh ramen is pretty good, and I would not mind eating it again.
