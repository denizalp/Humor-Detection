Very happy with John's piano and math lessons.  My daughter, C.B., has been going to see John for almost 2 years.  She has improved her piano skill and math lessons have helped her to stay at the top of her class.  \nJohn is a great tutor - thorough and patient too.  Not only he teaches music to the students, but he also educates them on the music background and history. \nHighly recommended.
