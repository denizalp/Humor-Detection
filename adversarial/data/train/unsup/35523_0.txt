We used this company because it was through the Home warranty with American Home Shield. Our Ac broke down out of nowhere on Thursday night. We have a 4 year old and we had to sleep in a house at 92 degrees for a few days. We scheduled the appointment on Friday and the Tech Jenaro or Jenaco (Horrible hand writing) was on time then he goes really quickly to say the unit was so old so it needed to be replaced the whole thing with a quote for $4600. He said our insurance needed to approve it before doing any work. His report was then submitted to our home insurance who refused to fix the unit due to \"not normal wear and tear\", that is it! something was cracked and it was not normal wear and tear. We just bought the house 3 months before we haven't done nothing to temper the ac. Luckily!!  We had a recommendation thru a friend who is a tech and was off on Saturday and help us immediately it was an electrical issue, the part we needed to buy was $3.00 ( Three dollars and no cents) now is the weekend and we are enjoying our 72 degree house no problem at all! Doctor Cool and their TECH are a RIP OFF!!!!!! \nIf you have to use Doctor cool because of your home warranty, you can ask for a different company or at least request to not get Jenaro or Jenaco as a technician as he SUCKS HORRIBLY.
