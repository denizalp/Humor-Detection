It's a great sandwich, not much more to say here.  I usually go with the Italian style subs but the turkey and hams are pretty darn good as well.  I like to mix up my non cook lazy sandwich nights between here, jimmy johns, potbelly, and subway.  For $20-25 it allows me and my wife to not have to cook and goes well with a glass of wine at home.  Nuff said.
