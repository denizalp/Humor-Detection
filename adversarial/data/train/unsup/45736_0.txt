Tariq at Lash Brush designs was professional and courteous right from the start. I had his painting a large room and then we decided to paint the cabinets as well. He was very flexible with his\nRecommendations as well as keeping my ideas\nIn consideration. He was always on time. The only complaint o have it that I have run out of\nRooms to have home paint .
