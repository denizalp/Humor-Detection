I have had, in my opinion, less than satisfactory experiences with Right Honda in both the sales and service areas. \nThe sales team must wear out plenty of shoes and sharpie pens running back and forth to have the sales manager ok a price. I had three different people ask me \"how much I was willing to pay\".  What I was willing to pay never seemed to be enough, but the salesman was always willing to take it to that mystical place deep within the bowels of the dealership where the sales fairy refused to bless my offer and displayed his displeasure by marking all over the paperwork with his pen.  This back and forth went on for HOURS until I decided I had enough and walked out. I was angrily told on my way out that I had wasted their time. LOL, I had told them at the beginning what I was willing to pay, never changed, and somehow I wasted the sales fairy's time, not my own. \nAs for the service department, on an oil change I was told I needed new rear tires. I was informed by the open-mouth-gum-chewing service guy that he had the same car (S2000) and he had to put new rear tires on his car at 16,000 miles. He seemed to fancy himself as Burt Reynolds from Smokey and the Bandit and it was some sort of badge of honor to be able to burn so much rubber in such a short time. I think I was to feel like a loser that it had taken me to 19,000 to need new rim skins. The only problem was that I had just checked the tread depth the week before and it was nowhere near the wear blocks on the tires. I had to tell the Bandit that I was going to ride out the tires even after his dire warnings. \nSo enter at your own risk. I may just be an odd duck and expect too much as a customer.
