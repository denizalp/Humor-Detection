Wow, that place is worse that a dealership mechanic ! I had a speed sensor problem in my AUDI . I bought part from an Audi dealer . I had to leave town for a few days so I ask my girlfriend to take car over there for that part exchange. Before I left , I pop my hood and I show my girlfriend which part will be exchange and I mark that part. She did go there Monday morning . They took her car (and part that I bought) and told her that it needs to cool off before he can do it. It was very professional like it should be. After few hours she was happy on her way home. Two days after that I was back in LV . Came back home , jump to my car and I was on my \"marry way \". Same day , on my way back , check engine light came on with same symptoms as before. I connect a scanner and , surprise surprise speed sensor problem came back . I got home and after checking my car I found out that my original part is still in the car !!! They just took car from my girlfriend and reset codes and told her that part is replaced and she is good to go. Of course they charge her for diagnostics and everything else (he stole that part on the top of everything) !!! When I went there he told me that he replaced all the parts that she wants and everything was good before she left his shop. At the end , that fool (cuz I can't say nothing nice about him) said that \"maybe she changed that part back afterwards \" . My problem in that story was that how in the hell she put her hands on that old sensor ? Of course that short statement got him by surprise and without saying anything else he dropped his head and left without any additional \"words of wisdom\". After that one of my friends recommended \"EUROTEK\" tuning, which came out to be a best place in LAS VEGAS to repair any German car !!!!
