I gave this place a try since it had a good review, but I would not recommend it for haircuts. I have really thick hair and like to get it thinned a lot. My regular hairdresser does a really good job with this but moved away so I am looking for a new one and he is really irreplaceable! I went to Jola at Monaco hair design and she did not know how to thin hair. She only thinned the bottom half of my hair, so the top half was really bulky. I asked her to thin out that part and she ended up cutting it into a really short layer, so i have this weird half layer now. My hair just looks really embarrassing and I'm gonna have to tie it up until it grows out.\n\nThey also don't accept MasterCard and have a surcharge for debit. So if you plan on going there, make sure you take cash with you.
