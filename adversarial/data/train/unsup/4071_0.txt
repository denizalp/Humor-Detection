Hmm. I'm torn. \n\nBarrio is located in the old 806 space. I love what they've done with the place.\n\nI had a GREAT time at Barrio last Friday night with a big group of loud, obnoxious friends. (I was probably the loudest and most obnoxious.) I think there were 14 of us. Service was great. No gripes there. Our server was efficient, friendly, and informative.\n\nThe atmosphere was also great. I always thought the patio at 806 was one of the best in the city and they have kept that same great patio at Barrio. We were lucky enough to be seated out there.\n\nI have to mostly agree with Habby on the food. It was pretty bland. We must have dumped half of a salt shaker into the guacamole and the salsas. Most restaurants that I frequent don't even put salt on the tables because they know how to spice their food properly. Barrio needs a bit of help in that department. Even their *hot* salsa was bland. Disappointing. I like HOT and I didn't get HOT here. \n\nI LOVE the build-your-own taco concept. Just keep in mind: if you order several different sauces \/ toppings you should be okay spice wise. But yeah, like Habby said, the soft tacos came out soggy which was kind of a bummer. Had they not been soggy they would have been good. \n\nI loved my dranks but they could've used some more tequila in them. (Maybe I'm just too much of a lush?) Whatev. \n\nAnother thing.... be aware that they can't split up a check. Normally, this kind of thing doesn't bother me in the slightest. But when people are out in a giant group and they want to nickle and dime the shit out of the bill instead of splitting it all like adults --- yeah, then the rest of us are left paying for everyone else. \n\nI'll give Barrio a bit more time to spice things up before I return.
