This is my favorite place to go to see the sun set over Phoenix.  It's a short climb up and the view is wonderful.   \n\nIt's located in Papago Park so there is a lake and picnic tables at the base near the parking lot.  Perfect stop when you are on your way to the Phoenix Zoo or Desert Botanical Gardens.
