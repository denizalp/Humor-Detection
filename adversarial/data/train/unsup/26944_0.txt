We were very pleased with the service we received and the quality of the blinds and shutters.  Although circumstance forced us to impose an unreasonably tight schedule (installation within a week and a half after we first contacted him), he found a way to meet our requirements--at a very competitive price.  Although I doubt that he would normally be able to turn a job around that quickly, our experience did show his willingness to go the extra mile.  We can heartily recommend his services.
