Terrible customer service as of our last experience here. Went in, no one spoke or asked if we needed help with anything. Stood there for over 10 minutes being ignored, they even helped a homeless guy who didn't buy anything before addressing us. Despicable. Apparently now that we have left a Yelp review about how they overcharge for certain items, we aren't welcome as customers anymore.
