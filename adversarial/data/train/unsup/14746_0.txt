My first experience with Steam Whistle Pilsner was at a Yelp Elite Event. They has always been so supportive and provide us with their products at quite a few of the events I been to. \n\nVisiting the brewery was actually a lot of fun! I got to sample more of their Pilsner and see the actual brewing process. Unfortunately, my visit was on the weekend and no one were actually working...so it was more like visiting a museum. \n\nWe did not even ask to pay for the tour.. the nice lady just offered us a glass of pilsner then just asked us to join the tour that started 5 minutes before we arrived. \n\nThen more drinks...and more beer... burp! burp! at the end of the tour the guide said if anyone that wants the souvenirs then they can go pay $10...We opt not to get any so we got a free tour with free sampling! :) Sweet! \n\nSo definitely if you decide to come for a tour.. come visit during weekdays when some one are actually working and you can see how the brewery actually function!
