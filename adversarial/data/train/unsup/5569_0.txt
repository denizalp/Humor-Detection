Just got back from Frontier. I live in Markham and drove all the way to Brampton to check this store out. Their selection was not bad. They had a 50% off sale, but most of the outfits and sarees on sale were older styles. \n\nI had been having a difficult time searching for a mint green saree and was happy to know that Frontier carried a few options. There was one I loved and tried on. I had asked the sales lady for her final price on the outfit and she told me she'd ask the store owner and let me know. As I'm waiting, I notice she begins to pack the saree up. She then proceeds to take it to the check out counter. At this point I step in and ask her what was going on. In a matter of 5 MINUTES she managed to sell the saree TO SOMEONE ELSE! What kind of customer service is that?! I was thrilled that I had found something I like after so long and was absolutely appalled. When I told her that I was still waiting to find out the price of the saree, she said she had \"forgotten\" and that she would help me find something \"similar!\" The new customer and not yet even purchased it but the sales lady REFUSED to still sell it to me now that she had a definite buyer!!!\n\nI WILL NEVER go back to this store. Worst customer service, lack of respect and only looking to make money, not to please the customers!
