This place is horrible. They require you to wear the stupid hospital gown. The interior of the restaurant looks like they ran out of money 20% into the buildout. The TVs play disgusting images of fat bare bellies bouncing and getting slapped. If that isn't enough to lose your appetite, I don't know what is. They take the fun theme too far. \n\nBTW, take a look of the pictures on their menus of the food. It looks disgusting!  Gross.
