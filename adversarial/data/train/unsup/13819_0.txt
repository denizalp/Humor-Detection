Here's yet another establishment that thinks it's better than it's customers. First, I was expecting a more relaxed, Bohemian coffeehouse atmosphere. Instead, It was a restaurant where a pretentious waiter (complete with an attitude) wanted to tell me where to sit - really!, there's only one table occupied - There was a small area with two sofas for the chill crowd. Both sofas were occupied and I didn't want to sit in an uptight table alone. So, I sat outside on the patio. \nThe food was good, but it was expensive for the portion you get. The coffee was luke warm. \nToo expensive and no communal feel - I'm still waiting for a cool coffeehouse to make its way downtown.  The Beat it still the best going and PublicUs loves itself more that this place does.
