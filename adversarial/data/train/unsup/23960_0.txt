For the sole reason they allow dogs inside the premises - just for that I love this place!\n\nWhen people think of construction, it's mostly a male dominated occupation, so when I come into Lowe's I always feel intimidated therefore I always ask for help where things are located. I feel that every time I've came to this location, the workers from the sales floor to the register employee are all so nice and willing to help. This store is huge, and yet they know exactly where everything is on which aisle. It's crazy! Everything is organized by department and even within each aisle the items are always so organized! \n\nIf you can think of anything you'll ever need for your home renovation or repair, Lowe's has it for you!
