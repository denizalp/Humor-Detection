The food was excellent I had the grilled salmon with 6 grilled shrimp and fresh vegetables and a house salad. The salmon was prepared just right along with the grilled shrimp, the vegetables were cooked just right with a little snap left in them.  My husband ordered the catfish and it was cooked perfect with a Little crunch. Both of our friends order steak and the we're prepared to the liking. \nStephanie was our server and she was very nice the music was to loud so she ask t have it turned down so we didn't have to yell  she came by and checked on us just enough so that we could enjoy our dinner but not too much as to interfere with our meal with our good friends from Hawaii.
