My son has been going here for about 7 months. His first class was awesome and his teachers were great. He is now in a new class and we are still getting used to the adjustment. Some of the staff members are really helpful and others are not at all. We still haven't decided yet if we should keep him there or move him to a different daycare. The lady who deals with the financial part is very sweet, she always says hi and answers all of our questions.
