I am new to the Phoenix area and had been to Toni and Guy in Tucson serveral times to color and cut my hair. Rather than experiment with hair salons in the Phoenix area I had never been to,I went to Toni and Guy at the Scottsdale Fashion Sqaure location hoping they would be as good as the location in Tucson. I met with Demi for a partial tint with hightlights and got exactly what I asked for. The color Demi chose matched exactly what I had before. I have been going to Demi every 5 weeks for color and highly recommend her to anyone who is looking for a great hair colorist.
