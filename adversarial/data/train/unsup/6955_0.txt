Mandalay Events Center is one of the two major venues for large scale concerts with a capacity of about 12,000 people.  I have seen several concerts here starting in 2001 shortly after moving to Las Vegas.\n\nI prefer this events center to the MGM Grand Garden because it's a bit more manageable in size which makes parking and leaving a bit easier.  There are plenty of concession areas and bathrooms.  The center is always kept clean.\n\nI have one problem with them and it's a problem with them and TicketMaster.  I had my electronic ticket on my iPhone but the woman scanning tickets in the line I was in didn't have the ability to scan the phone.  Come on--work with your partner TicketMaster.  This is 2014.  Get with it.  \n\nThe leg room is awful and the stairs going down the rows has different sizes.  As it turned out, the woman in front of me slipped and as I went to grab her from falling, we ended up sort of groping each other.  That ought to be worth a star of its own.  I think every arena is built this way.  There's a master blueprint somewhere that states this is the way it has to be and if you digress, the place will fall down.\n\nIn any case, I am a fan.  I'm not here often, but I do like seeing shows here.  I like the vibe of Mandalay Bay.
