Finally, I had the opportunity to visit Seoul Poke Bowl! I've had this place bookmarked few weeks. \n\nI visited during lunch hour with a friend, the restaurant wasn't busy. Our food was ready within minutes! I appreciate the cleanliness and fresh appearance of the food. I'm sure they have a great health score (DUH). I choose to build my own Poke Bowl and BOY was it delicious!! I'm getting hungry just thinking about my order! \n\nMy order:\nBase: Salad Mix\nProteins: I selected the 2-Proteins for $10.95,  Spicy Tuna & Salmon\nToppings: You can pick 4!! Time to get creative!!!  I added a 5th topping- Seaweed salad for $1.50 extra. Daikon Radish, Cucumber, Carrots, Scallions.\nHomemade Sauce: Firecracker Sauce (Basically Spicy Mayo)\n\nThe beverage station has dispensers with infused Teas and lemonades. I was pleased to see no soda\/pop available! My total came to $16 and some odd change. I would've liked to spend less but I must say everything was worth the price. Can't wait to come back!
