Jason's Deli is the kind of place I want to love.  It's just the anti-Subway.  \nI have been to several locations around the country and I have always been really excited... until, that is, I eat the food.\n\nThe food, while fresh, is very bland.  It was no exception this visit.\n\nAdditionally, on my recent visit, I only had about 2-3 oz of turkey on my Papa Joe sandwich (the equivalent of maybe one and a half store bought slices shredded).  That was very surprising and sad.  The bread was ginormous, so maybe they thought I couldn't use the protein.  \n\nMy daughter's turkey on white with cheese had about four times the amount of turkey as did my sandwich.  She didn't care for the American Cheese (that's not real cheese Mommy), but she gobbled down the turkey and her side of apples.  She left the white bread and cheese on the plate.\n\nMom got a combo with 1\/2 a Papa Joe (still lacking on turkey) and a cup of their pot pie soup (which was oddly sweet).  She thought it was Meh.\n\nSo let's call this place a 3.5* joint because their salad bar and potatoes are pretty good.  We just didn't order them this time around.  \n\nMinus a 1\/2 star because not one table was properly cleaned.  It did not appear any chemicals were used to clean the tables, as they all had greasy hand prints and smudges on them.  Additionally, I watched as the busser cleared off a table.  He just used an-already moist rag and just quickly ran it over one corner of the table before walking away.  \n\nI don't plan to come here again.
