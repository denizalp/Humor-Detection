Better than an average 3 star, for sure!  It reminds me of a Johnny Rockets or a nicer 5 & Diner.  The first thing I noticed was how clean it was.  All polished stainless steel and freshly wiped down red booths.  I almost felt like I was in a circuit board clean room.\n\nThe food? Ohhhhh the food!  I split a swiss mushroom burger with the wife and I got my young one a kid's cheeseburger meal.  I really wish I would have ordered more, but the current status of our yackonomy advised me against it.\n\nThe other food coming out looked ridiculously delectable, and it was brought out with the haste of an olympic sprinter.  Who could ask for more?\n\nI will definitely be coming back to here and recommending it to my friends.  Its well worth the 2 block drive from my house.  Did I mention they have breakfast!  I'm so there!
