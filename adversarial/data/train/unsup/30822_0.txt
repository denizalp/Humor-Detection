The wife and I have been to Bahn Thai on a few occasions and have always had great food. I typically get the green curry, actually I have always had the green curry here. I usually get it 4 out of 5 spicy, which still has some pretty good kick to it.  It's always nice to ask for something spicy and actually receive it just how you like it. On my last visit, I also tried some of their sushi as an appetizer and the nigiri was all fresh tasting fish. The service has always been great as well.\n\nThe wife and I have recently moved away from south Charlotte, but I would not hesitate to stop in if we find ourselves in the area or even making a specific trip to Bahn Thai. I just have to venture out on their menu and get something different, but man those eggplants in the green curry get me every time.
