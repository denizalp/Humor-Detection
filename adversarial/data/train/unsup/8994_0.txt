Welcome to the Republic. The Republic of rich, luscious ice cream! They have some unique flavors, including some holiday flavors like peppermint, gingerbread, and eggnog. After browsing through the flavor selection, I decided on an ice cream sandwich ($4.50) with the gingerbread ice cream. The cookies included with the sandwich are either chocolate chip or molasses but you can also upgrade to a premium cookie (A chocolate chip oatmeal concoction) for $10. I felt like mixing it up so I had a chocolate chip on one side and a molasses on the other. \n\nThe ice cream itself was great and I loved the bits of gingerbread mixed in with the ice cream. The cookies though tasted too sweet for my tastes so when I bit into the sandwich all I could taste was a generic sweetness rather than the actual ingredients. Also, while the molasses cookie had a nice chewiness that made it easy to eat with the soft ice cream, the chocolate chip was harder.\n\nService was warm and friendly. If I'm in the area and craving ice cream I'd go here again.
