We've been using this service for 2 months now.  A different crew comes every other week.  I would say some crews are better  than others but all in all we've been satisfied with each.  They clean the entire house but each visit give extra attention to a specific room on a rotational basis.  \n\nI find the office staff to be very responsive. \n\nBasically, It sure beats having to clean the house every week yourself!
