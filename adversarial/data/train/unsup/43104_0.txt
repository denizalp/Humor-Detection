I have never eaten at Roy's before, and I was NOT disappointed!!!\n\nFor dinner, I had the blue cheese encrusted Salmon with white and green asparagus (as did one of my dinner companions), and the other had the Mahi-Mahi.  We were all very pleased.  My friend and I who ordered the salmon found ourselves wanting to lick the sauce off the plate.  The salmon was perfectly cooked with a slight crispy edge.\n\nFor desert, my friend had a chocolate martini and I a hazelnut martini.  Both were yummmm-oooo!\n\nPlus, between the 3 of use we ordered the pineapple upside down cake, served with coconut ice cream, the chocolate souffle served with vanilla ice cream (the gooey center of this souffle was finger licking good), the creme brule, and the fruit tart with blueberry lavender ice cream (this was AMAZING ice cream).  You practically had to roll us out of there because these were all the next best thing to great sex.\n\nService was excellent and all was well worth the price.\n\nGOOOOOO!!!!
