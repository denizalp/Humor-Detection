Today I went to the winking Lizard for lunch with my Husband and we walked into an empty restaurant and waited at the host stand to be seated as the sign said to do. A guy walks by and tells the host\/server there are people at the door. My husband and I wait a few more minutes and watch everybody do anything but come to seat us and we finally decided to seat ourselves. After we took our seats a server hurried to the table and asked where we would like to be seated (bar\/patios\/etc.) as if we hadn't just selected our seats already. But we let it slide. Eventually she takes our order and doesn't write anything down. And then come back and has to retake our order and this time she writes it down. We wait for what seems an hour for a chicken quesadilla, a chicken sandwich, and a wedge salad. Anytime she checked on our table it was only in passing as if in this nearly deserted restaurant she was to busy to give us any attention. Good customer service is a must
