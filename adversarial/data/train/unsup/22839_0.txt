Surprised we had not tried this place out yet.  It's been open awhile now, but for whatever reason, we just hadn't been in the mood for BBQ, I guess?  \n\nMy mom was in town and we needed some takeout, so we finally decided to grab something from here.  I placed an order online for a family pack with chopped brisket.  We chose mac and cheese and baked beans as the sides (also comes with 4 rolls).  We also got 1\/4lb of smoked chicken.  All of this was just about $31.00.  Drove down, picked it up and brought it home.  Here are my thoughts on the items we got...............\n\nChopped Brisket-  This was pretty tasty!  The family pack came with a pound of this, and a pound of chopped brisket is A LOT.  It was diced up nice and small, almost shredded.  Had a great smoke flavor, no fatty pieces etc.  This mixed with their sauce, was pretty freaking grub! \n\nSmoked Chicken-  Nice and moist, pretty tasty.  Nice coating of pepper on the outside.  1\/4lb is not much, but we were all able to have a few slices of it.\n\nMac and Cheese- Only had a bite, but it was incredibly cheesy and tasted great.  Reminded me of a Velveeta shells and cheese type macaroni.  If you like that style, you will like this.\n\nBaked Beans- Only had a bite of these, too.  They were just ok.  They were a little runny (I prefer my baked beans thick and rich), but still didn't taste bad.  Doubt I would get them again, or I would ask them to drain them first.\n\nBBQ Sauce-  We got the Original sauce and it was fantastic!  Just sweet enough, heavy tomato based type sauce.  Reminded me and tasted just like this place we had in Santee, CA called KB's BBQ.  Some of the best BBQ sauce I have ever had.  I was very impressed with this sauce!\n\nThe family pack also came with 4 rolls (didn't try any), some pickles and some raw white onion.\n\nEveryone in my family enjoyed the BBQ and we will get it again soon.  There was enough to feed 3 adults and leftovers to make a few sandwiches with the remaining brisket the next day.  \n\nGuys in the shop were friendly, online ordering was easy, and that BBQ sauce was BOMB!  Can't wait to come back!
