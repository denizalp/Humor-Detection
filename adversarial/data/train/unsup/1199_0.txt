Amazing Japanese pastries! So delicious, so perfectly hand crafted and simply magnificent. My Japanese mother was in town and had seen their pictures on Yelp and insisted that we check it out. I honestly didn't know this place existed even though we live right around the corner. What a hidden gem!\n\nMy mom's eyes lit up when we walked in the cafe and just went gaga for their little pastry treats. My mom enjoyed a quick Japanese convo with the Japanese pastry chef and ordered pretty much every item on display, some which she was getting packed up to take back with her to Texas. \n\nEverything and I mean everything we tried was just wonderful. The cream filling was fluffy and not overly sweet. The cake was moist and flavorful. The fruits were fresh and perfectly ripe. You can tell that they take pride in their pastries and treat it like art. Every piece of pastry is a masterpiece. I haven't had such amazing pastries since my last visit to Japan in 2014. So glad this place is here. Might not be frequenting the place too much before my upcoming wedding, got to watch my waistline, but I'll definitely be coming by after the wedding. I think I'll deserve a nice treat after that.
