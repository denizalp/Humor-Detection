Wow they did a really good job on my macbook and really good costumer service. I had a crack screen and the laptop was kinda bend. I chose this place cuz of great reviews. I went in and they did a free diagnostic testing on it. They said I needed to replace the hard drive. I'm so glad I got it repair because I was thinking of getting a new one. It was all fix in one day. When I went to pick it up, it look like nothing ever happen to it. I'm so surprise my macbook was not bend no more. I didn't get it replace instead they bend it back together I guest.
