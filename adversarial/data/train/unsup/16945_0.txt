Cozy, tasty, friendly and packed with value- I am not sure what more Blue Fin could do... oh wait, they were able to serve a party of 12 without issue! This is a rarity. Granted, it is a small restaurant, so if 5 entourages showed up, it might be a problem.\n\nI am generally unable to get my value's worth from AYCE, so I ordered the scallop entree. However, glancing over the AYCE menu and witnessing the rolls that came to the table, their selection is slamming, not just spicy tuna and fried shrimp. \n\nIf you are able to rustle up some of the chef's special creations, you will be in for a treat. We had a pile of tasty fish with truffle oil, and even my fish-picky taste buds approved whole-heartedly! The scallop entree was also a winner served on a bed of tasty vegetables with the perfect sweet marinade.\n\nService was super friendly and efficient, and the mochi was perfect. What more could ya want?
