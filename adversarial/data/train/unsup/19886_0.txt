Dear Essence Bakery and Cafe~\n\nDarn you. Darn you to heck. I used to lightly brush the earth at a waif-like 120lbs, but thanks to your macarons I now crush cities in my wake at 300+.  It seems so wrong, so unjust that something that I think tastes like...well, I can only describe them as \"caramel-orgasm-foam,\" - which sounds like something that should only come from the 1980s version of outer space or the wrong type of Tokyo vending machine - should be able to have such deleterious effects on my waistline.\n\nStill, I can't justify staying away. Your organic, local, thoughtful cuisine draws me in by heart, mind and stomach. Perfect seasoning. Fresh ingredients. If it wasn't for the fact that you are closed on Sundays, I would eat there everyday.\n\n(BTW, that is the only reason I subtracted one star. Actually, that AND the prices, which are slightly too high. Still, a place that does amazing breakfast but is closed on Sunday? A tragedy...)\n\nOh, Essence, how I wish I could quit you.\n\nSincerely,\nJake P.
