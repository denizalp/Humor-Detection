In Harrah's casino.  Excellent breakfast buffet.  Almost anything you could want to eat for breakfast from Danishes to \"make your own omelet\".  Virgin bloody Mary's, fruits, a carving station, ethnic style breakfast items like congee and Kim Chee.  Coffee was served by the carafe and was pretty good.  Service was swift as well. It cost about $20 per person but there was no way I could try all the delicious items.
