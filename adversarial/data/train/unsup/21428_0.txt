It doesn't get better than this.\n\nRather small space, but the kitchen is always crazy busy, and everything that comes out is incredible. It's a restaurant and a butcher shop that serves top-notch quality meats cooked to perfection. So far, we've just sampled the burgers. The beef is ground in-house and cooked to order; when you say \"medium,\" it's a true medium. The flavor is outstanding. I thoroughly enjoyed the Block & Grinder burger, as well as the veggie burger (on recommendation by our server). Their lamb and feta burger is superb as well - The Liberty just got ousted.\n\nThe lightly seasoned fries on the side are a nice complement that support the main dish, not just filler. The micro-sized biscuits you get while waiting are addictive like you wouldn't believe. We were also told to try the deviled eggs. Not sure what they do to them, but it's definitely takes them to a whole new level.\n\nThey have a fairly robust beer and wine list that covers every flavor profile you would like. On both visits, the servers have been as knowledgeable about the beverages as they have been about the food, and are eager to share what they know. Everyone we've encountered so far has been remarkably friendly. Even when it's busy, they don't suffer quality of service.\n\nThe only downside is how busy this place can get - weekend waits can be up to 90 minutes. Definitely want to call ahead. Next time I might have to try one of the entrees. I can only imagine how great the steaks are, and I have my eye on the rabbit dish, too.
