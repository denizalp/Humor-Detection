Pastel is probably one of the better dessert places I've been to. They sell french style desserts, crepes and cheesecakes! It's small, not too many tables, but the service was good. I had a Brownie Crepe which was really tasty. I also had the frozen chocolate drink which was interesting, in a good way. My only complaint though, were the water glasses, they tasted like dishwasher chemicals. Yuck! Otherwise, it was all good! :)
