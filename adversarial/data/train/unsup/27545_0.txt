Wow, very surprised on how clean and nice this place is. \nWe just stayed at another hotel in Libertyville, IL (not an Comfort Inn) and I was a little shocked on how dirty it was and was thinking well the Comfort Inn we just booked would be the same but Nope not at all. This place just amazed me especially being right off the 90\/94\/39 Interstate. \nWe only needed some place to stay overnight for a few hours, heading further North and wanted to get a little jump on the traveling for the holiday, so we headed out on Friday night (stormy night) for half the trip and finish it in the morning. Would have loved to stay here to check it out further but couldn't (hubby really liked this place, it had a TV in the bathroom & he said he wasn't going any further, he would stay there, we could pick him up on the way back. LOL) \nWatch map directions: they had us in a corn field, told us to exit at 132 & it was exit 126 (Hello). \nDidn't see the pool can't say anything about it.\nAnyway we are heading back to WI and will be booking here again.
