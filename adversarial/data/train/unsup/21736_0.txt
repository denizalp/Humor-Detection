If you want a burger with real meat and fresh mushrooms and actual, non-processed cheese, this is the place to get it.  A lot of people think their burgers are the best in town. (I prefer Swenson's, which is better, but I wouldn't kick this burger out of bed for eating crackers.)  \n\nProblem is, burgers are all they have - well, okay, you can get a hot dog.  Or fries.  Or another burger.  So if you want anything else at all, you're kind of up the creek.  \n\nMe?  I like variety.  You've had one Five Guys burger, you've swept the menu.  If you're the sort of person who likes eating the same thing a lot, then this is the place for you.  I'll show up once every couple of months when the craving for a burger strikes and Swenson's is too far away and Bearden's (the other best burger in town nominee) is closed, but otherwise I'll forget it exists. \n\nOh, and if you're allergic to peanuts?  There are cases of half-shelled nuts in the room, filling the air with deadly NUT DANDER.  YOU WILL DIE IF YOU WALK IN HERE.  Fo' reals.  There's even a sign on the door warning you of your impending demise.
