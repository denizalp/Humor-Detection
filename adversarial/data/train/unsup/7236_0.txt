Wanting to feel like we were some of the cool kids, we stopped at Pinky's on a Saturday afternoon.  Good choice - they were almost empty, yet you still have to park across the street and it is like a live-action game of Frogger to make it to your food.  I do not even want to imagine what this place is like when they are busy.  Is it too much to ask that places get ample parking rather than having to look for it elsewhere?\n\nOnce inside, the surroundings are nice.  For those looking to find the cramped-yet-homey feel of the old Penguin, look elsewhere.  This is more of a redone, upscale garage.  It works.  Even though there were not many customers, the service was on the slow side.  Friendly enough, just not all that motivated if you know what I mean.\n\nWhen it comes to the food is when things really shine.  In fact, the menu is so awesome that the actual food has trouble keeping up.  That is not to say that the food is bad - just that the descriptions on the menu get your taste buds in overdrive, and the service takes a touch longer than it should, so that by the time the food arrives, it could be perceived as a bit of a let down.\n\nAll of the components are good, but they do not fit together just right.  Not yet, anyway.  Give it a try, give them a while to work out the kinks, and over time, I think you will be likely to see some improvement here.  Right now they still have some growing pains.
