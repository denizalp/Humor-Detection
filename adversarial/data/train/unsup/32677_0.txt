I've used Integrity Garage Doors several times before; first to replace the springs on my double garage door when they broke, then a few years later to replace the opener. They do an annual service, too. They are my go-to company. I called at one point because our double garage door would start to close, then stop and open again. Instead of coming out, charging me a service fee, and charging me to fix it, he walked me through how to fix it myself, and stayed on the phone with me until it was done. That's integrity!\n\nThis time, the opener on the single garage door was too old to accept programming from a universal remote. Since the unit is at least 15 years old, we decided to invest in a new opener, and I called Integrity. They were able to come out the next day. Chris called me when he was on his way, and arrived on time. We discussed what needed to be done. He already knew the price the owner and I had discussed, so no problems there. I had him service the double door since he was there, and he replaced the rubber bottoms of both sets of doors. When he installed the new opener, he also installed struts at the top and bottom for added stability. The opener came with an external keypad and 2 remotes. Chris worked hard and finished on time. Both sets of doors now work perfectly.\n\nI am very happy with Integrity and will use them in the future. I recommend them 100%.
