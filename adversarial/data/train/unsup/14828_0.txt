Paymon's needs to condense their menu and focus more on the food they are putting out. \n\nI ended up here because Stephano's my go to Greek restaurant was closed. The atmosphere at Paymon's is so dark and dungeon like. I looked over the menu and saw that in addition to having standard Greek fare they also had Indian and Italian food which made me question the authenticity of the food. \n\nI started with a regular hummus and for my entree I chose the gyros plate. The hummus was slightly bitter but had a smooth consistency. I could tell the pita bread was low quality and store bought because it tasted like cardboard and had a spongey texture. This was the most unauthentic pita bread I have ever had at a Greek restaurant. \n\nThe gyros plate looked sloppy and did not taste freshly made. Later on, I found out from the manager that the gyros comes frozen. I was not at all surprised because the texture and taste reflected meat that has been previously frozen. \n\nI hope the owners look into improving the quality of their gyros and either make it in house or find a local supplier because anyone that has had authentic\/high quality Greek food will not want to eat here.
