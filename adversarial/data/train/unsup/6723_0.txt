I love the Del Chicken Burrito with that awesome sauce. The funky fries remind me of middle school. This place doesn't get my orders wrong and they are always friendly. \n\nThe one thing about this location is that it's in an odd spot. But, with a little know how, one can navigate from Rancho heading South. The place is behind the Drive-in theatre. \n\nHonest food, honest prices, and friendly service is my experience here.
