One of those places that isn't smacked dap in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. Its remote but cozy. Very smooth atmosphere, casual and simple decor. Walking in the host greeted us and sat us down very promptly. Service was very attentive, nice, and on point with our order. Wellington burger was on point! Not overly complicated with a bunch of random stuff on it. Medium rare the way it should be. Swiss cheese, wild mushrooms and above all sunny side egg. Liquid gold that just gave it extra push of deliciousness. Chef came out to see how everything was which at a lot of places I don't usually see. I would definitely take a trip back here to have another food experience like the one I had at Served.
