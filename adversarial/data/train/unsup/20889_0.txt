My best friend gets the Deluxe Platter w\/ miso soup, a small sashimi salad, a California Roll, Chef's sushi & sashimi!  I will have to try that next time & share the California Roll cause it seems like a lot of food for a very reasonable price.  ($17)\n\nInstead, I ordered the Yellowtail Serrano Roll which was good.  I needed a little sweet to balance out the flavors.  I also ordered the fantastic very large sashimi salad!  Lovely dressing that didn't overpower the large pieces of sashimi.  If only I knew it was so big I would've ordered it alone.  Delish. \n\nI really like certain tofu dishes, not the Agedashi Tofu that they have, however a few Yelp pix from not long ago, they quite serving & the chalkboard menu above the sushi bar says a Tofu salad which they also no longer serve.  I will be back to try the Deluxe Platter & am looking forward to it.
