Well. Went to Bruster's tonight...permanently closed sign on the window.  Right below the closed sign was a sign they put up telling me about McMahons.  Thanks Bruster's.   Had the PB crunch, Chocolate ice cream with PB cup and PB cookie.  Also had the wildcat crunch, Twix and Carmel. Thankfully I can still get my ice cream fix.
