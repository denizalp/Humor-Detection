3 strikes, you're out. Uber, train your drivers to standardize service. \nFirst trip: Listened to 25 minute rant from a sweet intelligent lady about all her ex's and their offspring and how she had figured out the formula to get more uber rides. I tried to stay quiet for the first 20 mins. She should have paid me. \nSecond Trip: Got a call from the driver who said he was on his way but just had to \"stop at the bathroom first\". TMI. \nThird Trip: I texted the driver to tell him exactly where I was. I called the driver to see  where he was - he went to the wrong hotel. I gave him the address again. I called him again to see where he was and if more than 2 mins to please let me know because I had to get to the airport. He never showed and then I got an Uber message \"your driver has cancelled the trip\". WTF!  \"3 min Uber pickup\" made me 20 minutes late and cost me. \n\nI have had similar poor Uber experiences in NY. Good experiences a couple of times in various cities. Uber has a great opportunity to improve and training is key.
