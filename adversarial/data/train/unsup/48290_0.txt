Great first time experience. Tom Ka Gai soup was fantastic as well as the Red Curry w\/ Pork. My 10 y\/o son is a fried rice critic and said this was the best he's ever had. \n\nService was good but it was a slow night with it being the same night as the NASCAR race. \n\nWill be coming back and will recommend this place.
