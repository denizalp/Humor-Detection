Not my favorite mall but it does the job when I need a quick luck time Sephora fix. They have XXI and H&M which is basically all I need to be happy in the clothing department (I'm not a fan of shopping, I'm a fan of the food court.)\n\nThe food court is my favorite part. I come here for lunch 3\/5 work days. They have McDonald's, Spring Rolls to go, Mr Sub, Jimmy the Greek, Bourbon St Grill (LOOOVVEEEE THIIISSS ISH!!!!), Tim Hortims, Teriyaki, Man Chu Wok and some other stuff (too healthy for me to care about it!). Oh and Starbucks! So it's everything in one. \n\nI don't like the fact that similar stores are so far away from each other... like XXI and H&M for example. I don't like walking all the way to the other side of the mall for it but that's just me...\n\nAPPLE STORE WHAAAT!!! Always packed, obviously, but I come here regularly to take morphed pictures of myself with photo booth :)\n\nBath & Body Works - candles. to die for. right across from the Apple Store.\n\nTIP - if you want to go to the food court, park on the second level. There's an entrance that takes you right to the escalator that goes down to the yummy floor.\n\nLCBO and a movie theater are here too (I didn't say I bring beer to the movies with me. I also didn't not say that.). This LCBO is pretty big and if you're going on a date you kill 4 birds with one stone - wine at LCBO, movie at SilverCity, dinner and Moxies and hopefully some contraceptives at Shoppers for the end of the night :D
