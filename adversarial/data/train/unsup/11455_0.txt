Teddy's pizza is fabulous!  That's the only reason we go back.  Last night when I called to place my pickup order, the phone was answered with a very disheartened voice, as though it made him sad that an order was coming through.  I was quoted 20-30 minutes.  Knowing their tendencies for being late, especially with delivery, I left my house 35 minutes after the call.  Knowing I had to drive about 15 minutes, I figured this would give then plenty of time.  As I walked in the door I saw him putting my pizza in the oven.  Remember, this is at least 40 minutes after I called.  Silly me, I didn't check the pizza before I left.  When I got it home it was completely wrong.  \nI love Teddys pizza.  He's got one of the best crusts around.  It's really hard to give it 5 stars because they're slow and this isn't the first time our pizza was wrong.
