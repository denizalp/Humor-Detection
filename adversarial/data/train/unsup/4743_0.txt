My only gripe with this place is amount of food you get for the price you pay. It's almost $20 for a few eggs, some toast  & some bacon. The food quality is decent, just a little bit better than what they have in their buffet & for the price you're spending here you're probably better off having breakfast or lunch at the buffet. Besides that the restaurant is nice & clean, the wait staff was great, but will all the other options for breakfast & lunch in Vegas this wouldn't be near any of my top choices to eat. This is pretty much an option to eat if you're staying at the hotel, you wake up hung over & you don't feel like traveling too far to eat.
