AVOID ALL the Walgreens on the Strip!! They are nothing but TOURIST GOUGING BUSINESS'S & not your neighborhood store you may be accustomed to. For Example:\n\n I went into this store & brought my Arizona Iced Tea & pack of .99 cashews to the register & told the clerk \"The Iced tea is on sale this week\". She then asked if I had the coupon. I told her NO & asked her dont you have a Sales paper for this week?\" She answered \"NO.\"\n\nWTF?!! I then pulled out a reciept I just happened to have from a store I was at on Maryland blvd & showed it to her explaining that I DID NOT have a coupon then either and the store had a sales paper to accomodate me. She said she couldnt help me. I told her get the mgr.\n\nThe mgr came and explained that I needed to have a coupon. I showed her my reciept and told her I've NEVER heard of a Walgreens that didnt have a sales paper to accomodate customers and went on to say QUITE LOUDLY that all they were doing was \"gouging tourist\" by not honoring their weekly sales paper or making it available.\n\nI left and will NEVER solicite any of these STRIP stores ever again & I will be venting with Walgreens mgmt via the 1800-763-0547 number.\n\nAvoid these STRIP stores at all cost!!
