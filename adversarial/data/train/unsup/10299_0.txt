Character written all over this joint, It's like that friend of yours that you know has just been around the block a few times, but still a good friend. You know? \n\nI didn't eat much, it was some type of cream filled crepe topped with strawberries and whipped cream, but yummy none the less. The waitress was nice and closed the blinds part way through the meal to shield all of us sitting near the windows from the sun. Very considerate, I like considerate people, a lot more than those who aren't. But I don't remember getting a refill on my water...\n\nAll in all, not a bad experience but not a awesome one, so 3 stars, yay for Coco's.
