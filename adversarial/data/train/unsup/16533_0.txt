All the reviews say this place is amazing, but we never got the chance to experience it for ourselves.  The three of us wanted to take an Intro to Pole class today at 1pm, but we're turned away because we didn't sign up online. When I called earlier in the week to inquire about the class, I was told to go online to find more info.  I was not told that the ONLY way they'll let you in was to sign up online.  The three of us came ready to take the class, and one of the ladies ran outside saying \"Can I help you?\" before we could even get  in the door.  She said the class was cancelled because no one signed up for it.  But here you have THREE people willing to pay you NOW to patronize your business, and you turn us away?  $60 would have been better than nothing, right?  Terrible business practice.  She didn't even offer to accommodate us or sign us up for another class.  Just cold turned us away.  Can they not accept money on premises?  I will not be recommending this place to anyone if this is how they treat potential customers.
