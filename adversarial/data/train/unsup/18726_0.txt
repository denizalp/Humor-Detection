What an incredible event! I already can't wait to go back to Tanzy and IPic! It was such a beautiful night and Tanzy had such a beautiful set up of the food, fires lit, and all their windows open to enjoy this gorgeous weather. We all got 2 drink tickets and the servers were awesome about checking in and being friendly to everyone. \n\nTons of food! They had a fresh pulled mozzarella stand, pasta with meatballs table, and a bruschetta\/Charcuterie table. The bruschetta was my favorite and the meatballs were so tender and flavorful.\n\nAfter chatting and eating the lite bites we were escorted into the beautiful theatre. The recliner chairs were so comfortable with the pillow and blanket. It was almost a struggle to stay awake...whoops. Free cookies, cocktails, fountain drinks, and popcorn during the movie were awesome! Such a relaxing night to enjoy a movie. \n\nThanks yelp and Tanzy\/IPic for this excellent event! Looking forward to coming back soon with my hubby for date night.
