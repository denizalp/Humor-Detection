My Vegas go to man comes through again!\n\nCraving some Agedashi Tofu, we called Yokohama Kaigenro to see if they had any.  They said they did.  So off to the strip we were headed to fill my belly with this yummy stuff.  \n\nFirst off, you got to love a menu with Japanese and English on it.  (I mean, do they really have that many Japanese people eating there?  Yes they do!  The waitresses are all Japanese and so are the sushi chefs!)  Their menu also has pictures to help you out, so that makes it all that much more easier.\n\nWe ordered the Tsukemen, which was an order of ramen noodles and another bowl of soup with tofu, pork, hard boiled egg, etc.  Usually, most ramen places combine this stuff into one heaping bowl for you, but they separate it out for you here.  \n\nWe also ordered their special Uni Ikura Rice Bowl, with was a layer of rice slathered with Uni and then topped with Ikura.  Sprinkles of seaweed flakes and sesame seeds rounded out this dish.  I am usually not an Uni fan and will never order the stuff.  But I decided to give it another try and it was way creamy and yummy.  My friend was forced to share this lovely concoction with me! Haha!  This also came with a bowl of miso soup.  Although noted on the wall that this order was $15.95, we were charged only $9.95.  We're not sure if this was a mistake on their part, or if this was their lunch price.  \n\nMy only complaint really was their version of what they said was Agedashi Tofu.  It really was deep fried tofu covered in a thick gravy sauce, not what I had in mind.  This version is what I can get in a Chinese restaurant, and I was looking for something a bit lighter.  So, you won't find me ordering this again.  \n\nThey also played an LV local radio station and got a fan out of me.  With two TVs going on, there can be a lot of distractions though.  \n\nAnother little perk is their little market right when you walk in.  They sell anything from rice, to tempura batter, to fresh veggies or Japanese snacks.  Now, how often can you go out for lunch and dinner, and then grab some groceries while you're there?\n\nYou'll find me slurping noodles at this place, or getting my face mixed into the Sea Urchin\/Salmon Roe concoction.  Yum-my!\n\nUpdate! 11\/13\/06 - Do NOT try the Potato Yam\/Tuna concoction on rice.  The waitress recommended it and it was an oh-so bad choice!  The yam stuff was a slimy white mess that reminded me of something else that should not be consumed on rice with tuna.  Yuck yuck yuck!  I'm not changing my stars though because it's because of them that I'm a converted Uni lover!  *sigh*\n\nUpdate! 04\/01\/07 - They changed their menus...which means their prices went up.  I ordered the Ikura\/Uni bowl as I always do.  Not only was the presentation a bit different, but it seems like you get less now and you have to pay more for it though.  Sad sad.
