As Kristin C. noted, this place is now called Canton Wong #8.  \n\nWe tried Canton Wong for the first time last night, and based on our first experience, I think it warrants a solid 3+ stars.  We called in an order of Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken, Egg Fried Rice, and Crab (or maybe \njust Cream Cheese?) Puffs on the way home from our kickboxing class.  Kind of defeats the purpose of the kickboxing class, I guess, except that we probably would have eaten the Chinese anyway.\n\nI must admit that I was skeptical about Canton Wong #8 because of the location and the *extremely* low prices, and when the man on the phone told us that our order would be ready for pickup in 5 minutes, my skepticism grew.  Needless to say that when we arrived to find that the front door of the restaurant was locked, I started to think that I should have trusted my instincts and stayed away.\n\nLuckily, after beginning to follow arrows painted on the building around a dimly lit alley that led past the dumpsters, we heard someone opening the front door to let us in.  The inside of the restaurant is nothing fancy, but appeared clean.  Everyone working there was very friendly, and they also told us that they've expanded their delivery to include our development and others south of Dobbins.  Everything we ordered--which was more than enough to serve as dinner for two last night *and* lunch for two today--came to less than $20, and the crab\/cream cheese puffs mentioned above came free with our order of more than $15.\n\nRelative to my expectations, the food was amazing.  Both the beef and chicken were high-quality, nothing was too greasy, and despite eating much more than I should have, I didn't feel gross after the meal.  Judged more objectively, the food was good but not great.  None of our dishes was particularly flavorful, and I was disappointed to find that the Mongolian Beef--billed as spicy on the menu--was utterly bland.\n\nThese caveats aside, I'm thrilled to have found a solid neighborhood (Americanized) Chinese delivery place.  Note, too, that Canton Wong #8 has an unbelievable lunch special; entrees start at about $3.50, and combos pairing an entree with steamed or fried rice and an eggroll run a seriously affordable $4.15.\n\nNext time, I plan to ask for my food to be prepared extra spicy.  If Canton Wong #8 is able to oblige, it will definitely merit a 4th star.
