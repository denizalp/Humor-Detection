I've been using their daycare service for a few months now and am very satisfied with A Dog's Life.  Sonny and the rest of the team are great with my dog and I can tell he loves spending the day with them and the rest of the pack. \n\nI think the best part is the boarding service. They take your dog home and treat is as their own, not like other places that leave the dogs alone overnight.\n\nThey have a groomer in a few times a week who does a good job too.
