It's a nice bakery. There are lots of options, and I bought egg tart, pineapple bread, taro bread, and sticky rice cake with red bean. The one in picture is tasty. The cashier is not very friendly tho. She assumed I speaker Cantonese, and seemed like in a hurry. But I'll visit there again. The price is decent too.
