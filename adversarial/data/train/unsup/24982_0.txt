I spent the whole week in Pittsburgh thinking there's no good ethnic food. Then I discovered Squirrel Hills....\nThis restaurant has a very modern vibe. The food however is fairly authentic (hand made noodles, soup dumplings, and other snack type of Chinese food). The food is Taiwanese in style although some dishes have a northern China vibe. \n- beef noodle soup: good stewed beef, good noodle, soup could've been brothier (just add some juice from the beef stew), I'm also missing pickled veggies Taiwanese style;\n- soup dumplings: tried the Sunday special seafood ones, very light and delicate tasting, waitress gave us dishes with ginger but no vinegar which is a little odd;\n- Dan Dan noodle: soupier that what I'm used to, not spicy either, was alright.\n\nOverall a pretty great spot, sorry for being picky, I'm just really Chinese lol.
