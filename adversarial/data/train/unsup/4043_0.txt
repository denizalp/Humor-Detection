For someone who doesn't usually order waffles anywhere else, I love the variety of offerings at Bruxie.  Not everything on the menu has to do with breakfast, either.\nThis Sin City location is very nice and spacious with some huge windows overlooking the Park Vegas, great for people-watching.  The lines were not really long when I've gone and service is quick and friendly.  \n\nWhat I've Had:\nFried Chicken Poutine:  just yum!  Treat yo'self to this item for the combo of waffle fries, buttermilk fried chicken, cheese curds, and gravy.  It's worth the cheat. \n The Buffalo Bleu Fried Chicken sandwich is basically like eating buffalo wings on a waffle and if you like those, you'll like this item.  And, it's not really too spicy which I appreciate.  \nThe Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar waffle is nice for breakfast; you can add another egg and prosciutto to make it even nicer. \n Ask for the Fluffernutter from the secret menu for a sweet little treat.  I still haven't tried the Lemon Cream and Berries, but it's on my list.\nIf you're in the area, try Bruxie out for a fast, casual, and fun meal.
