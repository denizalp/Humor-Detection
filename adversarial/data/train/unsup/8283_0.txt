I became curious about The Burger's Priest after seeing it on so many \"Best of\" and \"Top 10\" lists. Even carnivores lauded the vegetarian \"Option\", so I made the journey over one night to pick myself up an Option for dinner.\n\nStepping into The Burger's Priest is basically the equivalent of going to church, because there are so many rules about what you can or can't do. Even though there are a couple of stools inside, there's a sign explicitly saying that there is no dining in. There's another sign on the door telling you how to line up, where to stand, etc. I guess there needs to be some law and order since it's an extremely tight space inside, and I feel like it's always pretty crowded in here.\n\nAfter a bit of a wait, I traded my ticket for a brown paper bag holding the goods. Since it was cold and dark outside and I didn't want to stand on the sidewalk trying to juggle my belongings while simultaneously eating a messy burger, I had to wait until I was back at home to tuck in to my fully loaded \"Option\", which had already cooled down significantly, making the huge gob of cheese inside extremely rubbery and unpleasant. Also, for $7.99, the burger is fairly small. The breading on the mushrooms was crispy and good during the first few bites, but the deep-fried nature of the thing made me feel a bit sick afterwards.\n\nThe verdict: another one of those places where I don't really get the hype! For a place that's tiny, has no seating inside, and is a bit of a trek from the downtown core, I admit that it's impressive that The Burger's Priest has such a devoted following, even if I'm not a convert. My advice: don't come here super hungry, and don't come here with high expectations.\n\nCASH ONLY (but there's an ATM inside).
