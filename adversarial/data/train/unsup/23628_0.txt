My very first time being able to gamble!!\n\nThis review is strictly for the casino. My grandma lives around here and I finally came to Vegas to start house hunting and she wanted to show us around LOL.\n\nThis casino is so nice and I didn't feel like we were in a boatload of cigarettes either! They must have good ventilation even though there were quite a few smokers it wasn't unbearable! Most casinos make you plug your nose from all of the smoking!\n\nI mostly went for the penny slots and they had a huge selection! I'm happy to say I made my money back LOL! There was only one weird thing that happened while out on the floor. My mom and I were sitting next to each other at the machines and one female employee walked past me giving me a weird look and then a few minutes later a male employee asked us if we wanted to sign up for their rewards card, he did my mom's in two seconds but then when it came to my turn he took my ID somewhere and was gone for a bit, I'm not sure if I looked so young that they wanted to card me but it was random and awkward. \n\nHe should of just asked me flat out, and I wouldn't have had any problem showing my ID. There's a few other casinos my grandma wants to show me so I'm not sure if I'd come back on a basis.
