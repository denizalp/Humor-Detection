Don't let the building fool you.  It looks like an old school diner and smells like cigarettes especially in the bar but the food and service in the restaurant was unbelievable. We were pleasantly surprised. Best Reuben, grilled cheese and burger ever. It's like dinner and a show with the fun people watching. Food is plentiful and the prices are reasonable.
