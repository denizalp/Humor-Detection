I got my ears pierced here almost a year ago. These guys know what they're doing. They're the only tattoo and piercing place that posts up all of their health inspection forms up on their website for all to see. They're a bit pricy, ($60 both earlobes) but I never got an infection. Compare that to my 3 cousins who got their ears done at Claire's with a gun and had their piercings ooze pus like Mt Vesuvius over pompeii.\n\nThis place is clean and sterile. Most of my friends who have gotten weird piercings and first time tattoos go here just coz it's been around forever and coz it's SAFE and CLEAN. There are a ton of blood borne diseases and viruses, this is not a service you want to cheap out on.  \n\nHighly recommended.
