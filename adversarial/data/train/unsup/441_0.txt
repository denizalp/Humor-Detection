I'm sorry it took me this long to finally be getting around to reviewing this place. John and Ed run the best garage I've ever taken my vehicles to in my entire life. They are thorough and do excellent work. They're very reasonably priced and most importantly I have never left there without peace of mind. I used to live right up the road from them so I originally found them through convenience. Now that my wife and I live in Strongsville I find myself still driving all the way up to Parma to have John and dad take care of all of our automotive needs. What can I say, when you find a good mechanic that you have complete faith in you do not want to give them up! I would recommend Broadview auto care to anyone who needs mechanical work done. And on top of that I would stake my reputation on the work that they do. In fact if you tell them that \"Colin sent you\", John will want to know exactly how you know me....  Over the years these guys have become friends of mine.
