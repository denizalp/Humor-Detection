Came here with my family about 7 of us, made reservations , got seated right away on a friday night. Servers were very attentitive to our table there was never and empty glass or empty plates at the table. I had the wedge salad was amazing maybe slight over dressed with dressing for some but i thought it was perfect. I got the charlotte crab soup that was very creamy served hot nice amount of crab too. This place was highly reccomended to us and very happy we saved it for when your family was in town.
