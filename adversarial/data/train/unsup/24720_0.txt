The best new bar in downtown Montreal hands down. Hand crafted cocktails in a speakeasy setting with a healthy mix of tourists and locals. The ambience and decor are as carefully crafted as the drinks. A total prohibition era throwback. These guys really know their stuff. Oh and the music is a great eclectic mix.\n\nAnd if I may objectify the staff, they're the most gorgeous bunch and as friendly and accommodating as can be . Jordan, Aidan, Phil, JÃ³n and Daniel kept our glasses full all night. And the owner was a great help in helping us retrieve a forgotten item.\n\nIt's a mellow vibe through most of the night but the laughs and great interactions take place once you get past midnight if you're a social person who likes to meet new people.
