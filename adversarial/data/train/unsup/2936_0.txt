By now, you've probably all seen what this place looks like either on the news, Yelp! or Instagram, and it truly is beautiful inside.\nI came with some family members for Happy Hour.\nI was offered a drink, but declined stating I was going to wait a bit for the rest of my party. Well the server took that to mean that I wasn't going to drink at all that night and routinely ignored me when taking everyone else's drink orders once they arrived.\nThe food was decent. Nothing earth-shattering, inventive or innovative. The blended margarita was good, and the wine was tasty, but as my uncle said \"just because the restaurant looked like a church doesn't mean they have to give us communion sized portions!\"\nWill I come back? Yes, several friends want to try it out. Are there better options? Yes! I'm dying to get back to Gallo Blanco. Better tacos! And less expensive!
