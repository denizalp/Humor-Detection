I would eat here three times a day! The food is the best in Vegas for the price. $4.99 gets you a huge plate of homestyle cooking. You can sit at the counter or at one of the booths, all while looking out the window at such beautiful sights as the Yucca Motel. Ever since seeing Robert Duvall sitting here in the film, \"Lucky You,\" I've been drawn to Tiffany's. The help is more than friendly, the food is great and the atmosphere is fantastic. Old school all the way. They are open 24 hours AND deliver! When you are done, you can mosey on over to the drugstore portion of the building and get some ex-lax. It's a win-win! Two words: greek omelet.
