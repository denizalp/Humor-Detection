Our family recently visited Brokin Yolk for breakfast. We heard great things about the restaurant and also heard that line ups are a normal occurrence. So we decided to call in advance before heading down.\n\nWe were seated right away, and our orders came in quickly. For a super busy restaurant, they get all the orders out quickly without any problems. \n\nThe atmosphere of the atmosphere was great and their servers were very attentive. \n\nWe ordered 2 waffles and chicken, pulled pork hash, salmon benny, Nutella french toast, usual farm breakfast (eggs, bacon, toast, rtc), and tocino with rice.  All were amazing! The only minor complaint was that the chicken still had the bones in it, so it was a bit hard to just cut on top of the waffles.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend Brokin Yolk, but make sure to call in advance so you are not waiting in line for hours before getting seated.
