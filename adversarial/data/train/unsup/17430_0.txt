From the moment we walked in, I was very impressed with how organized this place looks as I have been to a few gun shops in the past.  The staff were so helpful and friendly, they know their stuff!  We had a machine gun and a pink 22 semi auto to shoot along with one of their instructors. I wish I remembered his name since he was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and easy to talk to.  He answered our questions with extreme professionalism.  He gave me some great tips which perfected my shooting skills.\n\nI highly recommend this place when you get tired of the casinos and wanna take your losing anger out somewhere. :)  This is your place!!
