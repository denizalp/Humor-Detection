Who would think you could find decent Mexican food in Old Town.? Located among the souvenir shops is a welcomed destination. \nWe started with a margarita spiced with jalape√±os, that finishes with a little bite to it. We ordered guacamole and chips to start.  Next, we went with a burrito and enchiladas. The portion sizes are large and are very filling. Red and green sauce options are available to finish.
