I was in the area and decided too stop quick for a bite too eat.\nI sore a huge line at the drive up so I decided too go in instead.\nThat was probably as big a mistake as it would of been to stay on drive thru line.\nI was 2nd in line walking in and it took literally 10 minutes for them to get to me to take my order.\nShame on you guys terrible customer service and extremely slow.\nThey seemed too be taking the drive up orders first then the walk ins.\nThere where more employees working on the drive up window than inside which there was only one cashier.\nI ordered two hamburgers with extra pickle and a large fry.\nThe only positive thing I can say is the order was correct and the food was the same as every other McDonalds.\nI would not go too this McDonalds again unless I saw that there was no line on the drive thru.\nRidiculous waiting almost 20 minutes too order and get food in a fast food place.
