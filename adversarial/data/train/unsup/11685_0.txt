I haven't eaten at every buffet in Vegas, but I can say with complete confidence that nothing could possibly be worse than this. Do not believe anyone who says they enjoyed this place, they are demented, and considering that no one in the place appeared to be under the age of 65, dementia has to be a factor because anyone who would return to this place has to be insane and since everyone there appeared to be a regular, I felt as if I were dining inside an asylum.\n\nIt's unbelievable that this buffet is more expensive than Fiesta Rancho's which is exponentially better. Nothing, I mean nothing, was edible, everything sucked, go to the Chinese station, the Mexican station, the place with the godawful chicken potpie and what I guess was supposed to be Cordon Bleu, next to the nasty Tilapia fillets, I couldn't stomach any of it.\n\nI tried some spaghetti but I couldn't top it with any of the beyond frightening meatballs, they looked like they came straight out of an Eli Roth movie. Even the fruit I could not eat because it looked like someone had taken bites out of the watermelon and cantaloupe slices and tossed them back on the bar.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the food: the grannies racing around on their motorized scooters were extremely dangerous...bingo could not start soon enough.\n\nLook, I am by no means a picky eater and am an extremely tolerant person, but this place would even test the endurance of Job and I doubt God would have been cruel enough to put him through it. As I stared at the grease pooling on my plate, drowning god knows what I knew without a doubt that I had shortened my lifespan by several days by paying this place a visit.\n\nThe fact that I had picked up a player's card beforehand was hardly a consolation. Save me a dollar?  I' m the one who should be paid for being here...I tossed it in the garbage with the rest of the refuse.
