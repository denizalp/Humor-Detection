The interior almost looks like it could be the window display of a furniture store, with a nice roomy space with a communal table under a tiny chandelier and a pretty big and comfy couch. \n\nI'm not sure how busy it gets but seating is very limited, fortunately it was pretty empty when I walked in and sat myself down on the couch. This is another place where I really wish I could bling up my review with half stars because this is a 4.5 star place for me! \n\nWhy is it not 5 stars? Good question. It was my drink, now I've never had a nutella based coffee drink before (and they've got 2 on the menu!) so I had to get one. I settled with the nutellate over the nutellaccino. Next time in order to get my cocoa fix I will probably stick to mochas. My drink was not horrible at all but there was just that hint of bitterness that didn't sit well with me since I was a expecting nice frothy nutella drink. \n\nGot myself a chocolate almond cookie for just over $1 and it made for a great pairing with my drink. The staff behind the counter was very friendly, like most of my favourite coffee shop staff she was not overly chatty but was very pleasant when we did chat about my drink etc. And similar to @Isabella's experience I had to be the one that had to point out I had yet to pay on my way out! \n\nNext time I'm here, I'll switch around my drink options and give myself the 5 star experience that Bisogno is sure to deliver!
