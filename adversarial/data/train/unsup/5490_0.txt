Even though this is a AAHA,  we still won't come back because I don't know how they got their AAHA because we had a very bad experience here with our dog. We took our dog here because he had a shomach problem and the vet there said he might have something in his shomach and she wanted to do a ultrasound and some blood work to make sure.  So we agree on the work but was surprised by the price they charged us after the ultrasound and blood work.  In the end they found nothing . My dog just ate something bad. They should know if there was something in his shomach or not in the first place if they are experienced.  We ended up pay like $1000 for nothing.  What surprised me was the vet told us was about $700 for everything but $1000 in the end. Yes they lied. I won't mind paying $1000 if there was something in my dog shomach and I just can't believe they lie about the price. I won't recommend anyone coming here.
