Came here for a quick stop yesterday on my way home from lunch.\nIt is always good to shop for food after you have eaten because, you are not as likely to buy things you do not want or need.\nI managed to get out or here for less than $20.00, very good for me you know.\nOf course we all really like Fresh and esy around here.\nIt is quick and easy and I am sorry they are going out of bussiness. \nI always find something here that I like and want.\n\nMy girlfriend likes all the British food they have to offer.\nI myself am not too crazy about it,but since she grew up on that stuff she loves it!\n\nShe says it is one of the best places to buy it(here at F & E).\nGreat vegetables and fruit, good prices. Quick and Easy. What more could you ask for. Parking is a breeze as well.
