This is our food away from home. Of course it's double the price we pay here in Houston, but I'm glad at least it tasted good.  I'm always a little weary of Chinese food on unknown territory. We ordered soft shell crab, scrambled eggs and shrimp, pork wonton in red oil, shumai, pad thai, orange chicken, and beef flat noodles. All were tasty.  The pad thai is pretty spicy though. I actually really enjoyed the orange chicken and that's usually a hit or miss at places. I would definitely return when I come back to Vegas!
