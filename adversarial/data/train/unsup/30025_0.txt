I'd like to update my review of Red Carpet VIP. Based on my experience, I would not feel comfortable saying that \"I'm a fan\" or even that they're \"A-ok.\" My friends and I did get that refund we were waiting for. However, this was only after I had requested it more than once and been accused of lying.\nI've added a star because a representative that I had not dealth with during my stay in Vegas reached out to me with an apology for our subpar experience and a promise of a better experience should I try their services in the future.\nI am glad to read that other Yelpers had a much much better experience than my friends and I had. Hopefully, our experience was simply a fluke and not due to anything else.
