In Vegas European pool is code for, morbidly obese older women will be the only topless ones.  I wanted to be topless here, really I did.  But there were so many single guys staring already it would have been weird.  I loved the environment of being able to get away from the families and kids and have some alone time with the boyfriend so it wasn't awkward having kids watch our drunk selfs make out at the regular pool.  \n\nExpensive drinks, $20 Pina Coladas.  Expensive Cover charge $50 Men $20 women.\n\nTo go against some of the other reviews, you can be topless here again, but whether you want to or not is the choice.  We walked in and some guy had his escort hit on me as we walked in, that made it tense and weird for  girls around the pool she was offering to rub tanner on.  Freaking Vegas.
