I love the ability to customize all aspects of your meal. You have so many options to make your perfect hot dog, or go a little crazy with a peanut butter and fruit loop hot dog (Check out Michael Symon's favorite - chunky peanut butter, siracha, alien relish). Not to mention all the sauces you can get, unlimited choices! I believe it's about 50 options of homemade toppings (again, unlimited!) The cost is completely reasonable. $6 for hot dog with your choice of toppings and sauces. $3 for tater tots with unlimited sauces and then additional toppings like cheese sauce and chili for additional $1. Great beer selection as well! Plenty of micro brews. I HIGHLY recommend the chimichurri sauce for the tater tots... My favorite!! Also, the service was great!
