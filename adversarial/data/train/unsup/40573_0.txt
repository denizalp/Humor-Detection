Should have known when it's prime dinner time and no one was in the place. First the yakisoba free item was less than an appetizer portion more like a bite of crappy old noodles. Better not to offer it. I had the shoyu ramen special which was like soy sauce water with some package ramen. The other thing we ordered was the mackerel which was like he sardines in a can that I get for 99 cents at 99 ranch market. All in all, place was  awful and never coming back again. The previous yelpers who positively rated this place was probably related to the owners.
