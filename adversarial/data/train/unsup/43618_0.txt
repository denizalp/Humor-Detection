The ribs were okay.  Menu stated I would get two sides and a salad, it was a misprint, so I got one side.  I was okay with that since our very good waitress let me know in advance, but the coleslaw was not good at all.  The other dish at the table was overpriced for what it was.  Ravioli, which was most likely frozen with canned sauce or a sauce that was substandard.  I think the menu is much too large to keep things fresh and quality.  Better to have a small menu and do those items well, than a huge menu that is mostly just frozen stuff.  If you are going to serve frozen items, the price need to reflect that, so the Ravioli should be under $10.  The salad was good though and pretty fresh.  The beer selection isn't very good for an area like Aspinwall.  It is tough these days with super high overhead and all the massive taxes from Onorato, but places still can deliver.   \n\nThe atmosphere, even though it is a sports bar with a ton of TVs is still friendly and nice.  I wish it had no TVs and had a small menu with really good food, but that is very hard to find in our region.  I will return and get snacks and a beer.  Like the people there.
