The best dive spot in Madison! Hands down. Just don't cuss. Not kidding, they will eject you. Everything (and I mean everything) is covered in tiger decor and memorabilia  ... Stiff drinks, good beers and a free popcorn machine (use at your own risk) plus a great cheap juke box with some oldie hits on it. Gets a diverse crowd and steady streams of college age visitors, who don't stay long though leaving the few regulars at the bar. Tiny, tiny place right next to a paint store. But inside is a wonderland of gaudy tiger stuff. Plus it's open late. A must visit!
