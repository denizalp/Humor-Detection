I needed cute cupcakes for my girlfriends birthday and was content with grocery store bought ones but I wanted them to be decorated nicer and made a little more special. A coworker told me about this place so I called 3 hours before I needed to pick them up to place the order. \n\nWhen I placed the order for mini cupcakes I stated that I wanted them decorated for a girls birthday. \"Girlie colors and happy birthday\". Whoever took my order seemed to understand. She asked if I wanted to pay over the phone or when I picked them up, I said when I pick them up how much will it be? \"$60\" I almost canceled right on the spot. $60 for two dozen MINI cupcakes? But whatever it's for my friend I thought \"ok see you at 6:30\" I replied. \n\nWhen I picked them up I liked what I saw other than there was nothing whatsoever hinting that these were birthday cupcakes when I clearly stated they are for a girls birthday. But nonetheless they were cute girly cupcakes so $60 later I was back in the car on the way home with my cupcakes carefully situated on the floor of the front seat of my car so nothing could happen to my precious, expensive treats. \n\nI arrived home after my 21 minute cautious drive back and my cupcakes were ruined! The icing slid off everywhere and onto other cupcakes, the sprinkles melted their color onto the icing. WTF! 21 minutes in the car and my $60 down the drain. Now obviously the car situation isn't necessarily their fault, I don't expect them to have mini seat belts for mini cupcakes but it just soured my experience and now girlfriend gets an ugly surprise. Not cool.
