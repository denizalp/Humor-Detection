Daniel did an amazing job with the renovations. Love the Tiffany blue and silver pillows. Best hookah in town but now it's the  best hookah place in town. Exquisite taste in design. Now I don't want to hang any place else:) Great Service, Delicious food\/cocktails,and The best hookah in town. You can't go wrong if you decide to kick it here tonight :)
