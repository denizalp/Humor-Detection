The easiest part of my move was shipping my car cross-country from San Diego to the South. My rep was Charles, quote was good for 30 days. DAS is excellent...on time...in contact with you....my car was transported and actually arrived 5 days early. You can also track the vehicle on-line. I used the door to door service, car was delivered clean, at the time scheduled over phone and there were no damages.  I highly recommend the company.
