I was a little off-put by its location cuz... you know... strip club... with boobies... and I'm -- well, anyway, finally Emijandro and I got out to the location on a couple of recommendations and holy bananas it's some of the breast Mexican food in Vegas.\n\n...BEST. It's some of the BEST Mexican food in Vegas. (I feel like a real boob for making that joke.)\n\nOnce inside though, you'll forget it's next to a titty bar. The atmosphere is a really chill type, where it can be casual with friends or intimate with a special someone, but enough about that... the FOOD. OMG so good. I was really torn as to what to order, there was so much good stuff on the menu. I finally settled on the breakfast burrito, and it was fantastic. Paired with a good stiff margarita, it was absolutely exceptional.\n\nThe service was phenomenal, and the Chef himself even came out to make sure everything was to our liking, especially Emijandro's flan. We will most certainly be back here.\n\nUntil the next review, ta-tas! (Singular. Dang, another boob joke. I feel like an absolute tit.)
