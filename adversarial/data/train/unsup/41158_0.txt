Wow!  Not a huge fan of the classic sub - I was totally blown away by Papa Kelsey's Sub sandwich.  Fresh bread and crisp vegetables compliment your choice of fixings! The staff is friendly and accommodating.  We enjoyed our lunch in the nice clean cafe styled restaurant, but they offer take out as well as daily specials. YUM!
