When it comes to doughnuts, I'm a yeast guy. Cake doughnuts have always come second. But, since Fractured Prune was so close to work, I decided to drop in after a shift. Unlike your typical doughnut shop, there were no doughnuts to purchase in front of you. Doughnuts are instead sold in pairs and made fresh right before your eyes. It was fun to see the doughnuts float along the assembly line and get made with glaze and toppings in real time. By the time they reach your hand, they are still pipping hot!\n\nFor my first doughnuts, I tried the bacon bomb and the salted caramel. Both were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. I was shocked by how good the cake doughnuts were, even though I took it home and ate it a couple hours later after they had cooled. At $3.79 for two, the doughnuts are pricier than your usual pink box variety, but they don't come any fresher than this!
