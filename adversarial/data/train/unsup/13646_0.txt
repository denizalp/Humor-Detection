I have such mixed feelings about KaKa. It has a lot of good points but also a lot of bad points... too bad, otherwise it'd be a pretty great AYCE restaurant.\n\nIf you don't make a reservation, you can easily wait for 30-40 minutes for a table. You also have to write down your order number and amount, as opposed to an iPad ordering system like most AYCE places. Ok, sure- that's fine. The thing is, the servers will normally give you less than you ordered. If you wanted 15 pieces of sashimi, you'll probably end up with 5 or something. This happened every occasion I visited KaKa; I guess no one has complained about it since it happens each time. \n\nIt's really expensive, too- around $40 including tax and tip. I don't know if I ever order enough to justify that price tag, so I suppose it's more of a \"special occasion\" to venture here for dinner.\n\nI do think the food is very good though! They have a great range of sashimi, rolls, and desserts. I always get salmon and butterfish sashimi. The crême brulée is awesome too, so make sure to stock up on that. DON'T order the tacos, they come in a really cheap shell and is drenched with odd sauce. I don't really like their red meat options either (personal preference), so it's really the sushi that are the superstars here! \n\nI would come back in a few months... after my stomach has recovered from bingeing on too much sashimi.
