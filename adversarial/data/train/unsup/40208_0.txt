We visited on July 1st prior to an evening out with the girls. What a wonderful place - amazing food, great atmosphere. Our server (I apologize, I can't recall his name) was excellent, friendly and very knowledgeable about the food and wine. He gave us a small lesson in red wine, as I honestly don't know anything and was trying it for the second time.  I tried the Pinot Noir from New Zealand at his recommendation and now I'm a wine lover for life!  I definitely recommend this establishment based on both the quality of food and more so the excellent service.
