Came here twice while in Montreal and think it is a solid choice.   First time, just had beer because the kitchen was closed.  I had the amber and it was fine.  Nothing too unique.\n\nSecond time came for dinner with a bunch of friends.  We ordered the meter of beer which came with a pizza and that was a great deal.  I had the French dip sandwich and I liked that a lot.  My friend enjoyed his salad.\n\nService the first time was okay but Laurie our waitress at dinner was outstanding.   This is definitely a reliable place to have decent beer and good food.
