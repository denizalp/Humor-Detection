In fairness to Islands, I'm not a burger fanatic.  I didn't even want a burger necessarily, but since Islands was the closest thing to a vacation I might see this year, and they are known for their fine burgers, this is where we ended up.\n\nWe started with chips and salsa.  \"Started with..\" There lies my problem.  Why do I always have to \"start with\" something.  Why not \"start with\" my entree like a normal person.  I digress, I'm having a fat day.\n\nThe chips were a little over browned, but it's just a chip right?  The guacamole was actually pretty good, however.  I went with the Big Wave cheeseburger.  I love that the bun was toasted, but it was on the greasy side.  Other than that, no complaints, was actually quite a good burger.  The fries (thick cut-skin on) were not very good, however.  They were hot, but didn't seem fresh.  We did have great service though.\n\nIslands is quite a distance from me, so I think I would save the gas money and fly to Hawaii instead.  Funny how that was almost true not too long ago.  But if you're at Desert Ridge, it's worth the stop.
