Gave this place a try since I saw it is now open. Initially I was going to order a burger until I saw they had pastrami on the menu. I was thrown by the prices a bit. For a fast food place it all seemed a bit overpriced. I had a pastrami sandwich that cost almost $8 for just the sandwich. No fries or drink because that would have been almost $12. Now the sandwich had mustard, pickles, cheese and was on garlic ciabatta bread. I liked the flavor of the meat it was tender and the other stuff on the sandwich all meshed well together. For 2 people to eat complete meals here it can run around $25 which is too pricey for a drive thru joint. I did find on their website though how you can sign up for deals and they had printable coupons posted for really good deals on meals that include a drink. I will come back with coupons because I did like the sandwich but I'd never pay regular price.
