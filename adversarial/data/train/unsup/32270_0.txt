What a bummer! We used to love Toast--- it was our favorite restaurant in Davidson. Recently returned to dinner on a Saturday night and left incredibly disappointed. We were a party of three and one person's entree never arrived, without acknowledgement from the owner\/manager, who was standing next to our table! The wait staff was standing around chatting while we were waiting to order, and the table next to us was waiting for the menu. Really bad service. The food was pretty bad too. The Caesar salad lacked flavor and the crab cakes were as dry as can be. We didn't even want to try the dessert... We won't be back.
