Went there yesterday with my wife and kids... the service was great, polite and very nice. \nThe atmosphere is very nice, although we went there on a quiet time. It is very nice place for people with children, they provide crayons and a paper to colour, also the kids menu is good, and prices are fairly reasonable. \nThe burger is very delicious and I can admit that it is one of the nicest burgers we had for a long time. \nIf you are in the neighbourhood then you have to try it. I wouldn't recommend the poutine, however you can try making your own burger there.
