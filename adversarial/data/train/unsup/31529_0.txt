My family's Budget car rental reservation at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport was for $400; we were billed over $800. I called Budget to investigate and the customer service representative promised me it was a mistake; for proof, he gave me his employee number. Budget charged the $800 anyway. We've been struggling to get our money back for 8 weeks. According to my CC company,Â  we could wait still another 8 weeks. Not recommended.
