Upon checking I was informed that Rumor was holding an after hours party all weekend (Fri\/Sat\/Sun) from 12-6am.. Here's the problem - Rumor doesn't have a dance club & they decided to have the concert outside; within a few hundred yards of every hotel room on the property. \n\nIt's 4:57AM and I've had less than 2 hours of sleep in the last 48 hours b\/c that's impossible due to noise.   I'm contacting LV better business bureau tomorrow due to unfair business practices (You should  expect to be able to sleep from 12-6am when you pay for a hotel)\n\nDo yourself a favor; don't give this place a dime.
