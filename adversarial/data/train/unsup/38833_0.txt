Decided to try on a whim. Decent food and friendly staff...a little pricey for what you are getting considering it wasn't that much. The fried yuca was on point, hands down...and their green sauce on the table is like crack, lather that on EVERYTHING! The beef was a little lacking in both flavour and preparation...overcooked and under seasoned. Overall didn't regret the experience.
