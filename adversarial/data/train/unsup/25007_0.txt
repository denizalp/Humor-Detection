My friends and I managed to rack up a fair amount of comp points from the MGM and got to eat here pretty much for our entire trip.  What a spread!  Their offerings include king crab, juicy steaks, fresh bass, and what could be one of the best bread puddings I've ever had (I've only found 2 other places in my travels that have it this good).  I COMPLETELY understand why there's always a line out the door for their buffet.  Truely the gold standard in buffets and an absolute can't miss whenever you're in Vegas.
