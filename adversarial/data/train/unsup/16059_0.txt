This is a belated dinner review from September 2010.\n\nWe started off with some bread, goat cheese, nuts, a bowl of squash soup, and a couple of salads (see my pictures).  The goat cheese was great but everything else wasn't too memorable.\n\nI was scared the rest of the meal would head in the direction of the salads, but luckily that was not the case.  For entrees, we had the croque madam, the pork belly (a seasonal special), and the trout.  The croque madam was so delicious, but then again, how could one ever go wrong with a grilled sandwich with a fried egg on top?  The trout was superb--light, flaky and tender, pairing well with the sauces veggies and almonds (yes, almonds).  It was also humongous!  We barely finished it!  The pork belly, unfortunately, was probably the biggest disappointment (mostly because the waiter kept raving about how good it was).  The cooking traditions of Taiwan and Japan must have spoiled me, because I am used to expecting the satiny sensation of pork fat melting in my mouth, but the braised pork I had that night was on the dry side.  The potatoes and vegetables were still good, though.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the eponymous bouchons, which came with three different ice creams\/sorbets (see my pictures).  Not something I would come just to this restaurant to order, but it was still yummy (for dessert, I personally think you are better off finding the Bouchon bakery stand next to the Phantom of the Opera theatre in the Venetian proper and buy anything that's there and enjoy it in the comfort of your hotel room).\n\nNow, this restaurant isn't cheap...but I think if you want to splurge and experience fine dining, then this is the place to do it.  Huge portions, high quality food, the Thomas Keller brand name, and a pleasant atmosphere totally make the extra $$$ worth it!
