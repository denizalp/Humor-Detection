I've been with them for 3 or 4 years, they have a branch right on ASU West campus in Glendale so that was super handy. I had a few issues with wording once on their transfers but when I went to talk to them they settle those issues and the wording that confused me was actually changed in their disclosure statements soon after, they likely had other people confused but I'd like to think it was just cause of how awesome I am. \n\nWhen the checking fee kicked in I had them switch me into a student checking account so I could get 5 years free checking, but now that I'm working again my direct deposits would keep me from getting a fee so for me it worked out great but I do agree there would be some reprive for people who aren't students and are unemployed though...I suppose using your debt card 10 times a month to avoid the fee isn't the hardest thing in the world, especially if you ever buy anything at 99 cents only. \n\nThey also have coinstar machines at a couple branches, and if your a member you don't pay that crazy 11% fee which saved me a ton! I really hope my pleasant experiences continue with them when I get the chance to buy a house.
