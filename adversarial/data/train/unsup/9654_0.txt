It isn't that Franktuary is bad, it is just way overpriced and way overrated. \n\nTheir hot dogs range from classic to extravagant with many options in between, but nothing really grabs your gut and twists, bellowing, \"Eat me you silly beast! I was made for you and you alone.\" \n\nSome of the waitstaff act a bit too cool for school. I mean, I get it, you slang fancy hotdogs downtown to flabby baby boomers and young professional bros. Still, cheer up a bit, kids. It isn't the end of the world.
