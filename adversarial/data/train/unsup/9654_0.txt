It's an ok Airport. It could stand for an update but they do their best to work around that. There could always be more outlets but... there ARE outlets available do musnt complain. Moderate in size, ample seating & clean bathrooms with decent food options including a froyo place in terminal B. I've been here more times than my check ins report, they've improved their TSA process greatly. The lines used to be long and it would get backed up. Now, there is an entire gate slated for TSA precheck. \n\nThe only grievance I have is that the rental cars are located in an offsite facility that requires you to shuttle there. The facility is about 5-10 mins from the airport. Make sure you save it's location for your GPS upon return and give yourself ample time to get there and make your way through the airport. One more thing... The jetway isn't sealed like most. So, if it's cold & windy outside, it's cold & windy in the jetway to board.
