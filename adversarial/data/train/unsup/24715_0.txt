The worst service ever!\nIt was a disaster right from the beginning. \nThey ordered the wrong jacket so I had to wait 3 hours for them to send a new one from their head office and the groom had to pay for the cab. Both side clips broke on my pants so I had to hold my pants up the whole night as they were falling. My friends shoes came apart, he couldn't dance cause the heel came off. Worst place ever! \nAvoid, Avoid, Avoid. \n$189.99 plus tax for crap!
