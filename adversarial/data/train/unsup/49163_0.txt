You want to have some fun??? Bowling has tired you out?? Then you need to try top Golf.  This is a fun place to be... I am pretty sure all locations are similar, but I have only been to the one at Talking Sticks out in Scottsdale.  Full bar, good food options and fun - low key golf driving.  This is like darts with golf balls. All ages can play, it is more about fun than accuracy.  We sucked, but we had a good time. They bring food and drinks to your 'lane'.  Good times. Would be great for a date night.
