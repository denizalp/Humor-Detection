I just want to say I stayed at the Days Inn Las Vegas and the wifi connection there, which you have a contract to support was beyond worthless. I could not get a decent signal there 4 out of 5 days I was there, and the time or two I called you, you had NO clue where the wireless access point was on the property and just kept referring me back to them in a vicious circle offering NO troubleshooting to me. You need to learn how to do IT support. UNACCEPTABLE!\n\nI see from the majority of your other reviews here that you are a trailer trash ISP.  It just goes to show that if you ever experience bad service, 10 other people (at least) have encountered the SAME THING!
