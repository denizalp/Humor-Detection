This place is daddy! This is the best Tapas place in Vegas, hands down. What's nice about this place is it's not all touristy etc. This is more of a locals hangout spot. Lot's of sexiness there, so you may wanna throw on some Cologne for this one. \n\nMy Favs: \n\nDates wrapped in Bacon \nThai Beef Salad \nBaked Tetilla \nMeatballs \nChicken Skewers \nDuck Rolls \nMerguez \nCherry Bread Pudding \n\nIts right across the street from the Hard Rock.
