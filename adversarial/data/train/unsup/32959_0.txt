This is a AIRPORT RESTAURANT people.  I see all these harsh reviews, NOT COOL.  This is a FIVE star airport restaurant.  They have really good food.  I ordered the Spicy Sausage and Mush flatbread.  Requested extra Arugula and wallah it was covered in glorious Arugula. My server, Julia, was absolutely lovely.  Very attentive, I never had to look for her, very knowledgeable of the menu, happy & upbeat, I would hire her in a second.  The restaurant itself was clean, laid out nicely has a very forward thinking motif. \n\nEat here.
