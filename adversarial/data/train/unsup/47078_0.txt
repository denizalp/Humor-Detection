Finally selling my favorite Korean drink, Soju, now. All the food are delicious and up to my LA Koreatown taste and quality. Deep fried chicken gizzards, bossam and spicy crispy chicken were great. You can't go wrong with their spicy menu selection. I saw that I can order from home using one of those apps so I will probably start ordering from home.
