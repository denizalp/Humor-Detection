I'm writing this review as a bookmark for myself to never order here again. \n\nI got tacos from the to-go counter. 3 tacos took 27 minutes to make. I had to beg the staff for literally any food from the kitchen just so I could make my flight. \n\nTo add insult to injury, the tacos were cold, didn't come topped with what I wanted and just had iceberg lettuce and pre-shredded cheese. \n\nWorst spend of $13 ever in an airport.
