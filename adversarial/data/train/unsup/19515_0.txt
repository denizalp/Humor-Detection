In my opinion, Sunday Funday should always start off with a bottomless mimosa brunch, and RnR is just the spot to do that. For $10, you can get all the mimosas or Bloody Marys your heart desires and your liver can handle from 10am-2pm. Our party of five must have averaged 7 per person. Key word is \"averaged.\" There were two in our group (who shall remain nameless) who probably pounded at least a dozen.\n\nThe food was really good! I'm not really sure what the whining is all about from a lot of the other reviewers. I loved my pork hash and maple bacon scone (genius), and my friend's grilled chicken sandwich with pesto, brie and sun dried tomatoes and side of sweet potato tater tots (even more genius) were delish! \n\nObviously, service was amazing, as our group was never left with an empty champagne glass for long. We had fun being rowdy out on the patio, which is an ideal spot on a nice sunny day. \n\nHappy hour specials (daily 3p-7p and reverse happy hour W-Th 10pm-2am) are awesome. Make sure you follow them on FB as well, as they're always announcing other specials.
