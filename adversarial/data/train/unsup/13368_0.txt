I'm not going to lie... The 1.5 star rating on this place had us very skeptical to even step foot in here. Moving into a brand new house, we were on a mission to find the perfect couch -- and honestly, we went to all the larger furniture places (Ashley's, Walkers, RC Wiley, etc) with no luck. We fell in love with two of the couches at Big's... but again, the low yelp rating and the horrific reviews had us resistant. \n\nWe continued to search, but honestly there was just no competition with the other places and had our heart set on getting the gray flannel sectional couch at Big's. We took a chance and hoped for the best... and I'm so glad we did!\n\nCOUCH ORDERED AT BIG'S: 11\/13\nCOUCH DELIVERED AT BIG'S: 11\/18\nCOUCH DELIVERED TO HOME: 11\/29\n(NOTE: This is the date we chose, due to move in date -- NOT because they couldn't deliver it sooner. They accommodated us and delivered it when we were ready, which was awesome!)\n\nWe had a great experience at this place from start to finish... Kim was our salesperson and she was awesome! She was not hounding us as we walked around or pushy (like all the other vulture salespeople at the different furniture stores we visited!), and she made it such a smooth & easy process! THANK YOU KIM & BIG'S FURNITURE! :)
