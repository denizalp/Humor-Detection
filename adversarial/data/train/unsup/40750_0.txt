Let me start by saying that when you sit down at a Mexican restaurant, you shouldn't have to ask for chips & salsa,  let alone ask for it 3 times!! My boyfriend & I started off with the habanero-lime margarita. Great fresh flavor but we weren't sure where the habanero disappeared to. There was no heat whatsoever. I ordered the 2 taco special--carnitas & shredded beef. Part of my order was wrong, there were only 2 pieces of carnitas, and the shredded beef taco was like a running faucet. My boyfriend ordered the carne asada burrito or should I say the 'rice burrito'...it had nothing but rice & was dry as hell. To top it all off, our waitress never even asked how we enjoyed our meal. Perhaps that was intentional on her part since our entire meal sucked!! Yelpers beware...don't waste your time or your $ on this place!
