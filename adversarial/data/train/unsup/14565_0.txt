I hate that I have to give this place two stars.  In fact, it should actually be one star.  However, because of past good dinner experiences, I decided to bump it up to two.  \n\nI ate lunch here for the first time with a group of friends.  About an hour or so later, I became so ill, I can't even express the discomfort I was in.  Without going into too many details, I had excruciating stomach pains.  I ended up at a nearby pub but spent the entire time in their bathroom.  I've never gotten sick from sushi before and of all places, I can't believe I got sick here!  \n\nI'm sorry, I really liked this place a lot.  I just can't go back anymore.
