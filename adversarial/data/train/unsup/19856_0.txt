I have been following this store through Instagram for months. Since I am from California and I only come to Las Vegas about twice a year... I had to make my visit to this location... I mean, Heat Locker to possibly win some pair of shoes for $5 a pop??? Had to do it! Actually got helped by JC (I believe he is the owner) and he was very friendly. We chatted for about 10 minutes about sneakers and other sneaker boutiques in LA. \n\nI have to say that I am very pleased with my visit and my purchase! I've been looking at them Chicago 1s for months and since I was not able to get a hold of one when it released, it was a must cop for me! IMHO this place has very good pricing! It was lot less than sneaker boutiques in LA, or even compared to ebay where you may be dealing with possibility of your sneaker being fake. \n\nIf you are in Vegas, and you love sneakers... You need to check this place out! Thank you JC and UN team! I for sure will be back for some more heat on my next visit!
