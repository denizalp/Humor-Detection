I stayed at the Luxor 6 years ago, and I do not remember it being as bad as my most recent stay.  Then again I was much younger and much more intoxicated the majority of my trip. \n\nMy husband and I stayed here for 2 nights at the end of our Vegas trip.  We had to switch rooms 2x's because of the shape the rooms were in.  Please note these were suites, not just regular rooms.  The furniture was damaged, couches were stained,  nonsmoking rooms smelled of cigarettes, horribly outdated, nonworking hot tubs, horrible water pressure, etc.  I could go on.  \n\nThe only good thing out of this hotel were the 2 free drink tickets (but not really free considering the daily resort fees) and the bell service and valet.  \n\nWILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN.
