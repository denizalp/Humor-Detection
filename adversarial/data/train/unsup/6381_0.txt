OK, I've been here a handful of times and I think it's ready to give the Crispy Crepe my honest review: It's as good as everyone says it is!\n\nPersonally, I think it's one of the best crepe spots in Charlotte. It's usually busy on the weekends so make sure you get here early or you will wait. However, I've noticed they always tell me it's a longer wait than it really is. Last time the wait was \"45 minutes\", but we only waited 20. \n\nAnyways- to the good stuff:\n\nChipotle Crepe (Chicken, Pico de Gallo, cheese,avocado & chipotle cream): You can't go wrong with chipotle. It's got a little kick to it, but nothing too over powering. If you're not a fan of spice, ask for a side of extra sour cream with it and definitely extra pico! \n\nSpinach Goat Cheese Crepe (Ricotta cheese with sundried tomatoes, cheese, spinach & roasted red pepper pesto): First of all, add chicken. It's bangin! You can also add chicken to any veggie crepe for a slight up-charge. This crepe is the bomb.com and one of my favorite savory crepes. So delicious! \n\nPecorino Chicken (chicken, romaine, parmesan & creamy caesar dressing): Basically it's like a chicken ceaser salad wrapped in a crepe and it's delicious! But it's also really big so come hungry! \n\nWaffles: Pretty good- super dense and a little aggressive if you eat it yourself. You might be in a sugar or chocolate coma after it so think about splitting it with someone else first. I had the Cookie Butter one and was in heaven while eating it.\n\nFor sides, the salad is good and I love their dressing - a creamy pesto basil dressing (?). The potatoes are also a must! They are so cheesy and delicious. \n\nFor the 2 pairs out there- do yourself a favor and order one crepe and one waffle or one savory crepe and one dessert crepe. Get the best of both worlds. Plus, the servers are happy to bring you an extra plate if you share.
