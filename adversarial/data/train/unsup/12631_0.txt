This review is for AFTER HOURS!\n\nThere's a lovely internet meme going around: No Arty, No Party. It's the damn truth.\n\nThe decor and style of the hotel - it's all true. It's dark, artsy, creepy, and adds an amazing ambiance that you have to experience.\n\nThis place does not get off and poppin' until about 2 AM. This is after hours. You go to the club then roll over to the Artisan. \n\nThe music is house. DJ Stellar is resident on Fridays and DJ Mike Attack kicks out the beats on Saturday. \n\nThere is definitely a PLUR\/Rave vibe here. Tons of people packed into a small hotel bar. There are never any fights. People come as they are. It's a beautiful thing. There are all walks of life: rave kids, to older folks, to club rats, to artisans. It's truly a nice mosaic.\n\nDrinks run about $12 a pop and bottled water will cost you $6 a go. I usually order a bottle of water and refill it at the lobby.\n\nAs for awesomeness, a basic bottle will run you about $275 (SKYY VODKA) and during your birthday month you can reserve a comped bottle. Just call it in ahead of time. You need at least 6 in your party.\n\nOutside on the patio, there are HOOKAHS available for $25 a pop. Debra, the hookah goddess, has created her own blend called \"Fucking Amazing\" and it is: FUCKING AMAZING. It's fruity awesomeness.\n\nInside the lounge\/bar area there is NO smoking! (YAY!) There is a small restaurant in there and food is available 24\/7.\n\nWhen in doubt in Vegas at 2 AM. Hit up the Arty. No cover. Great people. Cool vibes. And they don't shut down until 8 AM some days! \n\nNo Arty, No Party. Yes, indeed.
