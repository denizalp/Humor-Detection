Whew, I'm totally backed up on reviews but this place just became first on my list! \n\nWhoever reviewed this place and gave 5 stars obviously is friends with the owner or worker because this place is a straight up SHAM! \n\n- Valentine's reservation for 9pm (I know my man planned a late dinner lol) \n- we arrived at 8:55pm and the maitre de said it would be a 5 minute wait (although there was 4 couples ahead?) \n- decided to sit at the bar and grab drinks before would be seated... One drink became 3 drinks... 5 minutes became 15 more minutes and tables are empty yet we're still sitting at the bar?\n- as soon as we noticed it was 10:30pm (still seated at the bar); we were like \"whaaaatttt the hell\" so we ask to speak to the manager- the bartender points at this man and says \"you see that man that's leaving? He's the manager\" WOW \n- so we ordered our food; received the appetizers at a reasonable amount of time but the entrees; 1 hour tops. \n- it's hitting 11:51pm and the manager comes to our table and makes a complete joke of himself and the situation and says \"how are you enjoying the food now that it has finally arrived?\" Seriously dude? \n- he offered us a free drink and dessert... At that point I just wanted to shank myself with a butter knife than to be there for another minute. \n\nFood: lobster bisque and field greens salad \nUS striploin and Bison--- for what we ordered it was not worth what we paid \n\nTotal bill: $200. Comped nothing. If you go; bless your heart because you will have a tragic time.
