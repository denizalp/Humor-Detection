The person who took my order was very nice, but I specifically asked (twice) for a VEGGIE power menu burrito and even stated that I am vegetarian. I got home and took a bite of my burrito, to discover it had chicken in it. On the screen when I placed the order it even said it was the veggie burrito. I haven't eaten meat in over three years and I am horrified that I ate chicken tonight. It was awful and I hope that in the future no one else has to go through what I went through.
