How to describe the Longhorn....It is Vegas's version of the neighborhood dive bar. small, crowded, smoky (but it isn't), but for some reason it's comfortable...The really reason for coming here is the food, seriously, I have been eating here for 20 plus years and have yet to have a bad meal, the ribs are good, the specials can be great, though understand, you're paying $9 for steak and lobster, you will never get prime steak and you will never get a large lobster tail for that price, a reality check is needed by some.\n\nAnyways, the food is good, the drinks are cheap, the gambling is low limit and they do offer live entertainment.\n\nGive it a shot, just walk in thinking that you are about to visit that redneck cousin at his trailer park in Kansas (His name is probably Eddy) and you will leave happy...\n\nThough here the burgers have beef in them, not ketchup.
