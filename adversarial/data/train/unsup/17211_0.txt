So I really like the gelato here. I tried the passion fruit flavor on our past visit last night and it was kind of tart, just like the young lady who was helping us. \n\nSo FYI here's the directions given to us by Miss Mary Sunshine: \n\n1.When you are ready to order your gelato, stand at the register and just tell me cup or cone.\n\n2. Then tell me what size.\n\n3. Pay\n\n4. Then you can tell me what flavor gelato you want.\n\nDon't make the mistake like I did and tell employee the flavors you want before step #3. Otherwise you'll get that \"you're an idiot\" stare.\n\nI was set on having my usual crepe, but the employee was giving off such a 'tude, that I opted to just get a small cup serving and get the heck outta there. \n\nIt was quite comical, but in all seriousness, the vibe in Amorino stunk. From the recent low rated reviews, I wasn't the only one who left there with a sour taste.  My friend and I decided if Miss Mary Sunshine is behind the counter whenever we are there, well pass and get a froyo.\n\nAmendment to above review - -  It was reassuring to see that owner Jerry reach out (See below) and address some issues. We'll see you soon! Thank you.
