Worst service in the city. Our group of four -- two couples, dressed nicely -- was looking for a drink at around 12:30 on Saturday night. The front door was open and there were people seated at the bar and at tables, so we entered. We looked around for a host\/hostess or waiter, and were suddenly accosted by an elderly Asian man -- owner? manager? -- who shouted \"We're closed, we're closed!\" and placed a hand on my back and my friend's back, literally PUSHING us out the front door. \n\nI have never been treated like that anywhere else and neither had she. (BTW, we're both professional, polite women in our twenties, not exactly scene-causing ruffians.) I've worked at nightclubs in T.O. and I know that some people need to be physically shown the door, however you should never, ever touch a stranger -- let alone a customer! -- unless it is well and truly necessary. \n\nWe simply stood there waiting for someone to greet us, and instead of saying something like, \"Oh, sorry, we're just shutting down, please come back another time,\" this rude man put his hands on us and pushed us out the door. To top it off, we heard the bartender thank this older man for kicking us out. Yes, thank you for acting so rudely so that I didn't have to serve these people? Amazing. I will never be back.
