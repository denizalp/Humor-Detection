Often crowded and for good reason. I have had such good food here! My favorite is to get the pork soup dumplings and the eggplant. The soup dumplings are not quite as good as Everyday Noodle around the corner, but they still are very good and the other dishes are just great too. I've had a couple of chicken dishes that I've been very pleased with, and a friend of mine had a tofu dish that was great. The only drawback is that it's so busy that you have to leave as soon as you've finished eating--doesn't feel very hospitable. But if you don't have time to stay and chat anyway, this is a good place to choose.
