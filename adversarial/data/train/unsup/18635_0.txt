Angela was great. She was kind enough to remove the cpl lashes I had left over from the previous lash technician free of charge. I'm happy with the outcome although I would've preferred them a little fuller, with a deeper curl. More dramatic. However, that was mostly my fault. Didn't quite know what to ask for as I only had experience with one other technician who offered styles a bit different. Looking at pictures of others on here now, gives me a better idea of what to ask Angela for, when I go back for my first refill.  I definitely plan on going back. It was a good experience overall. :-)
