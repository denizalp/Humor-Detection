The Tom Kha was decent...met our needs but NOT the best in town.  \n\nThe lady server bent over backwards to be nice but the man was super annoying and talked to us when we didn't want to have a conversation.\n\nI don't like cooked tomatoes in my Tom Kha and the man almost started arguing with me that they are supposed to be in the soup--but that is NOT my preference--so don't try to convince me against me preferences!\n\nWe asked BOTH the man and woman for tea and neither brought it.\n\nWe were the ONLY people in the restaurant.\n\nAlso interesting: at closing time 2:30, a new customer came in saying he had a large party to feed and they were denied because they were closing.   Yet earlier we heard them complaining that the afternoon was slow... COME ON GUYS stay open another 45 minutes and serve this party!!!
