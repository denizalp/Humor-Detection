I enjoyed a very relaxed gastronomic experience at Tremonti. The food is spectacular and they know what to charge for it, more the kind of restaurant I'd expect to find in downtown than at the end of a plaza up north.\nAmbience is touch and go depending on the clientele in a given sitting as the place doesn't have much of its own. Warm wood finishes would suggest a more mature audience but loud groups were abundant at last visit.\nService is timed beautifully and alternates between incredibly pleasant and perfunctory.\nWe both had a fish special, cooked in a delightful tomato broth and well worth going off menu for.\nAs hinted to by another reviewer, the wine list is neither extensive or inexpensive, however refraining from choosing a cellar bottle would keep the cost down measureably and there is definitely adequate selection for most.\nDinner for two with shared appetizer and dessert, wine, tax, and tip came to ~$150.
