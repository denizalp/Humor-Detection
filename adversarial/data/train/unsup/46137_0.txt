even though we made a reservation for 3 people to go to the airport the driver showed up and was surprised to see three because he carries a child's car seat with him. It's a nice thing to do but the luggage filled up the trunk so the car seat had to sit in the back between two of us and banged around and bounced around and it was a very tight and very uncomfortable and I now have a bruise on my arm from it. I have never used Uber because I was not sure who or what was going to show up, but next time I will.
