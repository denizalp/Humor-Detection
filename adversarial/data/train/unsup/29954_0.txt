My boyfriend and I just tried this place for the first time the other day. We were immediately impressed by how welcomed we felt. The customer service was beyond amazing. They really took care of us. They even gave us two rice puddings on the house, which was delicious. The gyros were fairly cheap but really yummy and their akropolis fries were out of this world. The place was clean and had beautiful decor. We will definitely be coming back :)
