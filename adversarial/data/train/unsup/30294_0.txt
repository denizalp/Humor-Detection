So, don't get me wrong. This place is old school, laid out very funny, a little dusty, and is almost always littered with oldies.\n\nHOWEVER, this place is a real gem. It's my number one place to go for healthy and affordable name-brand food close to Oakland. Being a college student, it's very nice being able to use a $20 here and there to its fullest potential. But that's only half of what makes this place great; as a native girl from the Burgh, this GE is about as true to the community of East Liberty as you can get. And no, this isn't the newly gentrified \"East Side\/End\" version of this town. Don't come here expecting a cheap Whole Foods. This is where you see the community in its most familial form. There are still jitneys outside, for goodness' sake, and even they are very kind! You'll see them helping the elderly to their cars, even those who aren't customers. Inside, the kindness doesn't end. They give out free cookie cards to kids, the employees are helpful (but don't try to treat them like subhuman servants; they are real people and they'll let you know it), and I am always greeted when I walk in the door by the nice security guard, who I've never seen without a smile on his face.\n\nNow, I've shopped here for years, and when I introduced this place to a roommate, I realized that store layout memorization is key, because navigating this store won't work on common sense alone. But don't pass up this relic of this old neighborhood. You'll save yourself some cash and see a side of East Liberty that may not exist in a few years time anymore.
