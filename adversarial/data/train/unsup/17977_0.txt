Finally made it to check out the SnoBalls.  This was a late evening visit and although there was no one in line, it took a bit for the SnoBalls to be prepared.  In any case, the SnoBalls were quite tasty; better than a Snow Cone.  The number of flavors is unreal.  You can have just about anything that suits your fancy.  When you get to the bottom of the cone (mango), the combination of the extra flavoring and ice is soft and sweet.  Very good and good for you, I think.  After all, it's just ice, right?!  The cost is less than ice cream and you definitely won't get as many calories!  For that, I say cheers!
