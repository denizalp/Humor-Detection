Safeway is the same thing as Von's which is pretty cool, I can use my rewards just like I was at safeway. I was pretty excited to go, I got there and it's actually a pretty good size store, very clean. Well, the down fall is.. I was grabbing milk and bunch of expired ones were up front or the next day, even one back from May 24th was still there. So I told someone, they need to check those milks. I had to dig all the way into the back to get a good date one for the organic milks. GROSS.... but anyway, always check your dates buying food and milk ;-)
