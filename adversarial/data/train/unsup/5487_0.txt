Called the HOTTEST Club in the Nation by a local (expiration date 2\/20\/06) this place actually hosted Paris Hilton's 25th birthday party the night before we went.\r\nUm, Paris I have not moved and we all know you have my address, so where was the invite?\r\nI digress, apparently Paris and Nicky made quite a mess the night before because the floor was sticky but the beat was moving.\r\nThe DJ was good not great but the crowd was jumping. It was mostly hip hop, old skool, early 80s rock mash ups. \r\nDJ AM spins here on Fridays apparently in a similar style.\r\n\r\nThe dance floor reminded me of Amerika in Beunos Aires, though certainly not the same size but the style, bright lighting so you could see everyone and everyone is smiling. Plus this place knows it is cool but guess what for a night you get to be cool too!  With 4 rooms, you can select your style of cool and your type of music.\r\n\r\nLike any club, Everyone is there, so your hipsters, your guy who got stuffed in his high school locker now acting cool, Rico Suave with his too tight shirt, his out of style too long hair and toothy, lecherous grin at the ladies, your dad straight off the ranch, you grandfather in a neon green sweater with his protruding beer belly, yep they are shaking it large here too.\r\n\r\nWe got in for free and bypassed the line, so I cant speak to that but here's a hint kiddies on getting over the drinks.  Its simple, slightly ghetto but it o so works.  \r\n\r\nBefore you get in line, you go sit at .25 cent slot machine, stick in your dollar and pull away just once, attract the cocktail waitress and order yourself a free drink, maybe two.  When she comes back, this will be at least ten minutes later, you will have racked up a few credits on the machine, tip her what one drink would cost at a normal bar and ask her to go get you another round, finish off your first round while she's gone, maybe put in another dollar, take your second drink, tip her again then walk around enjoy the spectacle, maybe get in line, drop your glass off at the promotions table and you are two drinks in before you walk in the door.   Take that $16 RedBull and Vodka!
