My siblings and I were really looking forward to the promised experience here, but were instead thoroughly disappointed by poor service and lack luster, over-priced drinks. We were told that the Mandalay Bay location is better. I wish we had taken that advice. Please improve your service here Minus5. We WERE looking forward to it...
