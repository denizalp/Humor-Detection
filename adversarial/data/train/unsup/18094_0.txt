About a month ago, I scheduled an appointment to get a tattoo. I'll admit I should have read reviews before, but I had gotten a small tattoo here before and everything had gone well so I made an appointment anyway. About 2 weeks before the appointment I saw all of the Facebook posts and reviews about Chris, and I couldn't believe it. Obviously I didn't want my tattoo done by someone like that so I decided to cancel my appointment. Keep in mind I gave Chris a 2 week notice, it wasn't like I cancelled the night before. I called the shop and after talking to the assistant I was given to Chris. I told him I wanted to cancel my appointment and immediately he said \"okay well I'm not giving you your deposit back, I'm not in the business of money giving, I'm in the business of money taking\". I told him I understood and that was fine because he took the time to discuss and draw out tattoo ideas for me. He then asked why I cancelled and I told him that I found an artist whose portfolio had a lot of examples of what I was looking for and I appreciated his time, but I felt more comfortable getting it done by this person. He then proceeded to tell me that that was \"preposterous\" and that I couldn't just cancel like that. He became increasingly heated and even ended up calling me a \"fucking cunt\" and when I said \"could you repeat what you said for my boyfriend\" he changed it and said \"I said you were acting like a bitch\". Good thing I cancelled. \n\nP.S Chris said \"what are you gonna do? Even if you cancel and write a bad review Im still making money cause nobody reads the reviews before coming to get a tattoo\".. so maybe you should read the reviews guys:\/
