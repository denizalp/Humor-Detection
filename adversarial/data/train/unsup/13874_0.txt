Finally. A Barriques that barreaks the mold of Barriques in Madison. (You get all that?)\n\nIt's clean. (Yay)\nThere's usually parking right outside. (Yay)\nPlenty of space to work solo, or larger tables if you're there for chit chat. (Yay)\nLet's talk about how it's clean again. (Double yay)\nThey offer 50% off an espresso drink when you check in on Yelp (cha-ching)\nBright sunny atmosphere is awesome if you're working and need some vis stim. (Yay)\nIt's clean, there's that. (See where I'm headed?)\n\nSo far out of the ones that I have been to, this Barrriques tops them all. If you're feeling like a tea-se grab their iced Rooibos. Tasty in the mouth, antioxidant charged for your bod.
