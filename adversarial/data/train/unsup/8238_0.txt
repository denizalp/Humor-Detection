We wanted to celebrate Christmas at the famous Fairmont Scottsdale Princess resort and took advantage of their Christmas event dining deal.\n\nParking rates:\nSelf-parking: $55 per personal vehicle\nValet-parking: $85 per personal vehicle\nRide sharing or walking: $20 per person \n\nOR\n\nSpend a minimum of $75 at one of the selected Princess restaurant and receive a maximum of 4 admissions to Christmas at the Princess event.\n\nWe settled for Ironwood American Kitchen because the other restaurants were fully booked and didn't accept anymore walk-ins. Lesson of the day: make a reservation in advance for the Christmas event. \n\nPot roast ($28.00): we ordered pot roast, but the worker called it short rib and the receipt listed the dish as short rib. It was meh. \n\nPrime rib ($36.00): the prime rib edible. Where is my au jus? After few bites I noticed that my au jus was served with the pot roast. \n\nIced coffee Baileys ($13.00): I could barely taste the coffee.  It tasted like Baileys with brown water. \n\nGreat service. Our waitress was funny, helpful,  and friendly. We couldn't stop laughing and she made us feel like regulars.\n\n2 stars!!\n\nIronwood American Kitchen is not yummylicious!!
