I would say food was just ok Definitely better options out there. Tried the sampler chimis, tacos, pollo fundido and flautas. The only one that was good was the pollo fundido and that's prob because it was very cheesy and i love cheese.\n\nSalsa and bean dip they give were good but nothing outstanding.\n\nPrices were normal for a sit down restaurant.
