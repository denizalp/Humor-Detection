I received a quote over the phone, which was confirmed to the exact penny once a tech came by for an estimate.  The termites have not returned in over a month.  The locations where holes were punched are unnoticeable and the cement drills were covered.  I received the full service and it was completed in about 3 hours.  Great prices and great service!
