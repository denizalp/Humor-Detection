learning fast that Vegas isn't just Casino fun time dominated... there are so many good time spots .. when I was taken on a date night to this putt putt I had my doubts only since I love the outdoor ones but then again on a 107 degree day Ill gladly take this spot!! \n\nLooks small from the outside but its pretty dang big.\n\nStaff was young and energetic... crowd was all smiles and there were couples\/families of every age group.  They recommended a laser tag place close by too so that's encouraging for Vegas Youth.  I might be too old for that but sounds fun!!\n\nJust like the pictures show its pretty colorful with detailed art... all black lights .. I'm a rock and bowl gal so this was right up my alley --- PUN intended.  \n\nI was spoiled as a kid and had been to huge outdoor ones so its why I cant go 5 stars.. but a \"yay Im a fan\" is oh so very true!!
