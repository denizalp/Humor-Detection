It's our last day in Vegas and what's left to do?  Tour M&M World?  Sure, why not?  It's another one of those Vegas things to do.\n\nM&M World is 4 floors of everything M&M.  If you're a fan of M&M's, you'll find plenty of M&M goodness - everything from the candies themselves, cups, memorabilia, ice cream, a 3-D movie, and a crazy combo of M&M colors to make your own M&M stash.\n\nWe explored all floors and grabbed a few peanut M&M at the Colorworks station.  You can easily get overwhelmed and feel like the proverbial kid in a candy store.  How do you choose what colors you want?  \n\nWe walked through an M&M maze where there was a short 5 minute 3-D movie at the end titled \"I lost my M in Vegas.\"  It was cute.  This is another Vegas tourist trap but cool if you have the time to kill.
