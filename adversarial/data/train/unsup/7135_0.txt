Korean fried chicken, mouth watering goodness!!!! Let me start by saying im not a big fan of fried anything but my friend told me about the best fried chicken ever an TaaDdaaa!!!\n\nNot really sure what kind of glaze they put on before frying it up but it really was incredible. \n\nI will definitely be back!!!
