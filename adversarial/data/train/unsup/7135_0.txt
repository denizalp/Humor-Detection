I am slightly obsessed with this place. Since its opening there have been many a rectangle boxes in our office. Every time I go I get half and half to attempt to try everything once. My favorite so far is the southern comfort with corn and pork belly bacon (YUM)! The staff is friendly and patient while I take forever to make pizza decisions and the toppings are fun and delicious. It's a great little place in French quarter and I find myself craving this place every couple weeks. Their sauces are creative and tasty, keep up the great work!
