Overall a very good stay at the Hotel Palomar.  Parking is sucky but I guess that is to be expected in a downtown area.  Check in was easy and the staff helpful.  The room was large and comfortable, modern in style.  A very good value for the price.  The hotel has a happy hour with free crappy wine and snack which is nice.  There is also a restaurant inside the hotel and an outdoor pool.  The best thing for me is that the hotel is within walking distance of all sorts of fun things to do like bars, restaurants and the baseball stadium.
