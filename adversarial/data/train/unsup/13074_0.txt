During my recent trip to Phoenix, without a doubt my favorite find was Duck and Decanter. I discovered them while searching for a breakfast option one morning. \n\nI actually had a hard time finding them at first. They're located by the parking garage in the SE corner of a plaza that is on the SE corner of E Camelback Rd and N 16th St. Overwhelming amount of directional abbreviations aside, if you manage to find this gem, you will not be disappointed.\n\nI stopped here twice during my Phoenix visit. I had the breakfast burrito with egg, cheddar chz and black forest bacon for breakfast one morning. It was pretty good. Adding their salsa is really what increased the flavor and brought it up a notch. \n\nOn another day, we stopped in for lunch and had the marinated roasted chicken sandwich on sourdough bread. This was a game changer. The fresh, delicious roasted chicken was so good. It tasted like something your mom would make for you if she really loved you. Yeah, that's right mom, I'm calling you out. This is the sandwich I needed growing up. Not bologna and processed cheese. We can still salvage this relationship. Balls in your court lady. \n\nThe food here was great but they're also a specialty store. They have an assortment of greatness throughout. Barrels of coffee beans, containers of different teas, wine, cheeses, beer, different kinds of oils, all kinds of stuff. \n\nThere's seating all over, including outside, but I chose the upstairs loft both times. It was relaxing and there are giant photos of AZ wildlife all around upstairs too... I like animals... and free WiFi. Yup, they have free Wifi. I love you D&D!!!\n\n*In a hushed voice* -- Psst, Mom, I love you too. I was just trying to be a big man in front of my friends. Your sandwiches are great.
