Metro Diner - Las Vegas, NV (West Trop Location)\n\nThose that know me know that I prefer to eat breakfast dishes all day every day.  It was just a matter of time before I finally got to check this breakfast bookmark off my list.  Metro Diner is a hit with locals and it's not uncommon for there to be a wait. I attempted to dine here about a month ago, there was 3 groups ahead of me, and I didn't want to wait.  I finally had the opportunity to dine here last week on a Friday afternoon.  The parking lot was full and the restaurant was busy.  There was plenty of tables open and I was immediately seated.  Metro Diner's menu is extensive.  They're known for their Charleston Shrimp & Grits, the Fried Chicken & Waffles, and the Bold City Burger.  I know what I want and it was their special...The Meat Lover's Omelet.  This meal consists of 3 large eggs, bacon, ham, and sausage. The meal also comes with toast and grits.  In my opinion, the grits were a little too salty for my liking.  My omelet was good and highly recommend.  I thought that the portions are average and the prices just a tad higher than the other breakfast joints in town.  The highlight of my first experience at Metro Diner is the service.  The entire staff was very attentive and checked up on me multiple times.  Overall, I recommend Metro Diner because they have so many options and the service is top notch.
