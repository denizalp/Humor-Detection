Wandered in here quite by chance on a Friday night. We had been at Rusty Spur most of the evening. Got out to wandering around and found ourselves here, after initially passing it once, we returned. \n\nSuch a small down to earth, charming spot with a few tables and about 8 stools at the bar. It had a crowd of mostly regulars, but being that is was such a small place it wasn't crowded while we were there. They had a small flat screen in the corner playing the Suns game and several people popped in to pick up phone orders and take food to-go. \nSeeing that we decided to supplement our liquid dinner with a shared chicken strip plate. Over all it was good, the chicken tenders and the fries were cooked to order and they served with our choice of both BBQ sauce and ranch. Hit the spot. \n\nService was prompt and very friendly (sorry but I can't recall the man's name who was tending bar...my attention was elsewhere). But I would be sure to go back when he was working.
