I tried a different pizza (The Egg Pizza, with prosciutto and an egg) and was quite pleased.  Sad to discover the CFL lights extend to the main seating area, and they need some music - it wasn't as busy as I'd like to see, and so it got a little quiet, which is a bit of a mood-killer.  That's a great crust though.
