Removing any feelings about Guy Fieri, this review is based on a few things:\n\nFirst, the late night menu is super-limited. We in Vegas, son! 10pm in the second town known as the city that never sleeps should have good options (and definitely include ones for folks that don't eat the meats.)\n\nThe ambiance is that of Red Robin on 'Cowboy Day.' Nothing against Red Robin; I would have preferred to go there instead.\n\nService: the poor servers looked harried. Too busy for the number of people coming in the doors. They were all nice, but rushed when speaking with us, which made me feel rushed.\n\nAfter nursing a few drinks over the course of the evening with my group, my choice was... nachos with queso (sans red meat.) I chuckled inwardly at the overdone presentation: they brought out what looked like a flour sifter with a bottom that opens. They place it on the plate and RELEASE THE KRAKEN! Meaning that the chips and jalapenos dumped onto my plate. \n\nWoooo...\n\nFor all cheese lovers (yeah, I'm talking to you) you know that queso's liquidity needs a chip that can stand up against it's food-soaking quality. \n\nThe instance that they poured the queso over my recently freed nachos, I was swimming in a mushy bland corn soup. \n\nThis place is a no-go for me but maybe their other food is good?
