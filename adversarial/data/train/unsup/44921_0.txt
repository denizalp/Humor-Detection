This is a perfect steak. I have had steak all over and this mesquite grilled perfection was fantastic.  We had to take part of our dinners home because the portions are large.   Every meal comes with choice of salad or soup and a choice of potato, including twice baked and ranch house.  You must try the ranch house potatoes which are hash browns mixed with creamy cheese and mushrooms then baked. Try and leave room for dessert. \n\nThe feel of this restaurant is an old style ranch house.
