It has been years from the last time i had a burger anywhere and was truly impressed.   After reading some dispointing reviews for Red Robin, i was shocked at how perfect everything turned out to be. I ordered the smoke n pepper burger cooked medium and my typical diet soda.  The wait person was fast, attentive, and knowledgeable.  My meal came out quickly to order.  What?  No mistakes to complain about?  Hot, juicy.  Loved the bun. The vegetable toppings perfect.  I even got a second order on the steak fries. I usually hate steak fries as they are never cooked properly.\n   When it costs so much to eat a premium burger out, ($21.39 including tip, no desert), it has to be perfect or I'm not happy.   It in fact was perfect.
