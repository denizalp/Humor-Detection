This area is a cool place for locals and tourists alike.  Every time I come here I see something new.  Cute little shops, galleries, and restaurants.  Something for everyone.  \n\nTo the driver who knew full well we were making a U-turn to get the parking spot and decided to cut in front to snag it...  You're a jerk.  We found a better spot and the driver who left even gave us their paid parking ticket (thank you very much).  Karma.
