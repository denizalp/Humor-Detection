This is my Shell of choice. They give a 10 cent a gallon  discount when you use your shell credit card. They give an additional 10 cent a gallon discount when you use your Fry's fuel points. 20 cents a gallon adds up after a while. I also just used their FREE vacuums and newly renovated car wash. If anyone complained about the car wash malfunctioning before, I suggest checking it out now. Yes I'm a fan and loyal customer. I have always had a good experience here.
