I wouldn't even give this place one star, the guy sprayed to close to my vehicle and now my vehicles clear seal that makes the paint shine is off and a couple weeks before that they broke my windshield wipers. I have contacted them and was told by the manager CARLA that the owner MiKE would not do anything for the damages that his workers caused. When I went in to see Carla and show her the damages she thought that the pressure washer couldn't do it so I had another guy spray closely like the other guy did and she saw the clear coating come right off from spraying my vehicle too close. I would not recommend this car wash at all.
