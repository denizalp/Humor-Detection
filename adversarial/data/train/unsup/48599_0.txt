Upon looking for a beginner combination percussion book, I stopped into this music store as I was in the area. I was helped by an employee (possibly the owner?) and assured that I was grabbing the correct book once I showed him specifically what the teacher was asking for. Turns out, it was the incorrect book, so I called to find out their exchange policy and was informed they'd exchange it, as long as there wasn't any writing in it; there wasn't. I also asked the person on the phone to check if they had the correct book on hand; they said they did. \n\nAs I go into the store, I hold the door for a young girl with her violin. She's helped first by the female employee as I stated I wasn't with her, but the male employee doesn't attempt to help me even though I'm standing directly in front of him. He eventually kind of starts helping the young girl too, who's mom has also come into the store by now - they have questions about the metronome they purchased previously. After several minutes of standing there, the female apologized for taking so long. After a couple more minutes, the male decidedly asks me if he can help me. I explain my situation, that I need to exchange the book. We walk to the books and it turns out they don't have the right book, so we discuss a refund as we walk to the register. As I approach the register, he literally stops and starts fiddling around with the metronome again. I wait. Eventually I ask if we can go ahead and finish this up so I can head to a different music store to get the book I need. \n\nIt was an overall odd experience as a customer. I felt as though I was invisible and then disregarded.
