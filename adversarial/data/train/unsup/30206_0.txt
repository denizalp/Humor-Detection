Four stars because I've only been here once and I've become a bit careful with the doling out of stars.  That said, my husband, mom-in-law and I had lunch here last week and we thought the tacos and the margaritas were spot on!  \nI lived in Phoenix some 20+ years ago and the *good* Mexican restaurants in Phoenix became my benchmark for Mexican food.  Granted, all we ate here (at Cien Agaves) were the tacos, rice and beans but, it's surprising how easy it is to mess up a taco.  I sampled the grilled ono, shredded beef and I think the carne asado taco.  All were good but my favorite was the shredded beef... I had a moment with that one.. (picture the scene in Disney's Ratatouille when the food critic samples Remy's ratatatouille).  I was transported to 1986.\nThe margaritas we had deserve their own paragraph.  They use fresh ingredients and it shows!  One look at the first page of the menu and you know THEY know their tequila.  Find out when happy hour is as we learned you can get some very good deals.
