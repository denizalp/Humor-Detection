My friend had some comp coupons for the buffet, so we went at breakfast time one day. It had your typical buffet fare (a little of everything) and was rather greasy and salty. The waitresses are ancient...as my friend put it, \"I think they dug her up to cover a shift for someone!\" Most buffet-goers were HUGE and had two or three plates piled up in their pudgy arms. (This is a BUFFET folks, they're not running out of food anytime soon! I don't think even the recession can hit this place) I would go here again if I had a comp coupon, but otherwise I'd skip it.
