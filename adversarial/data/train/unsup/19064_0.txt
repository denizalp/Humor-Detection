MPM and Jim's team have managed our investment real estate on behalf of our family for over 10 years. Frankly before that, the management company we were with almost put us in a stature to consider selling. That said, the reason for this review is to once again thank them for coming to the rescue on a personal request to move an item too big for us to handle personally (2nd time they came to our rescue)! What is really heartwarming is that throughout the relationship and the array of requests or needs on behalf of our buildings or residents, I can't recall even one time where Jim or his team said no. Instead, they always find a way to make things happen. Now anyone who owns real estate and understands the unique challenges of doing business in Madison in a rental industry certainly understands the daily challenges of them being caught in the middle of tenant's sometimes crazy requests and not taking responsibility for their actions and property owners who will not let MPM spend necessary $ to properly to work for the residents. So for our family, we do understand those challenges and are grateful for what the MPM staff does for our residents and the buildings we own...hats off to MPM!
