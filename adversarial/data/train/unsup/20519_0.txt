I feel like saying that this bar is a reported favorite of David Lynch should be review enough, but I'll try to gussy it up with usefulness or some such thing.  \n\nThe odd location in a strip mall with an unassuming storefront seems just right for some reason.  As do the numerous tigers, tiger prints, and tiger carpet which lend themselves to the name.  The bartender was friendly, the atmosphere cozy, and the music classic.  Drinks were good and cheap.  A decently sized (and poured) Tanqueray and tonic and a Spotted Cow will set you back $8.  \n\nOther than the free flowing popcorn there's no food, no credit cards, and allegedly no swearing, though I did manage to catch myself saying \"ass\" and I didn't even notice I'd said \"bitchass bitch\" and nobody tossed me out on my can.  That doesn't mean you won't be given the bum's rush for your potty mouth.  I'll try to do better next time.  \n\nNo Log Lady to be found anywhere.
