All in all, this place is an indoor block out of NYC's chinatown. \n\nCome here expecting a VERY complete selection of oriental products, crowds, and interesting (that's optimistic) smells. It's huge, 10 or so aisles and a freezer section that spans the entire back wall. From kim chee to canned curry paste to blocks of tamarind to sticky rice balls, they have at least two brands of everything, so there's plenty to choose from. The produce seems to vary, but the standards are almost always represented: bok choy, bean sprouts, etc. \n\nI will make the trip specifically because of the vegetarian-junk-food frozen stuff they carry. A company called Companion gets very creative with soy and puts out a lot of interesting dim sum\/ faux meat options for the buddhist crowd: \"fish\" balls, taro cakes, vegetarian \"pork\" pot stickers and the like. They stock a wide range of this stuff, and it's the only place I've seen it.
