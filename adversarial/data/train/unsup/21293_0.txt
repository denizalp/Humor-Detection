This bar is a dive. There's nothing fancy about this place. If you want a bar where you can smoke and talk about how the Dems are taking away your guns, this is probably a place for you. Me, I come here bc our awesome 4 wheelers (Jeep) club meets here. Woohoo. We get the back room. Our waitress is always the same one who serves us. She works very hard so I always go and fill my soda. It's pretty obvious she is running around serving everyone's food. It's a beer bar. You don't really come to these places wearing heels and expect it to be Kona Grill where they will judge you up and down, not that I care. I put on my best cow lick, and wretched looking clothes, when I go to those kind of bars. Here, the waitress works hard and does her best to come around and serve everyone. They are a small neighborhood bar and understaffed so I can see where they can lack service. I don't think it's a lack of effort though.\n\nAs for their food, the food is hit and miss. They really need to find a better cook. At least someone who knows about the invention of salt and pepper. We had the battered fried shrimp and French fries. About as tasteless as a white piece of paper. It's obvious it came out of the freezer and thrown on the fryer with no hint of salt or pepper. Robert Irvine would pull out his hair if he had any. The previous meet, I had the fish and chips and it was not too bad. If you ever watch that old tv show on Nickelodeon, Alice, Mel is probably back there making your food (with no salt and pepper in sight).
