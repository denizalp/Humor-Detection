I have never been so humiliated. I went to my daughter's and to my son's apartments to pick them up. We were out having fun. We stopped at Bashas and had a couple of coupons. No extreme stuff. The cashier was so rude. She yelled at my daughter saying only 4 coupons per household. My daughter said we don't live in the same household. The cashier actually called my daughter a liar. Oh my god. I left the store. I called the manager and my daughter went back in to talk with the manager. I will never walk into Bashas again.  Seriously. I'm a charge nurse in an emergency room. I will share this experience with everyone I know and everyone I meet. I will plaster my experience on Facebook and Twitter. Thanks Bashas for ruining our evening out. LOOSER.
