I'm not very girly. I don't love to shop. I get overwhelmed at malls. That being said, out of all the Charlotte area malls, this is the one I prefer. \n\nSouthPark is too fancy (hey, I want to shop in sweatpants). Concord Mills and Carolina Place are both a haul for me (unless I'm in those areas. If I have to go to the mall, Northlake is my go-to spot. \n\nIt's a mall. All the normal chains and usual suspects here. There's finally an H&M. Funny how we went from zero H&Ms to three just like that. There are rocking chairs all over the place. As comedian Josh Wolf would say, it looks like Cracker Barrel designed your mall. \n\nIt's pretty easy to get in and out of this mall. Super convenient off of I-77. However, don't attempt during the evening rush hour. 77 North can be a headache. \n\nThere are also a lot of restaurants (PF Changs, Olive Garden, Etc) and stores surrounding the mall area itself. A giant Super Target is just 5 minutes away.
