Food was brought out fast and was still hot. Inexpensive beer and the sangria looked great, wish I had ordered it. Wife got pasta which they put this really good tofu on, not sure how it was fried and it didn't really go with the meal, but it was tasty. Pad Thai was solid too. Go back for breakfast, they serve it all day.
