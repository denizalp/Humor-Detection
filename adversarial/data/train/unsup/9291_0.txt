If you could give a negative score that's what I would give this place.   They said it was good for storing furniture items.   This place is all outdoor stage with roll up type garage doors that are open on top so all the dust and sand comes right inside each unit.  My garage at my home seals better than these things.  I made a reservation over the phone because I was coming from out of state and this was my first storage I ever used so when I asked if these units were good for storing furniture they said oh yes but the real answer is oh hell no.   Full of dust and dirt who would store furniture in something like that really.  They gladly took my 15 dollar deposit over the phone however when I got into town and went to to see the unit they had for me i was flabbergasted at the condition inside so the first thing i said was\"you said this was good for household furniture\" and said well you have to cover it that's when I said I can't use this for future and I told them it's not going to work.   When I asked for a refund of my deposit they said we don't give refunds.   Nothing was said about that when i made my reservation either. So false representation of the storage isn't enough for a refund apparently plus the fact I never signed anything and they gladly took my money over the phone, so I contacted my credit card company and they will handle it from there.. the little worm that manages this place is rude crude and apparently stealing 15 dollars from someone under false pretenses is more important to him than keeping good customer relations for future potential clientele.  Don't use this place there are plenty of storage places in surprise and surrounding area to choose from that are honest and reasonable.
