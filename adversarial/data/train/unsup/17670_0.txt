They'd have to try to have slower &\/or harder to find service.\nOnce they referred me across town to another HD where they said they \"are ure\" they had the item I needed. 45 minutes and ~$5 less gas I was there and they DID NOT HAVE IT.\nWhat could be worse? Complaining to several HD sites AND HEARING NOTHING BACK.\nGO TO LOWES - BETTER EVERYTHING!
