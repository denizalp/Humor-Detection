Love this dentist. Have gotten a deep cleaning here twice now and the experience both times was very pleasant. From the front desk receptionist working with me on payment options, to the X-ray tech being very nice and sweet, to the dental hygienist who is a lovely woman and does an amazing job. I will definitely be coming back for years to come. Thank you guys for making it so easy to take care of my chompers.
