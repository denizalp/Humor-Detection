I love this park even though it's out of the way. There are lots of things to see like ducks, swans, turtles and fish. They have a cool dinosaur themed playground that my inner child could definitely appreciate! There is also a mini water park for the kids when it gets too hot. I wish there was one for adults because I seriously wanted to slide or run through the water. If I ever come here again I'd love to set up a blanket by the water and have a traditional picnic under a tree.
