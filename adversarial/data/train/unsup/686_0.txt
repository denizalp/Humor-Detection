I came here because of a friend's suggestion. She used to come here about 5 years ago when she lived in Phoenix and for her sake I hope they were a lot better back then because I was very disappointed and I'm definitely doubting her judgement now. \n\nThe food was ok, I'd give it a 3, but the ambiance was awful. I walked in and stopped at the hostess table, but after 5 minutes no one greeted or helped me. Finally another patron came up to me and said they didn't know why that table was there and to sit wherever. I picked a booth which was the least comfortable booth I've ever sat in (you can feel the wooden bars holding the cushion up and there was little padding) and waited 10 minutes until I was approached. There was a game on the tv so it wasn't terrible, but I debated leaving a couple times and I wish that I would have trusted my instincts. \n\nThey claim to have a happy hour until 7pm, but $.50 off of domestics is not happy hour. I ordered a burger which again was about a 3 so not bad at all and a beer, but it took awhile to come out and the waitress never followed up with me. I had asked for a water when I got there and that never came out so I asked for it again when she dropped off my burger. \n\nAs I'm eating, I look up to the tv just in time to see a mother and her daughter being raped. I instantly lost my appetite so when my water came, I asked for my check, downed my beer, and got the hell out of there. And that's the story of the first and last time I ever went to Metro Sportz Bar.
