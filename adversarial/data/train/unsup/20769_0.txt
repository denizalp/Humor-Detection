We were the only customers, which tends to make one a tad nervous, but the service and food did not disappoint.  We got the fried wonton - and it might be my favorite Thai appetizer ever... chicken \/ peas \/ corn \/ carrots in tiny fried wonton triangles with a sweet orange dipping sauce - just wow.  I got my stand-by Thai dish - the Pad See Ew with pork, which was equally tasty.  Simple, fresh ingredients make all the difference, and this is right up there with the best Thai I've ever had.  Never a bad thing when you can get a nice cold glass of Thai iced tea to wash it down.  Well done!!
