I decided to come here because I was carving some Indian food the host Abraham was very helpful and recommended a couple of dishes that went well with Lamb. I got my dinner to-go and Anthony and Abraham made sure to make my wait comfortable even though the food was ready quickly! Will definitely dine in sometime since the atmosphere is very nice and inviting! On a side note: Their Chai Latte is amazing and perfect for the Arizona weather!
