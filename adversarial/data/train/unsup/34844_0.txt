Went here for summerlicious and ordered the calamari, fish and chips and ice cream. Also ordered some kushi oysters. All very good! The oysters were fresh and sweet. The grilled calamari was cooked perfectly and so tender. The fish and chips were also very good, one of the best I've had. The only complaint i had was the food took way too long. We waited 30 mins just for the calamari then 10 more mins for the fish and chips. I will definitely be back although i'd make sure i have extra time to spare.
