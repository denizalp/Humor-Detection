I've eaten here on multiple occasions. I love coming here for brunch as their brunch menu (small though) is always good. Plus they have cheap mimosas\/beermosas. \n\nThey have a good menu and tons of drinks. Even loved the peanut butter and jelly hamburger. \n\nI love too that it's so large with a large balcony. \n\nSometimes the food is hit or miss to be honest (didn't like the pictures brunch toast or their fried chicken sandwich) but it's a fun spot anytime of the day with a great beer selection.
