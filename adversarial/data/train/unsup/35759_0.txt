These people should be in jail. I called about an adverse reaction to a drug they gave me a prescription for. She took the details and said she would get right back with a replacement. 2 1\/2 hours later no call back. I try to call and only get a machine saying we will get back to you. These people should't be allowed anywhere near the medical industry. Maybe cleaning toilets or some other menial job, if someone closely supervises them.
