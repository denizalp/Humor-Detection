Even in the context of airport food, this place is pretty bad and probably best avoided. To be fair, I only experienced breakfast but that was quite enough for me.\n\nI ordered their benedict which promised me \"poached eggs and peameal bacon served on a cheddar biscuit with homemade hollandaise\". Sounds delightful, no?\n\nNo. No, it was not delightful in any way. Let's break it down:\n\nPoached eggs: served completely cooked, as in \"hard boiled yolks\". FAIL\n\nPeameal bacon: code for \"deli ham\". FAIL\n\nCheddar biscuit: Tough and hard. FAIL\n\n\"Homemade\" hollandaise: Oh Lord, this was the worst part. My hard boiled \"poached\" eggs were smothered with a thick, gloppy substance that honestly looked like cake frosting. I scraped that crap off with a quickness because it was certain \"tummyache on a plane\" action. \n\nFor $18, I don't expect every element of a simple benedict to suck. There you have it, folks.
