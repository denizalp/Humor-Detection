Forget going to this place again, I wouldn't even recommend it to anyone. Just to be clear, the service here was good, but that's about the only thing I liked here.\n\nSo we heard about this place opening up, and since I'm Indian, I'm always looking for good Indian restaurants around Charlotte. We decided to go here on a stormy evening for dinner. The decor was nice, which made me think \"oh wow, an upscale Indian restaurant.\" Upscale my foot! The only thing upscale about this place is the decor and prices and it stops at that. Overpriced mediocre food, some less than average, and some misleading.\n\nAlso, it makes me laugh when non-Indians call this place \"authentic.\" Keep reading to find out why.\n\nLooking at the menu, I found palak paneer, marked at $14. Um, what?? It should NOT cost over $9 unless it has gold flakes mixed in or something. Pieces of paneer (firm cottage cheese) cooked in spinach puree - why does this have to cost $14? I can cook it for 10 people for a lower price than that! Fail #1\n\nNext, I asked the server what kind of noodles they used for the hakka noodles. He said \"thick noodles like spaghetti.\" No, no, no, no... I have grown up in India and Indo-Chinese cuisine is my favorite in the world. Using spaghetti for that is a disgusting insult. Hakka noodles are supposed to be thin noodles, made with Angel Hair or something like it. Fail #2\n\nThe dessert section had totally non-Indian things like Tiramisu and Apple crumble. Get your shit right, you are running an Indian restaurant. I expect to see desserts like gulabjamun, rasgulla, gajar halwa and kulfi, maybe some Indian flavors of ice cream. I don't go to an Indian restaurant to eat cheesecakes and creme brulees. Fail #3\n\nWe went over the menu again and decided to order chilli shrimp for appetizers since the description on their menu looked authentic. From their menu: \"Shrimp flavored with soy sauce, vinegar, ginger-garlic paste, sauteed with jalapenos, green peppers and chilli sauce.\" This is what arrived to our table: Shrimp in really hot RED sauce, no jalapenos, no soy sauce, and, wait for it... CURRY LEAVES! Did I mention HOT? I'm Indian and this was hot even for my taste buds! Let me tell you something, dear friends at Curry N Kabab House... I make this thing at home, and even a spoonful of soy sauce gives this a lovely dark brown color. It's not supposed to be red, and should not have curry leaves. In fact nothing in Indo-Chinese food should have curry leaves so get rid of that! Fail#4\n\nThen came the Tandoori chicken. The chicken was not well marinated and I kept thanking my stars for the mint chutney that came with it, because without it the chicken wouldn't have been palatable. Also, the essence of Tandoori chicken is in the drumsticks. A single Google image search for \"tandoori chicken\" will show you pieces of chicken drumsticks, marinated with ginger-garlic paste and red chilli powder and grilled. Our tandoori chicken came out sizzling hot, without a single drumstick, and yes, without any flavor. Also, bright orange food color? So tacky... Get rid of it, it's 2013! Fail#5\n\nLastly (thank God) the lamb biryani. It had so much masala, I was sure this would be good. Wrong. It completely lacked flavor. It amazes me how someone can fuck up biryani but still make it look good. In fact, it amazes me how a restaurant can call itself \"upscale,\" have everything overpriced, and still manage to not make a single thing on the menu right. And to think we spent $40 here for two. Shame on you Currey N Kabab House, Your restaurant sucked just as much as your other one, Curries and Cakes. You are the biggest Indian food failure in all of Charlotte.
