Been here a few times.  Typical Chioptle, nothing special about this location or their food.  The staff are always upbeat, friendly and polite, and the restaurant in general is clean and airy.\n\nThe is tons of seating both indoor and out, and easy access from main roads.  Plenty of parking up front.
