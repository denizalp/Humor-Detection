Great atmosphere, awesome pizza, very questionable spaghetti. \n\nFirst off, our server was faaaantastic. She checked up on us often and cracked many jokes even when my lactose friend was giving her a hard time. Also, the location is pretty nice. Attached to the south side of Northlake mall, it has access to a large parking lot with its own entrance from the outside.\n\nOverall, the ambiance and food was very good. Their beer selection was widespread and priced very nicely. Having been in NYC just one week earlier (artichoke pizza omg..), I must say that their \"I love meat\" pizza ($20.99) did not disappoint. It is huge! and was very delicious. Well balanced between the bread, cheese, and meats, and a proper representation of the NY slice. \n\nWe also got their \"Big Tuna Starter\" which was very good ($12.99). The arugula was a nice touch as well. \n\nHaving said that, what in the world is wrong with their Spaghetti. I have never seen a more basic spaghetti and salad. It looked straight out of my high school cafeteria. \n\nTaste: 4\/5 (if you omit the spaghetti)\nAtmosphere: 4.5\/5\nValue: 4\/5
