Love this place! The burgers are great! People are so pleasant and they were playing reggae music to tie it all together. The burgers were juicy and cooked just enough that the edges was crispy. Love the burger sauce that they put on your burger. The combos are come with fries and can pop! Poutine is perfect with the amount of cheese and gravy. A definite must try! FYI they accept the PLATINUM PLUS card.
