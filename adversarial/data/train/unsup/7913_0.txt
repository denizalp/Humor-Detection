When four people head out for dinner, it's inevitable that three of them may have a four star experience and one of them comes out feeling like their visit was a three star. I'm the \"one of them\" in this story, or rather in this short anecdote.\n\nA reso was made for 3 people during Yelp Eats for 730pm. All was well there! We arrived to a table already set and waiting for us. We added an extra person last minute and the staff had another place setting added to the table. Service level remained at a 4 star the rest of the evening. We were seated at a table on the east side of the restaurant, near the front and with a nice view out onto the patio. \n\nHere's where the 3 stars come in. To start I ordered the wedge iceberg salad. A wedge salad? It sounded intriguing. And it certainly looked intriguing! But once I dug in, it was literally a wedge of iceberg lettuce served with dressing and some garnish on the side. Order the lobster gnocchi or the scallops instead.\n\nIn between our starters and our entrees, there was a long wait. And by long I mean 30-40 minutes, probably closer to 40. Brava wasn't overly busy. Not sure what happened there, but it was too long and we had to ask about our food. Minutes later, my prawn penne appeared in front of me. Hooray for food! But not hooray for the prawn penne. The sauce was good, but the noodles were overcooked, it was almost like I had made them at home. It's true, I over boil my noodles all the time, it's usually why I order pasta in fancier restaurants instead. \n\nAt any rate, Brava's still a go-to, I just know what I won't be ordering next time.
