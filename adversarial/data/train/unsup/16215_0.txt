My bf and I had just arrived in LV, starving and ready to chow down with our Buffet of Buffet passes bought and ready to be used. What better place to engage in gluttonous eating than a buffet? We arrived at the Spice Market right 10:55pm (they close at 11pm and for some reason we read that they close at 3am on Yelp. Glad to know someone fixed the times!) and they were nice enough to immediately seat us right in front of the desserts so we had quick access. They let us know that food will be put away by 11:30 and that we'd have to leave by 11:45. They gave us a list of drinks to choose from and we just checkmarked a whole bunch that sounded good so we could hurry along and fill up our plates. They separated the buffet areas by genres - Italian, Mexican, Mediterranean, Seafood, Asian, Dessert, Middle Eastern, etc. My favorite of everything that I tried was the crab stuffed sole. The crab is so flavorful and the sole was soft and delicate. Whether you're a dessert person or not, try the creme brulee. You will love it. And I love the fact that they had pink cotton candy. How fun and cute! \n\nOur waitress, Remi (?), was an angel the entire time. She knew we were in a rush and was quick to bring out our drinks and give us recommendations on the best dishes. She felt bad when she had to kick us out at 11:45 and repeatedly apologized but we knew she was just following the rules. We came back the next day for round #2 but sadly didn't see her. Nonetheless, the food was one of the better ones we had from the Buffet of Buffets list and the service was exquisite.
