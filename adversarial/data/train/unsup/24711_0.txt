The Tartine Bistro is a small but classy restaurant and wine bar located in Rocky River, Ohio.  This bistro-style restaurant is the perfect place to stop and enjoy a wonderful meal in-between shopping at some of the nearby stores or have a romantic evening with someone special.  Indoor and outdoor seating options are equally impressive, but I opted for one of the small outdoor tables since it was a cool but pleasant evening.  The beautifully-strung outdoor lighting added to the ambiance of this cafe-style seating option.  \n\nAfter being seated, I was immediately greeted by my waiter, Lorenzo.  He was friendly and professional throughout my visit, and continuously monitored my dining needs to ensure my satisfaction.  I asked a few questions about their selections and his advice on their menu was informative.  \n \nI started my meal with their house red wine, which originated from Rhone Valley, France.   For my entree, I selected the salmon, which included roasted root vegetables and a rapini lemon and fennel purée.   My entree was prepared and delivered with perfection.  Their red wine along with my meal was a wonderful experience for my tastebuds, and the cool evening breeze in their outdoor seating area was rather pleasant.  The high level of ambiance of their outdoor seating just added to the enjoyment of this experience. \n \nBravo to the owner and staff at this restaurant for a wonderful experience.  They have earned the rare and coveted five stars!
