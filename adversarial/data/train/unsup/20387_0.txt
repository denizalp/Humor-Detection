Since we booked a one-bedroom in the Cosmopolitan, it came with a two person buffet breakfast for free!!!  Read up on priceline, people!  Get this deal, because this is one of the best buffets in Vegas!\n\nHoly moly you will not be disappointed.  Comfortable chairs, large tables, good service, modern d√©cor.  What more could I ask for?  First off, no wait for water here.  They leave a bottle at your table.  The buffet is well spaced, so no standing in line or waiting.  You can easily jump from station to station without fear of evil eyes from people who think you're \"cutting\" in line.  \n\nI hadn't noticed, but someone wrote that there were different stations for different types of food, separated by nationality.  I had braised short-ribs, orange pancakes, gnocchi, Greek yogurt with oatmeal, strawberry smoothie, smoked salmon, and many other delicious breakfast treats.  Have no fear, sweet teeth, there is also a huge dessert station even during breakfast.  Lots of pastries laden with chocolate and glaze, chocolate and raspberry rice crispy treats, and many small cakes and tarts.\n\nThis is by far my favorite buffet in Vegas, and will soon be visited again during my girls' trip in September.
