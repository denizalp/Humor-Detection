I came here with my BFF the first time, and it was overall a good experience. I customized my own salad, and the watermelonade that I got was good. My friend and I enjoyed our eats and then came back for the extravagant looking acai bowl. The acai bowl looks like it's going to be the most incredible thing, but is really eye candy, because when you try it, you're like this is alright, but can't help but be a little disappointed because it looks like it's going to be this wonderful explosion of flavour in your mouth. \n\nI came back the next day for the Beet juice, because i tried my friends and really liked it. Later on I came back for the Brazil something smoothie, which for $10, was really lacking. I make way better smoothies at home. On top of that, the girl who made my drink was wearing shorts that exposed her butt cheeks quite substantially, and I couldn't believe she came into work like that and management didn't do anything about it. It honestly turned me away from the place, because no respectful place would allow their workers to dress like that, unless you're in a different industry. So, because I make the same juice myself at home, and my smoothies taste way better, and I don't want to be exposed to random ass cheeks, I will not be back. Bolt management, I hope you're reading this.
