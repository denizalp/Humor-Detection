It's like a country bar that plays nothing but old school metal. And while I'm about 20 years too young to appreciate \"Judas Priest\" (whoever that is), it sets the mood for the no-nonsense approach to drinking that Shotgun Betty's inspires. \n\nJager, Patron, Jack Daniels, all while having a great time out on the patio. Shots were reasonably priced...well, depending on who was serving me. Why did it change every five minutes? Either way, the loud, rowdy environment was fun for about an hour.\n\nUntil you realize it's a crowd of thirtysomething guys in business casual clothing gawking at some college freshman attempting to pole dance. I won't put too much weight on the square clientele, but I feel obligated to return with lots of women just to balance things out. \n\nStaff doesn't waste time being pretentious, and they totally support Movember with a \"Gentleman's Night\" for guys who wanna rock the stash. Will I be back? Probably. But it's not at the top of my list.
