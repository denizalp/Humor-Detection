First time at Gen Korean BBQ ever and it is wonderful. All the servers are kind and fast. They check up every so often to make sure everything is going well and if we need any more orders. Yuhao our server seemed to appear whenever we needed anything. \n\nThe place is well lit and great for groups. They have a great selection of meats and appetizers for their all you can eat. Would definitely recommend eating here
