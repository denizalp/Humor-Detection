The 1st time i've ever gone to this shop, I went to patch up a flat tire.  Worked great because I totally forgot about it a year later when I was about to get a new set of tires installed.  The lady at the front counter was very nice.  Although, every time I called to get quotes, I would get a totally different quote when I walked in.  BUT.... they seem to work it out w\/ you.  The lady did it for me anyway.  I was told a quote over the phone of about $80 to mount & balance tires.  And when I got there, the lady told me it was gonna be about $115 or so.  I told her that's not what I was told & she absolutely worked it out for me to get the quote I was told over the ph.  She was really nice about it.  Clean shop.  The mechanics working on my car was really nice too. I haven't had service done on my car here before, just tire service. But by the other customers coming in & out of the shop while I waited, seemed to like them very much.  A lot of regulars it seemed like.  I'd say it's a pretty good place to go! =)
