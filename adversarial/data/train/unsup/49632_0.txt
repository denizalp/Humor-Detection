If you are looking for not just a foot massage but maybe a full body massage, I recommend you give this place a shot. \nNot unlike a number of places in town, the place is owned and operated, in my best estimation, by Chinese. But very unlike most other places of this ilk, it is super clean and the massage is high quality. \nI have been there a couple of times and have been more than satisfied. \nThe only drawback is a language barrier. So every now and then communicating with the masseuse can be a challenge. \nBut that is a small price to pay for a great massage at very affordable rates.
