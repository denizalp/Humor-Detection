Just attempted to have lunch. I asked for the chick parm and the pasta with light on the Marinara it came out heavey sauce when I brought it to the goofy waitress she laughed at me. When she came back with the second order I asked her why she laughed and she denied it. I had one bite in my mouth and a big goon manager came over to defend the girl and argue with me. I stuck the knife in the chicken and bolted with the goon manager following me out the rotten door. People who like this amateur place are Olive Garden fans.  Welcome to the Valley of the Dummies!!
