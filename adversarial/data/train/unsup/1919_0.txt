Great place for drinks, but I wouldn't eat here again.\n\nPATIO: 5 Stars\nSERVICE: 4 Stars\nFOOD: 1 Star\nPRICE: 2 Stars\n\nI almost gave this joint 3 stars until I remembered that they charged me for lettuce and tomato on my burger.  Dude, that is a GARNISH. Nobody in their right mind actually puts a vegetable on their burger.  It's supposed to be there to fool you into thinking that you're eating healthy. Seriously, is this really going to make an impact on your bottom line? GRRR.\n\nI went here with the Yelp crew and we initially took a table in the back patio.  The sun wasn't quite out of the way yet so we were a bit hot.  Soon afterward, it started to look like rain so we asked for an inside table and they graciously agreed.  The service was friendly, fairly fast and professional all evening.\n\nI'd heard \"Best Burger in the City\" several times, so I had to give it a shot. \n\nOne of my secrets to a happy life is to always keep your expectations low.  So with all the great reviews on here and the CM of Yelp telling me how amazing the burger was, my expectation levels were off the charts.\n\nOrdered Medium, it came out well.  Very well.  Thick, well, and dry.  Someone else at our table ordered their burger well and it came out bloody!  Initially we thought they may have confused our orders, however she hadn't ordered cheese or the expensive garnishes.\n\nThis is an ordinary pub food burger and nothing more. \n\nOverall the location, service and patio were above average.  I didn't hear anyone discussing their food however.  I'd highly recommend it for drinks though.
