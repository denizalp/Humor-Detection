Thank you Lord!!! Having lived in Oklahoma\nCity and Washington state, where authentic taco trucks abound, then coming back to Cleveland to find little, to no food trucks, was a sad reality! \n\nThese are REAL tacos! If you've never had an authentic taco, do yourself a favor and head over to La Plaza and order some! We will definitely be back A LOT!
