Good urban baby shop. A lot of environmentally friendly product, but the overall select is limited.   When my friends and family tried to order stuff on line for our baby shower, several items were out of stock, which made it a bit annoying for them.  All and all, however, the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and I enjoy my shopping experience when I go.
