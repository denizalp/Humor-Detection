This place is down the street from our house but I've only eaten there once before. I enjoyed it my first time but haven't gone back because my fiance is not a fan of Indian food. With him gone Saturday night and a few glasses of wine in me, I decided to order takeout with UberEats. \n\nMy order: samosas, chicken tikka, garlic naan, rice. My total: $38.83 ($2.99 delivery included). \n\nThe samosas were my favorite part of my order. When I ordered them, I was afraid they might get soggy on the ride to my house but they were still crisp and so flavorful. If you can't handle a lot of spices, I would advise to to not get these. If you enjoy a lot of flavor, these are a great appetizer for you. \n\nThe garlic naan didn't really taste much like garlic. The garlic is visible but the taste was bland. It was just okay. \n\nI was not impressed with the chicken tikka and it is probably because I don't like anything burnt. There were parts of the chicken that were pretty dark and overcooked so I threw out some of it. The dish was a safe one for me and I was not a fan. Where was the flavor?\n\nMaybe it's because I'm Asian but I enjoy eating flavorful dishes with rice. I noticed that my entree wouldn't come with rice but I really didn't want to whip any up myself. The cost for a side of rice: $4. I would say that is a little much - especially for the portion. I guess I was paying for the convenience.\n\nI was a bit disappointed but was able to enjoy some of it. I felt like it was a bit overpriced as well.
