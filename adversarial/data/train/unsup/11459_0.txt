$4 for the bus, which doesnt come on time. I'm talking about the 88 bathurst bus. if paying with presto card, you get no transfer so you cant connect to a ttc bus within york region. you also cant use the dial a ride service if you tap your presto card.\nI have to pay $4 for a ticket valid for 2hours yet the bus driver can stop the bus for a restroom break while on my time??? She easily took off 10 minutes from my 2hours so she could use the restroom which I'm assuming. She stopped the bus at bathurst just south of hwy 7 by a shoppers drug mart and disappeared. I hate York region.
