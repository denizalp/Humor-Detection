If you're a big fan of frosting, good cause that's the only good thing on the cupcakes here. \nOk ok, I'll give them a break since I did come here around closing time, so I really can't expect any fresh tasting cupcakes. I had the birthday surprise cupcake, which besides the slight dryness it had, there wasn't really any flavoring to it. Just vanilla and buttercreme. Most \"birthday\" labeled cakes\/cupcakes have a punch of bitterweetness to them that really give them the taste that says \"birthday\" flavor rather than just \"vanilla\". I also had a bite of the wedding cake flavor cupcake as well, it tasted exactly the same. Um. Ok.\nCould probably get better flavor variety at Wal Mart.\n\nAnyway, I ate all the frosting off and threw the cake in the trash. I might try this place another time, perhaps in the morning, when they have their more distiguished flavors available. Bad last minute call on my part.
