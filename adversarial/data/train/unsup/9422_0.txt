I found this place on the way back to my hotel from a visit to Carefree.  I came looking for a pencil cholla cactus.  When we first pulled up, it was hard to find someone to help me and my mom.  We wandered around for a bit, looking at overpriced cacti that were in mediocre condition.  We finally found someone to ask for help, and he showed us to the pencil cholla.  Unfortunately, they weren't in good condition, shriveled up.  After that, we decided to finish browsing the nursery and leave, but were constantly followed by the man who helped us.  He would just stand there and watch us observe the various cacti they had.  It became really uncomfortable, so we left.\n\nSeriously, I would have given this place more stars for mediocre quality plants, but the guy following us around was simply unacceptable.  I've never been followed around at a store before, but now I know how uncomfortable that feeling is.
