Stopped in for breakfast before the 4th of July parade. This was my first time here and I was pleased to see smiles on the staff and a packed house (always a good sign!). I can't recall the name of what I ordered, but it had French toast, 2 eggs, and bacon. The eggs were cooked exactly like I ordered them and the bacon was nice and crispy. The French toast is made with Texas bread so it was really good! I ordered a side of wheat toast and it came out nice and hot. The coffee was really good and our waitress was on top of keeping our mugs full. Everything was really good and we will definitely be going back!
