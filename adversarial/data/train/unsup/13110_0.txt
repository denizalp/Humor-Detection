This place is so close to my work and amazing! Not a bad price either. \n\nI always get the lamb gyro wrap. I love it the lamb is so tender! I love the seasoned herb fries as well. They have a unique taste I swear I could eat them all day everyday. \n\nThe couple that owns this are so sweet and act like we are in their home. It doesn't feel like a restaurant, more like a friends house. :)\n\nCheck out this cafe it's worth going to
