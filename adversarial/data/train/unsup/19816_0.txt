Very, very, very cool ambiance. Right on busy ass Lorain by Fulton, cool artwork all over the place, hip workers, and not a Starbucks or Target in sight. I had the hoagie( chili on a bun, no dog). Flavorful, great texture( not just mush like most chili), and only five bucks to fill my gas tank. Parking is iffy around late afternoon( try to make sense of Cleveland parking laws, I dare you). Menu is simple. Nothing fancy, nothing trendy. Just chili and about a half dozen ways to eat it. Choosing between here and Skyline in that horrible Lyndhurst strip mall? No brainer.
