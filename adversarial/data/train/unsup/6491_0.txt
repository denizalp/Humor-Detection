Third times a charm! What an amazing dinner my husband and I had at Bazaar Meat for our 10 year anniversary. We enjoyed some classics like the cotton candy foie gras and grissini with parmesan dip as well as some new dishes. The tomato tartare blew our minds and we wouldn't necessarily order a just a vegetable dish but the awesome knowledgeable manager Pano recommended it and boy let me tell you it was amazing. So bright and full of flavors definitely a new favorite. The table side presentation of the drinks and melt in your mouth A5 Kobe beef were such a treat. Desserts were sweet and just right. The menu is delicious and unique, the decor intriguing and the service is friendly and welcoming. I definitely recommend Bazaar Meat.
