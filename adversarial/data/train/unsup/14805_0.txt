Well three things: As a kid, I grew very close to a cemetery and never thought much about it. In fact the very first time I went to it was to cycle, which I know is a bit odd since well, all the dead people and all. However the amount of people that goes on a jog\/walk in cemeteries is way larger than you think! \n\nSecond, as a photographer, they make for great locations, plenty of green space, lots of creative variety within to use as a backgrounds and lastly they are a great place to think about a city's history. Some of the most famous and sometimes strange stories can be found here. Including the odd and the creepy. \n\nThere are some mayor and people of interested buried here, like Toronto first mayor, William Lyon Mackenzie and a number of interesting businessmen, like Thornton Blackburn, a black slave who established Toronto's first cab service. \n\nOr for example... Did you know one of the tombstones ACTUALLY has a web address? (!) A girl who kept a blog -- I was curious and slightly creeped-out enough to check it on my phone. So even though she is no longer with us, she still has an online presence and... still getting hits.     \n\nAlso fun fact: There used to be a cemetery at %$@##$%# Yonge and Bloor during the 1800's and as the owners of the land realized the future importance of the intersection they dug everyone up and moved them here. Most of those graves are on the east side, most of them only marked by numbers now. It reminds you about the levity of life and makes you wonder if they left anything behind... Or if they are allowed to get a tombstone that reads \"I was buried at Yonge and Bloor in the 1800's then got my remains dug up and moved here and all I got was this lousy number!\"  \n\nNow, Toronto's Necropolis might not be the most grand nor architecturally the best cemetery in the world but it is part of our city history and one day if you feel like going through a stroll, I would recommend for you to swing by, check it out.
