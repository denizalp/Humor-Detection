I stopped here yesterday after arriving after traveling all day from the East Coast. Needless to say after airplane snacks I was starving. \n\nMy wife and I have a tradition of going to at least one Diners Drive ins and Dives location in every new city we travel to.  \n\nWe ordered an Il Purista sandwich on whole wheat roll to take back to the hotel.  While waiting for the sandwich to be done we perused the groceries and wines they have in the store. They have everything imaginable for a great Italian meal from antipasto to dessert. We ended up buying some fig cookies to nosh on as well. \n\nWhen arriving at the hotel we dug in. The sandwich was prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, tomato, roasted peppers, extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The wheat roll was soft and worked well with the sandwich. Total cost for the sandwich, two drinks and cookies was about $25. \n\nThe best compliment I can give this place is that it reminds me of Italians Delis back in Hoboken.:)\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming to Scottsdale.
