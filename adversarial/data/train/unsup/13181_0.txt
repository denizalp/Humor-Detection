Service impeccable.  Tasting $169\/person comped, not so great & wish I'd used it at our other true favs.  Let me do a quick run down:\n\nOsteria Caviar on a Meyer Lemon Geylee & Creme Fraiche on sea salt decor... EXCELLENT!  \n\nFoie Gras & Strawberry Granola... waste of Foie Gras, tasteless, except for the granola.  Absolute disappointment.  \n\nWarm Asparagus w\/ Chanterelle Vinaigrette.. more like lemon squeezed on top w\/ mushrooms.  Nothing beautiful like the fancy word & wow, a simple asparagus I make better at home as a part of the tasting... \n\nCaramelized Scallops were part of what I thought would be a pick-me-up in the tasting.  Never again.  Sandy & horrid.  I have never had such horribly dirty & undercooked Scallops ever.  I hate eating Scallops w\/ grit.\n\nWagyu Filet ... mine was cooked to perfection & melted in my mouth!  I gave my boyfriend the majority of mine cause his was overcooked, but we didn't wanna waste it so he ate it.  Strange if it was the same Chef how both came out so different when ordered at the chefs preference.  \n\nTo top it off, the dessert with the tasting was a Salted Caramel Sundae w\/ Caramel popcorn & candied pecans, which was delicious & a wonderful palate cleanser from the previous disappointments.\n\nOverall, this is the third time I've been here on a $400 comp & am sadly done trying again.  I am an honest yelpers so give chances.  Maybe a bad night gets old with all of the amazing restaurants at our finger tips here.  I thought trying a tasting would be a chance for me to broaden my horizons from only ordering steak since I am from the Midwest where the steak is raised next door.  I was wrong.
