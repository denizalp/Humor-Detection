DONT RECCOMEND, got a car wash Monday rained literally all the next day and went back the next after after it rained to get a rain check. Gave the guy my receipt to show him and he says it has to be in 24 hours not 48 and I told him last time the other lady let me because that makes sense right ? Or was in the wrong ? He told me $10 and I told him no I'm okay that it was stupid ( that I had to pay $10 ) and I walked away to tell the workers that I wasn't going to get the wash and  the old man followed me and started yelling \"I'm not stupid you're stupid\" and I was so confused I even told him I didn't call him stupid I said that this is stupid and he was just rambling on and I kept telling him I didn't call him stupid and he was just like yelling at me ! And I told him how dare you talk to a customer like that and he said that he's like my grandfather ? Like what?? I told him to shut up at that point bcuz he was yelling at me ! I'm 19 I'm a mature teenager girl. I work at qt and I have never talk to a customer like that! Made me very upset and cry how he talked to me and it's not like he cared! Lost customers how he treated me, don't go here
