It's been a long time since I last visited Osaka. Boy, what a difference. It used to be a traditional Japanese restaurant, but now, it's turned into a fusiony bistro. I should've read the reviews on here before going.\n\nThe restaurant is now separated into tatami rooms, teppanyaki, sushi bar etc -- we got the tatami room.... which was fine. We got a sushi platter, zaru soba, selections from their robatayaki menu and agedashi tofu. The zaru soba was actually really good. Robatayaki items weren't bad either -- skimpy portions though. The sushi however, blows! I was so damn disappointed in the poor quality we were given. They used to be fantastic.\n\nAfter this visit, I really won't be returning again. I like my sushi traditional. I'm kinda a stickler about that. The agedashi tofu was quite dismal too, not true authentic agedashi tofu at all. It was so dismal that the young man refused to eat it and he was the one who ordered it.\n\nThe service was attentive though hence the extra star. They have a late night menu with discounted prices after 10pm.
