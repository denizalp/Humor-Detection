We love it here! We bring our pup Wayne multiple times per month, usually for brunch on weekends or for happy hour. We love their menu, the awesome beer selection, and obviously the fact that we can bring Wayne. The staff are always so nice and give Wayne so much love. It's a great place to catch a game, and the manager on the patio Tony is next-level with customer service. We always feel welcomed and have never had a negative experience or bad meal here, through 15+ visits. Thanks guys!
