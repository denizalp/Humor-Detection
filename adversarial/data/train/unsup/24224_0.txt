Give the best 5 stars,  when someone earns it .\nAli Baba is a great place to dine and enjoy the true flavor of Arabia.  Food tasted amazing no matter what you order.  I got the Largest Mazza Combo,  Falafel,  Kuba, Tabuleh, Hummus, Baba Ghanug, pastirma, Labni,Foul,Grape leaves, Armenian Sausages and Arabic Bread. \nWe couldn't finish the food although it's the best we tasted so far . I wish we have a branch in Fresno.  Ali Baba also had Hookahs and live music on weekends,  too bad we missed it . But we will be back for sure,  very soon. Thanks to Waseem our evening was magnificent dining experience.
