I guess my last view was deleted, but anyways look at your contract CAREFULLY especially if you sign with them under a special. They pinch every nickel and dime out of you. Their staff is very rude once you leave if you encounter problems and so far from the people I have talked to that move out, it happens a lot. The place was nice, but the staff I could do without.
