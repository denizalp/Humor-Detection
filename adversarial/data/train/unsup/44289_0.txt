This place has a cute, cozy ambiance and good food. Husband and I started with the warm brie, which was nicely complimented with plenty and fruits and breads. Unlike a lot of places that serve similar dishes, there was actually enough stuff to use up the cheese. I had the roast chicken, a simple dish that is hard to execute well and husband enjoyed his steak. My chicken was very fresh and well complimented by the sides. We also enjoyed the well selected wine list. Definitely plan to return.
