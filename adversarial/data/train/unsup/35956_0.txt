Ok so this place has 300 reviews and 2.5 stars.... my first experience was the day of Sept 2017 Urban Ale Trail and my friend got me a Lemon Jello Shot. I asked the bartender to trade the yellow JellO shot for a red one and bartender said no. Like a quick NO. I was in shock. Like why!? \nOk there you go. Short, older woman bartender is rude and SHE is the reason you deserve 1 star!
