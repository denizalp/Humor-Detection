Finally I don't have to go to Etobicoke just for really great pizza!!! Come here all the time now. Great for classic slices or for full pies. Their signature White Pizza is incredible! I was never one for tomato sauceless pizzas but this one is amazing, and so is their Big Marc! Think a Big Mac on a pizza... I know it sounds bizarre but it's seriously delicious and more satisfying than going to MCDonalds that's for sure. These guys have me hooked! The salami on their hoagies is seriously the best deli meat I've ever eaten! Really hope they put buffalo wings and a buffalo chicken hoagie on the menu! Really can't say enough good things about these guys and their amazing service and food. So lucky to have this place in the Clarkson \/ Port credit area!
