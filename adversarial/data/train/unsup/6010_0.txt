Delicious. Why does this place have to be so far from me?! I ordered the Roger That on sourdough. It was everything I want in a sandwich. Turkey tasted fresh, the sourdough bread was perfect. I highly recommend checking this place out. I ordered extra bomb sauce on the side but the sandwich was so delicious I didn't even use it. I don't know how often I'll get to eat here because it's so far from me... But a definite treat when I'm on that side of town. Seriously so good!
