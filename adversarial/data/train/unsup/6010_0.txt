Seriously, people, five stars for Panera Bread?  Y'all don't get out enough.\n\nSo far as I can tell, Panera is a pseudo-trendy food stand aimed at the same suburban yuppies that shop for music from Starbucks and proudly drive Ford Escape Hybrids.  The pastries are decent at best but incredibly overpriced.  You can get donuts and cookies that are just as good for less than half the price at the Giant Eagle across the street.   And how about the food?  Decent soup, shitty little sandwiches, and again (as if it's a dominant theme), incredibly overpriced.\n\nI guess that mark-up is for the \"hip\"-ness factor?\n\nPanera always reminds me of eating lunch in elementary school, back when those Lunchable things were fashionable.  I begged and begged my mom to buy me those things for my lunch because they were cool, but once I actually ate it, I felt cheated and unfulfilled.  Glad I learned that lesson way back them... otherwise, I might actually be a Panera devotee today to get some coolness by osmosis.  Sure as hell wouldn't be for the food.
