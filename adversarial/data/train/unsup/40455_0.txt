This place is soooo classy.  Take someone here that you really want to impress.  The food was very good.  I had the prime steak, the crab cake and the Caesar Salad.  The salad was probably the only thing that was just OK.  Dessert cart is unlike anything you've seen.  Everything looked amazing and we had the bananas foster which was delicious.  It's the service here though that you really want to go for.  You'll feel like you're on Downton Abby at a formal dinner!
