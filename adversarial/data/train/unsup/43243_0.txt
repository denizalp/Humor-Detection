My daughter had a veneer break while visiting a couple of years ago.  She called Dr Angel's office.  Even though it was Friday and they normally don't schedule appointments, Dr Angel was in the office and saw my daughter.  She had issues with that veneer several times and had gone to several dentists.  Dr Angel was the first dentist to fix it correctly.  She still schedules her appointments with Dr Angel when visiting Phoenix instead of going to a local LA dentist. \n\nEveryone at Dr Angel's office is friendly and professional.  The waiting times are short, yet I have never felt rushed.  Dr Angel and her staff make sure they explain any procedures, answer all of your questions, and provide excellent care.  She also doesn't try to convince you to have unnecessary procedures.   The office is comfortable, clean and conveniently located.
