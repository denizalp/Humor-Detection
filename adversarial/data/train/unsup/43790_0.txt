Was recommended to this place by a friend. I never tried sushi before, the thought of anything raw always turned me off. My wife however loves sushi and always wanted to go out and try a all you can eat one. I decided to give it a try since Valentines day and what not. All I can say is, that was the best damn experience I've ever had. Chef Beto makes some of the best damn sushi ever. My wife and roomates loved it! Chef Beto will feed you till you explode! Great food and atmosphere!!! Will be back again soon and with more people!!! Thank you for making my first sushi experience a awesome one!!!
