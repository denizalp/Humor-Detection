There are soooooo many better options, not only in the city of Montr√©al, but right on Crescent St. itself!\n\nI had no interest in going, but one of the guys we were traveling with wouldn't stop talking about \"this awesome cougar bar called Thursdays.\" He had heard about from someone at his work, which was kind of a red flag for me.  But I figured, \"what the hell...\"  If there's nothing going on, we make it a One Rounder and move on.  It wouldn't be the first time it's happened.\n\nWell, if there were Cougars they must have been on the prowl somewhere else.  Don't get me wrong, there was quite a few older women there but none were by any means fitting the definition of Cougar.  But like I said, that's my buddy's thing so I gave him 1 round to find a reason to stay.\n\nThere was a few groups of girls that could only be described as, \"terrified American college students that were legally in a bar for possibly their first time.\"  They were so tightly huddled together, trying to avoid eye contact with anyone outside their group... It was actually pretty comical to observe from afar as guys would try to approach them.\n\nWell after our round, my friend wanted to stay and \"keep trying\" but my patience had been worn and I was headed back to one of my regular bars.  He convinced one of the other guys with us to stay and be his wing-man.  So we split 2 & 2... \n\nThey met back up with us about an hour or two later to report that it was the complete bust-out that I had thought.
