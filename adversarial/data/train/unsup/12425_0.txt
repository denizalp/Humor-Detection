My first time in I thought it was decent, they have a broad selection of toys (mostly in the higher end $$$.) I was impressed that they had latex (despite it being molded) and leather cuffs in the back. Their show selection is similar to what you'll find almost anywhere such as Demonia & Pleasure shoes\/boots. \n\nI have a fairly vast knowledge regarding sex toys, etc and don't often need much help from the staff, so I didn't grill the staff on their knowledge. But after my second visit there I will not be returning. \n\nThe woman working (owner?) was obnoxious! I went in looking for something specific and I swear it was cheaper a few months ago when I was in getting a different item. I've seen the item online for less than half what they had it posted at. Not that that's too surprising but I have seen it in town for less. I was prepared to pay the higher then online price I'd seen elsewhere knowing it's a brick and mortar store - and I try to support those stores as often as I can. Off handily I commented on their rather high prices compared to other stores in the city and I got a huge dose of attitude thrown my way. Perhaps it was an off day, but I wont tolerate being treated with such attitude by someone in a sales position. I will not be returning to this store.
