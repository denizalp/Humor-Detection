With the heat wave this weekend we needed a good boba break. We decided to give Teastreet another try.\n\n In stead of milktea we tried the  Top 10 menu selction Yogiberry. The cashier was helpful  in helping us.\n\n We subbed strawberries for  lychee popping boba. She was very  quick and efficient with our ice blended surprise.  Within 2 minutes before I had time to even scan my perka app our drink had arrived!\n\nWe went back in line and ordered a lychee milk tea. So far oolong milk tea, red bean milk tea and yogiberry are my faves!
