The wait for Chick-Fil-A is over, kinda.\nIf you come to this location, one of two now open in Henderson, you're in for a wait, depending on when you arrive.\nI first attempted to come here last night around 6:15pm (Wednesday) and there was a maze of Henderson Police directing traffic, customers parking and walking into the restaurant, and lines for the drive-thru that weaved around the parking lot.  It doesn't help that there's currently construction going on in the parking lot that's probably one culprit for all this chaos as there are sections that are totally blocked off.  The other reason it's super busy is that there are tons of people wanting to EatMoreChikin. I managed to park, but the line was out the door if you were planning to dine-in, so I just went home.  \nMy second and successful attempt was today, arriving around 11:15am.  The line was not out the door this time, but just inside.  However, there were employees armed with mini-iPad-things taking orders so by the time you got to the register you just had to pay.  The restaurant was almost full, but there are tables outside, too, if you want to dine al fresco.  I had my food by 11:30am, so my recommendation is to come as early as possible since this place is going to be packed for a while or just come armed with a LOT of patience.  My usual order of the 8-count nugget meal was as terrific as always.  I've been a Chick-Fil-A fan since I grew up with it in Southern California.  The customer service here is just like the other locations:  attentive and friendly.  Fast food may not be your thing, and it's not usually mine, but there are a few exceptions for me including CFA and that burger place which hails from So Cal.  Food snobs need not apply.  Welcome to Southern Nevada, Chick-Fil-A!
