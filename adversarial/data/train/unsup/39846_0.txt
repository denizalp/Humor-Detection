Went here with a few girlfriends. We made reservations in advance and they were ready for us on time.  Very clean space and friendly staff. Everyone was kind and professional. Legit operation. \n\nHad a deluxe pedicure and gel nails. Had great choices of product and enjoyed every minute. Would definitely go back when I visit again.
