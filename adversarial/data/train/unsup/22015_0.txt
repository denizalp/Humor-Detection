Everyone else's reviews of the casino are on the money.  Cheaper gaming ($3 blackjack on a Sunday night!), looser video poker payout, heavy with locals and oldsters sporting the Rolled Out of Bed line.  You gotta bring your own exuberance, and take off that collared shirt, fancy boy.  It's a fun, grungy alternative to the Strip's conspicuous consumption flash.  Bonus points for absolutely no one leaving their stools during the fire alarm.  Smoke inhalation is part of Vegas culture.\n\nThe hotel room was swell - decored like your grandparent's flat-gold-accented rec room time-travelled from the 60s.  It's not shmancy, but it's way better than the low price would suggest:  Clean, roomy (except the bathroom), comfortable, peaceful.  Even if they hadn't been so generous with discounts and comps, I'd still look forward to staying here again.
