Although we have eaten at -- and really enjoyed -- the Roy's on Oahu, our dinner at the Roy's in Las Vegas was very disappointing. One fish entree was raw, the other was way overcooked and served lukewarm. Even the crabcake appetizer, one of our favorites at Roy's, was off at the Las Vegas location.  Service was average and hurried, likely because we didn't order any alcohol. I would never return to this location again -- it's way, way below the standard set by the rest of the franchise.
