OH MY GOODNESS! YOU NEED TO STOP IN HERE THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN OHIO CITY! The pizza is made in 3 minutes and it is soooooooooo delicious! Everyone who was working were so nice, helpful, and appreciative. Not only that but the owner is so kind! It was 68 degrees outside at 1:30 am when my fianc√© and I stopped in. We wanted to sit outside and eat our pizza, since they opened so recently they didn't have any outside tables or chairs. The owner was so nice he brought out chairs and made us a table so we didn't have to eat on the ground. Best experience I've had at ANY establishment  in a very long time! I will be in again very soon! \n\nP.S- it's 3 shops down from Ohio City Burrito and open late, perfect walk from any of the bars on w25th and they are open LATE. Get here!!!!
