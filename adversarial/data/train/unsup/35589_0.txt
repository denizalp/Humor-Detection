I WISH THERE WAS A ZERO STAR OPTION. \n\nThe management of this building is a complete disaster. They treat big issues with absolutely no urgency and treat the residents like second class citizens.\n\nEx: issue with the pool has left it empty and under construction for the last 7 months. No biggie though, leave it up to management to lie about progress and intentionally delay any decision to fix it until the last minute possible to save cost while keeping the HOA payment the same. \n\nAnd shame on anyone for wanting to know what's going on. If you call the office they respond as if it's none of your business. The most unhelpful people I've ever come into contact with.\n\nAnd the sales office? Great before you move in. Once you're a resident good luck getting them to do anything for you. Empty promise after empty promise. Truly disrespectful.\n\nOnly redeeming quality: the service staff is excellent. Valet, front desk, cleaners. All great people. Unfortunately they aren't the ones making decisions. \n\nBottom line: do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. There are plenty of wonderful high rises in Vegas (Panorama, Mandarin, Martin, Turnberry Place, Veer). Don't subject yourself to this place. It's just not worth it.
