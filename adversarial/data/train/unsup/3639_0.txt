Awesome five star service today from A-Access. Our previous lock decided that it didn't want to play \"unlock\" anymore. Instead, it's going to just be \"lock\" and that's a problem when you'd like to leave the house secured and go out.\n\nA-Access to the rescue. We checked them out on Angie's List where they had an excellent rating and I was a little concerned because they only had one review here on Yelp. That concern was completely unfounded!\n\nOur locksmith arrived right on time, he was professional and he was friendly and he did an awesome job replacing the locks on our front door lickety-split. Definitely five stars worthy.
