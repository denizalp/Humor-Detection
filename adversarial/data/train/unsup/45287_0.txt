Made a last minute stop here for dinner before a show. Didn't have a reservation, but the hostess was friendly and able to seat the two of us quickly.  Nice atmosphere and an attractive space. Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive. We started with the pasta fagioli soup which was good but a bit bland for my taste.  The complementary focaccia bread they bring to the table was excellent.   My wife ordered the chicken rollatini Parmesan and I got the lasagna. Both were excellent.  Overall the experience was very enjoyable with great food, great service and a beautiful atmosphere.  The only reason I removed one star was because during our meal a photographer who worked for the resort was going around taking pictures of people in the restaurant and trying to sell the photos. I found it a bit tacky.
