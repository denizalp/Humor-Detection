The exterior is deceiving because the interior looks so new and clean!!!! Vegan friendly!\n\nRemember to check in on YELP so you can get a free coffee!\n\nTheir jalapeno cornbread is SO SO good. I ordered a side of it so I can snack on it later in the car. \n\nVegan Burrito (6\/10): It wasn't what I had expected...too much of a turmeric taste. I was hoping for a \"Chipotle sofritas\" kind of taste. AND it was a bit spicy!!! The portion is generous so you will be full. It comes with a side of smashed sweet potato and red salsa. I would probably not order this again though.\n\nSante Fe Benedict (8\/10): My boyfriend loves this dish! It comes with a side of hash browns and cornbread. It's your traditional breakfast dish with cured ham & chipotle hollandaise poured all over.
