There is no option for no stars ? I went there in an emergncy when my own eyebrow person was not available. I specifically told the lady, I guess Jana.. to remove the extras only and explained her that i have a very strong arch which needs to be taken care of while waxing. \n\nShe was like \"ohh honey, i understand\" and next thing I know she totally ruined my left eyebrow, it was totally flat. I told her ohh god you waxed on my Arch.. she was totally horrifed but still kept on saying ohh honey you still have the arch.. i'm sorry i will take care of it in the right one. \"Yeah like that will fix everything\"..\n\nAnyways i was upset, i asked how much, she said \"although i take $20, but i think you are upset so i will take $15\" I gave her a $20 bill and she had the nerve to ask me \"do you want the change\", Really you think i will be giving you a TIP on such a bad job.. I said \"Yes i want my change\" I stormed out the place.\n\nFor the next 2 weeks i was sketching on that missing hair area with a pencil..\n\nWill never go back there again.
