I have had the absolute worst experience with this place. Between not fixing my dry-rotted shower for three months, letting my A\/C leak for 3+ weeks before maintenance came out, and my personal favorite, ALLOWING A CLEANING COMPANY INTO MY APARTMENT \"ON ACCIDENT!\" How did this happen, you say? Allow me to elaborate.\n\nI get a call while I'm at work, asking if my name is Emily, and if I still live at Lakeview At The Bay. Suspicious, I asked who was calling. Jordan - the apartment manager. She explained to me that, while it was not a big deal, something had happened. According to her, there is an apartment complex in Mesa called Lakeview at Superstition Springs, and someone with my apartment number there had ordered carpet cleaning services. A mix up occurred, and they ended up COMING INTO MY APARTMENT, cleaning my apartments, and...stealing $100.00 out of my drawer!\n\nJordan offered absolutely NO apology, would not explain to me how this mix up occurred, what she would to do rectify it, etc. How are there no verification procedures in place? How is that even acceptable? I ended up having to call the police and file a police report against the complex AND the cleaning company (who, by the way, Lakeview gives out \"coupons\" for). \n\nAbsolutely unacceptable. Worst apartment manager I've ever dealt with. I cannot wait to move out in two months and not deal with her unprofessional, demeaning self anymore.
