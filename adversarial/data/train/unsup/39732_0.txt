I ended up stopping here spontaneously and did not know what to expect, but I will for sure be returning.  My friend and I ordered the appetizers of baba ghanoush and hummus with pita bread.  They were both amazing, although I preferred the baba ghanoush.  The prices are great too, and the hummus cost and portion size is comparable to what's in a regular health food store, but Parsley's is fresher and better.
