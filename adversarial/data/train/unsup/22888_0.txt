It's no secret. I am not an Apple fan. Apart from a 5th generation iPod that I still use from time to time, I do not buy Apple products. But you know what the Apple store is perfect for? Posting last minute Unofficial Yelp Events! So I have to give it up to Apple. Unlike many other electronics stores, their products actually have an Internet connection and I was able to post the UYE using one of their many MBPs. This afforded Yelpers three full hours of notice! Thanks Steve.
