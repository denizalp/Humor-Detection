I am giving three stars because the waitress was very upbeat and apologetic. It was a new experience eating in the dark. Also the restrooms were very clean.\n\n1. There is no menu. It is a surprise meant to activate your other senses. You choose between three categories. (Savory, sweet, spicy) \n-No menu seemed exciting. I took the risk, trusted the staff and left extremely disappointed. I did not hide my disappointment. My waitress apologized for 5\/6 dishes because I was unhappy.\n2. It should not be a secret that this is a vegan restaurant. There are only meat like items.  \n-The menu can be secret, but tell people in advance the type of restaurant. I was thoroughly upset. When we first got there and asked about any conditions to be aware of, my bestie told them she is vegetarian. The girl said ok no problem we have a menu with options for you. I said I am not a vegetarian and no allergies. She said ok no problem. During the experience, I kept asking will the next course be my main meal with meat? (I actually asked for meat)  I repeated I'm not vegetarian and expressed my concern there may be confusion in the kitchen. The waitress kept saying possibly... I can't ruin the surprise...test your senses. I think that would have been a good time to tell me I am not getting meat or fish. \n3. The price...$70 per person. There was one course that I fully enjoyed. The other courses I didn't eat everything due to bland taste or certain veggies I have never enjoyed. \n\nI am not ok paying so much for a meal that I didn't enjoy. It's pitch black so you're  not paying for the ambiance. I expect to pay for great tasting food... whether all vegan or meat included- a price that high MUST be great tasting food. This did not cut it for me. \n\nI wish this new business the best of luck! It is a good concept.
