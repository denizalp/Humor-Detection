It's been a while, and not much has changed at Spoof. It's still small and simple, the sales associates still let you know about the deals and the clothes are still cheap and compliment provoking. \n\nCotton style blazer that travels without creasing - $20; black tights (the gray ones I bought 3 years ago still look fabulous), $10; plus an assortment of $13.99 shirts and dresses to stack my wardrobe. \n\nYup - you still rock my frugal world. \n\nCurrent hours are 10-10 but I've been told they'll be changing these soon. And there's rumors of a website in the works too!
