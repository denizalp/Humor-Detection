This place is awesome!! It is such a welcoming restaurant with friendly staff. My boyfriend has talked highly of the food here for quite some time now so we finally came here for brunch on Sunday. He had never been to the new location so it has been a long time. Let me tell you, the menu is super eclectic, overly creative and wants you to come back to try more of their awesome put together dishes.\n\nThe staff, first of all was super friendly and welcoming. We sat at the bar (as we always do wherever we go) and the bartenders and manager were all very nice.\n\nMy boyfriend has boasted of this \"FEZ burger\" for quite time so he obviously ordered it, and subbed salt and pepper fries as the side. So dang good! The pears, the molasses sauce, the bun...heaven on a piece of colorful ceramic that matched the eclectic atmosphere.\n\nI got the chicken pita, sub lettuce for pita, lol. It was excellent! I loved the pomegranate sauce and the dried fruits! Chicken was cooked perfectly and the grill\/char flavor was present which I love. The side salad in the lemon herb dressing was great too! I loved the rainbow carrot diced in thin shreds on top.\n\nWe also got the drinks...I ordered the jalapeno Bloody Mary, so good, I also had the G-Spot drink, at only five bucks each, not only a great deal but great drinks!\n\nWe will be back, it was an excellent dining experience and the parking is actually really easy :)
