My husband and I are from the Philly area visiting  family in Cleveland and were looking for an original menu with outdoor seating.  Vegan & Vegetarian options a plenty, a nice mix of Mediterranean and Indian influenced dishes.  And real sardines grilled perfectly.  Inventive drink menu, and a great local beer selection.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal, and the hospitality of the owner stopping over to see how are dining experience was.  A great find in Cleveland.
