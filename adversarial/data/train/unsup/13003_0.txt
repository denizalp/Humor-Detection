Having Mon Ami Gabi bookmarked for awhile, I finally got the chance to come by during my company vacation last December. We didn't have reservations as I wanted to sit in the outdoor patio, which is served on a first come basis. We were told the wait would be roughly an hour, and were surprised to be seated after 20 or so minutes.\n\nIf you're planning to sit outdoors, be prepared for very tight and cramped seating. The patio is a popular choice and it's like the restaurant wanted to maximize the space and squeeze as many tables in there as possible. But the view of the Bellagio fountains slightly makes it all worth it. One extra star for the view.\n\nI started off with their St. Germaine cocktail ($15), which was light, sweet and refreshing, and Onion Soup Gratin ($11), which was baked with Gruyere cheese. It was heavy and very flavorful, but I couldn't finish it since it was too salty. While my Eggs Benedict ($15) consisted of Canadian bacon, it was very standard and unmemorable. The rest of my party had the Grilled Salmon & Spinach Salad ($20) and Maine Lobster Roll ($18), which seemed to be fairly mediocre as well.\n\nThe service left a lot to be desired. Our server was very friendly and outgoing, but couldn't be found half the time. Maybe it was because it was busy, but we seemed to wait forever for everything, even small requests.\n\nNot too sure if I'd come back, unless I'm in the mood for a bougie al fresco lunch with Bellagio fountain music playing in the background every 15-minutes. If you want decent food for the same price, you're better off at Grand Lux Caf√©. If you want better food with a view and aren't on a budget, go to one of Bellagio's lakefront restaurants.\n\nP.S. Who's Gabi?
