Mother's Day, a train wreck. Hostess was confused and apologetic. (Untrained?) Never saw a manager. (Who was in charge?) Even though we had a reservation, and an elderly woman in our party, it took 15 min to be seated. No waitress spoke to us for another 15 min. (Understaffed?) Empty tables all around us, clearly well below capacity. Since they couldn't handle the number of people already seated, thankfully the hostess was turning people without reservations away. Significant loss of potential revenue on what should be a big dollar day for the restaurant. With too few waitresses, people were leaving tables and going to the bar to get their own drinks. \n\nOnce we got a waitress, she was very competent, friendly and apologetic. Limited menu selection, but plenty of choices. Kitchen staff was holding up well. The food was OK, better than expected, and delivered in a reasonable period of time after placing the order. I would have given Table Brick Oven & Bar 3 stars, maybe 4 stars without the chaotic greeting and slow service.
