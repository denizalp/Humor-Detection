Very poor customer service by the cashier who says he is the owner. I went to return a defective inner tube which he said I punctured the tube upon installation and was not responsible.  A 6$ inner tube that probably cost him 2$ at the most he was not willing to guarantee. ..i then gave  back the rest of my purchase there that I had done with the tube and told him that his poor attitude towards customer service will not be rewarded with any of my business.  When I arrived earlier in the day at the original purchase I asked if he would install the tube on the tire and he said he could do it in about 5 hours later because he was so busy...i was the only customer in the store at that time...He did tell me it would only take a minute. ..but he was so busy that he could not take a minute of his day to do for a customer.  Since he won't back an inner tube I doubt u can trust him with a guarantee of anything expensive or costly repairs.  He is willing to sacrifice current,  future and repeat business over the cost of an inner tube. I told him that he can keep everything I purchased and since he refused to give me back my 31$ I am involved in a dispute with my bank over his payment.  GOOD LUCK BEING IN BUSINESS IN A YEAR JERK! This is the second of 5 reviews to mention this guy's attitude towards a returning of a tube....go to Walmart where u will get a better guarantee on your purchase. ..\nBUYER BEWARE. ..
