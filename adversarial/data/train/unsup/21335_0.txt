If you are Asian American and the fact that you don't like to go to church on Sundays to meet other Asian Americans, this is the place for you to get a chance to meet other Asians. You often accidently meet other Asians there while in the steam room and end up meeting them at the Recreation Center in Westlake, and at Borders in Westlake.
