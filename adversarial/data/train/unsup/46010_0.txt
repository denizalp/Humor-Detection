I should NOT have posted such a awesome review about the ER on my last time I was here, as it's exact opposite, on this visit.... terrible.. absolutely terrible on this ER visit!  \nI arrived here in agony, which just progressed into terrible agony! They let me sit in agony for HOURS!! \nI'm a pain management patient so my threshold for pain meds is HIGHER than the average patient & they give me Tylenol while pain level was at least a 10-12 on pain scale!! After this incompetent nurse put in my IV, which only made my pain 10 fold! Then walked away & left me crying for another TWO HOURS! Did they offer me the Tylenol! I take 60 mil morphine almost daily for severe back\/leg pain. \nWhen nurse failed yet again (causing more pain!) to get IV to work, she's got the nerve to say \"you moved\" we need to do it over again on the other side! \nI only give you 2 attempts to get IV in & generally I don't have a problem nurses normally get IVs in without issue this nurse has nerve to say your hard \"to get\" well NO I'm not, that's just how bad this nurse was with IV's & I honestly wanted to punch this nurse! And punch her badly!! She finally got IV placed & placed in the worst area possible, next to cat bite etc... \n\nBut the fact she caused me ten-fold more pain then walked away & just left me crying in pain! After I begged I finally got some relief. Just as my 4 hours was up\nOn my pain meds, I begged please don't let me get like that again... yes you can ha e pain meds in 15 minutes... They MOVE ME into a different area with our instructions for new nurse.... has to start all over again. Of course my nurse was out to lunch... they would have left me the way I was had I not begged again.. please don't let it get bad again!! Please! The nurse went ahead & got me my pain meds again.... so thankfully I didn't go down hill in pain again... but only because I didn't allow it to happen. Had I not complained they would ha e left me alone to fall into pain again!! \n\nSo I did get admitted & after waiting for over 5 hours in ER in a recliner chair (thankfully) chair I got moves to a bed in a hallway, not a room, hallway, in front of nurses station. Noise, bright lights every thing! No rest at all! \nHopefully I'll get a room at some point tonight! So I can get some actual rest. It's just a waiting game now... to keep you posted. Thank for now...
