I'm fascinated by the momentary trend of the fancypants burger joint.\n\nPeople who wouldn't be caught dead ordering a \"hamburger\" flock into the place for the wood-paneled ambiance and information-heavy menu in search of words like \"quality\" and \"exotic\".   They want important sounding ingredients.  They need to have a menu that speaks in their language.\n\nEverything is overexplained in mouth-watering detail.   It's not \"a burger and fries\", it's \"AAA grade beef patties served with a side accoutrement of hand-cut french-fried PEI potatoes\".  \n\nOne man's ketchup is another's imported Italian tomato glaze.\n\nHamburgers are always delicious.  Face it.  You don't come here because of the food.  You come here because of the company.  You want to eat in a place that represents an environment of where you want to see yourself.   The homeless people at the fast food joint down the street sicken you.   You don't want to eat out of a cardboard box.   You don't want to stare at picture of a crazed clown playing with multicultural children.   You don't want to talk to someone wearing a headset.\n\nIs Craft Burger good?    It's great.   Superb, actually.     \n\nExtremely consistent, with none of the riff-raff.
