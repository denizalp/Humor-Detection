RUN ... DON'T WALK FROM THIS PLACE!!!\n\nThis place is filthy, slow, unprofessional, has a very rude and uncaring staff and is just as ghetto as a place can be.  Giving plasma is a hard enough gig as it is, but donating here is like a living hell. The average time to donate is about 3 hours which is how long it normally takes only on the first donation at other centers. Stay away and go to any other place except for this one!!!
