i got contacts for 2 different promoters for this place from my friend.\n\none of them was really helpful, the other, a fail. \n\nafter texting them both, one replied he could get my group of 6 girls in for $30 cover on a saturday night, no line\/wait. \n\nthe other replied, \"no problem, i got you guys down.\" \n\nso i politely turned mister $30 cover down by telling him $30 was a bit expensive, and that we were just going to go to a different club...because i didn't want to offend him and tell him i was on someone else's list. he replied with, \"$30 is a lot? lol, where u from, alaska?\"\n\nso i kindly just told replied that $30 is not a lot of money in a bigger picture, but as a group of girls in vegas, there's no way i'm paying for cover or drinks. i stood by that this weekend, haha. \n\nso thanks, but no thanks, tony. i'll make sure to refer my other promoter who clearly has more weight in the promoting scene.\n\nBUT ANYWAY, i'm so grateful for the other promoter because this place was AWESOME. it's more of a lounge than a club, since there's not really a dance floor (or if there was, it wasn't a big one). people were just kind of dancing around the pool. it was beautiful and classy, nice and cool outside, and had a crowd of people who were easy on the eyes. if you like house music, you'll love this place. i wish we had gone on friday because someone told me steve aoki DJs there sometimes. \n\ni don't know if the drinks are expensive, but they are strong. forget overcrowded XS (which we went to the night before), this is our new go-to club in vegas!
