Do not take your phone into these guys. They are con artists and do not stand behind their work. I took an iPhone in to get my battery replaced and received a defectiive battery. I asked them to replace the \"new\" battery with another one and they refused to replace it. They swore it was the motherboard on the phone and there was nothing they could do for me. \n\nI refused to take their word for it and took my phone to another guy. He replaced the battery and the phone is good as new. These guys also told me I had water damage and my motherboard was damaged from that. The guy I took my phone to for a second opinion showed me I had NO water damage. These guys have no idea what they are doing.
