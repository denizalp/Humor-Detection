A really good place for early morning breakfast. We got there around 7:30am craving breakfast food. \n\nHIS & HERs: We had random cravings so we ordered a few things to share. We ordered the WHITE CHOCOLATE MACADAMIA NUT PANCAKES, the ADOBO FRIED RICE OMLETTE, & the CHICKEN SKILLET w\/ a side of CINNABON PANCAKES. We're fat, I know.\n\nEverything was extremely good... My only qualm was that there weren't really white chocolate chips infused into the pancakes. Previously we ordered the red velvet pancakes, which were perfectly infused and I still highly recommend! The adobo fried rice was also really rich and satisfying. Wasn't too fond of the skillet personally... not as flavorful, but wasn't bad. And if you're into it, they also have sugar free syrup, which we were really happy about! Overall, definitely will return when we have an early morning sweet tooth! :)
