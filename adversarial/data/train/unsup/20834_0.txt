Hmmmmmm, how do I phrase this? Don't go here. No, no; sorry, too harsh. How about, the hot dogs are not good? Aaagh, I messed up again, let's try, skip this spot. \n\nThe hubby and I were getting drunk while blowing our money at the casino, so we wanted a snack. I suggested (I claim responsibility) Pinks.  There was a yelp check-in special, buy two hot dogs, get one free, so, of course, we monopolized on this deal. \n\nThe cashier was very sweet and accurate. \n\nI got a turkey dog with nacho cheese, ketchup and mustard.  My hubby got a polish dog with chili, onions, nacho cheese and mustard.  His free hot dog was a turkey dog with chili, nacho cheese and onions. Boy were they pretty when we picked them up. However, the dogs just were not good, at all. \n\nI enjoyed feeding the pigeons that were at Pinks (there is a sign that says don't feed them). However, everything else (outside of the cashier) was a thumbs down. Sorry, we won't be back, there is no need for you to visit either, just saying.
