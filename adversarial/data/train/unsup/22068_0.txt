Great selection of salad, soup, and breads. I love the wonton chinese salad the best and they always have a new pre-made salad every few weeks which are usually good. The blueberry muffins with the honey butter are my favorite. No trip to sweet tomatoes would be complete however without a dish of soft serve frozen yogurt at the end! The ingredients are always fresh on the salad bar, the dressings always have at least 8+ choices, and there is usually some fruit as well. \n\nIf you sign up for their \"club veg\" emails, there are coupons every week for lunch and dinner. I always feel like I am making a \"healthy\" better choice for eating out when I come here.
