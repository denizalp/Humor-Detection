I'm going to start this review with the positives... \n1. The outdoor seating and overall ambiance of the restaurant was very fun.\n2. Service was good. \n3. Food came out quickly. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I'm not sure how this restaurant gets 4 stars. Maybe I just don't know good Italian food or maybe we ordered the wrong thing. \nWe ordered the eggplant Parmesan appetizer and sausage meat walls with a red pesto sauce (recommended by our waiter) with gnocchi pasta. The eggplant appetizer was just very  underwhelming and the garlic bread that came out with it was not even warm. Our main dish was again just very underwhelming. It wasn't terrible but my first thought was that I would just rather have Olive Garden. \nI would give this place a second shot just to see if maybe another dish would be more worth the while but I just left feeling very unsatisfied by the food.
