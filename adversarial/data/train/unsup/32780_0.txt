It looks like a hole in the wall. The only reason we stopped by was cause we really wanted some Mexican food and this was the closest thing. But the food was SO good! My wife had flautas and wouldn't stop talking about how amazing they were. I had a carne asada burrito. The food was great. The a\/c must have been broken or something cause it was hot in there. But the food, totally worth it!
