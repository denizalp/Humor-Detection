If it wasn't for the salesman, Ron this review would be 1 Star!   The ladies they have behind the \"cashier\/customer service\" area are the worst!  Rude and disrespectful, not only to the customer but to Ron also!  They messed up our account so bad I had to call corporate to fix it & even they were upset because they wrote in the notes what to do!!
