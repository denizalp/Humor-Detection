BF surprised me with reservations here for date night! Definitely a place that would be a hit with guys, it's a steak and potatoes place for sure. The decor was upscale going for romantic but the kitschy cow art and eclectic selection of music (from the 70s?) kind of threw off the ambiance.  \n\nCLASSIC CAESAR: BF's pick, huge portion with several anchovies. I liked how the croutons were served on the side, as I don't care for them, but the full-leaf romaine used made it difficult to serve this dish without making a mess.\nHAND-CUT WAGYU TARTARE: I am a tartare fanatic and this version, mixed tableside, did not disappoint. Flavorful American beef accented with red onion, quail egg, and parsley, simple but very good. Plenty of crostini provided, too.\nPORTERHOUSE FOR TWO: $98\/32oz, huge portion and cooked to perfect medium rare. This was served with a bearnaise sauce I didn't care for, and the meat was lacking a flavorful crust. The pan sauce perfectly complemented the meat. Porterhouse is served sliced, and brought to the table with the bone marrow. \nPOTATO PUREE: Portion goes farther than it seems, because it is so freaking rich. Texture was so smooth it was like velvet. Enjoyed this more than I thought I would, definitely one of the must-get sides.\nCHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER LAVA CAKE: I'm not really a lava cake person, but this version filled with peanut butter was quite good. Cake was moist, chocolate-PB contrast is hard to screw up, the vanilla ice cream paired well with this. Wish I had thought to sub the cinnamon ice cream, which sounds even better. \n\nService, especially from bussers, was attentive, and the booths are intimate for a date night or special occasion dinner with family. Highly suggest making reservations- even on a late weekday evening, the dining room was packed. The three-course dinners (just pick your meat, staff picks the sides and starters) sound like the best experience, will opt to go that route next time.
