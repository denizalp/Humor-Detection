I'm a huge fan of Marigny.  Be forewarned, that the atmosphere is very different depending on which night you go!  Thursday is the famous $10 \"drink and drown\" night. You pay $10 cover and you can drink as much well liquor as your heart desires.  I do believe drink and drown is an excellent descriptor of what happens to 50% of those in attendance.  It's a great time though (if you don't have to get up before 10 on Friday).  Saturday is the usual club scene.  Drinks are regular price and there is usually a $5 cover.  However, you can get onto guest lists and your entrance is free.  The music and dancing is unbelievable.  Everyone just lets loose and breaks out the crazy moves.  Prepare to sweat (off your alcohol)!  \n\nIf you are looking for a more low-key evening and are into trivia, come Tuesday nights (8:30).  They have one of the funniest, entertaining drag queens as the trivia hostess, Roxy! Plus, 1st place wins a $50 bar tab, 2nd place wins a $25 bar tab.  None of those cheap-o koozie, key chain awards!  The competition is fierce.\n\nLastly, parking is free in the surrounding lots after business hours - after 6 PM is a good rule of thumb!
