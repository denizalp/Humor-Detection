Excellent pork belly bahn mi tacos! Went with a party of 4 and everyone enjoyed the taste of their meals.  The duck wings are definitely worth a try as well.  The only drawbacks were that the presentation and plating was sloppy.  Also avoid the skillet corn it tastes nothing like real grilled Mexican street corn.  Service was friendly and fast.  Good place for a quick bite.
