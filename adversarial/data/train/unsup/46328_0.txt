I would like to update that the business owner reached out to me to apologise for my experience and even offered a free meal or a refund which I didn't expect.\n\nThough my experience still stands, I definitely appreciate this gesture. My original review was not to discourage anyone from going to Knuckle Sandwich, I was simply being honest. The level of customer service provided was great and that is the sole reason for the 3 star rating. \n\nI will add that my boyfriend seemed to enjoy the food just fine so it easily could have been a one time mishap. The sauce on the sandwich did taste quite good but it was difficult to judge flavors when I began feeling sick. \n\nAgain thank you to the business owner for reaching out!
