The candied yams and French fries with white sauce are a must.  The wait service was very good.   Our waiter took the time to explain the menu and type of cuisine on the menu. \n\nEverything else we had was a disappointment.  My husband said it is like the chef used the wrong recipe for his meal (pulled pork looked like chicken?) and my brisket was so like three days old dry.  Good brisket should almost melt in your mouth and be so savory you don't notice the space in between bites.   We did not finish our meals.  We lied and said we were full.  \n\nAnd perhaps this is because they are new but there was no diaper changing station.  Fail for mamas!  \n\nWon't go back.
