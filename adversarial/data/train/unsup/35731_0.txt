I would love to give this location more stars, however the manager of this store is so unprofessional . She taints the entire experience. The store is well stocked and clean, very shoppable. The staff is polite and helpful as well. However the manager is so bad, and I wonder why they keep her. I was shopping a few months ago, and had extra coupons that where set to expire, so while in line to check out, I gave one to a lady in line in fount of me. The manager glared at me, gave me a dirty look, and finished checking the woman out who I had given the coupon too. I was next in line, and another associate helped me. Has soon as her customer left, the manager started complaining that they had just lost $10 in sales because I gave the previous lady a coupon. She made such a big deal out of it. I was shocked, and she kept going on right up until I walked out of the store. I was parked right in front of the store, and she then proceeded to follow me out the door, yelling at me the entire time! She lost her mind! I called the corporate office while sitting in my car, while she was having the melt down. I was sent a gift card for my trouble, but months later the phyco is still there! I still drop in, but prefer to shop at the mall now!
