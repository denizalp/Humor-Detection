Thai Nong Khai might be reason enough to move to the suburbs. If it isn't enough, know that there's excellent Mexican in this same strip mall. It is a strip mall of excellence and magic, in my opinion.\n\nAnyway, Thai Nong Khai is worth the trek out to 75th Ave SE. Their dishes are fresh and expertly prepared. You can get most dishes with any kind of meat you like and they have an extensive vegetarian selection. \n\nThe decor is strip-mall + Thai (cute) and the service is prompt. They have an almost-life-sized Santa that they roll out at Christmas time, he sings songs when you walk by. \n\nIt's a cool place to bring kids and also a great place for a date. Seriously, the food makes this place right for any occasion. I cannot say enough about it. \n\nGo, try it and then remember me when you're buying Christmas presents. You're welcome.
