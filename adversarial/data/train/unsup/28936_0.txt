Ordered chicken tikka masala and garlic naan to go. For the chicken I give 2 stars, it was way too buttery for my tastes which is fine but it gets knocked down a bit more because of the small portion. It was about 6 thinly sliced pieces. \nThe reason it gets knocked down to 1 star is because they forgot my naan. I understand mistakes will happen but for a brand new restaurant with only 2 people inside you would hope that the small details don't get overlooked. And I don't consider getting everything I paid for a small detail.
