NorCal people have Santana Row in San Jose and Stanfford Shopping Center in Palo Alto. SoCal people have The Grove in LA, Americana at Brand in Glendale, and Victoria Gardens for Inland Empire. \n\nNow.....\nLas Vegas has Downtown Summerlin that is pretty much twice the size of Town Square. Been coming here since it open a few years back. It was one of many projects that was stalled during the \"Great Recession.\"\n\nThere are a lot of retail stores and restaurants that have opened up these past 2 years. My family and I enjoy coming here because there is something for everyone. Plus we don't come across tons of tourists. It has more of a local feel. They have two anchor stores, Macy's & Dillards. Along with your Express, Forever 21, and H&M. My personal favorites are Foot Locker, House of Hoops and Dave & Buster's (We finally have one in Vegas!) The Regal Cinema that is located here is by far one of the most modern and luxurious movie house in the valley. A great place for an Urban Adventure.\n\n-Dog Friendly\n-Great for walking and people watching\n-Farmers Market every Saturday, starting at 9 am\n-Parking is abundant. Parallel parking near your favorite store(s) makes it convenient. Plus it's free!
