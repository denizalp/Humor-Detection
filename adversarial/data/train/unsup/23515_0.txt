I've always wanted to stay at Paris in LV - don't know why..it's not the best nor most luxurious hotel on the strip and I've stayed at other beautiful hotels on the strip before but for some odd reason, I always wanted to experience Paris as a guest.  Well - I don't know what the hell I was thinking.\n\nHere's just a quick lesson in why girls LOVE going to vegas in the summer.  It ain't the sound of people's bank accts going negative, it ain't the smell of disgusting cigarettes\/cigars, and it certainly ain't the sound of those cards slapped around by those annoying men on the street passing those degrading cards out blatantly to men who are walking hand-in-hand with their gf\/wife.  Girls love vegas in the summer for the pool.  Although it's scorching hot and we end up frying ourselves out there poolside, there is nothing more fun than ordering cocktails, grubbing on buffalo chicken strips and then jumping in the pool to wash it all off our fingers & mouths.  So what could be a bigger buzz kill than some jerk-face who completely shatters the image Paris tries to uphold!  \n\nIt was hot and I was so thirsty and the now-warm Margarita next to my foot did not seem very tasty to satisfy my thirst.  I went to the bar located within the poolside lounge area.  I had just $4 cash on me and nothing else, thinking I'm sure a bottle of water cannot cost more than $4 even in vegas.  I asked the guy behind the counter (Mark) how much the aquafina (small bottle) was - he says \"$4 - I need to see an ID\".  I replied confused \"Oh, I just want water, not ordering alcohol\".  He says \"Doesn't matter - I need to see an ID\".  A little peeved at his attitude \"Well - I didn't bring my ID down with me - we came down to swim (**it's a POOL not a CLUB! - I didn't say this...but you get my point)...\" He says \"well, I need an ID\". I said - \"For a water?\"....He says as he gets closer to my face \"EVEN TO SPEAK WITH ME!\".  WTF! $%#$%(&*(#&$*#^%*&^$*Q#%^&!%!!!!!!!!!!!! I could NOT believe what had just happened!!!  And I know, I know...being the bigger person, I should control my emotions and ask to speak with a manager then and there calmly at that point....well..I'm not one of those calm, collected, think-with-your-head type- I'm a Woman!  I turned around to walk away in shock...and then turned right back and said \"F%ck you!\" Very classy of me right?  But I couldn't help it - I had to have him get a piece of me somehow.  I cannot stand letting guys like that just go.  You'd think that's the end of that right? Ha - the ass-face says back \"You too!\".  Who says that to a customer??!!  I know I shouldn't have said something so harsh to him, but he deserved it cuz he wanted to card me to \"Speak with him\" inches away from my face spit just missing my nose!   Since when did \"I'm sorry maam that's our policy\" become so difficult to say?  \n\nI went back to my sister and her bf with steam coming out of my ears and cheeks hotter than the 132 degree weather that day.  Eventually, I called the manager on site and let him have it but I know how this kind of stuff works - that assface probably still has the job and still has mental issues he needs to work out before clocking into work each day.  I am still puffing with anger and even if Paris is the only hotel with a vacant room next time I need to go, I'd rather sleep on the street than donate my hard earned money to them only so they can pay someone so disrespectful and rude as an employee.  \n\nI work in a customer-service oriented industry myself and know it's not what we sell but how we sell it.  What job isn't customer-first?  If the customer does not stay at the hotel, eat at the restaurant, bank at the bank, and shop at the store - we would not have that nice paycheck in our acct every other week.  I told the manager I chose to stay at Paris not because I have to.  They no longer earn my business as a guest nor gambler, even if it is because of just one employee who didn't know better.
