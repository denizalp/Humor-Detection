Hubby and I just wanted a quick, weekend getaway and opted to stay at PH when we got what we thought was a great deal.  First time, most likely last time.\n\nTo be honest, it was mostly fine.  If you're looking for a no frills place (cuz you know, frills cost extra here in LV), PH is the place for you. If you don't mind shitty plumbing that wakes you up in the middle of the night because your neighbors are using the facilities, then this is also the place for you.\n\nCons:\nPlumbing sucks. We sort of heard it here and there over the weekend but on our final night, our neighbors came in late and got up early.  When they use their plumbing both times, it was LOUD, even louder than if we were using our own bathroom.  We didn't sleep well.  It's in the walls so we couldn't even close the bathroom door or anything to muffle the sound.\nValet parking is virtually unavailable until about Sunday. Even when they charge $18 or $20 a day, it's packed.  No allowances for hotel guests.\nWe found trash in certain parts of our room so cleaning could be better.\nSelf-parking is miles away due to the unavailability of valet parking. At least it's free for now.\nDearth of good restaurants.\nA whopping $40 a night for resort fee, turned our originally great deal to not a deal.\nOur one window was tiny.  The curtain ran the length of the wall but we quickly realized our window was about 1\/3 of the wall.\n\nPros:  \nNice, modern rooms\nFriendly cleaning staff (we didn't ask for service during our stay but did get extra shampoo)\nCheck-in is relatively painless; if you opt to use a human, the line goes fast at peak times.\nCheck-in staff is professional.\nI like the set up where the lobby is near the entrance and ease of getting to the rooms.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure most people find PH satisfactory but I prefer better.
