This is a really nice Starbucks in a sense that the space is attractive and the displays (mostly behind the counter) are neat and well kept.  There is not much seating here at all, barely any at the front with about 2 or 3 soft chairs and only 2 table\/chair combo outside.\n\nThe centerpiece of this store is the large wall art depicting the first Starbucks at Pike Place Market.\n\nThe large counter area is L shaped and since the store is wide there's a lot of space to order and get your pickup at the right.  \n\nFor the width and size though I think they could have done more with the seating inside.  They could expand the outdoor seating too a bit because only 2 tables with 2 people right beside each other is sort of tight.  \n\nStill this is a nice location along a stretch where you can get a good amount of walking traffic.
