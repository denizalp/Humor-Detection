I flew from Santa Barbara to Phoenix and rented a car to get to Auto Corral RV and buy the used Pleasure-Way Lexor TS on their lot, if the camper was as they described it.  It was, their service was straight forward, prompt,  courteous snd complete  in every way, and I bought the camper.   They are honest and treat people well:  I realized after signing the contract that the camper had just one, not two, roof solar panels--a surprise to them, too--and they promptly reduced the already-agreed-to price by the cost of the panel.  Follow-up service--they're  a service point for Pleasure-Way--has also been great, Allie is really on the ball. Last note--the Lexor TS is beautifully planned and built, and a real pleasure to drive--a great Class B live-aboard camper! Five stars to Auto Corral RV in Mesa!
