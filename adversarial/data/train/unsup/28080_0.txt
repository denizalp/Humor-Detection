Had an amazing stay at the Venetian!! We upgraded to the prestige level and it was so worth the price! We got breakfast in the morning, drinks in the evening, snacks, coffee and tea, and upgrades to the pool! We had a really good time you could literally stay at the hotel the entire time and get everything that you need! The service was amazing, we ate a ribeye at the Mercato Pella Pescheria, where Brandon waited on us. He was great and friendly, just like all the others serving us in the hotel, including Jamie, Derrick, and Ina at the concierge level!! It was awsome we will be staying there again!!!
