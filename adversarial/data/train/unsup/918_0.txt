Hype. It either is the maker or breaker of expectations. Unfortunately, this didn't live up to the hype. Almost everyone that eats late night or has a recommendation for other than regular eats on the strip, will utter this name.\n\nThe food wasn't bad, hell, it was good and flavorful like a lot of places in L.A. I would even dare to say a bit better. The service, well, I don't expect much, but it was satisfactory. The thing that makes no sense to me at all, the ordering system. Why is there 1 person and a separate line for a selection of meats? Why?! The lines would move so much quicker if they had people in the back cutting up said meats while 4-5 counter people take orders. Nope, they think having 1 guy handling each specific meat and 1 guy handling sides (grilled peppers, onions) is the way to go.\n\nWell, it's not. It's a huge and annoying clusterf**k of people in line. It just makes no sense. Then, I wanted to buy an agua fresca, but no one told me how to get a cup. What? I ended up with a can of Coke. \n\nMeats and wares are good, but again, don't get the system of ordering and considering this is quite some ways away from the strip and the wait for food I can get in a good taqueria in L.A., I'll pass.
