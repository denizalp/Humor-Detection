All that Pipe in there just gets me excited...and by pipe, I mean the amazing  pipe racks that the shoes are displayed on.  Some people have issues with money and the pricing of this place but hey its consignment, look it up in the dictionary. No one forces you to sell your shoes there or buy. This group has been always friendly to me and they also work with the community.
