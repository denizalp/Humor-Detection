I'm sorry but dim sum pretty much tastes all the same to me. Unless of course it's super nasty or they don't have a large selection. \nThis place is good cuz they have dim sum ALL day so you don't have to worry about getting their by a certain time. Plus they have their regular menu you may l order off as well. \nDecent prices so you can good a good bang for your buck.
