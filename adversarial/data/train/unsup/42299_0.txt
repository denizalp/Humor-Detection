Found this gem through yelp reviews.  Cute bistro located in strip mall.  Service was very friendly.  But it did take a bit of time to get our food.  \n\nWhat we ordered\n\nHouse guac served with chips and cucumber.  Nice and fresh. \n\nGrilled cheese with jalape√±o bacon and spinach dip.  Creamy rich decadent.  Not for the faint of heart \n\nChicken club.  So yummy. Bread was perfectly crisp and juicy chicken.  \n\nRigatoni and tomato sauce.  Fresh sauce with garlic and basil.  Delicious. \n\nSweet potato fries were on point.
