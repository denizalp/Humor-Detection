The management was fairly prompt with their scheduling since I tried messaging them for a spontaneous appointment via Yelp while I was working overnight at 3am, as soon as I got off work they replied before they opened for a 10:30am appointment! I was impressed by this because at times I can be impulsive and just want to try something new after a long night of work haha.\n\nEm Nail Bar is located in a plaza next to EOS Fitness Gym and Wag N Wash along the Badura\/Durango intersection. Once you enter the spacious facility, an aura of clean luxury awaits you inside: glistening chandeliers, white leather chairs, and spotless textural flooring. The decorations were tasteful, if not subdued- as if I entered a spa and not your typical nail salon. \n\nCindy is the absolute best! She's such a sweetheart and loves a challenge when experimenting with different designs! When I first walked in, she greeted me in such swift grace that we hit it off pretty quickly as we engaged in conversation for the duration of my stay there! I felt like met a long lost sorority sister haha, I couldn't help but be drawn by her magnetism! She even offered water for me at the beginning which was a nice impression in terms of hospitality.\n\nHer skill and precision with my nails were quite impressive. I'm thankful and glad that while experimenting the glittery nude marble gel style on my nails she handled everything with care and had a keen eye for detail for each nail she designed for me. Each cleanly manicured nail was carefully done with skill and with great precision. \n\nAs an update though its been about 20ish days since my last visit there, the color in still intact as if it was the first day, the texture still a smooth finish, and even while my nails grew there was absolutely no chipping\/peeling at the top! I'd be delighted to come back again for a mani and a pedi.
