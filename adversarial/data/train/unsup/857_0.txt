ATTENTION: FOOD POISONING ALERT \n\nMy friends and I ate here. Two of us ordered the Gordon Ramsay burger which comes with a pork patty.  The server whom I do not remember the name of touted it as being the Kobe beef of pork. We ordered it medium but I guess it wasn't cooked well. My friend and I who got the same burger both got food poisoning. He had intense, and explosive bouts of diarrhea whereas I had it way worse. I vomited over 25 times and also had diarrhea. I was flipping 180s on the toilet all night. The next day I was nauseous the entire day and had diarrhea and couldn't even keep down water. My visit to this restaurant ruined my entire Las Vegas trip. The worse part of it all was that the burger itself wasn't even all that good. If I were you I'd go for the farm burger it was less expensive and tasted better. But overall, this place was nothing special. Never coming back again.
