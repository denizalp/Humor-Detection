I don't like being negative, but I don't mind telling the truth. The most mediocre Pho I've ever had. And some of the crappiest service around...unless you're asian. \n\nI absolutely dislike saying this, but it was so clearly apparent. Our waiter was a jerk! In the entire restaurant, there was only our table and one other table that wasn't asian. Both tables were neglected and weren't even given chopsticks. Come on!!! White people can't use chopsticks? \n\nOur waiter also forgot my sister in laws noodles and two beverages. How do you just forget an order that you wrote down? \n\nAnd my Beef Pho wasn't very flavorful and the beef was nearly inedible. It was so fatty and chewy. But, it was inexpensive. $7-something and came with add-ins. Like jalape√±os, basil and mung beans. There's also house made sauces and spicy pepper sauces like Sriracha. \n\nAnd I guess you need to go stupid early, because A) Parking is a Nightmare and B) there's a 6 p.m. dinner rush which means you will be smushed in the doorway with a bunch of grumpy people for an hour. \n\nIt's also open 24 hours and located within Las Vegas's China Town. \n\nAll in all...I'm not recommending this place if you want good Pho or if you're not asian? I totally don't understand the reviews. Because apparently the clueless white folks are getting the crappy scraps or something.
