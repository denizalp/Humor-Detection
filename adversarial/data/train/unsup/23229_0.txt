Oh Retro...Why are you so far away? You need aother shop in Henderson. In the meantime, we'll continue to make the trek out to Southern UTAH, because our kids love your cupcakes. (of course we do too!)  Their cupcakes are the real deal and we don't mind driving 40 minutes out and paying $2.65\/ cupcake  because its worth every penny.\n\nThe one cupcake that caught my attention was the Maple Bacon cupcake. I love the combo-similar to pancakes and bacon. Small pcs of bacon in a vanilla cupcake with a maple buttercream. The buttercream isn't overly sweet, its just right. I also had a bite of the sprinkled donut and it was pretty good. And I may have a new favorite cupcake in the Pucker Up...a raspberry cake with lemon butter cream, good play on the sweet and tangy combo.  The kids love the chocolate fountain-who wouldn't ...chocolate cake, chocolate buttercream, dipped in chocolate ganache. That my friends is a hat trick. Their 2nd fave is the Cookies and Cream cupcake.\n\nThey don't just make cupcakes, they make mini cupcakes,  cookies, and cakes. While waiting my turn I flipped through their  cake book and they make some frickn cool cakes. They will also custom make your cupcakes and cake to your party theme.\n\nThey are doing something right especially when my kids are requesting Retro Bakery for dessert. They pass up ice cream for their cupcakes...what!!!  As my son says...Retro Bakery is BEAST!!! Give them a try and support your local businesses...they won't disappoint.\n\nAloha
