This restaurant came highly recommended from friends and oh it was worth the hype.   One of our most fun nights out all year.  \n\nWe sat in a super comfortable booth that had a huge open window so it felt like dining outside while being in the comfort of this glitzy restaurant.\n\nWe started with a bottle of wine and got a little crazy as we ordered the Poke appetizer but also the Chefs MAC and Cheese.  It is typically an entree but we decided to share for an app.  It was tasty.  Cooked perfect!  \n\nAfter that we decided to share 3 meals for 4 people. The very best was the ribeye. This steak melted in your mouth.  And it was perfect to share so everyone could have a taste.  \n\nWe ended with coffee drinks that were just out of this world and a great dessert. \n\nThe waiter was attentive but not too much and the Manager came over to insure we were having a great experience.   \n\nA super place for a date nite or going out with friends.   Don't plan to eat and run.  You have to enjoy the adventure!   Highly recommended!!!
