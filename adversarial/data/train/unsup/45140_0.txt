End of life choices are hard, one of the hardest is choosing a hospice organization that keeps the patients wishes at the forefront of their mind. Those wishes are the guiding principles followed by the care givers at Sage Hospice. While we always offer choice at our organization we do our best to let families know our preference is Sage Hospice and Palliative Care. \nI have had the opportunity to spend many hours watching the leader of Sage Hospice guide our families\/ patients through the dying process and wholeheartedly believe in her and her team to provide outstanding care under the most difficult of situations.\nGod Bless the amazing work of these talented and selfless caregivers.
