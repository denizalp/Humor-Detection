First time visiting, it was awesome.  We had both sweet and savory crepes and they were equally delicious. There was quite a line when we got there, but they all moved as quickly as possible and got through rush like professionals. When they brought the food out it was as beautiful to look at as it was delicious to eat. 4 plates and 2 drinks was $62 dollars...plus tip, so it is a bit spendier than a regular breakfast out; but sometimes you have got to treat yo self 2018.
