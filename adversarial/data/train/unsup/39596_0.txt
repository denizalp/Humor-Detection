I booked this restaurant on Open Table for our 12th Wedding Anniversary.\n\nAll I can say is I'm glad I did!\n\nWhen we arrived and gave the hostess our name for the reservation she immediately welcomed us with a \"Happy Anniversary\". I thought this was awesome since I didn't even speak in person with anyone at the restaurant. I just mentioned it in the notes when booking the reservation on-line.\n\nI also arranged flowers to be delivered to the restaurant ahead of time and as expected, they were there waiting on our table as we were seated. Not only did they have the flowers ready, the decorated the table with sparkly anniversary confetti and there was a greeting card from the restaurant wishing us a happy anniversary as well. Truly above and beyond!\n\nEverything was perfect from the moment we arrived till we left some two hours later. The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable, the atmosphere not as pretentious as I was expecting. It was \"fancy\" but still felt friendly and cozy.\n\nThe food was truly incredible and plentiful. We ordered the ribeye and the filet. I recommend you try the sweet potato casserole too. To die for! At the end, we were so full that we had to take leftovers home.\n\nAnd also because it was our anniversary, they bought our dessert and coffee.\n\nAs we paid our bill, the waitress also validated our parking.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant and we'll be back!
