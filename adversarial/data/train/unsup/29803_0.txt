Not at all impressed with the Gilbert office on Mercy.\nNot kid friendly or cozy environment- especially waiting room.\nMD McKenna not touchy feeling (maybe a bad day?) and made us wait 25 min in the room until she came in.  Come on, it's a pediatric office- you know kids cant wait that long.  Then spent under 10 min with us.\n\nChandler office is a better environment.  NP was very helpful and nice.  A lot better service and attention.
