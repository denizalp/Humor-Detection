3.5 Stars\n\nFriend: \"We gotta see David Copperfield!\"\nMe: (reacting much like the Sultan in \"Aladdin\" where Jafar is trying to hypnotize him) \"Whaa? But he's so old!\"\nFriend: \"He's not THAT old!\"\n\nWell, since we saw that shows I wanted to see last time we were in Vegas, I decided to humor her. We caught a matinee on 11\/26 and purchased our tickets last-minute through Tix4Tonight for $67.25 per person, including taxes. We got good seats in the middle--not up front in the V.I.P. section, but not all the way in the back, either. Please note that if the show is fully booked, you may have to share a table with strangers, as we did.\n\nWe all know going in that this show is gonna be hokey, so here's a tip to make the magic more enjoyable: they have a this \"souvenir cup\" that is a big silver goblet emblazoned with the MGM logo on it. The menu says you have a couple of choices of what it can be filled with, but our server said they can put any drink in there. I think it was 24 ounces for $18. You can refill for $12. A gin and tonic that's about 8 ounces is $9, so you do the math. And then you get to be the proud owner of a Harry Potter goblet-sized crunk cup! I forget our server's name, but she was very friendly and was on top of things. \n\nSo once you've entered the state of being where it feels like you've entered a padded room with velvet curtains, Copperfield's jokes, the cheesy video montages, and the tired script are much more enjoyable. There is a lot of audience participation, and he a couple of really cool tricks up his sleeve. I actually ended up liking it a lot more than Penn & Teller we saw last year. If they would cut out some of the video montages and added more of the \"how did he do that?\" tricks, it would be worth paying full price. \n\nFor parents: there are a lot of sexual innuendo jokes that he tells (he dubs a participant \"16 Hour Man\" after he asked how long has it been since he got laid), so if I had to rate this show, it was be PG, but honestly, the jokes flew over the kids' heads. \n\nBottom line: use Tix4Tonight and get the crunk goblet.
