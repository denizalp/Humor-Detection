I really don't like to wait and after reading the reviews, I thought I would just drive by and make sure I didn't want to stop here.  This barbershop is only a 10 minute drive from my house.  I got there at 11 AM on Tuesday and was lucky enough to get right into a chair.  Kevin did an excellent job on my hair and did it in a reasonable time.  (not 45 minutes)  When I left, the place was full with a couple people waiting.  My guess was the wait time was 20 minutes.  If I can get an appointment, I will be back to see Kevin.
