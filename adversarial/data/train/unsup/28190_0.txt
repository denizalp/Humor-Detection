Let me say this.  This show is for young women only.  We were probably the oldest women in the crowd in our 50s early 60s.  The dancers attempt to cater to older women, pulled a couple up on stage and that was good fun to see.  But my friend thought that was staged too, with the older women intentionally placed in the crowd.    The dancing feels very stiff - the pointing to the crowd, the winking. Not really natural choreography.   I will say that us older women like to look at hot young guys too and the Thunder are beautiful. So if you don't mind feeling really old, just go to stare at them.
