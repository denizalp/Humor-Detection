This is a must visit spot for several reasons.\n\nReason #1 It's cheap\n\nReason #2 It's fun\n\nReason #3 Extremely friendly staff\n\nReason #4 It's cheap. (I already said that. Oh well it's worth saying again)\n\nI'm not a fan of Coca cola but I came on yelp and everyone was so excited abut the taste of the world. Well let me jump on the band wagon. The taste of the world was great. It's interesting to try the different drinks from different countries. They also have great portions sizes. It's enough to share a serving with 2 people.\n\nWe also had the Float Variety Platter (which was OH so yummy!) The taste of the world tray offers you 16 different drinks from different countries. There are 8 drinks per tray. Also it's only $7 for the taste tray. The float platter wasn't that bad either. It was $8 for 8 different floats. ( I tasted 3 of them before I blew one out of my back end, which subsequently made my hubby go into a laughing stupor)\n\nWe also were able to take pictures with the Coca cola bear. They (the staff) take pics with your camera and one with theirs. It's was great fun for us at Coca cola World but I must admit, I will take a gas-x pill before I try the float platter again.
