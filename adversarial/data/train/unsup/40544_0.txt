My favorite entree here is the grilled skirt steak ($27).  The steak is so flavorful, mine was cooked perfectly.  The combination of flavors with the corn relish and black beans in that soft, handmade tortilla is just amazing...makes my mouth water just thinking about it :)  It was even better with some of the guacamole that we ordered as a starter.  My husband had the chicken mole, which he said was delicious as well.  Our server was wonderful, she recommended the black cherry mojito and the sparkling white peach lemonade, both of which were amazing!  They even brought us a complimentary dessert for my husband's birthday...the pineapple upside down cake served warm with pineapple ice cream...we devoured this dessert!  \n\nThe only misses that I've had here were during a lunch visit: the Yucatan Pork (mainly because I didn't like the orange flavor in the pork, too sweet for me), and the green corn tamales (also because it was sweeter than I expected).\n\nWe used a restaurant.com gift certificate, which made our dinner fairly reasonable for the strip.  I can't wait to come back for their weekend brunch!
