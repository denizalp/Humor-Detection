It wasn't until recently that there was a decent outlet on the Canadian side. It was always us having to travel past the border to get any sort of deal. So I'm happy to finally see this outlet come out. Not only one but another one opened up by Burlington.\n\nSo my first impression of this outlet is the parking lot is brutal. There are a lot of spaces but due to the popularity it still can get pretty packed. If you have the guts to try and come here during the big ticket shopping days (ie. Boxing Day, Black Friday) then you deserve some sort of bravery award. It's hell during this time but power to you if you do it. But if you do then go at 6 am. \n\nThe shops are like any typical outlet shops but the sales aren't as great as the premium outlets at Woodbury or Grove City. You may be able to get additional discounts if you get an outlet booklet from the info booth at the food court. It's free if you have a CAA\/AAA membership otherwise it'll be $5.\n\nTip: when you leave don't go back on the highway from Trafalgar. Go east and enter the 401 from Winston Churchill. You'll avoid the traffic and line up to turn left on Trafalgar. \n\nOverall, its way better then paying the overage from malls such as Yorkdale or Eaton Centre.
