If I could give zero stars I would.  First off, I have owned a store on W.25 St. for over 3 years and have eaten lots of delicious bakery from Theresa's.  Until today.  The guy that works for me got me a sticky bun.  I usually get their apple fritters because they're out of this world.  I went to take a bite of the sticky bun and it was hard as a rock. I thought it might be softer on the inside so I tore it apart. It was dry and hard all the way through.  So I schlepped it back to the WSM.  I told the girl behind the counter (I was smiling) that the bun was dry and stale. She talked to another girl then gave me my money back.  I asked if they had anymore and was told by the owner (cute young blonde with a pony tail) that I complained so I got my money back and she stomped away.  I really wanted to buy something else but she was such a snot she refused. Then I asked what her name was and she whips around and say can't you see I'm busy you have to wait.  She then told me she was the owner, that I had complained enough, and got my money back and again stomped away. That's it!  I wanted to buy something else. So much for their lame customer service. I did not deserve to be treated like this. She was a complete bitch. And it's vendors like this that ruin the reputation of the WSM selling stale goods to people from the burbs. They get home and discover what they bought was stale, rotten, old whatever. And they're not going to drive all the way back to the WSM to return it. They just won't return to the WSM. I hope this owner feels real good about herself. I have people in my store all the time wanting to know where to go in the WSM, who specializes in what, who sells the best goods.  I will let them all know Theresa's Bakery sucks.
