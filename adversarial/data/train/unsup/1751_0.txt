Short line around 2:30 PM, which really is the best time to go if you want to try both brunch and dinner items, since the switcheroo happens around 3:30 PM.  Also you pay brunch price, which is a little cheaper than dinner.  But then again, you're at the Wynn so being frugal really isn't what it's all about here I guess.  Just take any deal you can get.\n\nI enjoyed a lot of items here, especially their prime rib and their desserts.  Also to recognize is their lamb risotto, which was super creamy.\n\nMy only reservation from giving this place a higher score is that it's rather pricey, and you can honestly get a similar experience paying less going somewhere else.  But maybe that's because I'm not so much of a buffet snob and any buffet is pretty fun for me.
