Well... this was the Hilton. Fyi.....\n\nSo we just checked in. Went up to the room and wanted to give my son a bath.\nHowever, before I could do that I needed to call housekeeping and have them come up and clean the bathroom! !!!!\nHair and dirt in the tub and all over the floor!\nThe bath is old and rusty. The rest of the room  and the hotel is old and run down. \n\nSeeing how they now charge you a resort fee.....( Bull shit if you ask me) ......  They need to clean up their hotel and the rooms!\n\nI will try to attach photos.
