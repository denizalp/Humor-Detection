Local celebrity Yuhi K. recommended Mt. Everest to me and oh boy was she right? Oh yes. I'm a Brit, we know , or think we know, everything about Indian food. We grow up eating the stuff, there are more Indian restaurants in England than Mickey D's. Really! Would I embellish? Maybe but I don't think so in this instance.\n\nAnyway, Friday night and the kids ditched us. Outrageous I know, but gives Wifee and I a rare chance to eat what we want. \"Yuhi K. recommends a place down on Sahara\" I explain. \"Who is Yuhi K.?\" asks my leader. \" She knows about food\" I explain unconvincingly.\n\nIt is a long drive down W.Sahara from my hood and Wifee is viewing my choice with suspicion. \" It will be great\" I proclaim \"be patient\". \n\nMt.Everest sits in front of a slightly rundown strip mall but parking is easy and my expedition was a success.\n\nWe were greeted promptly and offered a table or booth. Booth. The greeter\/server guy seemed to be the owner. He was great. Recommended a great beer, Taj Mahal, 1.5 pints of frothy cold delight, Wifee grabbed a nice cold Chardonnay.\n\nWe started with a mixed dish of samosa, kebab, chicken tikka and some other stuff. Fantastic and more than enough to share.\n\nMains: I had a Mushroom lamb dish, I am asked how spicy I would like. being a big shot expert Indian food eater , I asked for 7\/10. Too hot! I'm such a wimp after many years away from Blighty, Really quite pathetic. I tell my server\/owner\/guy. No problem! He took it away and brought it back re done at a more acceptable spiceness. ( I'm pretty sure that's not a word, sorry). Delicious! Served with rice and a garlic naan. \n\nWifee has Chicken Saag, she ordered 6\/10 on the heat scale. Perfect!\n\nWater was always topped up, drinks were offered frequently. Really great and we are going back. Often. \n\nThanks Yuhi K.!!!!!
