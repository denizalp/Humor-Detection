Airport Parking for $7 a day!\n\nI honestly try to save money when I can so when I am out of town and have to fly out, I try to find the most economical way to park my car. Vegas airport can cost $10-$15 a day and that certainly adds up! I found Fairfield has the Park and Fly for $1 cheaper than the previous place I parked. There are a couple of online sites that will take your parking reservation for Fairfield if you Google it.\n\nIf you plan on parking your car here give yourself a bit of time for checking in and waiting for the shuttle. I think the shuttle leaves for the airport every half-hour. I got to the airport a little after 10pm and waited for the 10:30 shuttle.\n\nComing back is just as simple. Call Fairfield and they will tell you where to meet the shuttle and give you an ETA.\n\nPretty simple people!
