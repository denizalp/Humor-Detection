The rating is actually a 3.5 star rating. I'm in between A-OK and Yay!, I'm a fan.\n\nI found out about Loga's Corner after watching a recent episode of Huang's World featuring Toronto. Parkdale is home to many Tibetans and is also known as Little Tibet in Toronto. With that being said many Tibetan restaurants and mom and pop shops have opened in Parkdale including Loga's Corner which is located in the heart of Parkdale. Loga's Corner is a mom and pops restaurant that specializes in Momos which is essentially a Tibetan dumpling that comes steamed or deep fried.\n\nWe came on a Saturday afternoon and ordered 10 steamed beef momos ($7 tax included) and 10 beef deep fried momos ($8 tax included). You place your order in the front and seat yourself and when the order is ready, they bring the food to your table. Tibetans dumplings are different than your traditional Chinese dumplings, the skin is a lot thicker, a more heavier seasoning and a musky taste but in a very good way. The steamed momos were okay but the deep fried momos were fantastic, perfectly fried and when you bite into it, the juices explode into your mouth. The accompanying hot sauce was also very delicious.\n\nWhen we were there on a recent Saturday afternoon it wasn't too busy but they do seem to do a lot of takeout business. The place was pretty clean and the staff and owner are really friendly. I definitely recommend Loga's Corner if you want to try traditional Tibetan dumplings and the prices are dirt cheap, the prices on the chalkboard include tax.
