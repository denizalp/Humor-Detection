I read the previous reviews. Although I come here for breakfast mostly, I believe the ice cream machine story. I have to tell you that the food will always be the same. I found the young man taking orders polite and courteous under the circumstances. Yes, it would be nice to have more people taking orders. Yes, it would be great to have more cooks. \n\nDid this location deserve my five stars? The minute the young man served me my coffee and thanked me for my patience it did. That young man was me twenty-some years ago.
