The biscuits smothered in honey...order them first and IMMEDIATELY!! I ate 3 and went to heaven  The wings were big plump & juicy..amazing flavors btw. We tried honey BBQ, honey habanero, and chefs choice.. Ohmgawdddd, heaven I tell you!!! \n\nWINGSTOP  is complete TRASH  next to this amazing gem. It's probably going to be crowded as hell, but you will live and be happy you waited & don't forget the biscuits!!!!!
