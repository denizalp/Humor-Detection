This was my 3rd visit to this location. The previous 2 visits were very satisfactory. This last time, however, you guys were really off your game. My ham sandwich on kaiser roll was half empty! Half the meat, no condiments to speak of(???) and the roll was turning stale. The manager(s) need to concentrate on re-training and quality control.
