We drove around the block a couple times before we figured out where to park and where it was, but it was worth it.\n\nThe place was packed when we got there but we got our name in and were able to walk around the area for 20 minutes until we had a table ready.\n\nWe started off with the pork belly buns which I've been dying to try.  They were everything I hoped for!  The pillowy soft buns were evenly textured and delightfully fluffy.  The pork was full of flavor and juiciness, with burnt, crispy edges adding to the flavor and balancing it's tenderness.  Cabbage added a nice crunch and took off some of the heat from the sauce.\n\nWe split the Miso Hungry ramen (which is really not that easy to 'split' without making a mess).  The broth was flavorful but not too strong, allowing flavors from the other ingredients to really shine through.  I loved the sweet corn in there.  Gotta say the pork belly in this one was pretty skimpy.  In fact, I think all the additional ingredients were scant and wish there were more, but even when they are all gone the noodles are able to hold their own.\n\nWe finished with the soft serve, and got a twist of their two flavors of the night: Mango and Strawberry Banana.  I loved the presentation in the small cup with wooden spoons - reminiscent of Momofuku Milk Bar's soft serve! The soft serve was refreshing and light, but the flavors were very muted.  Couldn't really taste the banana, and the other flavors were also bland.  I was hoping to try the green tea flavor, but it wasn't available that day.  \n\nTLDR:  Get any ramen dish and the pork belly buns and you will be pleased.
