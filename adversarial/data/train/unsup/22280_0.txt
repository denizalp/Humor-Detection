Located near Hwy 7 and Pine Valley on Whitmore, The Hot Pepper or Peperoncino definitely brings the heat when it comes to home cooked Italian eats - Mamma Mia!!\n\nEverything fresh and made to order, how could you ever go wrong, especially with a giant wood burning pizza oven in the back. I was trying to be healthy last week when I paid them a visit, I really was.\n\nI went in there saying to myself \"Ok, Kris, you're gonna get a soup, a salad and a protein and then you are leaving... leaving! Don't you dare look at the pizza or pasta. You'll hate yourself later you know you will!!!\"\n\n....but then my other side, let's call him Fat Evil Kris, goaded me and said \"Hey, a soup is fine, but CAM'AN, you can have a little pizza, who would know, I won't tell. And besides look at that little Italian lady making the dough with her bare hands - do you want to hurt her feelings? Go on, have a pizza, you know you wannnnt it\"\n\nThat damn Fat Evil Kris, always gets the better of me - bastard. I had my straccitella (egg drop) soup, yeah it was massive, and delicious and so hot that I burned my mouth, SO WHAT. It was amazing and I ate every bite - ya wanna fight about it?\n\nAnd then, Yeah, I had a pizza. Not a slice, or a small. I whole GODDAMN Calabrese pizza, with gorgonzola cheese, roasted red peppers and soprasatta (think long slice of hot salami)! And THEN I doused the whole thing in their home made red hot spicy peppers in OIL! It burned, I ate it all, SO WHAT? You wanna fight about it!?!?!?\n\nOK so maybe I've got a little Hot Pepper in me, since a visit here seemed to bring about an internal battle between good and evil (evil winning) and a little bit of attitude to boot, but it was just so good!\n\nMy ONLY gripe (and likely made worse by how hungry I was) was the speed of service. Three tables and myself dining at lunch and my lunch took nearly 90 minutes from order to bill payment. No problem for a Friday\/Saturday night but no bueno for a workday at lunch.\n\nOverall, a good meal, and amazing lunch specials if you're looking for a good deal on a ton of food!\n\nEatcrest Out! You wanna fight about it?!?!?!?!?!
