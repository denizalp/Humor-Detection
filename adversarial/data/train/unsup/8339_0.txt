You can always stay here, maybe not as nice as some of the hotel review I wrote about, but it's cheap and nearly free. It's a central location to everything, from monorail, to all the casino's on the strip. \n\nIt wasn't my choice to stay here but my friends got us to stay here nearly free. When I arrived, I was mad because I got rip off from the cab driver who charged me $28 from the airport to the hotel. I was told I should ask him not to take the freeway route. Besides that, the cabbie also gets a 30% cut of the fare. Just so you know, they also make 70,000 a year. This douchebag also makes about 70,000 a year, so next time you see a cabbie last named wildman, don't tip him!\n\nI check in my luggage and guess what, they took over an hour just to get it. They comp us a room night which was nice. I always have problems with bellman, they misplaced my shoe last time I was at the Hotel. \n\nThey got a cool restaurant named Toby Keith's, the country singer who all the girls love. Anyway, they have the best chicken wings we thought in Vegas, because just about everywhere we ate, the guys had some chicken. We thought therefore we can. BTW, order bqq chicken when you're on a date here, it's great. ( sat right next to someone who did, we didn't bother to tell him he has sauce all over his face ) We bought some girls drinks for the birthday, we saw some country music play some johnny cash. \n\nOverall, you can't go wrong! I won $413.63 on the nickel slots here, it was fantastic! It wasn't so when I lost some back. Oh well, it was fun! Craps, Roulette, blackjack, poker, slots, wheel of fortune, deal or no deal, and monopoly were quite the game we played here. \n\nBe warned, don't touch the mini bar, don't call a stripper over to the room, and you have to wait a long time for towels.\n\nFYI, the garage bucket is great way to store ice. Buy alcohol at the store is better than paying for drinks. \n\nIs $35 for a mid-size Jack Daniels right?
