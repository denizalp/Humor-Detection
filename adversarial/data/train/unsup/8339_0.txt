I love this wedding venue!! The Lucky Little Chapel is a super beautiful wedding chapel right near the courthouse in Las Vegas. The staff was so friendly--they seemed really into giving their clients a beautiful wedding experience!! I live in Las Vegas and like to stay on top of good places to refer to frequent guests. I am recommending the Lucky Little Chapel to all my friends who want a Las Vegas destination wedding or vow renewal that is romantic, beautiful and reasonably priced.
