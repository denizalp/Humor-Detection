When I went to go get winter tires from this place this past winter, they were very helpful in answering questions and quick with the tire change. \n\nAt the end of the winter, I went back to get my snow tires taken off. My appointment was on a Saturday morning at 10:00 AM. I arrived at 10:00 AM and waited until 10:45 AM until someone showed up nad opened the shop. No one apologized or made any attempt to rectify the fact that I had waited 45 minutes for them when I had an appointment. \n\nWould not recommend this place - there are far more professional shops out there.
