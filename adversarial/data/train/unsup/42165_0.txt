Made a appointment with Eric to come do some work at my home. On the day he was supposed to come I waited 2 hours then called him. When I asked if I was on the schedule his reply was \" Oh, Mike must have forgot to call you. We're not coming , we had a truck break down and we're to busy!\" Very unprofessional , they must not need the work!! I will be sure to never recommend them.
