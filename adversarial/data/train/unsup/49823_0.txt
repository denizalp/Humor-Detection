An adorable little place just off the strip.  I think it's a bargin compared to some of the other places we ate...about $25 for en entire meal (salad, bread, pasta, wine) w\/generous portions.  The food was good, but nothing fancy.   I liked the little accordion player, and the service was decent.  It was a nice change of pace from the strip.  I definitely recommend it.  We actually went twice in the same week.
