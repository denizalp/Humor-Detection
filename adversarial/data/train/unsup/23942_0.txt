I purchased a \"large\" ice coffee and some sort of grit meal.  No complaints everything tasted pretty good . \n\n I signed my bill and was thinking it was high but didn't think too much of it. I then got my \"large\" ice coffee and it was a small medium at best. I then drank it pretty fast and wanted a top off and she made me pay again.  That's when I realized that the ice coffee was $4.60.  I paid $9.20 cents for no more than 12OZ of coffee!  That has to be at least a 3000% margin!! That is completely insane and leaves a horrible taste in my mouth even though the coffee is pretty good. \n\nNot going back.
