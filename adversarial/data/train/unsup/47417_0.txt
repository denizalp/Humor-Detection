The breakfast selection at the Buffet was pretty delicious, but the dinner selection was pretty standard. The line to eat was insane & we would have opted out if we weren't mLife members. The price was too expensive in my opinion, mainly because I never get my money's worth at buffets. Overall, it wasn't a bad choice. Though, I would venture away from the strip and support some local small businesses in Vegas. I found some gems out there that were cheap.
