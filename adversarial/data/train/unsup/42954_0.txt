A MUST!! if you visit Vegas!! You definitely SHOULD see this at least once or even a few times!! I saw it like 5 times and never got bored of it!! It's truly magical, outstanding, jaw-dropping. The fountains are truly AMAZING and they are well-choreographed for the song\/music they are playing. When I was there, they played Elton John's Your Song as well as the national anthem of U.S.A \"Star Spangled Banner\". Sweeeeeet~~!!\n\nLike others have mentioned, it's definitely very romantic spot to be with that special 'person' and watch the magic that the fountains perform. It might also be the perfect spot to propose to your one and only!! Just make sure the song they are playing is a romantic one and sets the mood!! =)
