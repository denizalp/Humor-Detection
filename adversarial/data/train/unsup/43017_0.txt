While staying at the Hard Rock hotel, my friends and i decided a trip here was necessary. Our waiter, John, was awesome! I split the Mac n cheese with my friend and it was super good. Having been to a couple of other Hard Rock Cafe's, I was a little disappointed with this one, it just didn't seem as extravagant.
