This unassuming neighborhood Italian restaurant provides fresh fantastic standards with delivery. My favorite the Chicken Parmesan is one of the best. My wife swears by their sandwiches and pasta with meatballs. The boys and I plow through  pizza pies on a regular basis. Fun, friendly and great family feel. I highly recommend anything off the menu!!! Thanks Lucky's!!!!\n\nYour friends in 2241!
