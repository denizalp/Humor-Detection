We had the Crab Puffs to start and I ordered Evil Jungle Princess (medium spicy) and it was super delicious - creamy and full of aromatics. My parents got the Crab Fried Rice and Chicken Pad Thai and were happy with their meals as well. We enjoyed the fast, friendly service, reasonable prices, and the portions are huge so I was able to take half home for tomorrow's lunch!
