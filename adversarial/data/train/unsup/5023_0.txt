\"Poop\"ovich.. more like it. This was a disappointing show. Not only was the production a sleeper, the theater had a creepy, low budget feel to it. Coupled with a really strange cast of what appeared to be a bunch of drunken Russian men barely able to contain a lot of hungry stray cats. I think their 'saving animals from the shelter story' holds no water. Even if its true, these poor animals are forced into slavery, I'm ashamed I even paid to support it.\n\nAnd if that's not enough, we were also duped into 'upgrading our tickets' for $10 more per ticket. The box office guy is a trained conman stating that 'without the upgrade our seating would begin at the 14th row...' Meanwhile there's only 11 rows total in their shady ass theater. Ugh. Bad entertainment choice and shame on the  V Theater employees.
