When I heard the concept of a 24 hr sandwich place, I should have trusted my instincts. This felt like quality control would be loosened in favour of keeping the line moving. How on earth can you keep the momentum going around the clock? Emptying the deep fryer, cleaning the panini press, these are all realities you must deal with when promoting a brand of \"fresh\" and \"quality\" sandwiches.  i was worried it would be like running on empty ala  the new improved Sammy Maudlin show skit from SCTV\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7WHd5qG_iZ4\n\nMy suspicions were confirmed. The grilled vegetables were served on a greasy oily bread and the lack of flavourful marinade on the veggies felt like I was being chastised for trying to order something remotely healthy. \n\nBut that was nothing compared to the 3 cheese salad.  Perhaps the most cynical concoction. This literally felt like a pile of sliced apples and mountains  of grated cheese. I now understand what being  hatefucked with salad feels like. \n\nI'll probably give it another shot and hopefully bump it up a star or two but dudes, get it together, man!
