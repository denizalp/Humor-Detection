This restaurant is located in the Hawaiian Marketplace.  Indoor & outdoor seating.  I went to use the bathroom & as I approached the restaurant, a guy blared out \"Drake's Baby Momma\" on an intercom.  Lol where did that come from?!  I fell in line with my girlfriends & found out that they call your order by nickname.  Haha!  Better start thinking of a clever nickname!\n\nTamago aka \"Egg\" Burger = Furikake, teriyaki & wasabi mayo, crispy onion strings, & a fried egg - De-licious!  The patty was thick & juicy, the bun was toasted & buttery, & all the fixings were great!
