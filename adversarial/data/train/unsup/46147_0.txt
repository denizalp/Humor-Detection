Overall - 3.0\/5.0\n\nNewly opened Japanese quick serve restaurant owned by Chinese folks. Seating is limited as it is more of a takeout joint. You essentially order at the counter and they will bring you a tray with your food. \n\nThe Good:\n- Extensive menu with very reasonable prices.\n- Chirashidon has a decent selection of sashimi. \n- Dragon roll was well prepared with clean knife work.\n\nThe Bad:\n- According to their definition of a quick serve concept, it meant that there would not be any hot tea or water served. Water and soft drinks are available at additional cost. I would recommend them to at least have a self serve hot tea \/ water station for a better customer experience.\n- Sushi rice lacked vinegar flavour across the board and also came out a bit dry for the Chirashidon.\n- Skip the uni if you're used to eating the good stuff as the ones here are quite fishy and pungent.\n\nFeel free to give this place a try if you are in the area and looking to grab a quick bite or takeout to satisfy your cravings without breaking the bank.
