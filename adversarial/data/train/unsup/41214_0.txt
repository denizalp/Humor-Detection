Ah. Margaritaville. It's always a staple in my vegas trips. Is it because of their awesome margaritas or greasy American fare? \n\nNope. It's just so unbelievably cheesy and touristy I cant resist. \n\nI always go for the volcano nachos. They are enough to fill up four people. Just make sure you get the chilli on the side and no fake cheese-add real cheese. Unless you're into soggy chips and processed cheese. \n\nYou can't not get a margarita here... I tend to go for their classic as the other ones are pretty sugar laden. But hey we weren't coming here on a diet.\n\nThe best part about this place is every hour \"Margaritaville\" plays. You can see the staff cringe every time-the song probably haunts their sleep. It kind of has a rainforest cafe show too where the volcano goes off. It's always a good time!
