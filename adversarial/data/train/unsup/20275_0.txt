Ajo Al's on 90th Street has been our choice for Mexican food for years.   We've never had a bad or mediocre meal there and have tried a lot of different items from the menu.  Staff is friendly and all do a great job.\n\nFor those who think the food should be spicier, that can be arranged simply by requesting it.  I have trouble with really spicy food, so appreciate that a lot of the dishes have some heat, but nothing overpowering.  My husband, on the other hand, often asks that something be prepared \"muy picante\" and they are happy to oblige.\n\nSeems silly to complain about something they are so willing to adjust to suit the customers' tastes.
