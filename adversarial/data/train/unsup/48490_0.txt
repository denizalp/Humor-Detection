I went in for a pedicure and I'm so happy I did. This place is lovely, clean and organized. The chairs were super comfortable and everyone was so friendly\n\nI opted for the deluxe pedicure and it was worth it. Lots of nail colors to choose from both regular nail polish and gel.\n\nBrian did my pedicure and he was awesome. I was relaxed and felt very pampered.\n\nHighly recommend this salon, I will be a repeat customer!
