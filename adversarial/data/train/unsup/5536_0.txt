2.5 Stars\n\nQuick Review: OK food, not so OK prices.\n\nAm I the only one that does not think this place is amazing? I'm not sure if it was just me, but i found the menu to be too eclectic for my liking.  I guess I'm just not a fancy restaurant kind of guy.\n\nI found the portions small, and the prices too high to justify.  Maybe its the \"we try to use local and organic\" spiel.  I'm not into organic.  I'm into local because it should be tastier, fresher, and sometimes cheaper.\n\nI'm not so into the service either.\n\ndiner 1: I'll have the prix fixe ....\ndiner 2: I'll have the prix fixe ....\ndiner 3: I'll have the prix fixe ....\ndiner 4: I'll have the pork tenderloin ....\ndiner 5: I'll have the prix fixe ....\nwaitress: wait, if none of you order the super fresh grilled fish [that I already told you about 3 times already] it would be tragic. let me get it and show it to you.\nwaitress: look how beautiful this fish is. and we grill it [on a magical grill that makes it taste better than any fish you will ever eat in your whole life]\ndiner 6: OK, i'll have the fish \ndiner 5: OK, i'll have the fish also\ndiner 4: I want the fish too, but can i have it with a simple tomato sauce on it?\nwaitress: well, what i would suggest is you get the fish grilled, and then order a small portion of the plain pasta. so you can have your fish and your sauce.\ndiner 4: but i don't want pasta\nwaitress: WELL, we can't just INVENT a new dish just for you SIR.\ndiner 4: ok, I'll just have pork tenderloin\n\nHow is putting a simple tomato sauce (presumably the same spaghetti sauce that goes onto the pasta) onto some grilled fish inventing a new dish? If that is invention, I have a boat load of inventions to sell you ma'am.\n\n\nWould i go back here?\nOnly if its on someone else's dime.
