Prepare to wait.  And wait.  And wait.  And wait..\n\nI have ventured in here on three different occasions, each at a different time of the day and week.  In each case, the place was busy and I was told the exact same thing - \"The wait for a table is an hour.\"\n\nWith a place that normally has an hour wait, you think they would take reservations or hold a table.  Nope.\n\nAnd so, I've given this place three chances.  I won't give it any more.  I don't care how good, or different, their food might be.  I do care that I can get seated in less than an hour, at least one out of three times.\n\nMelt can freeze over for all I care.
