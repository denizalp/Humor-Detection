Little Luxuries is an ADHD person's worst nightmare. \n\nAnd I say this with the best of intentions. \n\nCOLORS! \n\nSHAPES!\n\nTHINGS!\n\nThere's so much to look at, so much to see, and luckily it's organized really well into sections with like items that make sense. (Can you imagine if everything was haphazardly placed? You'd probably find me rocking in a corner muttering something to myself on repeat overwhelmed with the sheer volume of options.) But not the case! Every time I've been things are easy to navigate. And it's a blast just to scroll through their current inventory without any agenda. I've found so many quirky gifts for so many people in my life. Among my faves are the books and journals. They carry (and hope they do forever) a journal titled \"Listography.\" It's such an off the wall way of putting pen to paper and making zany lists about anything and everything. There are writing prompts on ever page a la the SAT, just much more fun and perfect for someone with a creative mind meant for doodling ideas. If you have no idea where to start ask for help. They know their stock well and can make strong recommendations based on feedback from you. Gift wrapping is an extra nice touch and always much better than I would do. \n\nSo yeah, while at first glance it can look a little schizophrenic, I promise there's order to the madness. Delightfully locally owned and operated order.
