I've been a diner at Island's for a very long time and they have never failed me. You always know what to expect when you walk in the door. I love a restaurant that can be so consistent for so long! \n\nSome of my favorite dishes include their burger (always a good choice), their quesadilla, the tortilla soup (my favorite!!), the cheese fries or plain fries, the chicken tenders, their Shorebird sandwich (LOVE), their BLT, and their Yaki Tacos. \n\nAs you can see I've tried a lot of their menu options and have enjoyed them all. Island's is a reliable, yummy restaurant that the whole family can enjoy. I will always be a customer!!
