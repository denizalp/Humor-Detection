When I first came here for my eye exam, everything went well. They were quick and very organized. The Optometrist is very sweet and explained a lot in detail-reason for the extra star.\n\nBut I must say the whole getting glasses part is a mess.\nCame in this past Tuesday to pick out a frame. Very easy to do. They told me that it'll be ready for pick up in the morning.\n\nNext morning: I come in to pick up my glasses. Glasses are great but they did not add the anti glare that I paid extra for. So they told me to come back the next morning again!\n\nNow I'm back here in the office again: I came right after I got the automated text and email that my glasses were ready. Of course they can't find my glasses. Then when they do find it, it again does not have anti glare on it!!! They asked if I could wait an additional 30 minutes so they could do it now. which I'm not able to because I have to go to work. \n\nSo I'm guessing it'll take me a total of  4 visits to get a pair of glasses. And a total of 80 minutes of waiting. I just took my glasses without the anti-glare and left. They can keep my money\n\nThe guy before me was also complaining about because he received an automated messages when his glasses were ready for pick up but only 1 out of 2 glasses were ready when he got there. And  So I don't know if this is a common issue for them.
