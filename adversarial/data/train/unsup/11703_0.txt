It's a pain in the ass to get to (as is everything on the strip) but it's worth the hike for locals cause this place has the coolest local bartenders and supports local music! Plus it's a great place to see a show cause, contrary to the convenience factor of getting there, its on the strip! Tip: park at Monte Carlo for free and walk over to avoid parking fees in the garage connected to it ;) And try the breakfast quesadilla, its magically delicious
