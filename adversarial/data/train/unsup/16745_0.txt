Just wanted to give an update to a place that very much deserves it.  Went to Midtown last Sunday for the who knows how many-eth time (at least 40\/50 by now) and as always had a fantastic experience.\n\nThe servers and bartenders are warm and friendly, always making sure your needs are met, smiles on their faces, and being sure that you won't leave without a pleasant occasion.  It's places like this should make every other place around re-evaluate themselves.  The food is consistently good and well-priced, the menu has variety and some change but also is not overwhelming, and the little things mentioned in my previous review are all still present.\n\nI initially gave them 4 stars because they're not a fancy place so they might not suit every occasion, but after going so many times in the last few years I realized that was pretty silly.  Who cares what the occasion is, Mid Town rocks and it should be #1 on your short list if you haven't been.  It makes you feel at home, and that's what I want when I go out to eat.\n\nBravo Mid Town.  Keep Killin' It.
