I like this Goodwill location. Granted, that's because I haven't been stalked by a creepy Lil Wayne lookalike creeper and I don't buy used furniture that's doubled as the family's toilet. Well, no, that's not just it. I found some really nice clothing items here- like a large selection of designer jeans for $8 (normally) or $4 on 50% off Saturdays. I've scored really cool sailor-ish designer jeans for $1 not once, but twice. I have a major thing for collared shirts and found several nice Loft button up collared blouses that are just the nerdy bee's knees.\n\nI think the best thing here has been all the awesome records I found. I doubt they're collectors items, although it's possible to find some good collectable ones, I just haven't found any. I just like listening to records and found a lot of 70s singer\/songwriters like Nielson, Carole King, Kenny Loggins, and Carly Simon.\n\nUsually when I go here, the records rack would be pretty much wiped out. I think record fanatics know about this location and clean it out before regular people like me can get out of work or school to contend with. Still, sometimes I get lucky.
