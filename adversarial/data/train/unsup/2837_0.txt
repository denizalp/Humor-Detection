This was a very rare experience at an airport bar\/restaurant. Great food and even better were the 2 bartenders, Stacy and Ginger. I've been to so many places in airports and have never had a better time. Fun conversation started with those 2 and everyone else at the bar just having a good time. The only thing that sucks is that I can't frequent this place unless I'm traveling. Not sure how important these reviews are to the upper management, but KEEP THESE 2. Thanks for a really fun experience when I was expecting the usually grumpy airport employee.
