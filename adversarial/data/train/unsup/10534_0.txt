After service is a real real pain. The service staff sitting in Toronto is very rude. If you are talking to Carmen, watch out. You better prepare yourself for some legal crackdown with this person. I bought an expensive dining table set from Arrow and we found a crack running right through one of the extension leafs on the table. After 3 weeks of following up with them, finally they sent someone to look into it. The guy took some photos and said they would get back in a week or two. It was more than a month and nobody called. I had to follow up and then they accepted that they have to repair it. Fair enough!! They took the whole table leaf ( they left the legs) saying that they have to colour match it. \n\nWhen the table came back after 3 weeks, the colour of the table was totally changed!! Initially when I bought it was a double color table and now there was this deep maroon color which looked absolutely awful. More than that was the fact that the table was not stained but baked and caked. It was like somebody went with a paint brush and painted the whole table. \n\nI called Arrow right away and told them and they asked me to send me photos. I sent them the photos and at the same time, I went to Arrow Furniture in Brampton and spoke to the manager there. I actually carried a leaf all the way from my house to the store and showed him the piece and he was shocked!!! He said he will put in a word to the service dept.\n\nA week later Carmen called me up and said that the repair is according to the standards!! What crap!!! I am planning to go legal on these guys on the consumer court. I will try one last time with the manager at Brampton and if he doesnt help me out of this, I am planning to send the pictures over to all the newspapers in a day or two. Being in newspaper retailing helps a lot!!
