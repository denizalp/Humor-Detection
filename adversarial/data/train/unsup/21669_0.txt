I was never a big fan of escape rooms, but Omescape is definitely a fun one to visit.\n\nPlease reserve your room early on from their website: www.omescape.ca because it's fairly hard to get a spot there on the scene. All of the rooms give you 60 minutes to escape, and range from 3\/5 difficulty to 5\/5 difficulty. They have different groups of people required for each rooms as well, from 3 to 10 players. Currently, prices are $28.20 per person, with a $3 discount if you post on Facebook - so definitely pretty pricey. If you add $5 on top of this, you get to stay for unlimited boardgame playing and a free yogurt\/small sized premium drink for this.\n\nOmescape has Presotea located right inside it, definitely a nice place to get bubbletea afterwards as well. \n\nYou can most definitely spend the entire day here - the only question is, would you?\n\nThey have multiple rooms to unlock for this omescape, and a cute story line. For someone who's petrified of mysteries and unknown things, we got the kingdom of cats, which was super duper cute.\n\nThey also provide you with a walkie talkie to help you answer the questions - but if you ask for hints, you won't be able to go on their wall of fame.
