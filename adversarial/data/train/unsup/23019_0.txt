Okay I walked in and was pretty confused about what to do, this being my first time at a Jason's Deli. Thank god I my friend had been there before and directed me to the small cashier booth near the back of the place so we could place our orders. There's a pretty diverse choice of sandwiches, soups, and salads here. Also there's free soft serve ice cream. Who doesn't love free ice cream?!\n\nOur orders came out fast, but I asked for no tomatoes and ended up picking them out of my sandwich. Also when I order a sandwich toasted I kind of expect the inside to not be cold. It kind of throws off the whole texture for me, you know? That being said their sandwiches are huge! It was almost too much meat stuffed into the slices of bread, because I had to take bites from each side so that it wouldn't slip out.\n\nThe ambiance I would describe as noisy, and corporate. That's not really an issue though when you are just grabbing a quick bite before heading to a party as I was doing, but for sitting down and enjoying the surroundings I'd recommend somewhere else.
