CHAR just came through on exactly what the are trying to do - quick, quality, tasty pizza. A little more expensive than a pizza from a national chain, but faster, and cheaper than your typical gourmet restaurant. \n\nI think the unexpected highlight for me was the dough, which I have probably only said about 1 other pizza place.  I prefer a thinner crust, but not cracker crisp - a pop and then chewy - thin, but firm enough to hold up the slice.  Nailed it, with fresh-baked dough, and a great dough\/topping ratio.\n\nWe got a white pizza and a meat pizza - different flavor profiles, both delicious, with great toppings and balance of ingredients. Probably closest in size to a typical medium, but a little smaller - we had 2 slices leftover each, a younger me would have finished off the whole thing easily. CHAR will be visited again!
