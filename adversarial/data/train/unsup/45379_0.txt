Well, this is my first review on a string of reviews for my recent trip to Vegas. I ate at the Grand Buffet for dinner on June 28, 2007. Got there around 7:00 PM and there was no line. Got to the table within 3 minutes after paying. To me, the price for dinner was too high. I think it was $25 per person? But my dad did have a $25 dining credit, so it was 1 free, so we gave this place a shot. I loaded up on prime rib, hot and cold split Alaskan king crab legs, and peel and eat shrimp. The prime rib was good, but a little too dry. The shrimp was good and the crab was good, although on my 3rd plate, the crab meat was dry (a disadvantage when it comes to split legs). And this buffet has a memorable mashed potato cake bar where they take a mashed potato cake and add sundried tomatoes, green onions, mushrooms, cheese, broccoli, and\/or bacon to it. It was so great, I had 3 of those. I regrettably avoided most of their other foods because I knew that $25 had to be put to good use and the crab legs and the shrimp and prime rib did the job. The dessert bar was small, although had a good selection. I had chocolate mousse that was great, an Oreo cheesecake that was creamy, and vanilla ice cream (Yes, that was too much sugar). \n\nOur waiter was always there to refill our drinks and gave us extra mints in the end. We tipped him well.\n\nOverall, the food was good, BUT I would think it's worth it to spend an extra buck or two at the Bellagio dinner buffet, although the Bellagio doesn't have that great mashed potato cake, but hey, what can you do?
