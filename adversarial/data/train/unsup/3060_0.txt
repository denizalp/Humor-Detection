At first I thought ewww...chicken and waffles? I never tried it but somehow I was already being judgmental. Maybe because I'm usually not a fan of sweet and savory combo. But this....this place! Holy...I ordered the \"ODB\" boneless chicken and waffles and it was crazily delicious. The waffle itself was fluffy and the sauce on the boneless chicken was a triple threat It was sweet, sour, and spicy all in the same bite. The various textures when eating into it too was awesome (soft\/crispy etc)\n\nOkay. I love chicken and waffles now.\n\n I would also recommend coming to this location as I would assume the Kensington one gets pretty jammed. This place had plenty of seating area and barely any waiting time.
