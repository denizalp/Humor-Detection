Definitely not worth the price $55 or the wait time.\n\nI thought for sure, it would exceed Wicked Spoon but it just didn't.  They do offer  more food, but you definitely feel like you are in a mess hall - everyone just waiting to get some grub.  It was a bit ridiculous, waiting to get seated which can easily take over 1 hour, and then once you are inside, you are waiting in a long assembly line to get some food on your plate.\n\nNothing stood out here at all, other than the jasmine chicken soup, which stayed piping hot.  Unfortunately, that was the only highlight for me.  Don't get me wrong, everything was good and there was plenty of variety, but I didn't feel like the price was justified.  I probably wouldn't choose to come here again.
