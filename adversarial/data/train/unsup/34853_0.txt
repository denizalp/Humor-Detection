Usually not a fan of sushi but it's went with some friends for a bday and I was pleasantly surprised. \"I actually like Sushi\". The cucumber lollipop rolls are my new favorite dish. Filling and super healthy. No rice are in the rolls, instead they are wrapped in cucumber. It's served cold and if a refreshing treat. Highly recommend them!
