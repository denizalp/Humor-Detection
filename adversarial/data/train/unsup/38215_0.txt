Decent service, mediocre prices (typical of Scottsdale), great vibe\/kitsch decor, and THE BEST FREAKING NACHOS I'VE EVER TASTED! Whoever thought of putting brussel sprouts on nachos is one creative, twisted, brilliant mind. The only negative thing I have to say about our visit was that the margarita I had was either extremely watered down, or the bartender forgot to add the tequila. Next time I'll stick with a bottle of Corona. That being said, the nachos guarantee that there will indeed be a next time.
