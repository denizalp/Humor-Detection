I've never given a review this bad.  If I could give less that one star I would.  I feel it is my personal obligation to warn people about this business.  Here is my story.\n\nI called to get a quote for new spring bushings in my 2004 f-350.  Skip asked me to come in so he could look at the trucks bushings to make the determination on size.  After work one evening two weeks ago I went to see him.  I have Fabtech aftermarket 8\" lift springs and he wasn't sure he knew the correct size?  I should have been concerned then, cause I came to his shop for this exact same serve 4 years earlier.  Same truck, same spring bushings.  He even has the same truck in the parking lot as his personal vehicle??? He doesn't keep records and doesn't use a computer... Sorda brags about not being up to speed when it comes to technology. Yep, that generation...\n\nHe told me he had the bushings in stock, but suggested I get some new sway bar end links.  As the old sway bar bushings were worn out, I said that sounded like a good idea.  he said he would have to order them and he would call me.  He gave me an estimate of around $250.00 for parts labor and service, but he would know more after he had the job complete.  \n\nI called him early the next day to let him know I decided to go a different direction with my repairs and to thank him for his time.  He informed me that he already had the sway bar end links at his shop and he could not return them.  I asked him how he got them so fast, because he told me the previous evening around 4:30pm that he would have to order them and that they would take \"a while\" to get in.  He just changed the subject and got defensive.  I also found out that he already billed my credit card for the full amount, not for just the parts like he said.  Even though I suspect he had the parts all along.  \n\nI asked for a refund and to credit back the $250.00 fee to my credit card.  He said 'NO'.  He wouldn't do that.  I asked what he suggested and he said I could come pick up my parts and have someone else do the work.  He said the parts are now $250.00.  He tried to explain that he had fixed cost in procuring the parts???  I said, \"you mean the parts you had in stock?\"\n\nHe then told me there would be at the very least a restocking fee for the sway bar end links and the bushings and maybe he could issue a small refund.  But first he would have to deduct out credit card fees and expenses.  That would negate out the entire $250.00 fee.  \n\nHe later suggested I could come get the parts for $250.00 with no labor and the job incomplete.   \n\nI googled fabtech sway bar endlinks and found several shops in las vegas that sell them for $44.99 a set.  Skip charged me $250.00.  \n\nNo service ever took place.  I was told I would be contacted by this repair company after the 4th of July holiday weekend to schedule an appointment for services previously discussed.  I never did receive a call from them to schedule an appointment.  I do not intend for this shop to repair my vehicle.  They had no authority to bill my card.  \n\nPlease be warned.\n\nF-350
