I had terrible customer service at this location yesterday. My daughter wanted to by a bra that had a sign with a picture of the same bra and it said $29.99. When we went to pay the bra rang up twice the price and when we showed the sign to the clerk she took it down and said it should have been taken down a while ago and that we couldn't have that price. She then tried to say it wasn't for that bra even though it is the exact one in the picture. She said the description is for a different one that isn't the picture. That didn't even make sense. We left with nothing after being told we had to pay a different price then was clearly advertised.
