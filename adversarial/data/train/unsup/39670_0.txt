So cool to get to grab two seats at the bar here! We LOVED the Pepperoni Pretzel Sticks with Cheese! But the Macornoni burger to split as a follow up was too much food, yet delicious! The Blackberry Marg was way too sweet for me, if you like traditional cocktails go for the Bloody Mary here... it has an entire array of spicy vegetables and fruits attached... SO GOOD! Great beer selection as well. Worth a stop in Vegas for the prices people, you should probably make a plan to stop by and be ready to wait for a table or get aggressive at the bar :)
