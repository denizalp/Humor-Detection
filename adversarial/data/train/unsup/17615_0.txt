Last week, Kay wanted to come here to support a friend who was selling prints of her photographs, and I was reluctant since I figured nothing here would appeal to me.\n\nThat was until I came across an early X-Mas gift for myself in some locally made \"shaving mud\" that came in a tin cup and with a shaving brush. And the woman who made it was in attendance, tutoring me on it and explaining it herself. \n\nAs Kay stated in her review, this is a very local art co-op where you can not only buy but sell if you like to create things. Think of it as Etsy with a storefront or imagine if South Side's Culture Shop only sold items that were made within the city AND from repurposed materials. When I realized that the bracelets I saw were constructed from old typewriter keys, I began to fully appreciate what Boutique was doing even if I'm not well-versed in the hobby of arts and crafts. However, in addition to what I already mentioned, I also glimpsed other potential trinkets one could bestow onto friends, family, lovers such as...\n\nNecklaces made from broken plates.\n\nCuff links and tie clips recycled from used bike chains. \n\nNotepads with covers taken from boxtops. \n\nPieces of rulers and yardsticks turned into keychains. \n\nAnd of course lithographs, apparel, and oodles of Pittsburgh-centric gifts that will crack a curmudgeon's smile. \n\nBoutique 208 is a business that it worth observing and deserving of cultivation and your expendable dollars. Stop in if you're ever left with time to kill before a show in the Cultural District (Heinz Hall is directly across the street). \n\nP.S. Psst. Fellas. Bring your lady to Boutique. She'll do much cooing and repeating of the phrase \"Aw, how cute!\" Once she's done that for 20 minutes or so, have her pick something out and buy it for her to uhhh...earn credits if you see where I'm headed. \n\nP.P.S. Prices vary widely. Some items are in the $100 range while others are just a few bucks, so you're bound to find something you can afford here.
