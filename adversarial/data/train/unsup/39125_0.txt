We ate here throughout our stay due to being a part of the vouchers we received. \n\nThe food was great. Had some hard waffles and not so great tasting soul food, but I can't complain about the rest. There was a good selection so even the pickiest eaters would be able to find something to eat. I would recommend the Saturday\/Sunday brunch as you can get either breakfast or lunch. When we come back will come back again. Maybe next time we will not wake up so late and can make the breakfast buffet.
