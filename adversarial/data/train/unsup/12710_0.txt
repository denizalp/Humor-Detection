Not my preferred EOS location, but not bad. Very clearly a former Gold's location with the same fixtures and layout. It seems the only thing that's changed is the class schedule. I will say that I like the drilling stairs available at this location, but it's kind of a bummer that it's so crunched for space that you have to move equipment out of the way to be able to use it with ease.\n\nClass schedule is decent, with classes provided by some of my favorite instructors- Shirley B currently has a Hot Hula class while Rawlins has P90X, both people I'll drive across town for if my schedule allows. Bonus points for this location having a cardio theater, but it's kind of cancelled out by how bad (small, no circulation, very limited equipment) the women's area is.
