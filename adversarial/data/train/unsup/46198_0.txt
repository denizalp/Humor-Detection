So after the disappointment that was my rear windshield completely spider-webbing on my way to work on Friday night, I was able to get into Safelight Saturday morning to get my windshield fixed. Rick is the guy that took care of me, and he was awesome. He made me feel like I was in good hands, and was very attentive- he even recommended a breakfast spot down the street (Farmer Boys) and called me 25 minutes after they were done to let me know I was ready to go (it's recommended that you don't drive the vehicle for 30 minutes after installation) so I wouldn't have to wait!\n\nRick took what would have been an even more miserable situation into a good experience. I never thought I would have such a great experience out of such a big inconvenience (and expensive too). The Safelight website was upfront with all the extra parts needed to install the windshield (molding, etc.) where other places were not. \n\nThanks Rick, breakfast was as good as you said it was!
