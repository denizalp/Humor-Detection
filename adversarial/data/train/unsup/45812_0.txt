I was in Solon for business and oooooh the tooth issue that I thought I could go a few days longer with said oh NO take care of this now.  I'm from Los Angeles...I don't know anything about any Dentists here.  Called a co-worker who found this Glick Dental.  I called at 9am and had an appointment at 2pm.  I Could not be more grateful for the quick attention and the professionalism of all the staff.  Thank you so very much!!  I feel much better now!!
