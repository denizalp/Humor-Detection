For months before our scheduled visit, I kept telling my husband what a great buffet at the Bellagio was after watching it being previewed on the Travel Channel and the Food Network.  Well we finally made it into the buffet after waiting on line for over an hour for the lunch buffet.  We couldn't believe our eyes when we saw the amount of empty tables.  How can there be so many empty tables when there are hundreds of people waiting to get in?  Anyway, that is besides the point.  We were expecting something spectacular like lobster and crab legs and steaks.  What we got were slider burgers, runny scrambled eggs and vinegar laced eggs benedict.  I must say the dessert selection was great.  The only thing that the buffet at the Bellagio left us with was sodium bloat and regret.  Definitely not worth the wait in line nor the cost.  It is not all that it's cracked up to be.
