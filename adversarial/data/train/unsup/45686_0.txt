Little Restaurant in dying little strip mall on the corner of Bell & 64th St. \nJust went there because of the 4 star review. \nStaff is very friendly. You order up front at the counter and seat yourself and they bring the food to you. \nPortions were large, taste was ok. I think the lettuce had seen fresher days and it was a little limp already which turned me off. \nUnfortunately I don't think I will be back... there are too many other & better choices in the area.
