The service was very friendly.\nI found the food overpriced for the quality and the portion.\nThe French Toast were thin and small.  It was a bit dry.  The sauce on it was ok but considering how dry the french toast was, could have used more sauce.\nThe steak and eggs was ordered medium.  It came much closer to rare than medium.\ni ordered two slices of bacon.  For four dollars you get two slices much smaller than a Post-It and almost as thin.  \nI was trying to like this place.  Nice spot on Kensington, friendly service, nice patio.  Unfortunately the food and pricing really fails here.
