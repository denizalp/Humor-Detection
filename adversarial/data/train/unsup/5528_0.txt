Okay, so I am huge fan of Mexican food in general and during the week, this is my lunch spot of choice. They are clean, quick and very affordable. The salsa is spicy enough for most, but if you ask they will bring out a bowl with more heat. Yummo! The lunch specials even include a beverage which is almost never the case. My heart longs for there tasty Horchata which has to be homemade and to me beats every other restaurant in town! I must add it is not included as a beverage in the lunch special, but well worth the $2.50. I usually get the Cheese Enchilada and Chile Relleno Combo which makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The cheese tastes authentic and perfectly melted while the Chile Relleno has this unique kick to it's sauce and the batter isn't too thick. My one dislike of this place is the rice and beans which seem to lack any flavor at all. Regardless, this place has a soft spot in my heart AND my big belly:)
