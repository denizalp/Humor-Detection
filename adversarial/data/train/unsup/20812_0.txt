Well, you know a fancy decor and a great staff does not make up for crappy food.  Now before I slam the food, let me say that the staff was great.  They were very knowledgeable of the menu and did everything right.  My $65 steak came out and it looked like I burnt it.  I had to get some dipping sauce it was sooo dry.  I had the wild mushrooms which were good and the parmesan bread sticks were also very good.  If I had come for that I would rate this place 5 stars.  \n\nI would not waste my time or my money here again.  I will keep looking for a good steak house that I do not need a loan to eat at, total bill $135.  :(
