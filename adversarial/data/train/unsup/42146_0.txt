Had a blast at Top Golf last week.  Although a little pricey for the hour it is a great  place for some friendly competition!  \n\nWe were able to get in right  away on a busy Sunday  afternoon.  We had some issues with our monitor but were  able to get it reset to a little more than an hour which is great because they charge by the hour.  My only concern and my reason for the four stars is that no one knew how to fix  it or where to fix it.  It took the server several trips  to finally get the issue resolved.  \n\nAll in all Top Golf  was awesome.  Definitely going here  again hopefully with a group of friends  I can show off my skills to.
