I had to press on one star in order to write a review.  If you don't want to get ripped off, don't use this place.  If you work hard for your money, don't use this company for anything at all, no flights, no car rental, no hotel room.  My story:  My stepdaughter reserved a flight and a car rental.  I was charged for both, flight reservation and car rental.  The car rental was $125.90 and flight reservation was $297.22 for a total of $423.12. I was charged the full amount on July 11, 2016.  My stepdaughter traveled on July 12 and returned on the 14th of July.  When my stepdaughter returned the vehicle on July 14th, she was charged on her credit card $157.06 the amount increased because of taxes and extra insurance she decided to buy which was not needed.  Since I was paying for everything, I sent her a check for $157.06 and proceeded to dispute the $125.90. Allegiant had me send them a copy of the receipt, which I did but I never received a call or a response, finally after calling Allegiant so many times, I decided to dispute the charges through my credit card (Chase).  After waiting for about three months Chase  credit card decided to take Allegiant's side and basically said that $157.06 was the deposit and $125.90 was the balance, I was so frustrated that I decided to just give up the fight.  But I suggest to any of you that if you don't want to throw away your hard earned money DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY AT ALL AND \/ OR ANY TYPE OF SERVICES.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY.  ALLEGIANT IS A RIPOFF.\n\nTHE ONLY REASON I GAVE THEM A ONE STAR WAS BECAUSE I HAD TO IN ORDER TO WRITE A REVIEW
