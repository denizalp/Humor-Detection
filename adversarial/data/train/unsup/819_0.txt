\"If you go to Zero Degrees tonight without me, I'll give you both the finger.\"\n\nAnd that is how our adventure began.  Did I wait three f*cking hours for some boba on their Grand Opening?  You bet your titties I did.  I was ready to flip a table. I'm still agitated!  I won't let that affect my review but give me a minute to woo-sa, okay?\n\nThe drinks and popcorn chicken were legit. They did have some inconsistencies though.  A couple of us had ordered the same drinks as each other and some drinks were sweeter than others, some were more tart, and some were more gritty.  These were the same drink so training needs work.  It was their first official day though so we were expecting some inconsistencies but dang.  My split cup with Sea Salt Green Tea and Matchata was bomb though.  It was my favorite drink and as you can see, we ordered a lot!  Since we were the second to the last group of the night, they ran out of some stuff and our really tasty popcorn chicken ended up being majority bread crumbs and no meat.  Boo!\n\nAll in all, this is a great addition to the west valley and I'll definitely be back but not until the hype dies down.  I wouldn't wait three hours for this place.
