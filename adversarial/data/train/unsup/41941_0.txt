Jackpot! Lamesa was delicious, friendly, casual, affordable. The menu was simple yet creative, steeped in Filipino tradition all with a Toronto twist.\n\nSo thrilled my wife and I stumbled across this place. We were hungry and wandering aimlessly and it stood out as a perfect place to relax yet try some new exciting food.\n\nDespite having no reservation they took us in and made us feel welcome. My knowledge of Filipino cuisine isn't great but I'll try to describe what we had as it was all perfect.\n\nWell I started with a glass of wine. A delicious cab served in a glass. Started with a kind of butternut squash risotto, topped with brussels. Zingy and rich. Had to slow ourselves down. Next was chicken adobo, so so tender and bright. Then, my favorite, roasted broccoli with curry, peanuts, and a shrimp paste. Holy moly. Add a $1 bowl of rice and we were in heaven.\n\nWe actually weren't planning on getting dessert, but there was a mix up where our server ended up dropping off the yam flan at our table. We were surprised and definitely naive in our incredulity. We didn't question it, just offering our thanks for this kind gesture. It wasn't communicated that it was an accident until after we finished it. But we definitely should have questioned it. Sorry Lamesa! Anyway, it was one of the best desserts I've ever had and I would get it again in a heartbeat. Purple yam flan, cool, creamy and not too sweet, accompanied by all kinds of colorful sauces and fruity bits bursting with juicy flavor.\n\nNot sure what the dessert cost but everything else came out to $50. Worth double!\n\nIt'll be one of those nights\/menus that I wish I could relive for sure. Next time!
