Timothy's has great coffee at all their locations, with a nice variety in drip coffees.  And since changing some of their baked goods a couple of years ago, they now offer some of the best pastries in the city, much better than their counterparts at Starbucks.  But what makes this Timothy's location (Bloor E. & Sherbourne) truly exceptional is their customer service.  Super friendly and super fast, they provide the gold standard for food counter customer service in Toronto.  Highly recommended!
