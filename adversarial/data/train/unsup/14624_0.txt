Of all of the fails of Aria, this was surprisingly not one of them as I actually had quite a pleasant time here. The waitress was friendly and the drinks came fast. The Bramble Berry was good but the Cucumber Collins was even better. Their drinks are pricey (but again it's Vegas). I liked the atmosphere, it didn't completely reek of smoke or cigar. \n\nI especially liked that their tables were nicely arranged and the chairs were comfy. At some lounges, the chairs are too tall for the tables or comfort is sacrificed in the name of decor and it looks better than it feels (literally ...)\n\nThe whole environment was relaxing and conducive to excess drunkness. Not bad at all.
