When I opened the door and walked inside Chole's Garden Restaurant, I came face to face with a Toronto Maple Leaf's jersey!\n\nThe music here is hip and loud. The TVs are tuned to Hockey Night in Canada.\n\nAm I in a sport bar? But what's that smell of Pho in the air?\n\nThis is really a new Hong Kong Style Cafe that opened up that replaced Pho Trend.\n\n$9.99 or so will get you a set dinner with soup, main, dessert and drink. In line with most of the HK cafe in the area.\n\nHouse Special Baked Pork Chop with Rice ($9.99) used lean pork and was quite tender. The only problem was the kitchen baked it at high heat and burnt some of the pieces! Taste of bitterness!\n\nI don't mind coming back for lunch or afternoon tea if I am in the area to chill as the interior is spacious and has free wifi.\n\nBtw, they serves beer..maybe Chole's Garden Restaurant can be a Sport Bar after all!
