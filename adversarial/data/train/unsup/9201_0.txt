Two of us:\n24oz filet for two. Not bad, a little tough. Expected better. Was not tender as expected.    3.0\/5\n\nAu gratin potatoes. Very good 4.6\/5\nGarlic string beans. Very good. Buttery and garlic. 4.6\/5\nChocolate cake. Must try.  Rich, but not too much so. 4.6\/5\n2 glasses wine \n-----$200\n\nOverall: solid 3.7\/5\n\nEverything was a hit but the meat. This could be a deal breaker for many, and at paying $200 it's understandable.  They will get another chance with me. Would recommend for someone to try.
