What? I'm the first place to write a review for this place? Well then... I better make this good.\n\nI ordered the burger with cheese curds. The bun was freshly made and not your typical Safeway deli bun. The beef patty was lean. The ingredients were top notch, from the cheese down to the produce. I really liked the addition of arugula in the burger. I actually felt somewhat \"healthy\" after eating here.\n\nI tried some of my friend's fries. She loves the fries here as they will cut the potato right in front of you. The fries taste real too, they actually taste like a potato. Crazy huh? Lots of Parmesan shavings and a dollop of not too garlicky aioli topped this delicacy. \n\nYay! I'm a fan.
