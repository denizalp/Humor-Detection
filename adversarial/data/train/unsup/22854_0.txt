Great little spot in the heart of Little Italy. The atmosphere is nice , the service is good and the menu looks amazing. To start we ordered their house salad. It was unetable because the lettuce was brown in spots, limp and wilted. Next was their  clams special. It was outstanding! The clams were cooked perfectly and we loved the pairing with the zucchini and tomatos. We also ordered the Lobster Ravioli. Perfection! The pasta was perfectly done and eldente and it was jam packed with lobster. To finish we tried the chefs favorite pizza (pesto, chorizo, onions, peppers and smoked mozz). The pizza was great, loved the spicy chorizo and pesto, my only complaint was the peppers were cut way to large for me when I took a bite the pepper dragged all the toppings with it. Over all great experience and great food.
