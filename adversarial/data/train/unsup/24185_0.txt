I come here for the food and the angry ladies. \n\nWhen I first moved to Arizona, I shopped here and observed one middle-aged woman drive over a second middle-aged woman's foot with her shopping cart in the meat section. The two began to scream at each other and it actually picked up later again on the other side of the store when one caught the other continuing to mutter toward her in the wine section... it was pretty entertaining. \n\nThe second time I came here, I was called a \"slut\" by a woman in her twenties in the parking lot who apparently thought I took her parking space. Unfortunately for her, there were three other empties on the other side of my car, which I joyfully pointed out to her, but that didn't seem to stop the steam coming from her ears. All that energy and hatred toward me for absolutely nothing... poor girl.
