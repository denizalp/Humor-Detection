They committed the Cardinal Sin in my opinion.  Their website stated that the sale closed at 2 pm.  I drove all the way over there and arrived at 1:20 and was curtly informed that they were closed.  When I protested and showed them their mistake by having them look at their own website, they just said (without apology) \"it was a mistake\".  Turning away potential $$$ because of your own mistake?  Cardinal Sin of selling anything.  Bye bye Lythcoop.  I'll never be back, and would advise others to beware.
