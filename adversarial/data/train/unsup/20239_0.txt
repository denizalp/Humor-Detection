200th review!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nFriend and I were headed out to paint the town red and run amuck and we met up with some other friends in north phoenix down at the Whisky River, now I have never been and let's just say I'm more of an RNB kinda girl but with that said, I did find myself having fun, no cover charge before 9 and well drinks 50cents till 11, now this place is alright with me! haha\n\nPeople were friendly, bartenders & staff were nice, and dance floor was wooden and round had folks dancing and having a good time. \n\nI'm going to be honest, I dug the 50cent drinks, drank me some whiskey and coke all night long, well at least to 11. Had a great group of girlfriends and just a great time! \n\nIsn't it funny how once you start drinking someone in the group says Hey lets go somewhere else and see what's up!  I know the DD's that night got some miles on their car LOL,,,so we went off to our next spot!
