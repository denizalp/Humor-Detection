I had a reservation for 2 beds for a month, then showed up to the hotel and they only had single king beds. The casino sucks, they have like 5 tables. The rooms are far away from the casino. The reason I am writing this review, is because I just looked at my bank account. And not only did they not refund me my deposit. They withdrew more money from my account. I left the room as I found it. I will never stay in this sorry excuse for a Las Vegas hotel and casino again.
