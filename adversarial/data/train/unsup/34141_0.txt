VERY interesting idea!  and a deliciously good idea too!\n\nFavorites: Emerald chicken quesadilla and Jerk fried rice.\n\nThe place isn't spectacular to look at and you grab your own utensils and bus your own table.  But they do have funny photos on the wall that look photo-shopped to show a Mexican person with a Chinese person.  I kind of want to ask about that next time.
