This is a poorly managed company. It has a very cheap materialistic strategy of making the most money out of the customer instead of providing a better flying experience. A few days ago, I had the worst flying experience I have ever had. I have flown with allegiant several times to get to point A to point B and never had to pay for a carry on. I get to the gate, and they tell my boyfriend and I to turn around and go pay for our carry ons. $50 a bag! We said we were not informed of this. The man behind the counter told us \"oh well some people are misinformed\" like it's our problem. They basically cornered us for paying for the bags because we had no other option at that point.. even though no one told us this when we checked in at the front before security ... then you get on the plane and you have to pay for water. Any other airline that is complimentary. The engine sound is abnormally loud. For the $50 we used to pay for our damn bags, we could have bought a ticket with a better airline that would have offered complimentary soft drinks \/ water. I will never fly allegiant again. I will never recommend any one to fly with this company.
