As advertised, you're eating a meal in total darkness. The quarters feel a little cramped and the place isn't terribly comfortable. It felt a little stuffy- not great airflow in general. \n\nThe server was very nice and engaging as was the person up front. \n\nThe food itself was quite disappointing, especially after reading reviews - it was very salty and greasy; too many flavors trying to be combined. As other reviewers mentioned it is plant based, which is fine with me as I personally followed a vegan diet for many months, but this was not filling food as much as it was just heavy. The dessert was so sweet that I couldn't eat it. \n\n2 stars because for the price it's not worth it, as innovative of a concept as it is. It's not even directly on the strip- it's in an strip mall near the strip, but you're paying as if it's in a prime location. If it was more reasonably priced or if there were some options for the courses I would've given it 3 stars. \n\nI honestly think that the restaurant should consider simpler dishes- stick to protein, starch and veggie as was done for many of the courses but use less seasonings. Or include something like a pasta dish, and explore something like a cashew cream sauce which has an amazing amount of flavor but is still simple. Experiencing the crunchiness, texture, natural flavors of the food would enhance the experience overall.
