I just love THEhotel.  If you are coming with a group of girls (or guys I guess) THEhotel is a great option.  The large suites will fit plenty of people.  Both times I have been we had 5 girls in a room and it did not feel cramped.  The extra bathroom and sitting area is great for a large group.  \n\nThe bathrooms are very large and updated.  The beds are incredibly comfortable (although any bed after a night at the Vegas clubs is probably comfortable).  It is on the strip, but at one end.  There aren't too many places within walking distance.\n\nThey do have a liquor store across the street that you can walk to.  I also highly recommend Evening Call, the little bar right as you enter the casino floor.  They have great alcoholic slushy drinks that are great while sitting by the pool.  Speaking of the pools that is another aspect of THEhotel that I love.  They have a large wave pool that is always filled with kids and families.  It is great if you like wave pools.  They also have a lazy river that is fun for all ages.  There are a few smaller pools that cater more to the adult crowd.  Then there is also the \"toptional\" pool that I don't remember the name of.  They have great music and it is definitely adults only.  There is a cover to get into this pool which for guys is quite steep but it is a lot of fun.  \n\nOverall I would definitely recommend THEhotel especially if you are with a big group.  There are lots of great restaurants nearby.  They have a few fun bars (the view from the Foundation Room is amazing).  And the rooms themselves are great.
