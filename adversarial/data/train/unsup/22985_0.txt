I walked right by this place while I was shopping at the Galleria and decided to try it because it reminded me of a franchise in Japan called 'First Kitchen'.\nUnfortunately, it wasn't quite as good for me. \nI ordered the Chicken Tenders combo which gives you 3 pieces of chicken, mega fries, and a soda for $8.99 I think it was. The fries were good, but not that spectacular. Seems like it's just salted with flavored salt. There are some variety of shapes of fries you can choose from as well, such as curly fries. They are made to order which is good. \nIt's located on the second floor of the Galleria right in front of Dick's Sporting Goods if you have trouble finding it because it's not part of the main food court. This joint is kinda far for me, so I probably won't be frequenting it very much, but if you are in the Galleria, it's definitely worth trying once.
