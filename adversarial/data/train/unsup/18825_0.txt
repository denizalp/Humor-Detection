First time coming in here was last week and to my surprise, I was by myself when I showed up but that quickly changed as a rush of people came in. \n\nAs far as the food goes, it was decent. Good hamburger. Good Fries. It has that nice little diner feel to it which is always good. The people there were super friendly. The price of the food seemed a bit high though for the reasons I am about to say. \n\nIf I was going to tell ownership or management anything it's that this place needs an update. Bad. The guy who took my order added up my total with a calculator. I am a trusting guy but I can see lots of people having an issue. It also took them 20 minutes to get through orders for 6 people. Getting an Ipad in there with a card swiper would eliminate all that. \n\nAlso, this place needs a cleaning badly. It's not counter tops or floors, but the hard to reach places are kind of gross and something like just replacing the ceiling panels would make this place way nicer cause they are disgusting.\n\nI love having a nice diner feel with freshly cooked food, but the space feels like it is on it's last leg and some updates are needed badly.
