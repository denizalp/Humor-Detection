Nati's alterations is awesome. I'm sooooo happy they are still in the area. I've been coming to this place for years! I remember when Nati took in a full sequence size 13 dress in for me and made it into a size 0 for me! It was perfect and I've been coming here ever since! Now Nati's is under new management but still the same quality of work! \n\nThe prices are extremely reasonable so I always take my jeans and clothes here! \n\nLets keep this awesome local business around! They do awesome work for cheap and they work around the clock to keep the turn around time fast! You can sometimes drop something off and depending on the work you can probably get it back in the same week if she's not too slammed! \n\nLove Nati's they will always have my business!
