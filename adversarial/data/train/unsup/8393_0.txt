Exceptional, delicious, astounding, amazing...my vocabulary is limited so that is all I can do to explain the food and wine at Tutti Santi. i took my father in law, who I have little in common with and even less to talk about...The food was so outstanding it was a conversation in and of itself. Thank you Tutti Santi for creating a conversation about your amaziness where no conversation existed before! Dinner, midweek  - yes, weekend fling, yes, celebration - yes, anniversary -yes.Go eat, enjoy! You wil pay but you will enjoy and you will be waited on like royalty, lap it up!
