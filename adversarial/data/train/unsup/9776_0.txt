Let's take a minute and just talk about the electronics at Costco. Yeah yeah...ignore the huge boxes of cereal and the 16 loaves of bread you can score in a matter of minutes. The TV selection and pricing at Costco are baller. BALLER. \n\nDid I want to purchase a new TV just days before the Superbowl? No. But we were due. And word on the street tells me that late January is one of the best times to score a solid deal on a TV. So we pulled the trigger and headed over to Costco to check out the goods. I now understand that when I say to my husband \"let's look at TV's\" all he hears is \"let's go buy a TV.\" Noted. \n\nCostco has the Goldilocks of options - some too small, some too big and a nice variety that were juuuust right. I have to also give complete props to my main TV man, Andrew, who knew more about TV's, TV apps, 3D options, streaming, pixels, 1080pwhat? than the dudes I chatted with at Best Buy. He was helpful, he was honest and he was extremely knowledgeable. He was the furthest from pushy, too. \n\nSo, if you're seeking a new TV of any size or price point, hit up Costco and take a look around.
