I wanted a groom but instead my dog was shaved down all one length. I had asked for a kennel clip assuming the groomer knew how to groom poodles. \nThey however, have fast service if thats what one is looking for.\nOwner is quite rude and condescending. I would give this place another chance but for the owner's attitude towards the customers. He is rude and makes inappropriate comments.
