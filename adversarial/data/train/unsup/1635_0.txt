I had literally the best lunch in recent memory here.  Rice bowl with chicken was PERFECT.  The reason this place doesn't get five stars is because there appear to be a cadre of gross regulars that get preferential treatment.  I was waiting for someone behind the counter for someone to take my order, some sloppy Yinzer cut right in front of me, started yukking it up with the staff, and no one even acknowledged me.  Hopefully the customer service gets better, and if it does please let me know.  I won't be returning despite excellent food because trashy obnoxious middle aged sloppy dudes in faded polo shirts make me lose my appetite.
