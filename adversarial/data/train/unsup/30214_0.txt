My husband always goes here for his haircuts and he always look very sharp and fresh!\n\nI  went a few months ago to get my eyebrows threaded while my husband was getting his usual haircut. I wasn't happy with the results at all. The woman made my skin scraped and very red and irritated wherever she threaded. It took a full day for the redness to go away :( and the cost was much higher than other reputable places in Brampton. I will be sticking to my usual eyebrow lady.\n\nFor men's cuts I would give this place a full 5 stars, but for the threading I would give it 2 stars.
