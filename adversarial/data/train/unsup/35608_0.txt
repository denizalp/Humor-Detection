I really like the location as I work downtown and all the stores are great...HOWEVER I find it to be rather uptight. Of course many people are shopping there on their lunch break or at least thats what I think but the staff in several of the stores move as slow as molasses which in an hour lunch break I am on a mission to get in and get out......hard with slow employees.
