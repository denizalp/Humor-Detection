This place is so hidden and in the middle of nowhere. But.. It turns out they are an authorized retailer of Pacific range hoods! The only one in the valley apparently.  I hate my microwave\/sorry excuse for a range hood combo and was looking for a high quality replacement.\n\nWe cook a lot of oily\/fragrant foods at home and don't like smelling it for a week after, so we bit the bullet and got a Pacific AC3100 - this thing has a self cleaning function, a humongous grease\/oil trap, and a whopping 900cfm of air movement. This thing retails for $579 and we bought it here for $479. It's full stainless, straight out of Taiwan (not China), and the motors have a lifetime warranty.  This unit does not disappoint.  It is a MUST for high btu Chinese cooking!\n\nI did a self install - I think they have people that can do it for you, but I didn't even ask. It only took a couple hours - including cutting the opening bigger on my cabinet and running to Lowes for proper size ducting.\n\nStaff was friendly, they also have a huge selection of laminate flooring, carpets, as well as other building supplies.
