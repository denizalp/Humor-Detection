In town on business staying in a nearby hotel and went here for drinks and dinner based on a recommendation from a co-worker. The service was friendly although a bit slow but the food and drinks were both mediocre, really not very good at all to be completely honest. \n\nDrinks are small and have a microscopic amount of alcohol in them. The food was, in my opinion, likely frozen and reheated rather than prepared from scratch. The burger tasted like a Bubba burger and the mac and cheese tasted like it came out of a box with a Kraft label on it.\n\nTwo stars are for the decent service and modern-ish atmosphere and amenities but I would not consider ever going back unless I knew the food had been completely changed.
