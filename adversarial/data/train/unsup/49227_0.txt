Both visits here were not the best. It's the service that seems to be lacking. Overall, it takes a long time for the wait staff to get your drink order, then food order. Food takes way too much time to arrive after ordering (the last time I went it wasn't crowded, so the kitchen wasn't being slammed with orders) and doesn't arrive at the same time if you're in a group.  The food is decent, but certainly not great. \n\nIf they can revamp their wait staff operation this place certainly could be great.
