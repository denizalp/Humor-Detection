After leaving a very negative review for another Primanti's location in town, I have to say I'm quite impressed with this one. I went here one week after opening early on a Friday evening. The fries on the sandwiches were crispy and piping hot and the veggie burger seemed like it might actually be made in house? Service was speedy and friendly. Good beer selection and happy to see a full bar as well as a larger menu (items like Pizza and salads). There weren't any sports games on so the crowd wasn't very big which is a shame, because I feel like this Primanti's actually deserves the crowd. Despite being a chain of sorts, it does have a local vibe to it and I feel like it's going to do much better in this location than some of the upscale predecessors in this spot. Hopefully the service and quality holds up when they are busier too. I live nearby so I'm sure I'll be back often- excited to see what they do with the outdoor patio in the warmer months.
