I came for lunch with a few friends from work.  Ordered the brisket sandwich.  It was pretty disappointing.  It was skimpy on the amount of brisket.  The brisket was bland.  The sandwich must have been sitting around for a while, before the server finally brought it over, because the bottom bun was so soggy.  It was so soggy that it was falling apart and I had to eat the sandwich upside down.  \n\nMy co workers ordered a brisket sandwich, burger and quinoa salad with chicken.  the two who had buns in their order, experienced the same soggyness.  The quinoa salad apparently not too bad.\n\nThe fries were really good though.
