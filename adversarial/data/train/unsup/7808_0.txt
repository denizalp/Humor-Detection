Finally Max's restaurant is here! We've been waiting for it for a while and now that they're open we have to check it out!\n\nJust so you know, Max's is some kind of a \"fine dining\" restaurant, so expect to wait for a while or a couple of minutes for your order. Me and my husband ordered their famous: \n\n*Whole chicken (w\/ coleslaw and fries)\nSurprisingly good and taste like Max's in the Philippines. Love the fries, didn't even try to taste the coleslaw Not a single bite of it, coz it looks so dry. \n\n*Kare-Kare, taste like kare-kare but it lacks of vegetables. But the most disappointing part was, it has lumps! We asked the manager\/supervisor how did they cook their kare-kare he said it's pre made then, they froze it then, heat it whenever there's an order. That explains the Lumps! Lol\n\n*Lumpiang ubod, is nothing without the peanut sauce! It is so plain! Lack of ingredients and doesn't contain the real taste of lumpiang ubod. \n \nWe just got disappointed with the food and the price. I don't know if we're still coming back.
