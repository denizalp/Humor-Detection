So unique. A menu only the most creative of minds could come up with. I visited with a friend for a girls night on a Thursday and we were met with an upscale, beautifully & tastefully decorated restaurant, wonderful service from start to finish (thanks to our server Erin for such great suggestions and attentiveness), and a remarkably one-of-a-kind, delicious, and unforgettable dinner experience. Hats off to the chef.\n\nThere are a number of options on the menu, so if you have difficulty figuring out what exactly to get (I wanted it allllll!), your server can guide you. NOTE: most plates are designed to share so don't be surprised with the smaller portion sizes (we realized it would have been better to visit with a bigger group so we got to try more items - definitely next time), and they also have a pretty decent sized drinks menu.\n\nWe ordered: a) Lamb Ribs ($14.00), b) Black Truffle Buffalo Mozarella Bread ($16.00), c) Turkish Manti Dumplings ($14.00), d) Middle Eastern Fried Chicken ($17.00), e) Hand Rolled Couscous ($8.00), f) Seared Cauliflower (tossed in duck fat and tahini sauce). The Lamb Ribs (so tender and full of flavour), Cauliflower and Dumplings were the standouts, but everything was so delicious with such a bold, generous mix of flavours, there was nothing we could complain about. These are dishes you won't find just anywhere, and everything was a pleasure to taste. 'Unique' and 'special' are the two words I can use to sum up our experience here. \n\nIt's pricey for sure, but what an experience. This spot is located just east of Adelaide Street West and John Street. For all these items, plus two drinks (at $14.00 each), with tax and tip, our total was around $135.
