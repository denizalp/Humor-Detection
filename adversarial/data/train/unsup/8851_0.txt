Wow, my first time at this one and it'll be the last.  \n\nWent through the drive-thru and ordered my usual of trenta black tea lemonade (sweetened) and 2 birthday cake pops (don't judge!).   I should backtrack and mention that with only one car in front of me, it took 15 minutes for me to get to the pick-up window.  Unreal!  I then waited another 5 minutes for someone to come to the window.  The guy was in NO WAY the usual friendly Starbucks employee.  Handed my food out, took the money and never said a word.  Finally gave me my change and drink.\n\nI pulled away annoyed and became more so when I realized I had no straw.  Ok, I can take a lid off and be old-school.  First taste let me know they had NOT sweetened it as requested.  I thought to myself, \"Well maybe he didn't hear me.\"  I then looked at the sticker on the cup and nope...he heard alright.  *sigh*\n\nStill trying to be positive, I remembered my cake pops...yay!  Took one out of the bag and took a bite without looking (I was driving...stop judging!).  It was mushy.  YUCK!  I looked down and saw that it was clearly left out of the refrigerated case and had become almost melted.  Again, YUCK!\n\nSooooooooo, again I repeat that I will NOT be back to this location again.  Hmph.
