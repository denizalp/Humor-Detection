Decided to shop at this Walmart Super center was a big mistake , especially on a Saturday because it was the weekend there were many people and trying to stay out of people's way was very hard because Walmart decided to restock there shelves so not only the large amount of shoppers but the stock employees in the middle of the Isles made it very hard to maneuver around. I went to check out the produce department and was very let down because most of the produce did not look inviting, what was I thinking? Maybe I just wanted to get all the things I needed all at one place and it's very convenient for me because I live so close but from now on I won't make this my all in one place , especially on the weekend .i really hate to give bad reviews but it was so unpleasant but great customer service with my check out !
