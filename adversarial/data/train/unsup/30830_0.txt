The bartenders are great. Very personable, mix great drinks and know how to pair a drink with a meal. The food is top notch for the price and the area. They have an indoor and outdoor seating area, both with great atmosphere. A great happy hour. The only issue is you wouldn't know it existed if you didn't look it up. Long and short, been there many times, never had a bad meal or bad service. Well worth checking out and far better than some of the other bar\/restaurants on the same road within walking distance.
