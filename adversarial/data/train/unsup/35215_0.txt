This is the worst so-called semi-private club ever! Over $700 a month in dues and they run the public through there like cattle. Nothing special being a member. Pro shop does not know how to manage the rotation of three nine holes. No, Marshall, no starter but at least a beverage cart. Would not recommend becoming a member.
