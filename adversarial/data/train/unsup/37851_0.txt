One of the best Mexican restaurants I have eaten at in a long time! The food was excellent, the portions big and the staff was top notch!\n\nSome restaurants these days have lost their customer service but not this place. My waiter was on top of everything and everyone from the hostess to the manager had friendly smiles and made you feel at home.\n\nGreat job Juan's Flaming Fajitas!!
