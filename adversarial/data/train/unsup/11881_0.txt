Alright kids, buckle up because I'm going to paint you a word picture.\n\nLet me start by saying that Our Spot is like home away from home. And like many homes, when you get home, you want your food done right and good. \n\nI walk into this cozy place and I sit down, and I already know it's going to be a good time. \nService is fantastic, WIFI is available, the glasses are clean, the ketchup is full, the forks are nicely washed; you're home. \n\nAnyway, I decide I'm feeling something fresh, maybe a sandwich. I get this Jerk Chicken sandwich, and I literally had to take a break from eating it to reflect on my life.\n\nIt has everything you want in the most phenomenal combination of taste you will ever enjoy. This smoky hot sauce, that's not too hot, but not too mild brings the Jerk chicken alive. The mayo in between and you're overwhelmed by the perfectly toasted texture of the coco buns. \n\nOh. My. God. \n\nMy eyes are finally open, I can see what I've been missing. If you're not busy today, or tomorrow do yourself a solid, hit up Our Spot, if you don't like it, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
