Your standard boba place with smoothies, slushes, and fruit teas. One cool thing about this place is that they sell herbal teas (i.e. goji berries chrysanthemum, longan fungus dew, honey chia weed, et cetera). For those who believe in the \"hot air\" foods, their herbal teas count as the cool foods. So if you've been eating a lot of fried foods and feel an impending sore throat coming, come for the herbal teas!\n\nI tried the goji berries chrysanthemum tea and it was refreshing.  It also had jujubes in it which was a delightful surprise.  My mom makes something similar with goji berries and jujubes but uses hot water with agave nectar instead of chrysanthemum tea.  No complainants here as it made for a more flavorful and sweet drink.  I also had a few good sips of the longan fungus dew.  That stuff was thick and interesting.  We were told that the rose fungus dew is a little better.  I wish she told us this before we ordered!  ;P\n\niSnow is located inside the AZ International Market so it's convenient to grab a drink while shopping. They also sell snow and shaved ice. The people here speak Mandarin and English so order in whichever language. I think I'll come back for their herbal teas! 3.5 stars!
