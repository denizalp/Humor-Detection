I've heard good things about Above and Beyond and decided to give it a try. I had a girls weekend trip coming up and wanted to get some to go items for lunch the following day. The owners were so friendly and helpful, I was not familiar with some of the menu items and they were more than happy to share and explain what they were. I ordered the penne alla vodka, mac-n-cheese, roasted red pepper hummas, sandwiches and pasta salad. I came home with my items and about an hour later I received a call from one of the owners stating they just made a fresh batch of the penne alla vodka and she wanted to make sure I had fresh pasta for my trip the following day (even though the batch I took was going to be good also, she wanted to make sure we had a fresh new batch) she insisted I keep both batches. The following day myself and 4 others ate the lunch items and they were delicious!!!! Everything was so fresh and full of flavor, we all loved it! I will for sure be eating here again.
