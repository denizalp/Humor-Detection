Spent two nights here for work. Obviously I wasn't the one who booked this place; our boss wanted to be cheap and the hotel that hosts the trade show we were there for was booked. I believe they paid $95 a night. \nWe didn't spend too much time in the room, we didn't eat, drink or gamble in the hotel. We also didn't visit the pool or wash our clothes. That being said I can only review what I DID experience. \nOnce we arrived I instantly got a Motel 6 feeling. Outside were the type of people who stay here: trashy. So sorry but I must be honest! They would lurk around the hotel in their shorts like they were at home. When we got to our room, we had to ask for towels, the staff forgot to put any in our room, how does that happen? The elevator was old, hot and stuffy! I think the worst nightmare would be getting stuck in there! The room doors were always getting stuck. It had a lot of counter space but only a mini fridge. The bathroom was seemingly white and clean but the towel rack was broken. The furniture was old looking but you can't expect too much. The WORST of the worst was the bed. We were convinced our bed had bed bugs because mysterious bites appeared all over my body! And our coworker in another room said he got bitten too. \n\n\nPlease invest in new mattresses for the rooms or remove the bed bugs! It's gross.
