Love it here and my favorite Korean grocery store.  It is located in a large strip mall with plenty of parking spaces in the front.  There is a food court with a coffee restaurant, clothes store, beauty store, salon, bank, bakery, and MBC store.  The grocery itself has produce, liquor, fish and meat section plus much more.  It's comparable to HMart in Cali.  I would recommend you checking it out.
