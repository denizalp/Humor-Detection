A fifty year old american dairy bar owned by a republican Thai man who blasts country music at five o'clock in the morning. The best boss I ever had. The prices are as low as the portions are huge.  Payow's weekday only lunch specials and homemade soups are well kept secrets.  The scrambler is not a well kept secret.  Highly recommended by Lyle Lovett.
