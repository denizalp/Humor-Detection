Five Stars, Beach!!!\n\nWhat's a better way to close a Vegas vacation, then by spending your last day at a never-ending noon pool party!!!    Sure, dragging yourself out of bed is a pain, but when you pair it with the desert heat, beautiful bodies everywhere, smiling faces, blasting bass, and free Popsicles.... What the hell else could you ask for!!!\n\nI'm sorry but if you want more... MORE...Who in their right mind could really want more?!  If you want more, your off your rocker, for real!\n\nThe only con, which I suppose is actually a pro as well, is the fact that there's a little cubby area hidden towards the back of the pool.  I only found it on accident, and wish there was info about the baggage check area, when we entered... That way we would have really gotten our 15bucks worth of the service, but WHATEVER!\n\nMy fav part of the whole experience was throwing balls at peoples heads:\nif your kissing in the pool... Imma aim at you!  These crazy people wont let me kiss my man, without us taking a ball to the face, so you cant do it either!!!\nIf you look like your scared to get wet.... Imma aim at you!\nIf your obviously targeting someone else, whose defenseless.... Imma aim at you!\nIf your pervy and make a move on me, when I'm obviously with MY MAN.... Imma spike the ball at your f'n face, and imma make sure I hit you!\n\nBest part of the Whole Vacay.... but who am I kidding... breathing in Vegas was the best part, everything's the best part when your on Vacation!\n\nOh yeah.... and you've gotta love all the stupid people who pay for a cabana when, tons of us early-risers have been partying in the same spot for free, for the last 5 hours.  Losers!  Yes... show the world how you ball, by throwing away your money, for NO REASON! LMFAO!!!!!
