Pricy but delicious- my husband and I split the classic salmon with cream cheese, red onion, capers, and tomatoes and the smoked meat sandwiches on whatever bagel was hot- which turned out to be sesame. These definitely aren't as big or chewy as NY\/NJ bagels, but they were good. \n\nLocated about a 5 minute walk from the Metro.
