They have lost my business.  I love their food, go on a regular basis. My favorite item on their buffet are the pakoras. Unfortunately you have to wait and wait while they conintue to replenish the other items. Finally they'll bring them out. Tonight I went to get a to go buffet and I was told 5 minutes. 25 minutes went by I asked one of the staff when would they be ready. I was told it'll take some time. I was done. I always wait and wait and wait and hear the excuses. But no more of that loyalty. I just left. \n\nWill it make a difference? No, but they needed to see that I'm not waiting like the many times in the past. \n\nThey have lost a customer
