Okay, imagine opening up a can of condensed cream of chicken and vegetable soup, no water added, plopped into a bowl with a biscuit on the side -  that's your  chicken pot pie at flying biscuit cafe. My suggestion to the owner - if you actually cook the food yourself, you will have people coming to your restaurant. I should've known better- 5:30 on a Friday night, one table taken. Just Noodles next door packed.
