I use this branch often.  Since it's on the way to the gym for me I like to stop here to conduct my financial transactions often.  Today I had to go inside and use a live teller.\n\nThe line was short and she was very friendly and pleasant.  I was 3rd in line when I arrived and was in\/out in 5 minutes.  Awesome!\n\nNot much more to say about this branch other than it's pretty laid back and the employees are fast and efficient.\n\nWill I return?  For my financial sake....I hope so!
