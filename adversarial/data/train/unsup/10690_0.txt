I am so seriously bummed that I have to give this business one star, i would give it negative one star if I could.  We went in on Sunday morning and the owner had to meet us there to open the store up- and before we even walked in he asked us who the \"collectors\" were and asked us what we wanted.  We barely walked in and I saw some Misfits records and walked over to them in a nostalgic splendor, and he was like \"Miss, those are the really expensive records over there.\"  I ignored him because if I like a freaking record, I am going to buy it, and he repeated himself until I acknowledged him and at that point I just walked away and went over to the section my husband was in.  He proceeded to ask us exactly what we were looking for, and we tried to tell him that some (if not most people) like to go browse around in record stores, to find rare gems that they are stoked to walk away with, and he wanted it to be very goal directed.  He continued to get in an argument with my husband, telling him what he wanted, assuming that because we are young that we only want reissues of 80s and 90s music when really we showed up with nothing on the agenda.  He was totally rude and we walked out after about 5 minutes because we couldn't take being treated like that.  I would never go back here, and I would dissuade anyone from going in.  This guy is insecure in a major way and his entire identity relies on the fact that he is a record collector.  Well here is some news d-bag, some people buy music to listen to it.  I am sorry if this ground breaking news hurts your already inflated ego, but if you want to stay in business, you need to start treating people nicer.  I am so glad we left before actually finding something that we wanted to buy- what a nightmare if we had to have him give us a price on something (since nothing in the store has a price tag).  Bleh- good riddance.
