Service slow. Food was OK - adequately spicy. Prices unreasonable. 5 mini tacos for 15.95$?? Like you could eat 10 of them and still be hungry. And all that's on them is a two tablespoons of meat and some chopped onions. Best part was the patio which was festive and spacious. \n\nBEER: A pint of Amsterdam was 7.95$. It should be half that. What kind of Mexican bullshit is this??? \n\nA Mexican friend recommended me this place last week and I've been cursing him all afternoon (in Spanish) but now realize he was talking about a spot by Oakwood (not Wychwood - Latin Fiesta @ 1002 St. Clair). So my bad, Juan-Pablo, my bad.\n\nLunch for two and three beers was 55$. Dios mio. Dios mio.\n\nNote: El Trompo in Kensington is much better, I think.
