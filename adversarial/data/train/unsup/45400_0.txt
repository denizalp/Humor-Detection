The fish and chips here were good. I had the halibut and chips. I thought the piece of halibut was quite small. I'm a big fish and chips person and I've been to quite a few fish and chips restaurants in Toronto and always order halibut if it's available. I thought the portion here was about half of what you typically get at other restaurants. It did taste good, though. For a $15 meal I didn't think it was very good value, there are better fish and chips options in Toronto in my opinion.
