I have been to 3 escape the room-type establishments, and while the other 2 have been good, this one is leagues above the rest. My partner and I did The Pearled Pachyderm. It was just the two of us. The room was set up in such a way that flowed and felt like it made sense, rather than just collecting random letters, numbers and keys. The story, while minimal, made all the puzzle solving feel a little cooler. I liked the hint system as well. We only used one but they gave us a perfect hint that didn't tell us too much but got us out of our mental block. I can't wait to come back and do another!
