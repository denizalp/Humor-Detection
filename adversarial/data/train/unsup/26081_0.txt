Happened to be in town from Los Angeles and was impressed by the reviews, so I decided to call for a quote. Got a call back with a full quote in about 15 min. Was able I get in the same day and only took 2 hours to tint all of my windows, plus two sun roof windows. The quality is amazing. Omar's window tinting did great and for half the price I would have paid in LA. AND I got a lifetime warranty on the window tint. Highly recommended!!
