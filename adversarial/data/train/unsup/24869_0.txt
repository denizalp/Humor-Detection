Like all new places we try out (and we love trying new places often), we love to try what they're known for. \n\nWe came here on Friday night later, so the place was kind of emptied out. \n\nFor their menu, they seem like a semi nice\/casual dining. The seating is casual. \nThey have a good wine selection, but the food selection is a tad smaller. \n\nSo we tried: \n\nThe Lasagna on special. It was an odd one. It was braised short rib with squash and zucchini. It didn't sound good at all, but the waiter insisted. Honestly, it was really good. We were both pleasantly surprised. \nI had the Tartufo pizza. Because - truffle. I love truffle. The smell, the taste. It hits my spot. Whatever that means. :)\nIt was delicious. And I was even hesitant about the egg, but if you are--DO NOT BE! It was quite the topper for this delectable dish. \n\nThe waiter was super friendly and very knowledgeable. Maybe a little too knowledgable. In the way that he went into crazy detail about the food. But, he was super passionate about his job. Which is a great thing. \n\nOverall, I would love to try it again and have other dishes. It's just a little further for us. But when you have good food and booze, it's worth going a little out of your way.
