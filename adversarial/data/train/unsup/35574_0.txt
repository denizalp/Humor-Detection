Money, Class & Swagger. \n\nMorton's is a fine dining establishment specializing in... you guessed it, STEAKS! My first experience with the famed steakhouse connected to the Ritz-Carlton was my first glimpse into the life of the rich and famous. A life I'd only known previously from the imagery conjured up by Robin Leach. \n\nOf course at the time, I had absolutely no business going there (still don't). I was a poor, naive, school going kid who was trying to impress a date on New Years Eve, circa early 2000's. But for that very night, we were treated to absolute royalty. \n\nThe servers were clad in tuxedo's. The atmosphere, with it's rich mahogany trim reminded me of an exclusively posh men's club. In the dimly lit dining room, we walked past a table with Brian Billick and a few members of the Baltimore Ravens who were in town to play the Browns the next day. Waiters rolled out elaborate carts of meat and seafood (including live Lobster) to offer first-hand examples of the various cuts available. The wow factor was off the charts even before we ordered. \n\nIt shouldn't go without saying that the food & drinks were phenomenal and the service, discreet and professional. But for the price, it should be expected. At Morton's you get what you pay for. It's a special occasion place, but when that occasion comes and you're in search of that very special dining destination, Morton's should be on your short list.
