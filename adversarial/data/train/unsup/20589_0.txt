Beautiful Boralia.*\n\nThey're serving up Aboriginal and historical Canadian-inspired dishes in a cozy atmosphere with a boss wine, beer and cocktail list. Believe the hype, this place is a lovely choice for a fancy meal. Yes, it is a tad pricy, but it's definitely worth every penny. \n\nMy party thoroughly enjoyed the deviled eggs, pierogies, mushroom salad, mussels, sweetbreads and beignet dessert. I would go into detail about the flavours, the plating, the care, but I feel I can't do it justice. So just trust. Trust that this is a haven on the ever-bro-ing Ossington strip. \n\n*Said like Colin Firth saying \"Beautiful Auralia\" in Love Actually. Too deep of a cut?
