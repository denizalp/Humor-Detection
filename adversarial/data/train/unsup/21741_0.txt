Sorry, Buffalo Exchange...I am giving you an F for poor customer service skills. Your sales people seem to enjoy cutting people down for their potential clothing donation. Very rude, in fact. I am over 40, have teen daughters who have also shopped there and it seems to get worse every time I stop in. Very unprofessional...remember, you are a \"Consignment Store\" on the UNLV campus. I suggest that you take your employees to Nordstroms to learn how to treat customers well. \n\nMinneapolis has amazing consignment stores...Google them.
