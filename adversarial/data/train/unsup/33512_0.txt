This was an amazing show!  I am so glad I went to see it!  Now the movie came out before the actually show and I was turned off to see the movie because I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan (...I know, I know, most girls love TC (aka Maverick)) so I figure the show wasn't all that great.\n\nWell the husband got some free tickets through his show, I figure what do I have to lose?  If I didn't like it, it was free...didn't even think about the possibility that the show was really good!  Now for all the newbies...meaning you young-in born in the 90's, this is all about the hit music in the 80's,  true rock music and the lifestyle of Los Angeles during the era!  I don't want to give away the show and all that happens, the movie is slightly different then the show, yup I finally made myself watch the movie after the show, but I caught myself singing throughout the whole show!  \n\nThis was definitely an amazing show and what a great way to showcase such an awesome ere of time, the 80's!  I recommend anyone who grew up in the 80's and\/or love the 80's, this is the show to watch!  It's so good I wouldn't mind paying for the tickets to watch it again!
