Food is okay but you get very little for the price you pay. $1 extra for \"corn on the cob\" gets you one, little mini-cob. $0.50 extra for \"potatoes\" gets you one, little red potato. $4.50 gets you a tiny sliver of \"Pecan Bourbon Pie\" that's not that great. $1 extra gets you a scoop of vanilla ice cream that's obviously been melted and re-frozen. \n\nService is lackluster and overworked - one waitress for an entire section of about 10-15 tables and 5-8 booths. \n\nAnd, then there's the ear-piercing, heart-stopping SIREN that goes off and makes the entire restaurant jump out of their seats when someone orders the \"super hot\" spiciness.\n\nNot going back here again.
