The staff here are all amazing and very accommodating! Good ambience, relaxing, very clean! I originally came here to get help for my breakouts and scarring that's had been haunting me for years since I was in high school. Luckily i found a place that has been helping me ready my goals. Cindy, my Aesthetician, recommended laser genesis and it was amazing. I used to get bad breakouts and big pores but now after 6 treatments, my face looks good, not getting breakouts that much anymore and my pores has been looking tight. I'm getting good compliments from family, friends and co-workers. Now, I'm on my first laser resurfacing, I can't wait to see results. I'll keep you guys posted after a week or so. I highly recommend this place. It has helped me with insecurity issues and I haven't been more confident \ntil I get my treatment and gotten good results. Highly recommended!
