Drinking Floating, sun bathing, drinking, jumping off Rocks,\n\nI'm about to go to the Salt River, I always remember why I don't really want to go back every time I leave the place, trash, trashy people, smelly van rides,  But I seem to go back, its all about having a good time with friends while drinking and floating.  \nIts like going to Mexico, there are fears and there are good aspects. You don't really want to go but if you bring good company its a blast. \n\nPS people bring sheets to lay on the tubes so you don't melt to them or irritate your skin. \n\nHappy Tubing\nKevin
