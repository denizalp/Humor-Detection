This place is great. came on a lovely day and was able to sit on the patio facing kensington market. It's a great place to come for a pint and sausage of any kind. They  offer veal and other meats for sausage items. It includes sides of salad or fries or both. It's a great deal and I'll definitely be back! They have limited beer choices on tap but it ranges from light to medium brews.
