I had seen this restaurant mentioned in places new to Phoenix so I decided to head there for dinner when I was in town for work. I was really looking forward to indulging a bit. While the waiter was superb (I think his name was Francisco), my fettuccine was blah. It lacked excitement and the flavors were really dull. I'm totally down for fettuccine that isn't as creamy, and feels a bit lighter, but this version did not hit the spot. I almost asked for something else but found myself too exhausted and needing to head back to the hotel. Would definitely try something else if you head there as this dish was not \"it\". Sexy atmosphere, though, and great wait staff.
