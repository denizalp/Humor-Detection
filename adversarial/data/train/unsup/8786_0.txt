Thunderbird mountain is my favorite place to hike. There is so many different levels and types of hikes here so it's good for beginners and more experienced. It does get busy though so expect to see people. The view is beautiful esp on the south of pinnacle peak mountain because it over looks the  beautiful homes over the lakes. They have cute rock benches you can sit on at the top to rest before going back down. The mountain is a good mix of steps and flat where you can run. I get a great exercise and it take me about 45min-1hr to walk that first\/main mountain by dirt parking lot. It also has a pretty bridge you can cross to additional hiking trails. \n\nGreat place to hike with friends, significant other, and even families. I always see kids and dogs on this mountain which is fun. Highly recommend for hiking (:
