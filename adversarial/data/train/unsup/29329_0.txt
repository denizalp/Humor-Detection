5 stars to the Nail Spa\n5 stars to Heidi, who does great work!  (And I am pretty picky.)\n7 stars to the guy who did my pedi and killed the foot massage.  OMG.  \n\nGreat little salon...pleasant and lots of pedi chairs. Clean. I have been going there like clockwork, every 3 weeks, for over a year.  For a while I drove quite a ways, just to go to Mirage.\n\nOh ya, and they have the massaging pedi chairs that really massage deep!\n\nProbably the best compliment I can give them is that I get many compliments on my nails and people ask me, where do you go?  who does your nails?\n\nGreat job!
