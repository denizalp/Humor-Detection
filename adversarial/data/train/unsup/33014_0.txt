I've eaten at Red 8 three times now. This place is awesome. It's so difficult to find a restaurant that serves Kong Xin Cai! Since this is my favorite vegetable (the hollow-heart vegetable) I always get that. On the menu it's labeled as \"wok-fried water spinach, preserved bean curd.\" So that's what you're looking for.\n\nThis most recent time I had the curried Singapore rice vermicelli with shredded pork, shrimp, egg, and bean sprouts, as well as the wok-fried chicken in black bean sauce. I always share family style with a coworker. The bill is always $70 something, and I always use the corporate credit card. It's one of the few \"casual dining\" options at Wynn, and still obscenely expensive. It's all relative I guess. This place is relatively shabby as far as Wynn dining options go, only because they do not provide complimentary royal princesses from third-world vassal countries to massage your hands with slightly heated polished rubies every time you have to strain your fingers by cleaning your pasty pasty mouth with a wetnap made of a thousand dollar bill infused with a mixture of 1938 Clos du Mesnil champagne and the sweat of a virgin king cobra. If you look at it that way, this place is a shithole.\n\nI will continue to eat here anytime I get the chance.
