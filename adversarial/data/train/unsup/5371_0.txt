Worst massage I have ever received. I go to a lot of these massage places off the strip and understand you have to have an open mind as they can't be held to the same standard. However, Oasis Spa falls below this standard considerably. \n\nI bought a groupon for a couples massage. I use groupon a lot and have never had a problem with the spa services. I called ahead to set an appointment, and advised the woman I would be using a Groupon. The woman over the phone told me to not buy the groupon and to just come in to the shop and pay the same amount. I was confused by this because I typically call ahead before purchasing a Groupon and have never received this response. I was confused and questioned her about it and got \" ok ok ok just come in at 5\" \n\nI arrived to the appointment with my friend. She was friendly until I showed her the groupon and everything changed. She told me I would now have to wait longer because I purchased the Groupon. So how does this make any sense? I made an appointment for a 60 minute couples massage and my groupon is for a 60 minute couples massage. So we waited and were seen by two masseuses.\n\nThe masseuse was not pleasent either. She repeatedly would rub ON MY BONES. Why would massaging someones shin bone be benificial or thereaputic? I am not a professional but in all the massages I have paid for they massage my muscles. I have a hard time believing these were proffesionals at all. All the towels they used were incredibly scratchy, I dont know how someone could find such uncomfortable linens. \n\nAfter the massage came the \"Tipping Stage\" where your masseuses block you from leaving until you tip them. I shouldnt have tipped for the awful service but I did. I regret coming here. I should have listened to the poor reviews. Groupon has refunded me for what I paid for.\n\nIf you want a good massage at an affordable price I reccomend Sam's Spa on Charelston and Torrey Pines in the Walmart shopping center.
