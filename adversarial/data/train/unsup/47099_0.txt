So far I've visited Yorkdale's Cheesecake Factory twice and both visits were pretty great. Their selection of specialty dishes and cheesecakes is so large that it is a little overwhelming when it comes to choosing what to eat, especially for someone as indecisive as myself. \n\nThe first time I went, I tried the Chicken Madeira which was recommended by the server and the Tiramisu cheesecake. The Chicken Madeira is supposedly one of the most popular specialty items and it was really good; the chicken was very soft and the mashed potatoes were smooth and creamy. The size of the specialty dishes are very large, however they can be a little pricey (the Chicken Madeira costs $26). Although the portions are large, it may not be quite enough for two people. I shared the Chicken Madeira with a friend, however I think we both have a small appetite and we had plenty of bread with our dish. The Tiramisu cheesecake was very nice and light--would recommend!\n\nWhat's really great about the Cheesecake Factory is its unlimited bread and butter to keep you busy while you wait for your food to arrive. The servers are also pretty good at checking up on you and making sure that you have enough bread and water at all times. The servers I had during both visits were very friendly and attentive. \n\nAlthough the wait can be quite long, I'd much rather wait 1-2 hours to be seated at the Cheesecake Factory than dine at Pickle Barrel.
