I'm from Minnesota and in the Twin Cities, there isn't such a thing as good dim sum.  There is average dim sum, but not GOOD dim sum.  \n\nA few co-workers recommended this place for classic dim sum; so, I met up with them for what I was told was good food and great convo.  \n\nThis place is located in the older Chinatown in Scarborough.  It's attached to a large strip mall; well, it's surrounded by strip malls now that I think about it.  It's also about 5 minutes away from Pacific Mall, a large local mall filled with Chinese owned stores\/food\/groceries.  \n\nVery Fair has the classic interior\/exterior decor one would expect from a restaurant in the middle of Chinatown.  You make your way in, you're greeted by GIANT tanks of seafood, red\/gold all over the walls and large round tables throughout the restaurant.  This place has the classic dim sum service, old Chinese ladies, pushing carts around and trying to make you buy more dishes than you really need.  We arrived before 10AM, which means it was only $2C per dish (that's a DEAL).  \n\nThe food was amazing, simply amazing.  There were a number of items that I don't see back home in Minnesota that I had to get; fried quail and a few other things that I only know in Chinese.  On top of that, all the usual dim sum items were a billion times better than what I'm used too.  \n\nIf you have a sense of adventure and want to experience an amazing meal, hit this place for great dim sum.
