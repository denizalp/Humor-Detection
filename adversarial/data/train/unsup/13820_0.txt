So my Mum gave me a coupon to Las Velas. And let me say the free entree and the free queso appetizer that was ordered by someone else but accidentally brought to our table were the two highlights of the evening. My trip to the drugstore for Tums a couple hours later was the low point. Everything else was below average. I'd rather go to Chipotle across the street.
