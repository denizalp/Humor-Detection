I like this place but I didn't find it amazing. I got a salty crepe and a chocolate cake. The crepe was decent, there's nothing to rave or criticize about. I really enjoyed the cake. I went very out of my way for this restaurant and although it's a cute little place to go with a girlfriend for brunch, I don't think I'll go back just because it was so far.\n\nI would give it a try though if you live around the area!
