How come there are so many people here to greet you and none to fix your computer?\n\nAppointment? \"Genius?\" pshhhh... But aside from that - Well done Apple! I love this place in all it's non conventional retail environment. There's so many people that I get overwhelmed, but once inside you start to realize that the people are mostly just ambient noise. Not necessarily shopping, just parents pulled over from the rest of the mall for a second to give their tech addicted children a quick iPad fix. I can't blame them for being so enthralled, those things are freaking cool!\n\nThe staff now have grey shirts so they kind of blend into the background. It seems like they're just their shopping, but they're also quick to give you a hand if you appear to be one of the people who is actually shopping. \n\nThe best part about the Apple Store is  the sales people double as cashiers. Once you make your decision, you can just buy the product. There's no wandering through the masses again to find a massive line, no making appointments - just get and emailed receipt and you're on your way.\n\nI've bought a charging device, a Native Union charging device that broke right away, mighty mouse, headphones, portable speaker and plenty an over priced iPhone cable from here. $25 for a 1 metre cable? Come on...\n\nIt's alright though, all in all this store is friendly, efficient, and carries the best damn products. I so love my Macbook pro. A lot of Yelpin' has taken place on this bad boy.
