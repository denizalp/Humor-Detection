As I walk in I feel a sense and a vibe of freshness, and as I sit down I look around I feel at ease. The server comes with the menu and let me seat myself. Its cozy and and I sit down on the left hand couch. The table is too high for the couch which creates a weird posture for eating. I order a beer and wait for more of my party.\n\nThe vibe is pretentious and shallow. Our server, and not only our server, hovers constantly asking how things are, ask if there's anything we need, interrupts conversations several times.. this is not good service. This is bad service. I don't want someone constantly on my ass when I am engaged with friends in conversations, and it is clearly that we are and have ordered both meals and drinks. We are paying customers - pardon me for wanting some time with the people I came here to meet, and not have a fit with the servers. \n\nThe food was very pretty, and pridefully weird. It was more interesting than it was tasty and it is clear that the main goal is to use odd ingredients in an attempt to be hip, now and fusion. Sorry it does not work without tastiness. Novelty has a very short shelf life. Pigs ears do taste like pork rinds, no matter what kind of strange salad you bed it onto. And bone marrow.. as some love it, I find it difficult. The taste isn't that great and the texture requires motivation to handle. Motivation I personally cannot muster. \n\nThe establishment is beautiful, and I love the idea.. because it is swank, it is on point, but the follow through falls flat. Service, food and drinks are less than I expect to pay for this kind of beautiful hip place. And the price only accompanies the locale, and not the iffiness of the meal. It's painfully pretentious and pricey and I expected so much more. I have doubt that the local will still be here for long, so if you really want to eat here - hurry.
