I am checking this place out for the first. First impression, I came in the at the slow part of the day yet the staff was very attentive. I was quickly sat, promptly took my order. I ordered the spring roll and  Tai (Rare beef with Noods) add vegetables (the only think that was missed) I kind of like that the veggies didn't show, more broth .... really well made broth not to salty but with great density and flavor. My water cup was never lower than half way and the place was clean and smelled fantastic. I would give the 5th star had the bowls been a little bigger and the veggies hadn't been missed.
