Went there about a week ago on a COLD Monday night. It wasn't busy so getting excellent service was not a problem.  The food was wonderful. We ordered chivken paprikash, weinersnitzel, and stuffed cannage. All were very tasty and served at the perfect temperature. The sides were equally as good. The owner personally came out to greet us . Very nice, warm decor. Will definitely go back.
