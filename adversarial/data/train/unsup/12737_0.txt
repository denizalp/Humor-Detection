I attended a premiere here last night, and the staff was so friendly and rad! Not all the screens may be updated to the latest, hi-tech, digital AvX etc. etc. But the seats are comfy, clean, and I can see over tall people! And everyone politely shut their phones off when the show rolled around. Lovely! Am I biased, because I was sent home with an awesome gift? Nooooooo...\n\nYOU WILL GO TO EAU CLAIRE, OH YES. YOU WILL WATCH MOVIES, ONLY AT EAU CLAIRE... OH YES.\n\nP.S. Can't wait for the TV show (The Newsroom) to come on, on Sundays! Fascinating show with an awesome cast!
