You guys can go ahead and close the investigation, I figured out what the name means: \"Tups\" is from one of the owner's last name: Tupy. The more you know! ;)\n\nBilled as a specialty sandwich shop, I think the Village Greek Salad ($11) is the best in town. It's huge and easily makes two meals for me, even without the side of pita bread. The feta vinagrette is amazing, and made in house. \n\nShop is family owned and operated, with two (awesomely sweet!) teens running the register, grandma supervising, and dad(?) running the kitchen. As the signs say, it's fresh food not fast food- wait time is reasonable for the freshness, portion and quality are on par with the pricing.
