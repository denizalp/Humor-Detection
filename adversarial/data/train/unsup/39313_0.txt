One of my fave places to eat in Toronto. Great service and excellent food. A great combo of Mexican and Korean. All the tacos are amazing especially fish and chicken. Recent addition of BBQ items esp ribs are worth trying. Also, like all outposts of the Playa group, make the best margaritas. Highly recommended
