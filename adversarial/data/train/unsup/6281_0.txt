Was staying at the Hilton so we decided to have some dinner before heading back to the room.\n\nWe got seated pretty fast it wasn't too busy but did start to pick up a little bit during our dinner. Our order was taken pretty quick. Good arrived in reasonable time. But after that everything seemed to get slower. Maybe it was because it was getting busy but checks took extremely long to come. \n\nThe food was very mediocre. It was definitely not authentic Mexican food. Everything lacked in flavor and spice. I think the thing I enjoyed the most was the salsa that was brought out complimentary.
