We recently ordered food from here ( sambhar vada) my husband placed the order on phone and went to pick it up. He came home I opened the bag and there was no chutney of any kind and even the sambhar was like water!! No veggies whatsoever in two boxes of sambhar.. I immediately called the Restaurant but they were already closed. So I gave them a call next day just to explain what all was wrong with my order. So the person who took the order previous night was available so I talked to him and he was very apologetic. He said this mistake of ours can't be compensated and blah blah and he told me his name and asked me to order anything for free. Anyway I told him I don't need anything today so he said he is unavailable on Friday but is Available on the weekend. I said ok I will order something then. So today I called the restaurant and asked for him. And to my horror he completely changed his statement. He was like i asked you to order the same order on the same day!!!!!! I was shocked with such rudeness and such a poor customer service. I said no this is not what you said uh clearly told me that u would be here on weekend and u would take care of it. HE DENIED!!!!!! I was like you know what let it be I don't need your compensation just take my order and he was like ok! But my husband heard the conversation and he got so pissed that he asked me to cancel the order. So I told him that you know what let it be I don't want to order anything. And that guy simply said ok and hung up!! \n\nWell if someone wants to loose a customer he should take classes from this restaurant. Never ever going back to this place. Where they don't respect the customer.
