Good coffee. Good prices. Get an XL coffee not dark roast double double with an apple fritter and enjoy... about $5 .\n\nStaff seems happy. They give me extra bacon on the egg\/bacon with english muffin...\n\nThe everything bagel with herb and garlic cream cheese can't be beat...\n\nDark Roast Tim Horton's coffee makes me throw up... notified Toronto food safety about this... I think its an allergy.\n\nCheers\nAndrew\n\n(c) Copyright 2017. Andrew M. Walduck. Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
