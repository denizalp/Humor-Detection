This was a disaster of a Job.\n\nThey were called out to fix 2 problems and one of them was the problem of the spin cycle and that it was getting stuck at 6 minutes, when it did finish the clothes were not spun correctly and soaked, and then it totally lost power.\n\nFirst step was to get power back to the washing machine, That was easy job for them, the power board was burnt out and needed to be replaced.  \n\nThe technician then said all is fixed, I said what about the initial problem you were called out for?  \"The Spin Cycle\"  He said all is OK and fixed!\nThe Technician did not even run it through the entire spin cycle to see if the washing machine was truly fixed. \n\nWhen He left I started to wash a load of clothes, OMG, same problem!  I was so mad and frustrated!\n\nSo I called the office and I asked when they were going to fix the initial problem that they were called out for, They said they will send it to the evaluation department, I also asked for the manager to call me!  No Call back from the Manager!\n\n3 Hours later that day I get a call from another company stating that they were to do I second opinion on the washing machine!  \" Was totally surprised and caught off guard.  I said What?  There was not even the first opinion done up by ABM Appliance. I was so mad and frustrated again of ABM Appliance doing their job, they pushed it back to American Home Shield \"AHS\" to get another contractor to evaluate it.  How Unprofessional and Unethical.  They did not even have the common courtesy to call me and let me know!\n\nThe reality is that there is only two basic other things it could of been, and they decided to leave me the customer hanging with delay of getting another contractor to finish the job they were initially called out for and should of completed!\n\nI NEVER recommend ABM Appliance for any job!\n\nGod Speed!  Jake Out For Now!
