I actually thought this place was great - not sure why all the other reviews are so negative!\nWe went here on a nice summer night and sat on the patio. The service was excellent from the waiter, and the manager even came out to check on us at one point. The food was hot and fresh when it came out - we ordered a few apps and one main course. I live in the neighbourhood so I'll be making this one of my go-to restaurants when I eat out.
