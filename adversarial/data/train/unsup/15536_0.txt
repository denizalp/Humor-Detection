I just can't. I tried to be nice and patient but I couldn't. I walked in on time for my appointment and still had to wait. They staff barley acknowledged me. After checking in I wanted in the front and was called in after maybe 15 mins. Okay, that's fine it happens. I was told to go to room three which was occupied then moved over to room two. They took my X-rays. No problems there, here is where I got mad. I sat in the chair and waited for half an hour for the doctor to see me. He check me for cavities and then said the hygienist would be there soon. After waiting another half an hour the X-ray tech came back and asked me to fill out a survey. My main reason for coming was for cleaning and still hadn't happen, that survey was filled out completely for them. Then the doctor came back and asked me if I was tired, yes tired of waiting. It had been an hour since I walked in. Finally I was over to the cleaning office and waited another 10 mins and then the hygienist walked in and explain she had to go take care of her kids. That's really not my problem, then preceded to hit me in the head and let water drip down my face into my shirt. Worst expertise ever, I can't imagine if I was afraid of the dentist, it might have been worse. I won't be going back in six months. Not happening.
