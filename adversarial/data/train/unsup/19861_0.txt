I did it... I splurged.  I bought the most beautiful pair of Stuart Weitzman shoes to wear on my wedding day.  \n\nI'd been shopping for that perfect pair of shoes for months.  Being a size 6 with an image in my head of a platform peep toe shoe of sorts did not make my search easy.  I searched online and in a bunch of shoe stores with no luck.  I saw a SW pair online but I didn't have luck finding my size.  That is, until I met Amelia.\n\nI was shopping at the Biltmore with my friend and fellow yelper Cindy C a few weeks ago, and she forced me in to look at the Stuart Weitzman store. (Ok - she didn't force me, but she insisted we go in \"just to look\").  Once inside, we met Amelia (the sales person), and I told her about the shoes I'd seen online... she had me try on a similar shoe to that to confirm my size and then did some magic and found my size in the shoe I wanted.  She then told me that after the wedding, she could die the shoes black so I could wear them again and again. Hearing that was music to my ears.  It was exactly what I needed to hear to convince me to do it.  \n\nMy shoes came in the following week, and they fit me like Cinderella's glass slipper...  well, maybe not exactly like that, but I'm pleased to say the least.  I am so excited to wear my beautiful new shoes on my wedding day and beyond.  \n\nIf you're looking to splurge on a pair of shoes, go visit Amelia at the Stuart Weitzman Biltmore Store... it may have been my first visit in there, but I am sure it will not be my last.  I may even look back one day and say that this is when my shoe fetish began.  And it's all thanks to Cindy, Amelia, and of course to Stuart Weitzman!
