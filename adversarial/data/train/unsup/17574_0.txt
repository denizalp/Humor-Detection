Coffee Hunter just makes me feel like I'm Katniss Everdean. I'm on the hunt for some legit coffee while I'm in Vegas and thru the help of Yelp (of course), I found this place. Walking in, I definitely felt a hipster vibe. The place has a lot of blacks and browns and artwork on the wall of Bob Marley and others. They server Stumptown coffee in addition to other specialty beans that I believe change frequently. Besides the normal espresso drinks like pour overs, they have an extra menu for lattes. Ask the server for what exactly the drinks are because even with the names, you won't know what you are actually getting. Since I was trying some place new, I decided to not get a boring black coffee. I instead got a Honeycomb and an Almond Alegria.\n\nThe Honeycomb is essentially a vanilla latte with honey. It was pretty good.Not too sweet, which was something I was afraid of when I saw honey and latte. The milk was smooth and pretty much you could inhale the entire drink in one gulp. The Almon Alegria was almond milk latte with a hint of macadamia (if i remember correctly). The taste was a little strange at first, possibly because I've never had almond milk but eventually the taste grows on you. Definitely a great drink if you are into almond or cashew butter.\n\nThe server was so thoughtful that she even gave us a couple of donuts. We had a powdered sugar donut with raspberry filling and a bacon maple cronut. THe sugar donut was pretty average, though a bit on the hard side but the bacon maple cronut was amazing. The flaki-ness with the bacon and maple was a great combination. It went well with the lattes. Not too sweet with the maple and you get that savory bite with the bacon. It was great to get them free as well of course.\n\nI will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas. The drink sizes are a bit small but the taste is worth it. The added freebies might have enticed me to want to come back as well. ;)
