I stopped today to try the lunch buffet.  What a great idea it was and thanks to my fellow Yelpers for their reviews that helped me make my decision.\n\nThe restaurant was almost empty when I arrived at 12:30.  Service was excellent and I know it would have been even if there were a lot of people there.\n\nWhile I was looking the buffet over, the waiter brought me an iced tea as requested.  Shortly after returning to the table, another server brought me a basket of fresh naan.\n\nHere's what I tried:\n\nVegetable pakora - good but not a lot of spice\ngoat curry - nice spice and very tasty\nsaag paneer with cheese - flavorful with a nice zing\nbasmati rice - standard\nnaan - plain and good\nchana masala - excellent with a nice spiciness\nbhindi masala - this was noted as a house favorite.  I didn't think there was anything special about the okra nor the potatoes and it lacked much flavor\nnavratan lorna - good\nkarahi lamb - nice flavor and good spice\nchicken tikka masala - excellent\nras malai - excellent sweet to end this feast\n\nLest you worry that I cleaned the place out, let me assure you I didn't.  I took small portions of all these things just to try them.  Since I was alone, I had a great time watching the Bollywood Bang-Bang music videos on their TV screens.  \n\nI'm anxious to come back for a relaxed dinner with friends and enjoy being served and trying some things on the evening menu that don't show on the buffet.
