Best juice cleanse in Charlotte! Quality of ingredients is top notch--all organic, in glass bottles and you even get an awesome reusable insulated bag. We juice as a group twice a year during a conference and McKenzie is always super nice and accommodating with last minute orders\/swapping juices, etc.\nWE LOVE LUNA !!
