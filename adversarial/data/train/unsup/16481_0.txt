My fiancee and I Decided to try this place out last night around 5:30-6ish. We were pleased to find we made it for happy hour. One bartender said hello to us and walked away. The other bartender didn't even acknowledge us for about 10 minutes. Keep in mind there were 6 people at the bar including the 2 of us and the bar is not big. We ordered beers and he handed us menus. We looked over the happy hour menu and were thinking of ordering something. While looking over the menu's the bartender was dropping F bombs and extrememly rude to another patron. Don't get me wrong, I drop F bombs quite frequently but never while i'm working, it's just bad taste....I dont care what kind of job you have.  Our beers were dry for a long time before the rude bartender even asked if we wanted another OR order food. My fiancee used the restroom and decieded eating here would be a bad idea as they were dirtier than dirty. Meanwhile a cook came out of the kitchen with food at sat at the bar to eat it. The rude bartender yells across the bar to the cook \"COOKS CANT SIT AT THE BAR, NATES RULE\".  Poor guy got up and sat at an empty table away from the bar. Again bad taste. At this point we decided we had enough of this place and would not be returning. EVER. I am thankful we didn't try the food. There are plenty of other dive bars in Chandler with good service and clean restrooms.
