I play in Lost in Lies very often at Joe's Grotto next door to here, so every show night my band eats here before the show. They always take fantastic care of us, almost always with a table of 7 or more with split checks. The food is hot and fresh, the Chili paste is deliciously spicy, everything is just the way it should be. Highly suggest garlic chicken and house special beef.
