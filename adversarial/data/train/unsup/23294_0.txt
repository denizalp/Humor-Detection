Went for dinner and drinks with friends.\n\nFood was absolutely disgusting!!! I work in the industry and have reasonable expectations, but it was just plain awful. \n\nDrinks were good, so not complains on that.\n\nThe worst part was that it is filled with half naked waitresses that flirt with older corporate man. ..so degrading.\nWe felt extremely uncomfortable by looking at client GRABBING & RUBBING waitress lower back and....other parts, while she seemed quite pleased with it. \n\nOverall feel of a cheap strip bar and not a restaurant downtown.
