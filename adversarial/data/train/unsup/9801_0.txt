Supplement shops are a dime a dozen in Vegas. TN crossed my radar when I sampled their Cinnamon Roll protein at a fitness event- think Horchata, but with nutritional value. I was an easy sale, and the $10 off referral card was a nice bonus. \n\nGENERAL CRITICISMS: Selection here is small and their main protein line (including the product I came in for) is only offered in 5 pound tubs, which is a lot both in portion size and price. Their \"regular\" price is like $80, and their \"VIP\" pricing is closer to $60. You don't get the discounted VIP pricing til your second purchase once you are in their system. If I ever even finish 5 pounds of protein without getting bored of the flavor, maybe that will be something to look forward to, but it's a turnoff for first time customers. \n\nMY EXPERIENCE: I called ahead about the product I wanted, arrived 10 minutes later and was told the last tub was just sold to the customer before me. Employee apologized and helpfully arranged for one be brought over from another location for pickup the next day, and would honor the VIP pricing and discount. Ultimately, that did happen, but it took four days and me initiating all contact because no one ever called me as they'd said. Staff were polite, just lacked follow through. Bonus points for free samples with purchase.
