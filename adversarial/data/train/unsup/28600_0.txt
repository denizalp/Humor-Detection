This place is a great challenge. Tight fairways and fast greens. The only issue i had was on their Million Dollar hole that is advertised there was no course rep to verify if you in deed hit a hole in one. For a Friday before memorial day at 11am you would think someone would be working it. gladly I did not hit a ace but it would have nice to even have the opportunity. I did hit one within a inch on hole 12. I would recommend playing here once as it is a tough  course.
