This store is amazing. I love the location in Carr Mill Mall, it feels like an apothecary and fits the building nicely. They make pure perfume oils based on favorite designer perfumes, specific notes, as well as have a collection of their own blends. The designer collection are excellent matches, I doubt I will ever go back to spray perfumes with additives, etc... as long as this place exists. \n\nThe oils are long lasting and never give me any headache associated with traditional spray perfumes (rather than oils) but dry down fast and aren't overwhelming either. I even use them sometimes as aromatherapy to help me drift to sleep. \n\nI've also ordered online through the fragrance shop and the experience was just as lovely. They gave me free shipping even though I didn't have the coupon code and was not even aware of the incentive, along with a sweet handwritten note.\n\nI really like the option of the 4 mini size. You can make sure to get your classic scent(s) plus try something new. They are basically travel size, but because of the excellent quality and need to only use sparingly, would last much longer than any trip. If you are on the fence about trying a place like this, just because you don't know much about the reverse engineering perfume industry or reputation, don't hesitate. \n\nIf you can't figure out which designer perfume is which online, I would say call the store and they'll be able to help. I imagine some of the names are copyright protected so that's why they aren't listed on the site.
