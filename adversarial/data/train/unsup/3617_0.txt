dirty, dirty, dirty\n\ndirty house music? oh yes! dirty pool and dirty people? HELL TO THE NO.\n\nwe checked in with the attendant near the coffee bean at Venetian and told him who we were with, we got stamped and were shown to the 4th floor elevator. we took up the elevator and walked thru what it seemed like an eternity to get to Tao Beach. \n\nthe house music was on par, the crowd was going off but seriously, looking at that place and the people made me want to take a shower.\n\nthe pool is the size of a double jacuzzi and the water was a nice dark dingy almost seafoam green color. see the picture\n\nhardly any place to stand. i know for sure there musta been a fire code being broken because there were WAY too many people up in there. it's like a closet with a kiddie pool in the middle.\n\nif you are to go, book a cabana or you better go super early and grab that huge day bed to the left of the main bar because other than that, there's no room for anything\n\nthe crowd there was trashy. it's a mix of Rehab meets wanna be Jersey Shore meets crackheads. i don't mind that mixture if you isolate themselves..but to combine all 3 in a small cramped place?  hell to the effing no.\n\nroger sanchez is gonna be here on LDW, but even for roger.. i'll sit it out and listen to him at a better venue than this spot
