This is the perfect spot for someone looking just to be able to get your daily workout in without being in a crowded standard gym. they have all the basics you need.. in my book has everything i need, nothing more nothing less. Small, not crowded, 24\/7 access even on holidays. only downside is there  are no showers, so just make sure you give yourself time to get home and shower if you need to be somewhere after your workout. ( would have gave 5 stars if had showers)Also which is nice is you can watch what you want on one of the t.v's, compared to other gyms where your forced to watch what they put on.  Also you have the option to pay month to month which is AWESOME since a contract with a gym is like  a marriage, so you def do not feel trapped with this place.  Cant beat low prices. glad i found this place and glad its a low key kind of place since workout time for me is exactly that and not social hour.YAY for snap fitness!
