Just walking in, my mouth watered from the smell.\n\nClean place, lovely staff, $18 taxes in\n\nBathroom is too far of a walk lol\n\nDessert selection is aweful. Just ice cream.\n\nBut everything is super delis, \n\nIm not ashamed to say i had 3 plates full of carbs, totally worth the food baby.\n\nFor sure going back,
