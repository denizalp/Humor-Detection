It's a slow bleed, but it's OK.\n\nRio is off the strip, so if you're here, you have to pay to get somewhere interesting or maybe there's a shuttle. I don't really know if there is. The casino is fine. It's dark, a little cramped, but not nasty or depressing.\nThe hotel rooms are fine, but it's missing some normal things you would expect from a decent hotel. You get a single shampoo\/conditioner combo bottle and a bar of soap. No coffee maker, no turnover service, not even a minibar. But it's clean, and the decay is superficial. My room had distressed wallpaper and some holes in the drywall.\nWhile you're staying here, you will be slowly bled by surcharges and unfriendly approaches to customer service all over the place. There is a big resort fee, which is the norm for resort hotels. Soda is $3 for a bottle in the vending machine (and for some reason $3.75 in the shops). Alcoholic drinks are $8, or $23 at the pool. Starbucks is inexplicably priced 30% higher than anywhere else. Printing your damned boarding pass is $5. The biggest indignity is the bottle of sunblock in the gift shop, priced at $17.50. This is a life-saving safety product, and they're fleecing you for it. I'm fine with the casino making money, but after all of this, I'm starting to feel pretty unwelcome.\nThe staff is nice, but they're not trying to make you feel like a VIP. That's OK.\n\nGood: Clean. Your convention is already here Large rooms. Polite staff.\nBad: Everything is a damned upcharge. Off-strip, but it doesn't feel like a value.\nTips: Bring your own sunblock. Eat at the buffet at the Gold Coast across the street. Get your Liquor at the shop at the Gold Coast. Maybe you should stay at the Gold Coast.
