If you love shortbread these are the cookies for you.  I wasn't familiar with Honolulu Cookie Company and I'm not a huge shortbread fan but all the flavors sounded great pineapple, mango, coconut, macadamia nut, chocolate so I got a variety box.  I got one of almost every flavor and they all tasted the same to me.  They tasted like regular shortbread cookies with just a hint (sometimes not even that) of the flavor they were supposed to be.  I guess I was just expecting something different.  The man working was busy on his phone and not very personable.  They have samples but I didn't notice until I had already bought a box.  Would have been nice to have been greeted or offered a sample when I came in.  Glad Hawaii peeps can get their fix though.  They have a punch card so if you love them get one of those and earn free cookies.
