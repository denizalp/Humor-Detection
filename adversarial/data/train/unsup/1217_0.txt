I  was at your club on Saturday July 15th.  I was asked by a girl named Danny to go to VIP.  There she charged me 150 instead of 125 like the add said on the table.   She then asked for a 20.00 tip. So she go 170.00 from  me for a 10 minute VIP show which was supposed to had been a 15 minute show. She also told me that if I  gave her 1000.00 we could do more.  I was very disappointed in her show and the way she represented the club.  I had been in your club along time ago when I was visiting Vegas.  Now that I live here it's no way to treat a new local.  I honestly don't know if I will back to club again if the girls are going to pull this type of stuff.
