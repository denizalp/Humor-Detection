This place is very good. The only issue I have with the place is that they don't have prices\/names\/description on some of their products. Bring Chinese, a lot of the items in this place was very new to me. I felt adventurous and tried a random bun with chocolate o top of it... \n\nIt was a good experience overall! I was expecting cream or custard in it :( but there was none. The damn bun was probably larger then my fist... I will post a picture for reference! \n\nThe tiramisu was very delicious too! Not too sweet and just perfect with a cup of coffee. Unfortunately, this was pretty large too... There goes my diet...
