The first thing I saw when I walked in was a beautiful floral department- pleasant way to start my shopping experience! That led perfectly into the brightly colored produce department with oddly sensual mood lighting- all the better to hid imperfections on organic produce with? I don't know, but organic was stamped on nearly everything, to the point that you had to really look for regular produce. I will say that I liked the clear boxes storing the produce in the wall sections, it made the department look cleaner and more organized than usual.\n\nFound the clearance section in the small hall between the meat and bakery departments along the back wall- everything maxes out at half off, and most of the selection is niche-market goods that are typically overpriced in the first place (gluten-free chocolate chunk cookie mix, miniature salted chocolate bars for original price $5, etc), but right across is a freezer section with some clearance items too- snagged a pint of frozen vanilla greek yogurt for $2, nice!\n\nThe cat food\/litter aisle was priced similarly to Smith's, which is another way of saying overpriced unless you go for the ghetto bottom-shelf bagged variety. I have no idea how\/why people spend $10 on gravel for their cats to poop on- this chain is wack.\n\nThe service when checking out was a little awkward. I worked with Rocky, who is a manager. When checking out, with a huge line, I was informed that I would need to fill out an application for their membership card in order to get the sales price- even though I'm not from here (and have the TX license to back it up) and haven't lived anywhere they have locations, and there isn't one anywhere near me. She pushed it, which was a little irritating- as a manager, I know there is a way to simply swipe a store card and move on. Maybe if the line hadn't been six-deep this wouldn't have been an issue, but there was an audible sigh of frustration from the two people who overheard behind me in line.\n\nTL;DR: look for sales, regular prices are high, get a card or they won't honor their prices.
