If you are looking for a good banh mi in Madison, this is the place to go.  We had the grilled, marinated pork and one with pickeled veggies and the marinated pork one was far better. Finally, a place in Madison with delicious banh mi! Previous reviewers have said their bread is lackluster, yet I'd disagree, the French bread was top notch. We also had egg rolls, spring rolls and the pork and shrimp bun. All were authentic Vietnamese dishes and tasted great. The homemade chili sauce is a must. I would disagree with other reviewers comments about slow service, we had a very attentive server both times we dined here. I noticed they added on Thai and Chinese entrees to their specials, yet I'd say the Vietnamese food here is the star.
