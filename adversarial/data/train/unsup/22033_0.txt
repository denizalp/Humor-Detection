I knew going in, the ordering system might be a little bit of a C.F., but it actually wasn't too bad.  There was a friendly young woman by the entrance guiding the flow of traffic and she gave us a menu and pointed us toward the register.  We were there around noon on a Saturday.  We ordered with no problems and I suffered from mild sticker shock, but nothing obscene.  Two burgers, the truffle fries, and 2 beers were $39.67 before tip.\n\nWe shared the Thunderbird chicken sandwich, the truffle fries, and the Magic Shroom burger plus bacon (of course).  Mr. M had a Oak Creek Nut Brown and I tried Four Peaks' Peach ale.  \n\nWhen I ordered my sandwich I knew it had poblano peppers and chipotle mayo on it and thought for a split second that it might be a little too spicy for my taste, but actually, it had very little flavor at all.  Kind of shocking.  The grilled chicken breast was good quality and moist, but that sandwich was completely bland.\n\nThe truffle fries were just ok.  They were soaked with the oil, soggy, and not really that appealing.  Mr. M's shroom burger was the real winner.  The blend of flavors of good quality beef, mushrooms, bacon, and pesto was perfect!  I would definitely get that again.  \n\nService overall was really top notch and everyone was very friendly.  Our server Riley had several tables and she was hustling and smiling the whole time.  I didn't care for the techno music and all the rabid children.  When we were finished we asked ourselves if we would come back and we both said maybe.  \n\nIf I were to return I'd definitely just sit at the bar and for sure get the shroom burger again.  I read that happy hour pricing is pretty good too, so if I do return and have a better experience I'll be sure to update my review, but for now it's just A-OK to us.
