I grabbed my usual poke bowl today and the cashier was very nice. However the girl who usually prepares the food did not seem friendly, she seemed to be a new hire as she didnt give me the same portions I have recieved for the past 5+ times I have eaten here. I was very disappointed in the amount of food I was served for the price. I felt as if I was ripped off. Not quite sure if i will be coming back to this place again.
