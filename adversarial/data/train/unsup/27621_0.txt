As far as a great getaway boutique hotel in a nice area close to the strip it is great!!! Stayed there a couple nights. The rooms are very lovely & comfy. Reception & staff are great! If you want to gamble you can always walk directly across the street to the Hard Rock that cost much more each night.  It was a nice calm & private place to enjoy my stay in Vegas & only a $5 cab ride to the wildness & fun of the strip.  \n\nAlso a great thing about them was the fact that I had an incident where a cab driver who picked me up at Rumor & upon arriving at my destination drove off with my items. The cab company asked for the cab number & they immediately checked out the incident & gave me the cab number being a great lifesaver for a rude cabbie who wanted to run off with my items.  Thanks!!!
