True rating: 3.5.\nPros: solidly tasty food, generous helpings, customizable spice levels, unobtrusive background music\nCons: eclectic\/tacky\/outdated decor, cramped booth seating, dim lighting, a little pricey, slight lag in service, no website (god forbid I enter a restaurant without researching it as much as possible on the internet 5 minutes before we step inside)\nHighlights: more than 8 kinds of naan, samosa addicts central\n\nSOME HISTORY:\nAs a Clevelander (dare I call myself that?  I think I will!) whose had her mind\/tastebuds\/soul blown away by takeout fare from the Saffron Patch in Shaker Heights, I held high expectations for this Akron establishment under the same name.\n\nAnd happily, those expectations were mostly met, if not exceeded.  Turns out, the Akron location was the original hatching ground for the Saffron Patches in Cleveland today.  While holding the same name, Akron's Saffron Patch is not affiliated with the Cleveland brand--it was sold to and currently owned by the Cleveland owner's friend.    Which explained the minor differences: fluffier naan, less saffron but more aromatic jasmine flavor in the rice, mushier, less tangy green chutney, etc.  \n\nTHE SKINNY:\nWith that bit of genealogy out of the way, the food was decidedly fresh and flavorful.  Early dinner for two hungry couples quickly became a mini-feast of sorts: \n\nTo start: Samosa chat (2 samosas halved, perfect for 4 people) with chickpeas, veggies and sauce on the side\nLibations: Lassi (one salty, one mango, each arriving in tall pint glasses), Taj Mahal, Flying Horse (both 22 oz)\nEntrees (all curries): chicken makhani, lamb vindaloo (requested 4 out of 5 on the spiciness scale), mutter paneer, accompanied by a bottomless bowl of saffron rice\nExtras: Naan basket special--4 pieces each of the garlic naan, honey naan (extra fluffy!), the one with onions and potatoes, the one with cashews and cranberries.  \n\nThe result: four painfully overfed adults, huge bag of leftovers and sadly no room for dessert.  Though the last of the naans--the one with cranberries--had a delicate sweetness that made me want to eat it by itself rather than dipping it in the curries\/using it to pick up rice.  So I did.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\nProbably one of the best, if not the best Indian food you'll find in Akron. So what if the lights sometimes flicker, the waitstaff looks like they could be the real-life, chain-smoking counterparts to college-aged models in Colors of Bennington ads, and the interior looks as if the Indian grandmama you've always wanted tried her best to instill some Old Country luxe out of what plastic-covered furniture and crudely exotic, Indian-evoking artwork she could find at the only local Oriental curios shop in town.\n\nI'm not Indian so I can't say how authentic it is, but all I can attest to is this: Saffron Patch of The Valley, Akron can make same damn good grub.
