I love the atmosphere. Walking into an old house with bars on the windows just screams \"Mexican food made by angels\". The tacos are always killer with fresh meat and delicious cheese. The shells are always freshly fried and made to order. \n\nThe only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the anxiety I get when I walk in. It's cramped, busy, and slightly warmer than it is outside. I have pretty bad anxiety so I have to be in the right mood to go here. But it is always worth it.
