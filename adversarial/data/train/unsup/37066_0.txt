We happened by this place and thought would give it a try.  \n\nThis is a very small and simple shop, offering just bubble tea and Taiwanese wheel cakes which are made to order. There is very limited seating, best take it to go. \n\nThe staff here were pleasant and patient with our enquries. Service was a bit slow but it was coz the wheel cakes takes 20 min to make. \n\nThe bubble tea were pretty good, with the roasted tea aroma showing through the milk (more on this) and sweetness. I wish they'd use more natural ingredients though. They used milk powder instead of fresh milk for most of the drinks.  Flavoured drinks are also achieved with powder instead of real juice. I guess is difficult when you have a small working space. The bubble were pretty good.  Chewy, soft and slightly sweet. \n\nThe wheel cake has a texture that's slightly different from the real taiwanese wheel cakes. Its more fluffy. I must say i was hoping for the authentic taiwanese flavour. They were very generous with the filling, but then this means that the cakes were in a bit of a danger of falling apart.
