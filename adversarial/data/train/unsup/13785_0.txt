When it comes to carbs, go big or go home. Sure, their Cape Seed Loaf is as delicious as it is healthy. But they have a standout white loaf (Vienna? Farmers?) that is pillowy soft on the inside, slightly chewy-crusty on the outside, and all sorts of perfect. Have them slice it thick, then bring it home and enjoy it like I do, with fresh butter or a schmear of Nutella. If, by some miracle, you have some left over in a day or two, use it to make the best French Toast ever. \n\nBesides the fabulous bread, the people that work there are the nicest around. I almost wish they were mean bread-nazi's, though, since that would deter me from heading over there every time I have a hankering for a fresh loaf (which is often). Unfortunately, I've never had a bad experience at Cobs, so I will keep heading there on a regular basis, zombie-like, salivating and moaning, \"BREAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD\"
