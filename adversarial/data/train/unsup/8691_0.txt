\"Life is too short to miss out on beautiful things like a double cheeseburger.\" â€• Channing Tatum\n\nDang, that char on that burger is no joke.  My friend's double bacon cheeseburger put my hatch chile burger to shame but it's all good.  The hatch chile burger had good flavor, a nice char, and came wrapped up like a newborn baby.  I hate it when I get a burger with no wrapper and the juice slides all over the place.  The fries came unsalted which I actually appreciate.  Crispy on the outside, fluffy and creamy on the inside.  It was the perfect fry.\n\nIf this place wasn't so far, I can see myself eating here more often.  It's a modest sized place with lots of booths and tables for you to sit at.  The staff is friendly and the menu is huge!  Stop into Sammy's if you're in the area.  You won't regret it.
