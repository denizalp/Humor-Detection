What use to be 1 of the best buffets in Vegas shockingly has gone down hill!  I had a slight idea when I saw the cheaper price in front of the line.  Everything tasted bland and selection of quality food was minimal .  I haven't been to this buffet in a while and just comparing my experiences in the past when it was known as 1 of the best, if not the best.  Was disappointed, but 'B buffet' in the casino next door erased all the bad new memories here.
