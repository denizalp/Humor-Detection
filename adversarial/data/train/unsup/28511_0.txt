My family had an unexpected passing and it was devastating. On top of being emotionally overwhelmed we were financially overwhelmed, we had to get my loved one transported to the state we lived in, Davis Funeral home offered a service that to my surprise not every funeral home has, and that was to finance our funeral bill. Instead of having to pay thousands of dollars upfront we were given the financing option through a company they work with and it gave us time to sort out the affairs. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts to all the staff for your kindness and compassion.
