Whoa! That's the one word that came out of my mouth exactly 3 times when I walked into this place. I came here because I was in the area and it came up on yelp in the dive bar category. Also, being of German heritage myself, I thought it might be a sort of mini hofbrau haus. Yeah, I was mistaken. Don't get me wrong, this is an interesting place with lots of character. Really though, this place has much more of a VFW or local legion or senior citizen center feel to it. I'd take my grandparents here. Hell, I'd even take my parents here. Take it from me though, you really wouldn't want to bring a date here.
