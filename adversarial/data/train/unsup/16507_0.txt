3.5 stars for their crepes only. I didn't have the extra calories in me to try any of their wonderful desserts. \n\nMy sis and I ordered both a savory and sweet crepe. We ordered the Royal crepe (grilled chicken, sauteed mushrooms, bacon and cheddar cheese) and it was just ok to me. The crepe itself was some sort of wheat crepe that we weren't a fan of. We barely got any pieces of mushrooms and it was actually too creamy for me. \n\nWe were on a time crunch so we ordered the Exotic crepe to go. However they forgot that we ordered it to go but just added a top to cover it for us. We tasted a little bit of it before we headed out. All of the fruit with the sauce was delicious. The coconut sorbet was really good too and had tons of coconut flakes. Unfortunately they didn't pack the sorbet separately so by the time we got to the car it was a melted mess. \n\nI also ordered an iced caramel macchiato and that I liked a lot. All three items were a little over $25 before tax and tip. A little pricey for the experience we had but I still would want to come back and try their other lovely desserts! I regret not getting just *some* thing.
