My baby daddy and I love a good French date night. Unfortunately, the realities of work, a toddler and the daily grind have made this luxury an impossibility lately. I spotted a hole in both of our calendars this week, so I jumped at the chance for us to have a childless lunch date. \n\nWe wandered down Queen W and La Palette popped out at both of us. We snuggled up at one of their cute, colourful tables and got down to delicious business: Sparkling water, (a little) ros√©, fromage fondante (deep fried cheese, yes) and steak frites. It was all perfection. \n\nOui will be back. Often.
