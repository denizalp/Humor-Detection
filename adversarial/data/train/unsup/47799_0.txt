I ordered the Texas \"Moo Shroom\" Po Boy and it was delicious. Portabella, caramelized onions, red peppers and espresso bbq sauce? UNF. Seriously though, that sauce was amazing. \n\nThe thyme fries were perfectly seasoned and not at all greasy. They were a little thin and \"stick-like\" for my preference but I still ate all of them! That's the only reason I gave the place four stars instead of five. \n\nI had no complaints about the staff and my order was brought to my table in no time. I'll definitely be returning to Green!
