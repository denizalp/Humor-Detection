Really nice place. They are remodeling so it will look pretty cool soon. Everybody is friendly. Prices are reasonable. Kelly is a newbie and is still hourly but did a fantastic job with my hair and the owner came by several times to watch her progress and teach (as it should be). Great place. I will be coming back.
