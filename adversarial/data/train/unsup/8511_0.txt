Came in Saturday with a friend upon entering we were loudly told ...no appointment you must go come back...called on Monday and made an appointment for 2 pedicures at 6pm the next day...arrived at 5:55 ..waited until we were told to go back to the pedicure baths at 6..the pedicure baths were still dirty and the foot support had lotion and something else gross  on it...a women came in filled up the foot bath with plain water and there we sat and sat for a half hour ..we finally had to leave when the pedicure water got cold...the entire time we waited Danny and Vincent were at the nail bar doing another employees nails while her friend who appeared to have too much wine kept placing her dirty pedicure slippers on top of the nail bar...Danny nor Vincent seemed to mind and cont chatting and laughing...upon leaving I told the rude young man who is always at the front that this was unacceptable and I would be leaving a bad review on Yelp..he responded with \"cool\"
