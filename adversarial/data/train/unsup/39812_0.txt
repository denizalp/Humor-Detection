Went there on Labor Day weekend for lunch. Spicy beef noodle is average, soup is ok but noodles taste like low quality packaging stuff. Waitress is cold. No smile or greetings. Just came to us and took out a note, started to write what we said then left. Would never go there for this type of service.
