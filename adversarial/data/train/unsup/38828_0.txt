The absolute worst experience I've had in Montreal. Paid a $15 cover when the club was completely empty.  Understandable, that is bound to happen from time to time.  Asked for a scotch on the rocks from the bartender and got literally a third of a shot.  I asked why the drink was so small and she replied \"that's how they pour drinks in Montreal\". However it was half of what I'd received anywhere else.  Be wary of coming here for drinks.
