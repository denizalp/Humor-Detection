Who doesn't like sweet and yummy comfort food?! This place is the epitome of, well let's say a comfort snack!! \n\nPink Box has some of the most creative donuts ever!  Always something new and exciting.  This morning we stopped in to bring some joy to work since it happens to be Halloween. They had donuts dressed up as bats, eyeballs and ghosts! How creative! They do the same for all holidays! \n\nThe staff here is extremely friendly and always work fast to get us outta there.  I would suggest if you need lots of donuts, order ahead!!! \n\nThey do offer hot coffee and other cold drinks too. Located off Buffalo and Lake Mead.
