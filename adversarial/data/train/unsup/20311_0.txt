I have heard great things about Sephora and although I don't wear much makeup on a daily basis I thought I would just check it out for curiosity's sake.  One of the yelpers mentioned it was like entering a candy store, and if you are into makeup it sure is.  Every makeup designer can be found here, from pencils to foundations, from brushes to perfumes.  \n\nThe sales people were identifiable in this location as they all walked around with mike headsets.  I thought I was at a CIA convention or a Janet Jackson concert.  But nonetheless these teched up folks were amiable and were definitely there to serve you.\n\nI was mostly impressed with the range of selection for us \"coloured gals\"; sometimes range is limited in other make-up stores and here not only do they do actual coding on your skin, you also have three or four brands you can choose from.  \n\nOur server had on a very natural make up, that made her look fresh and appealing. She was also extremely down to earth and authentically enthusiastic in finding me what I wanted.  I was looking for a foundation that wasn't too pricey but that was also a moisturizer and used natural products.  She found me a natural tinted moisturising foundation that also protects me from the sun. It was a perfect blend for my complexion, it evened out my skin tone but it also looked like I had nothing on. Perfect!\n \nWhen I compared prices to Shoppers Drug Mart, I found prices at Sephora comparable and even a tad bit cheaper.  \n\nGood news is, that this store isn't just for women either it can be a candy store for those Metro sexual men out there as well.
