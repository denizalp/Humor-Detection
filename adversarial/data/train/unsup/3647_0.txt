I had shades installed throughout my home. Great customer service  initially with measurements and style recommendations but went downhill from there. \nDelivery took much longer than they said without any updated  new delivery time. Flimsy drawstrings broke after three weeks and it took months, many phone calls (never returned) and lots of just as flimsy excuses before I got the broken shade replaced in my bedroom. The office staff is very disorganized but the installers are efficient enough and friendly. \nTheir prices aren't that cheap for all the waiting and bother.
