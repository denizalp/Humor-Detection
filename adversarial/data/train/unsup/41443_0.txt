Seafood...Buffet? What more needs to be said. Seems like a brilliant idea. However, it is horribly executed here.\n\nBehind the fa√ßade of a great value, they have the world's best selection of below average quality seafood. Basically, everything looked great, but tasted at best, average, and at worst, funky.\n\nTheir best items were the cooked ones. Don't go after the enticing raw oysters. Just don't. Stuffed crab shells, yes. Oh, and the crab legs. I guess you can't mess up steaming some crab legs.\n\nThey have a whole range of other foods grouped by ethnicity. You can check them out, but they all seem kind of the same after a few rounds. All just bland below average foods with some random seafood thrown in them.\n\nThe only thing that this place has going for it are the desserts. A rotating gelato bar? Uhm, five please?\n\nBefore you fall into this trap, I recommend spending that half of your Benjamin at another buffet with not only quantity but also quality.
