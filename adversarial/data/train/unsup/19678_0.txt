Absolutely awful. I would mention our severs name but it was never given. After the first hour of asking for him 3 times just to order drinks, we somehow received a bread basket 1.5 hours later 2 minutes prior to the meal. Never saw our server again... Not for a napkin, not to check in, not for more drinks, and not even to see if we wanted dessert in celebration of my friends birthday. He simply dropped the bill on the table and walked away. As a local- even just as a patron, the service was appalling. On our way out, my friend appropriately made a comment to the hostess in hopes that management would be made aware to which he was given the response \"I'm sorry but there's nothing I can do.\"\n\nWaste of time money space and unfortunately a special occasion. Gordon Ramsay may be a good chef, but his business sense is absolutely pathetic.  Mr Ramsay, you've been CHOPPED!
