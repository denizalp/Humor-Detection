Garlic doughnuts? Whaaaaaaa. I saw it and had to experience it for myself. And I did. And it was delicious. Don't skip this strange and lovely journey. We also shared a burger, which was solid though unspectacular. For decor, it is great, a perfect place to enjoy a few drinks. Dim lit, long bar, lots of seating, a small outdoor seating section, wow. The beer menu is diverse and large, too, offering whatever style you prefer. I prefer imperial stouts. Not many places are going to give you tons of options there, especially in the summer, but Bar Hop had multiple delicious options. Heroes of beer, people. It is right around the corner from Second City and near the heart of downtown, so it's hard to beat that location.
