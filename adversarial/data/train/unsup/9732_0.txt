**This is a review of the bar only**\n\nI am at least 15% cooler after having sipped on a vodka gimlet in the bar at Durant's. \n\nSure I smelled like steak after I left and felt weird about walking through the kitchen to get in and out. But for the hour I was there, I was felt cool as shit.  And my drink wasn't half bad either.
