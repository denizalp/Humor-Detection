Been coming to Big O tires off and on for 10+ years. So I came into today to get my wife's right front tire replaced as it was worn. The manager came out, looked at the car and told me that all the tires needed to be replaced because they were 5 years old and I needed a front end alignment.  The car was brand new 3 1\/2 years ago and the tires had 35,000 miles on them. He wanted almost $700 for passenger tires for a Toyota.  He went on and on about getting the car aligned and I stopped him and said no thanks on the alignment  He then said \"If you would let me finish explaining without interrupting me, and let me do my job you'll see the benefit.  I looked at my wife and said \"we're out of here\".  We left there and went to Discount Tire and bought 2 new front tires for approximately $200.  Disappointing trip to Big O for sure!!
