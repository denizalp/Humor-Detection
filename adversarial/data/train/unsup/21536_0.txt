Amazing property, but I would never stay here again. Booked three weeks ago on business and paid in full, just to get here and be told they have no rooms for us. The manager we dealt with was unhelpful and recited lines out of the company handbook like a robot. His name was Brian Askins in case you ever have to deal with him. \n\nOverbooking and putting people out like the airlines is no way to run a business. What a joke.
