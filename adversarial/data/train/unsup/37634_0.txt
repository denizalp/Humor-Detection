I visited on December 22nd with a jogging stroller that I thought had 3 bad inner tubes. One of the attendants that met me as I was entering the shop with my stroller. He took it in the back and showed me an area where I could sit if I needed. After about 2 minutes he motioned for me to come to the back (repair area) to show me there was nothing wrong with the inner tubes other than needing air. They filled my tires and I was ready to go. They could have easily replaced or pretend to replace the inner tubes and charged me for all three. The gentleman didn't charge me and wished me a Merry Christmas. He has earned a customer and I will come back with any other bike or stroller issues I have. Thank you for a great experience.
