The fees they charge is a complete rip-off. They don't charge you for appointments and send your scripts to the pharmacy like a legit practice. They act as shady middle-men, charging you hundreds to thousands more than the scripts actually cost to fill. This is a SCAM. These guys are crooks. Don't be surprised that they close up shop in the middle of the night, without notice, once the FDA starts sniffing them out, and they leave you hanging and with no info and without the meds you need. THIS HAS HAPPENED!!
