Good Friday out on dim sum hunt!!  Rol San (thankfully) was closed for renovations until the 15th of April.  Tried out Forestview.  Old style carts and old style customers, all a good sign and was looking forward to it.  Was getting used to check off menus and forgot the whole essence of enjoying my dishes one at a time.  \n\nDim Sum Mond to Frid  8-4 is $2 a dish, so you think it`s not going to be good.  Well it was fantastic.\n\nChicken Feet (black bean sauce so tasty that i used it for a dip for Ha Gow)\nBean Curd Roll (a lot of meat in it, hot temperature it loses the goodness when luke warm becomes a bit jelly like)\nRice in Leaf (2 small ones, and we got a good size piece of Roast Pork in each)\nHa Gow (just as good as Rol San, San the $)\nPan Fried Pork Dumpling (not greasy)\nSoup in Pouch (tonnes of Ginger, hot and tasty broth with a splash of Vinegar)\nSiu Mai with Mushrooms ( all goooooood)\n\nTea $1.60  (jasmine i think a bit strong but asked for more water then ok for me)\n\n$22  tax and tip in.  \n\nWknd prices are $2 for small $2.75 for medium and $3 for large still very reasonable\n\nwe were full but stuffed green peppers, turnip cake and steam buns and other tables looked sooo good.  For the price going to start trying a few things i haven`t before.
