I have been coming here for over a year and honestly, my only case against the place was how small it is considering it would get packed and the line would inevitably reach outside but lately they expanded their operations and acquired the space next door and connected it with their old one which is really cool! Watching a small business grow and succeed like that makes me glad! The only problem I can think of is the parking  which is small and tight so be weary of that. The  prices are nothing out of the ordinary but everything is well done. Being mexican, I go for the spicy deserts  most of the time like the mangoneada( mango ice cram with chamoy) or the Chamango  (mango in fruit ice cream with chamoy and powdered chili on top). This place gets a  lot of flack for service but honestly, I have never had a negative experience with it even when the place gets packed you know and see them trying their best. Highly recommend anyone drop by and get a snack here- there's so many choices to explore!
