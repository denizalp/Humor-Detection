I had a surprise party for my brother here just this past long weekend and wanted to write a review to get the word out there on this place.\nI had actually sent an email right at the beginning of my venue search, asking for the details of the general specifics that I would be working with (number of people, minimum spend, catering capacity).  In the response to my email, the minimum spend amount was just a little out of my budget, so I send them a 'thank you for getting back to me\" email and resumed looking for a venue.\nA week later Albert followed up with me and asked a bunch of questions (not pushy at all, just genuinely curious to know what I was looking for).  We ended up coming to an agreement and I booked the venue that week - sight unseen, just based on the fact that I loved the pictures of the place (not the most brilliant move, but I took a chance)\nFrom the beginning Albert and AJ were an absolute pleasure to work with. They both responded to any emails within an hour and were as accommodating as they could possibly be with anything I needed\/requested, so I actually didn't need to worry about anything at all.\nThe night of the party, everything ran incredibly smoothly.  From the food being distributed to settling the tab at the end of the evening, everyone was incredibly professional and friendly and everyone had a great time.\nI would definitely recommend Stirling Room to anyone who was looking for a place with great ambiance and amazing people to work with to get their party done right!\n\nI have already given Albert's name out to a few of my friends who are looking for party venues!!!!\n\nThank you Albert, AJ and Dan!!
