This is the highest rated of the many Ethiopian foods in Charlotte and I can see why.  Wifey and I took the Mother out to finally try This delicious cuisine and we weren't disappointed.  They shared the vegetarian feast full of various vegetable and lentil items on a bed of injeera with extra on the side.  I did the doro wat with some fresh Ethiopian cheese on the side, which was just fantastic. If you know what paneer is, it's basically a crumbled version.  I had to drop one star as they ran out of Ethiopian coffee but we would go back to re-try any time.  The service was great and they really wanted to make sure we enjoyed everything. You can tell they really care about what the put out in front of their customers. That's why it was packed even at 8:30 at night. The Mother was very impressed
