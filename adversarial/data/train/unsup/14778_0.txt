This place is up there, with some of the most pretentious spots anywhere in Toronto. It's all a conspiracy to steal your money, disguised in a neatly wrapped, shiny box. And when you open the box, you'll end up with something similar to your local takeaway.\n\nThe entire experience can be summed up like this: A building fit for King Street West, with the food comparable to a small town Chinese restaurant, staffed by white people whose cultural horizon with Asian cuisine is as flat as the heart monitor line of NDP's political campaign. \nThe menu was so mediocre, I don't see any reason on reviewing it. I've had better packaged meals from grocery store in the frozen foods section.\nMy table was wobbly, if I hadn't came with two girlfriends of mine, I would have not ordered the wine. I was wearing fur, too risky.\nThe decorations was trying to emulate a Zen like space, but that all burnt up with the incense after 10pm, as it became intolerably loud. I really wish it was called \"Spice Route Lounge\" instead, to warn me of the late-night crowds. I had trouble hearing what my friends sitting beside me were saying. \nI noticed a bunch of yuppies leaning on the bar in their daytime suits, gawking at the girls in the restaurant while fiddling with their pocket change with one hand, and holding their remarkably emasculating drinks with the other. I think it was the Bay Street mating stance.\n\nThe waiter approached me questioning the reason why I short-tipped him, because it wasn't the 'regular' 15 percent. Let's just say I had the bouncers at stand-by throughout my entire conversation with our \"service\" person.\nI don't remember ordering the beef.
