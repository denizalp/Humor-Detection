I had an entire Sunday afternoon to kill before my evening flight home, so I decided to get a day pass to Qua.  It was far and away the best spa experience that I have ever had.   I would have stayed for days if I didn't have a plane to catch.  The few times that I had been to Vegas, I had gone to the Canyon Ranch Spa in the Venetian.  Canyon Ranch is nice.  Don't get me wrong.  But Qua?  Qua is amazing.  \n\nI actually had a few moments where I was thinking to myself... How could I make my own home look more like Qua?  Could I make 3 beautiful pools of different temperatures with a rain shower in the middle in my house?  Never mind that I rent and I live with 2 guys, BUT STILL, a woman can dream.   \n\nIt has that Zen quality that is hard to find.  Welcoming and relaxing.  Not snotty.  There is a robe sauna so that you can warm your robe while you soak.  A robe sauna, people!   Take some time out for yourself in Vegas and go to Qua.  You can undo all of the damage that you have done to yourself.  Don't blame me if you start planning your own Qua-esque roman bath at home.
