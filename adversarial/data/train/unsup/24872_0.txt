Don't I love, love, love this store!!!!!\n\nI love tea, old fashioned, caffeinated tea.  Not flower tea, not fruit tea (these are popular now, I am told), I demand real tea leaves.  This shop delivers.  I often walk into this store when I have my leisure weekend walk.  The lovely aroma of tea greets me when I step into the store.  The store owner himself often serves me.  I prefer a large variety of teas (light, medium and strong strength).  I smell the tea leaves before I pick and choose what to buy (by gram).  The whole experience is relaxing, luxurious, oh so zen.  The quality of the tea leaves here meets and exceeds Twinings.\n\nHumm... selection:  I bought black tea leaves with a vanilla aroma, Nepal tea leaves, Northern Indian tea leaves, black teas with fruit flavour.  I expect to buy more later.  Though I don't foresee myself buying, I am told that fruit tea leaves are very popular now.\n\nOh, they have an online store at http:\/\/www.cuppa.ca\/orders.htm.  It often runs specials and discounts.  I personally prefer buying in store just to smell the tea leaves.  :-)
