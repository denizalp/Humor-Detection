Oh yeah!  Gelati layered with chocolate custard and the root beer Italian ice.  It will taste almost like a Tootsie Roll, if you like that kind of thing.  That's my favorite.  We also tried the gelati with mango ice and vanilla custard.  That was perfect on a hot day.  The mango ice is not too sweet and had a true mango flavor.  We were also eye-balling the sign with their frozen lemonades.  That and some good booze would make a heck of a delicious poolside cocktail!
