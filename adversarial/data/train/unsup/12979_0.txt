I have been to the DNWR several times for hiking (Gass Peak and Hidden Forest) and to do some rock art recording for the US Fish and Wildlife Service at Cow Camp.\n\nThe most important thing to know before you go is that you have about 4 miles of graded dirt and gravel road from US 95 to the visitor center.  Anything beyond that requires a high clearance vehicle and in some places a four wheel drive vehicle.\n\nThe new visitor center opened in February of 2014 and this was my first time at the Range since it opened.  It is open Thursday through Sunday only so if this is your goal make sure you go one of those days.  Even so, there are many new trails that lead from the VC.  Today, we walked the Jackrabbit, Bighorn, and Coyote loops.  There are trail maps and information pamphlets available near the trailheads so you know where you're going.\n\nOur trip today was not the best time to go.  Fall and spring are good times times to visit because your chance of seeing migrating birds is greater.  We saw a few birds today but not many.\n\nI have included a few photos from the area from before the new VC was built.  I like the old pond better but the current trails are better.  There was mud on the old trail around the pond and this new trail system makes it more kid freindly and ADA accessible.\n\nThis is the largest Wildlife Range outside of Alaska in our back yards.  Give it a visit.  It's worth the trip.
