This place has had so many different businesses in the many years it has been here.  From aquariums, restaurants, Al Premium grocery, electronics, house wares, boots, etc.\n\nThere's a little bit of everything here along with a nice parkette in the middle of the parking lot.  Parking on weekends here can be hard to find.  The gate entrance being the main entrance is a bit of a bottleneck in that if you're turning left or waiting for others to turn remember that Dundas can be a very busy street.  \n\nWith no street lights here the entrance\/exit can be packed.  There is additional side parking on the east side and the rear of the lot too.  \n\nThere are quick bites to be had here like Tung Hing or a couple Bahn Mi places at the south side of the mall.  The pseudo food court has a BBQ place at the very back while there's also a couple sit down restaurants at the very back and corner.  \n\nNice decor for such a small little cul-de-sac type mall.  \n\nYes, the address is 888 Dundas Street W as luck would have it.
