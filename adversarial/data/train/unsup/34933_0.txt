3,5 stars. The place is absolutely stunning and the location is fantastic. I came here with friends for a nye boozy brunch and the vinoiserie plate was incredible! The brunch was really good as well. Mimosas were good but very diluted. Main negative was the service wasn't to the caliber you would expect considering how nice this place is.
