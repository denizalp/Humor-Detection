The best way I can sum up this experience is by saying that I really didn't want to tell anyone about this place at first. No one. Then I tried the food and drinks and realized that just wouldn't be fair. If you have found this review by randomly looking up information on this place, let me save you a little bit of time. Stop reading reviews, and get there! If you have read this far, you have already missed two minutes of amazing guacamole, queso, salsa, create-your-own tacos and wonderful drinks.  You won't be disappointed. The atmosphere and service matches the high quality of food and drinks served. My personal tip is to try the Barrio secret sauce, which is the house spicy sauce. It goes perfectly with a Rogue Dead Guy Ale, which of course goes even better with the Day of the Dead Murals.
