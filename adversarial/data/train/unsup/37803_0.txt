Lunch buffet is medicore at best, def. better food to be had elsewhere.  I usually only go there for the chaat.  However, today we were informed that the restaurant wasn't taking any chaat orders as the kitchen was too busy, all after the waitress had already taken our order.  Meanwhile, one or two other customers were given chaat orders to-go, I'm guessing they called ahead of time.
