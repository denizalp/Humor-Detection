Several years back (when I was a younger man), I took my first job in a little mobile phone store located in the Caledon town of Bolton and shortly there after Soup Du Jour opened it's door inside a near by medical building!\n\nThe owner (whose name escapes me now) is a creative lunch genius and does lunch exceptionally well. As it's been awhile the things that stand out in my memory are their made to order salads, daily soup offerings (which are made from scratch daily), artisan sandwiches AND my personal fave their meat (or even vegetarian chilli). \n\nThe chilli is always served with hunks of bread for dipping and it's the perfect on cold cold winter days. Pro-tip: If they still have it ask for the DIY spicy cayenne spray for your bowl of chilli, definitely go ALL in on this ISH. \n\nPro-tip #2: Aim in the right direction.... one day, maced myself....chilli did NOT taste as good that day.... sigh, FML.\n\nAnyway, it's located off of McEwan in the plaza right next door to Wal-Mart!\n\nEat-Crest Out
