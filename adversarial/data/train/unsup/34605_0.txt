My fiance and I usually go here when we're craving seafood... the only issue is it's more of a teaser. The oysters are decent but I don't think they are fresh. The crab and California lobsters however are very good. The other food in the buffet are pretty good they have a good variety but compared to other buffets it's only okay.
