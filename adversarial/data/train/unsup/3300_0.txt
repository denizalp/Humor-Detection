Brief Intro: \n\n'Feel' Fairview.  Next in the \"The Guys Survival Guide to Malls\" series.\n \nFairview Mall takes a spot slightly north of Highway 401 & 404 at the Sheppard avenue exit. The makeover it recently completed compliments the growing neighbourhood as you'll notice a few Condominiums recently built or currently under construction. It is publicly accessible with transit at the Don Mills station of the Sheppard TTC Line. The new interior design makes sense in terms of a natural walking path unlike the previous maze nearby The Bay.\n \nGentlemen please beware of the 2 G(Guess Accessories, Godiva) just above the beautifully redesigned Food Court(Starbucks, McDonald's, NY Fries, Manchu Wok, Tim Hortons, etc...). Try to aim for the 3 S(SportChek, Silver City, and Shoppers Drug Mart). \n\nSeating Comfort Level:(**---) \n\nInteresting design on those 2nd Level seating. Visually soft comfortable however the back support is really only intended for visual contrast rather than comfort. If you are a natural sloucher, you might be able to make it work otherwise it's just a normal backless somewhat cushioned resting area that lets your GIRL easily locate you because of its uniqueness. Tough call, since some guys do judge certain things on initial Hotness(i.e. the Ladies) rather than comfort and these seats do just that. \n\nSafety Zone:(**---) \n\nWarning: The path from the TTC station outside to Sears and then internal 1st Level long walk towards the Food Court is like Dead Man Walking especially some shops have remade their appearance. i.e. Esprit, Jacob's, La Vie on Rose, Garage, Le Chateau, Costa Blanca. If you survive the walk, then you'll enjoy the Food Court area and the brief walk with few shops that we know and love. i.e. Telus, Fido, Lids, Foot Locker, Gadgets, F.G. Bradley's Fun & Games, Shefield Express, Bestbuy Mobile. Seriously, I don't know what People's Jewellers is doing at such a high traffic area. \n\nExit Strategy:(***--) \n\nThis is more of a Parking Strategy in my believe since even the 2nd Level is swamped with shop such as Club Monaco, Guess, La Senza, Hollister. On the 2nd level, park either South end near Spring Rolls or North end near LCBO.\n\nSouth end has shops such as Z-Teca Burritos, Jugo Juice, Michel's Baguette, Ten Ren's Tea Time, Mac Sushi, Cinnabon. Most importantly are Ben Moss Jewellers & La Swiss where you'll be blinded by the Men Bling(Tissot, Breitling, TW Steel). North end has Shoppers Drug Mart, Silver City, Villa Madina, Druxy's, Showcase, Personal Edge, GNC, Purdy's Chocolates, Freshly Squeezed.\n\nBoth of these paths will lead you to the middle walkway where you'll notice the median Guest Services. This is the best escape route with freedom to go all directions. I know I know, the way down to 1st Level from here is stairway rather than escalator\/elevator but when you're a refugee, you can't be picky. \n\nEntertainment Level:(-----) \n\nWater Feature? No. Theme DÃ©cor? No. \n\nSorry guys, not much else to do aside from playing with your thingy(Iphone\/BB). Grab some smokes at Shefield Express, check out some Billiard equipment at F.G. Bradley's, Ipad testing at Apple, tunes at HMV, and gaming at EB Games. Worst comes to worst, go to Sunshine Spa & Nails. For the Spa(!), not the clear-coat Nails :p
