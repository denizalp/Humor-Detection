We had free tickets earned by playing the My Vegas game on facebook.  Our tickets were for section 201, but we were brought forward and seated just left of center stage in row 5.   Though we thoroughly enjoyed this hip hop dance production, I would hazard a guess that it would hold more appeal for the 20-30 year old crowd than members of AARP.
