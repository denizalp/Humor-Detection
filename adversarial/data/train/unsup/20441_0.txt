I'm so excited to be living near this dog park. However, I think my dog is more excited than I am.\n\nLike most dog parks, this one is separated into larger dogs weighing over 35lbs and smaller ones weighing under 35lbs. I've got a little ChiPin so we obviously belong in the smaller one.\n\nThis particular park gets popping with the dogs. There is usually a lot of people here with their furry canine friends. There are tennis balls scattered about, water buckets, a beat up frisbee and most importantly.. A LARGE FIELD. I don't know about you guys, but I love seeing my dog run around and use up all his energy. It's that Pinscher in him, I tell ya!\n\nI've been to the dog park on the East side along with the one in Henderson and this one has got to be my favorite because there are tons of tiny dogs that come here. The more dogs means more friends for my dog.
