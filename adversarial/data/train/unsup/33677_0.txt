Awful food.  Restaurant dirty and greasy and old.  Hamburger that waitress told me was \"very good\" was very very bad.  Thinnest, most tasteless burger ever...seemed to made of boiled vegetable matter rather than hot, grilled beef.  Asked for A-1 sauce...waitress told me their only bottle of it was nearly gone.  French fries were coated in cheap breading....no potato flavor at all.  Even my iced coke drink was watered down. Left two thirds of my lunch on plate.  Hope they give it to birds in back alley.  McDonalds would be much better.  This is realtiy.
