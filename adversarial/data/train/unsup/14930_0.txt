Great fresh cuisine and a very friendly staff! The menu has a lot of variety if you are looking for something hearty like a burger or Meatloaf (which i tried and was very good!) or something on the lighter side, like a pasta or salad.\n\nThe Guac app is very good.  Our waitress told us a story about one of the founders accidentally using Key Lime juice when playing with his recipe. They make their chips fresh as well. \n\nGood for families or a couples dinner.  Casual atmosphere.  Half price bottle of wine on either Tuesdays or Thursdays (i can't recall)
