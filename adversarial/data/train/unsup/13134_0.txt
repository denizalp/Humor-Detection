Having lived in Southern CA and dining with my son's Mexican family for the past 7 years, I would rate Viva Zapatas as one of the best authentic Southwest Mexican restaurants in town.  I don't know what Texican food is like, but from Santa Fe west, this ranks top in my book.\n\nAnd...they serve real micheladas!  If you haven't had one, try it!\n\nI drive across town just for this food.
