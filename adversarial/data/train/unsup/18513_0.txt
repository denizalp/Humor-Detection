I found myself in the middle of a strange city (Mesa), I was down the street shopping, hungry, and armed with the yelp app on my iphone. I saw a yelp $12 for $24, a groupon $15 for $30, and a yelp check in offer. Decisions, which deal to choose. Most of their meals are anywhere from $10-$12 with tax, so choose accordingly.\n\nWe walked in saturday at 6:00 pm, and there was no one else here. My initial thought was that everyone else *might* just know something I don't; perhaps I should find another spot I eat. I reluctantly decided to stay, then ordered the green curry and yellow curry. \n\nA few moments into our meal another couple came in to eat also, which made me feel better, if not just for the restaraunt operator, but for myself also. I'm normally a bit leary of a restaraunt with no customers. Maybe this is just how it is in middle of Mesa, I'm not really an authority on that particular subject though. I usually hang in and around the Phoenix mid-town area.\n\nThe food was great! Though I did like the yellow curry better than the green; which is what I would suggest if your looking for curry. Go ahead and order it spicy, it was good. They brought the bill and there was a discrepancy. The yelp check-in offer was clearly $15 and they adjusted the check for 15%. I think the check in offer is SUPPOSED to be 15% and not $15, but they still honored it. I felt obliged and gave them a bigger tip than I ever do; an extra 10% on top of my usual.\n\nOver all a nice spot to calm your inner Thai-ger. Happy dining all you Yelpers!
