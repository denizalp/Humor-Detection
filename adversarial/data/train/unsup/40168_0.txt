This place was just ok. We ordered a gyro. Tasted good. Not enough meat!  Got to the end of the gyro and there was 3 inches with no meat? !\nNo one ever checked on us (we sat out front) to see if we needed a drink refill,  etc.\nWhen the server finally came out to get our plates,  it was 15 minutes before he brought out our check. Won't return,  but nice enough place.
