Today, I made my first lunch trip to the Bronze Cafe and holy cow - it was bitter sweet.  Sweet, because the Tree of Life Pita Sandwich is probably the tastiest healthy sandwich I have ever had and BITTER because in order to enjoy my lunch as much as I enjoyed it today, I will be forced to visit the Bronze Cafe every single day. Damnit.  ;)\n\nI was going to order the LGBTQ because I'M NO VEGAN. Also, because I LOVE BACON like Ron Swanson loves bacon. But, in an effort to halt pre-holiday weight gain, I thought I would see what the fuss is about this \"Tree of Life Pita.\" \n\nAnd in this case, the FUSS was ON POINT.  I grabbed my pita to go and when I got back to my office and took my first bite, I was in fresh, veggie, avocado, tomato-onion, cashew \"crema,\" sunflower seed, mango cilantro ginger vinaigrette HEAVEN. If you don't know what I'm talking about, the only thing I can do to better explain my feelings about this sandwich is by saying this: go to the Bronze Cafe, order the Tree of Life Pita, take your first bite and proceed to basque in the fiery explosions created by the fresh pita\/vegan\/veggie flavor delight. \n\nI really cannot recommend this sandwich enough. I mean, really. It was filling, but in a \"healthy-full\" way.  You know, the \"healthy-full\" feeling that is opposite of the feeling you get on Saturday morning after eating pounds of bacon, eggs, toast and pancakes. \n\nAlso, the cafe is very cute and the service is fast and friendly with a smile. I was in and out with my sandwich boxed up \"to-go\" within 10 minutes and less than $10 was deducted from my wallet.  I literally cannot find one thing to complain about other than the fact that I no longer feel I can visit another lunch establishment in the area in good conscience after having such a great experience here.\n\n :)
