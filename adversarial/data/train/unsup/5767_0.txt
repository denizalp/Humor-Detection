Okay,  been a long time in the making for this review. \nThese guys are Amazing,  haven't even come close to letting me down and I frequent them often enough but not half as often as I would like. \nPizza wise,  these guys deal in the most wonderfully soft and buttery thin crusts possible,  seriously I am not sure how they do it but the crust alone is worth the visit,  as far as toppings...  Well...  Let's just sat they are unique but in a completely epic and amazing way,  check out the \"John A MacDonald\" or as it is lovingly referred the \"Big Mac\"  flavour combinations you would never expect to work work so perfectly it reshapes your whole idea of what pizza is. \nIf pizza isn't your thing they still have you covered,  aside from the most perfect Italian eatery type sandwiches your taste buds have even experienced they also have salads. \nMy favorite? Well I'm glad you asked,  is the Jerk Chicken Caesar.  Seriously for a couple of white boys they really get the concept of jerk, incredible.  always perfect heat always fresh while you watch. \nI grabbed one today and while I normally grab jerk but this time I was lucky.  \nThis time there was a special,  in-house Applewood smoked cured lamb shoulder seared perfectly,  it fell apart and was perfect.  Seriously amazing. \nTry these guys if you are in the area you will NOT be disappointed. \nTo the staff,  expect my return! I look forward to future specials.
