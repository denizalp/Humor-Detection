Great lunch spot. The best grilled cheese in charlotte. Love the tapas menu and the tea options.\n\nVery low key style and priced to please. Good lunch for around ten bucks and great service.\n\n\nNote: I recently emailed them about an incident I read about online and they replied with a very satisfactory statement and explanation.
