Store was very messy. I felt that everything was just thrown on the shelves. I get that they are busy but it would be nice to be able to find items such as decor and houseware items set up in some type of order. It's hard to shop this way. The clothing section seemed to have a better setup and looked presentable. \n\nI was however able to find some household items. I give an A+ to the sweet girl who rang me up. She was so nice and had a smile on her face.
