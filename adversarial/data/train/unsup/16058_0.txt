I know NOTHING about pawn shops but we were in the process of upgrading our home theater and had a few 400 blu-ray disc changers, a Fireball movie system and an audio receiver to get rid of and someone suggested we try a pawn shop since the equipment was too expensive to ship. This shop was convenient so we went to check things out. \n\nThe parking lot was packed on a Saturday afternoon and the place was hopping. Despite the crowd we were warmly greeted as soon as we walked in the door. We told the employees what we had and if they'd be interested in taking a look to buy and they said that we probably wouldn't get offered much for the items since they sell electronics for such low prices. I figured \"yeah, that's just a line they use\" but it's not. This place has CHEAP electronics! I had no idea! \n\nSome things were a true steal and others were a little pricey, just know what you're looking for. They had a nice selection of designer handbags, power tools, jewelry, cheap dvds (99 cents and up), dvd players (like new for $10), and electric guitars (some nice ones in the $50 range).\n\nThe store was bright and clean and very, very busy. If you wanted to pawn or sell something, the line was at least 6 people deep -- be prepared to wait if you come on the weekend. Also we saw a woman dumpster diving out back, but that may just be due to the part of town where this store is located.\n\nI'd totally come back here to browse just for fun. I'd not bring electronics here to sell, though. We ended up donating our equipment at the Savers down the street; I'd rather get a big charitable tax deduction than $10 cash in my pocket.
