My main issue with this hotel is that there was a very strong chemical smell in the hotel room. I got a really bad headache after about 5 min. in the room. We canceled the reservation for the next night and moved to another hotel because of it. We called the front desk and told them about it and said they would and someone up. They never did. When we checked out the next day we said something again and the girl working at the front desk nicely told us that they have that issue a lot with the air that is being pulled in having a strong smell because of a factory (or something) close by. Paid our bill and left and stayed downtown at a fresh smelling hotel for the same price. (No extra points, no discount, no comped breakfast). \n\nOn a positive note, most of the people working there were nice and friendly. They had happy hour at the bar on a Saturday and the bartender was very nice and helpful about the area. It's in a cool area and we had a nice view of the water, disappointing that the hotel has not fixed a known problem.
