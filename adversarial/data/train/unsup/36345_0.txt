Drove past earlier in the day laughing & joking about the taco truck in the brake shop parking lot. After a few hours and several drinks later, I found myself ordering tacos here. Sooo glad I let those drinks decide that we needed tacos from this sketchy looking spot. All I really know is that the pastor & asada tacos were pretty amazing. They had this pineapple salsa or pineapple pieces for the tacos in a self serve salsa bar, why does every taco shop that sells al pastor not have that readily available!? Where has that pineapple salsa been all my life? Good tacos  will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas. \n**only 4 stars because I've had better tortillas and $2 a taco is kinda up there, won't stop me from coming back though..
