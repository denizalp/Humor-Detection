I ordered online only so maybe my review may lack a bit, but as for a pizza spot, \nI almost boycott all franchised places like pizza hut or ceasars, there are SO many Mom & Pops shops out there for pizza instead of getting some frozen mass produced products.\n\nOnline was fun & easy, pics of Pizza were the real things not some fancy photo shop stuff. I will be ordering again for sure...
