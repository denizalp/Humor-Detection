This is the best Greek specific food store in Greek town (and I've been in them all!) Go-to place if you are trying out Greek recipes and need to find obscure ingredients. They have all the imports direct from Greece.\n\nFirst off, the owner is a real gem and will offer to help you out as soon as you enter the shop. He's answered numerous stupid questions from me whilst managing to keep a straight face.\n\nGreek House has a ridiculously awesome deli counter with deli meats, fresh butcher cuts, Greek cheeses (Feta, Kasseri, Haloumi, even Kefalotiri!), real Greek pressed yogurt and a wide selection of homemade Greek dips (tzatziki, taramosalata, telitzanosalata and hummus variations) and a huge olive counter.\n\nThe front part of the shop has a bakery section with all your typical Greek goodies (baklava, kourabiethes, loukoumades, loukoumia, etc). If you don't know what any of this is, GO AND SEE, you'll be impressed.\n\nAlso lots of canned and boxed food items from Greece (grape vine leaves for making dolmades, okra, greek white beans, rice, Greek honey, olive oils, etc)
