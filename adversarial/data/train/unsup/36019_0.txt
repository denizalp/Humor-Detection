This place makes some good sushi. It taste fresh, looks good on the plate, and that's about it. Nothing really stood out to me, other than one thing, the price. The prices are a bit on the expensive side. Maybe I'm more used to the pricing in Markham, where the quality might be a bit lower, but this one seemed quite expensive. It comes out to about 30$ per person for a relatively small portion. One thing that I observed, is that the restaurant has a more honest Japanese feel to it, not overly cluttered with cheap Dollarama Chinese turned Japanese type decor.
