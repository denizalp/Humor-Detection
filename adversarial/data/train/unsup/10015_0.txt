When I'm looking to fill a Chinese fast-food void, I'm not looking to see if the service is top notch; I'm looking for big value, freshness and flavor! China Tango Bistro meets all of those requirements so, \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"\n\nI would probably say they cook up the most flavorful and plump honey walnut shrimp ($12) I have had in a while. I loved how the shrimp batter is not too crazy thick and fried expertly to make it crispy for texture. The little white noodle bed it's served on also adds addictive crispy pops! So good! The best part is the portion is generous! Plus, the shrimp tasted fresh and succulent. However, it is a tad on the sweet side; you might be able to see the grains of sugar in the sauce not completely dissolved yet. If you don't like your food extra glazed and saucy, I would skip this item. Flavor rating: 5\/5\n\nThe upgrade from white rice to egg fried rice is only $2.50 and I completely recommend it! It is fluffy and flavorful with lots of delicious fried egg bits mixed in. The portion, again, is huge! It's enough for me and my fiance to share and then share again the next day! Flavor rating: 4\/5\n\nThe crab rangoons (cream cheese wontons) ($5) are freshly fried and filled generously with a silky cream cheese blend. I wouldn't sweat the crab since there is no crab flavor detected, but if you ever had a cream cheese wonton, these are a great version - they are super crispy and delicious. Just make sure to request some sweet and sour sauce to dip them in, if they didn't come with it. Flavor rating: 4\/5\n\nThe total for us to dine here for dinner was $22! We took over half of the food home to enjoy for lunch the next day because they really give indulgent portions. And guess what, the next day it was just as tasty! I won't lie and say that their service is awesome, but I can definitely see they are trying and working on improving, so hats off to that! If you didn't know, this type of service isn't as bad as you think it is. There are far worse and it's culturally accepted (or is it...O.o).\n\nP.S. When we dined here, we felt that they might have did an overhaul on their restaurant since the food tasted fresh and delicious, far from Panda Express quality.
