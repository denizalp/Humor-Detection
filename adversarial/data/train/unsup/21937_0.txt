This is a family restaurant run by a man who is out of control.  I went there to join my family in a meal but they were late.  I was told I could not occupy a table until the entire party was there.  OK I understand but I asked for coffee while I waited but they refused.  When my family arrived I told them that I was REFUSED coffee and the owner went nuts!  He started to shake and yelled \"get out\" to us.  He was clearly out of control and I feared for my life!  We left in a hurry and will never go back.  I recommend you stay away.  The owner could go off like a bomb again any time and it will be unsafe for you if he does while you are there.
