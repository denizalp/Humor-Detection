Wow I cannot believe how long it has been since I have updated my review. Since finding Fajitas I have become a fan, just cannot get enough of the homemade tortillas, if you haven't tried them, you are missing out! And for the many times that I have been there the taste of the food as remained the same, perfect & delicious.\n\nWent with a party of friends, about ten in our party, we had found out that Fajitas does not do reservations, but we did give them the heads up that we are a party of ten and we are showing up around 5ish, so we got their and had to wait a few mins, but we didn't mind, gave us time to mingle with each other before being seated.\n\nI still can't tell you what other items they have the on the menu, because I keep coming back for the beef fajitas which come with a plate of cheese, pico de gallo and sour cream, for me all this is enough, but you can order beans & rice to go with your jamming fajitas.\n\nYep you can bet I will be be back!
