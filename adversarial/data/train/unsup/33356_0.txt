First off buy your tickets elsewhere, we bought ours a block up at tix4tonight and it was $26 each, much better then $40. \nFor $26 it wasn't bad, it's about an hour or so long. You go in a big group so you'll have to wait till they have enough people. We only waited for maybe 10 minutes. \nYou are lead through rooms with cool items we've seen in the movies along with some interactive games.  There are a lot of cool photo opportunities as there's Thor's hammer, the hulk buster suit along with all the other iron man suits. \nThe store was full of cool marvel items but outrageously over priced. \nFor a hardcore fan I'd recommend it but like I said buy your tickets at a discounter. At $40 I wouldn't recommend it.
