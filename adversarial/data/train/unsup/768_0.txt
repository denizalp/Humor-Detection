Sugar is the worse drug in the history of mankind.   It has no redeeming nutrients, it leeches minerals from your bones, it creates a fatty liver, a issue of weight problems in America, and  a leading reason for Diabetes...but it taste so damn good! \n\nNearly 1\/3 of all Americans are diabetics or at severe risk of diabetes, and most of us don't even realize ramification of this diseases.    Okay, okay, I don't want to rain on everyone parade, but having diabetes in Las Vegas isn't a lifetime sentence of no bake goods or sweets.  Thank god for Mrs Williams!\n\nThis is one of my aunt's favorite bakery when she visit Las Vegas, and usually buys a few items before heading back to Hawaii, and today I made a stop for one of my friends because we were too lazy to make them sugar free caramel chocolate pretzels.    \n\nWhat I like about his place, it's not just for diabetics, but for anyone who doesn't want extra sugars in their diet, and even cancer patients can benefits from the lack of sugar (when they feel the need to cheat)    I really enjoy their deep dish Apple pie (9.50) and it weights around 5 pounds, and  filled with real apples, and this crust might be better than Marie Calendars     There a bunch of sugar-free pastry, and candies throughout in the store front.\n\nWhat surprised me about this business, they will help anyone who want to learn how to make sugar free items, and will even go to a point of teaching you how to start a sugar free business.  Just ask them, and you will be surprise.     \n\nI'm beyond impressed with their great customer service, and they will now save my Apple pie for me, if I call before going to Chinatown!    The only downfall, it's a hard turn to get into this small strip center off Spring Mountain, and Decatur, but Overall, this place is treasure of any diabetic or anyone who wants to cut Sugar out of there diets.
