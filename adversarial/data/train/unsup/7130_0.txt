I've been searching Toronto for 2 years for a new hair place to call home, and I finally found it at Grateful Head.  I've been to about 4 other places in Toronto.  While I liked the cuts I got at Coupe Bizarre, I couldn't stand the vibe, to cool for school employees, being moved from a stylist to a colourist, and the music.  I have been to other places where the vibe is nice, but the cuts...not so much.\nFINALLY Holly at Grateful Head satisfyed my needs.  Thorough (hello! dying brows to match new hair colour!), great cuts, good atmosphere and great music.  I love that she can look at me, say \"I know exactly what I want to do\", and have it turn out freaking awesome?  SO worth it!
