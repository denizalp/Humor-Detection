Decided to create a Yelp account to express my dissatisfaction with Avengers Station. The exibit is a collection of costumes and props\/prop replicas with limited interactivity. A decent concept with poor execution. \n\nThe first interative game, the Captain America reflex test is a glorified wack-a-mole type game that uses low resolution, blurry and distorted images. \n\nThe Thor room has an inaccurate replica of Mjolnir that you can try to lift, but the handle grip is coming apart. \n\nVision room has character bio where Ultron is misspelled as Ultra. A minor issue, but you don't put out a final prduct with spelling mistakes. I tweeted to Avengers Station about it, their response was to block my account. Lol. Seriously?\n\nIronman room was the highlight. Had a game that uses eye tracking, but there are 3 screens to use, with a low, a medium and a high stool, none of which can be adjusted, so you have to sit awkwardly and uncomfortably for it to work and the staff members who were there to assist were rude. \n\nAfter fighting Ultron using your iOS device, you can take a souvenir photo with some props that consisted of, a pair of Hulk sunglasses, a pair of Ironman sunglasses and the cheapest Captain America sheild you can get a costume shop that had broken straps. \n\nYou exit through the gift shop where you can buy the same Marvel merch that is carried by many big box stores and specific Avengers Station merch that feels very low quality. \n\nIn the gift shop, they were playing a Nicki Minaj song that repeated the work f**k and sang about riding d**k continuously, completely uncensored. I overheard one of the staff memebers suggesting they change the song as there were little kids coming in, the other employee, I'm guessing the manager snapped back, \"We don't need to change the song!\"\n\nI am a huge Marvel fan and I hold the brand to high standards that Avengers Station does not live up to. Do NOT recommend.
