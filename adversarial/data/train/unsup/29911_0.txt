I can't say enough good things about Cantina 1511.. However, one thing about me is that I kept ordering the same darn thing when I go there or many other places at that. I'm In love with the mojitos. I have tried every types they offer. Having their mojitos on my birthday was the perfect way to keep my mid life crisis at bay. \nI alway ordered the fish tacos every time. Nothing to complain about. I did recently visited them and order their \"street\" food platter. Which includes battered calamari, meatball with cheese, nacho salad, some other type of food I can't remember. This is the perfect way for me to step outside my box. I'm always a big fan of tapas. And it's exactly that. Everything on that platter is delicious. I would order it again. Customer services is alway great, the way I remember it. But most of the time, I'm tipsy from their mojitos by the time I leave. Haha. Either way, I have visited them many times before and will continue to do so as long as they don't change too much.
