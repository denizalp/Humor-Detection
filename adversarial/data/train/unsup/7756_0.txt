I can't complain about my food as it was prepared the way I requested and everything I had tasted good.  Our server was extremely busy but did his best to make sure we had everything we needed.\n\nThe two stars are because of quality control in the kitchen, not sure what was going on inside there??\n\nWe had a part of 8 and on one plate, she got her chicken she ordered, her potato and veggies, however, the paper receipt showing what was ordered buried under her chicken is not something that was ordered.  How does a paper receipt end up on a plate buried under food???  That was just an attention to detail issue that is becoming more and more of a problem with restaurants.\n\nIn the end, they did make her a new plate and did offer to give me a military discount, but why not honor military, active and retired 365 days a year?    \n\nOutback has gone down hill over the years and they try hard but still fail from time to time.  If they focused more on the business model being about the customer and customer support (from Corporate) they may enjoy a little more success.  Managers and servers trying their hardest but still having their hands tied does not allow the managers to do everything they would like to show customers come first.  It is what it is which is sad.  I only go here when I'm with people who suggest this chain otherwise I won't go, too many issues.
