I soooo love this place!!! When it comes to getting your eyebrow just right, this is as good as it gets and the location, price make it even better :). Idolize provides threading in a very safe, hygienic, fast and inexpensive way. With the \"Lucky 7\" rewards card, every visit is not only a treat to your eyebrows but a reward to yourself as you get to redeem a $12 discount on your next threading service. \n\nGita is my favorite, she always knows what to do, i just sit and let her do her magic, that is how good they are :)\n\nIdolize is located within the South Park Mall close to the Food Court (convenient) and the staff are super friendly, at times I even stay longer just chatting away. \n\nNext time you're in South Park Mall, make sure to check it out. Your eyebrows will totally thank you and never look better!
