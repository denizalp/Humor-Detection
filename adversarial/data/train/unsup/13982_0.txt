I was very hesitant to come eat here to be honest, but my friend insisted. I've been to the location in San Diego and hated it. I get that the server is trying to be a \"dick\" but service shouldn't be lacking because of it. With that said, our server at this location, Christine, found the perfect balance! She was a major dick but still tended to our needs like one would expect in a restaurant. \n\nThe menu was very overwhelming to me... Three separate sheets! But she went over it quickly and got us familiar with the items and made a few recommendations. (Here's a tip: don't get the chicken strips! Ha!) \n\nWe were seated instantly on a busy Thursday evening, quickly greeted, drinks seemed to come to our table as soon as we ordered them, and the food quickly followed. One person in my party was a huge dick, while one was super shy. Christine went full force on our party's \"dick\" and kept it a bit calmer for our shy friend. She really wanted to make sure we all had a good time. \n\nI ordered a burger but I realize I should have followed Christine's advice and gotten something more BBQ themed because my friend's pulled pork was amazing. \n\nI would definitely come back here if I'm ever in Las Vegas again. (Who am I kidding, I'll be back to Vegas!)
