My latest visit to The Liberty was quite different than the last two.  There were 5 of us at on of the pub tables in the bar area.  This area is under the bartender's watch.  \n\nThe bartender eventually came to get a drink order but it took forever for the drinks to arrive.  One person ordered food but she missed that and didn't seem to care if the rest of us wanted to order.  When one person asked for the check, she put everyone's drinks on it, assuming all of us were leaving.  Talk about clueless!\n\nThis was a different bartender than my last visit. The experiences between that visit and this visit was quite different.\n\nI also noticed the menu has changed and I am not sure it really appeals to me.  Lamb Pho?  If i wanted Pho, I'd go to one of the Vietnamese places down the street.  \n\nThe one plus about this place is the beer selection.  But what good is a beer selection when the bartender has no clue?
