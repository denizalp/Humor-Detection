I have a friend who insists we eat here when we get together. Sometimes he wins, sometimes I do. \n\nArby's reminds me of the Roy Roger's chain, which I believe they bought a few decades ago, but without the cowboy stuff. The food is not bad now that they have updated their menus. \n\nBut the old beef sandwiches which I do not believe either Geno's nor Pat's would serve in Philly is still on the menu. Ugh. \n\nSomethings do take a while to die I guess. I also need to get new friends. I'm feeling generous today, so I'll give them two stars for the new menu.
