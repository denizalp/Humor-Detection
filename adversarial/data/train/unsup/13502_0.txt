I had been jonesing to try the District for sometime after hearing rave reviews from several folks. I tried to get there for dessert one night, but was rebuffed by the host when I was told there was a private party. So when the opportunity arose to join the #smc crew one night before a movie, I jumped at the chance. \n\nI saddled up to the bar while waiting for everyone else. It was kind of empty, but it was a Wednesday night. They didn't have the biggest selection of bottled beers and being the beer snob I am, I didn't want any of the domestics they offered. Thankfully they had Kiltlifter on tap. They had an extensive wine list as well, for those of you that are interested. \n\nThe rest of the group arrived and we sat a high top in the bar area. They had a Twitter special for $5 meals with a beer. I chose the Meatloaf sliders with caramelized onions and the Gumbo with sausage. The Meatloaf sliders were exceptional, although on the small side, but for $5 well worth it. Very savory sauce and the onions were perfect. The Gumbo wasn't as spicy as billed, but was very good too. The regular menu was a little pricier, but there were definitely some other dishes that caught my eye. \n\nGeorgie S was one of those in attendance and we decided to split the chocolate cake. This was heavenly! Very rich and perfect size for sharing. \n\nOverall a good dining experience. One where I will be back for sure. It is also within walking distance of my building.
