Paid $30 (no additional tax) for a simple dry cut. I came in last minute for an impromptu haircut and waited for no more than 10 minutes. My hairstylist was Saki and she was professional and did her job diligently. I recommend her if you don't like talking while getting your hair done.  \n\nI was in and out less than an hour. Any tips, you give directly to the hairstylist. Note that they only take cash. \n\nI definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a cheap and fast cut. Don't expect any frills but they do offer you a juice box when you come in.
