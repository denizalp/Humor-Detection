I walked into this dealership in the market for a slightly used car with 14K to spend.  I don't know if they sized me up and didn't like the clothes i was wearing but I walked around the lot peering into prospective cars for the better part of a half hour while waiting for a salesperson to come out.  After getting tired of waiting i walked inside thinking that everyone must be extremely busy not to notice a potential customer walking around the lot.  \n\nSo i walk in the door and stood around for another 10 minutes before getting the attention of a guy whose hair was slicked back with about a gallon of hair spray (maybe he wanted to ensure that his doo would survive a nuclear blast?) holding it in place.  I told him I was interested in looking at purchasing a vehicle.  \n\nDoofis: 40 some year old trying to relive being in a frat based on his clothing, hairstyle, language and demeanor: \"Um I'm not actually a salesman.\"\nme: well what do you do then?\nDoofis: I'm a supplier so i don't really deal with prospective customers\nme: um sure, why not?  Can you get me a salesperson, I'm interested in buying a car.\n\nSo he leaves for about 5 minutes and comes back with some kid who looked like he was about 15 and looking forward to watching afternoon cartoons after he got done wiping down cars and sweeping the lot.\n\nKid who looked like he wasn't even old enough to be working legally: \"I'm Chad\" (can't remember his name but just look for the 15 year old trying to be like doofis in every way) \"how much money do you have to put down today?\"\nME: well I have about 14K between cash and pre approved loan\nKID: well most of the cars here are priced higher than that.  Were you looking to finance at all?\nME: yeah thats why i have a loan in hand\nKID: ok what are you looking for?\n\nLong story short i proceeded to rattle off a few models I had  been looking into.  He showed me a couple of older cars in my price range (all of which had obvious paint missing, dents, and a big sign on the side window NO WARRANTY.  SOLD AS IS.  After looking at a few and an extremely awkward conversation that made it clear this kid was probably on his first job, i sat in a Honda Civic.  I then asked him to tell me more about the vehicle.\nKID: well its a honda and they make great cars\nME: a Honda? Wow you don't say.  \nKID: what else do you want to know?\nME: how many previous owners, was it a repo or fleet car, whats the maintenance history aka carfax, and why so much when it has obvious damage to the body by way of paint chips on the side.\nKID: we can get you a carfax for $75 and we price our vehicles as cheaply as possible.  you're buying from a dealership not a private party.\nME: *getting annoyed at this point*\nKID: (while I was in the drivers seat) \"The dashboard looks like a spaceship\" ( I kid you not this is what i was dealing with)\nME: sure.  Can I test drive it?\n\nKID goes on to tell me that I can test drive it after we go over the paperwork and ensures that I would be approved for a loan. (this after telling him multiple times I had a loan in hand)  I promptly thanked him for wasting my time and that he should seek out some customer service training.  To which he said \"sorry have a nice day.\"  \n\nWell I did have a great day and an even better day after that when i went to a dealer who greeted me as soon as I walked in the door with a great salesperson who gave me a test drive without making me fill out anything, a free carfax, and someone who did a great job earning my business.  Now thats more like it!  I was thinking throughout the day at this other dealer which will appear in a review to come.\n\nDear Yelp, can you please allow users to award negative stars?  Sometimes a single star is just too generous.  Sorry for the long winded review but please don't go here if you would like to treated like a valuable customer.
