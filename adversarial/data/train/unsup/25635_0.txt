The atmosphere is awesome, they have sweet fans outside that blast cool mist on you when it's a hot summer day and the food is delicious! The first time I went here was with my mom one night and we got her drunk for her 66th birthday! She's a huge margarita fan and she was not disappointed. Matt was our server, he had great recommendations and helped navigate the menu very well. He gave us prompt attention and catered to our requests when needed. Overall he provided and created a wonderful dining experience. I'm excited to go back for round two! Cheers.
