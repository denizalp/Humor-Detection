Safe Ship is SO convenient, especially when I am too lazy to go to the post office.\n\nThey take USPS & FedEx packages. They do not take UPS packages, but there is a UPS in the complex across the street.\n\nThe workers are very friendly! I usually just drop-off packages with the label already printed on for work, but they can provide everything you need to ship!\n\nI delayed mailing my friend her baby shower gift (so delayed that she had the baby already) because I needed a box big enough to ship it in. I brought in my presents & it was a no more than a 5-minute process! They measured the size to determine what box it would fit it, weighed it, asked for sender & recipient address, what kind of shipping I would like, paid for it, got the tracking number & that was it! I didn't see them put it in the box, tape it up & etc., but my friend texted me a few days later saying she received it!\n\nI highly recommend this place if you need help with shipping!
