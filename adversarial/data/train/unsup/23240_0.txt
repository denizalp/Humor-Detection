Milestones BRUNCH review! Ya heard.\n\nAlthough I'm not a huge Milestones fan, one Saturday morning we were lusting after some brunch and took a chance on Milestones. We were pleasantly surprised!\n\nDoors open at 11:30am, and this particular location, the dining room is located upstairs where there is tons of light and seating. (Elevator and stair accessible).\nWe started off the meal with raspberry mimosas - DELISH. The sparkling wine, raspberry puree and fresh raspberries were a great combo (they also had a tropical fruit option). Then onto the main course. All ranging around the $10-12 price point, we had the Milestones traditional breakfast (three eggs anyway you like, bacon, fresh fruit, homefries), French toast (made on fresh baguette, syrup, strawberries and some sort of cream to top it off), eggs benedict (huge serving, delicious), and an omelet (they offered western of mediterranean accompanied with bacon and fresh fruit).\n\nThe menu isn't huge, and doesn't offer anything 'basic' like pancakes, bagels, etc. The servings are huge, but everything we ordered was done to perfection. I highly recommend the french toast, not too eggy. \n\nThe fresh fruit showing with the traditional breaky was a little weak, but other than that, we had tremendous service (ya I said tremendous), delicious food and a good family visit. Thanks for paying Mum & Dad
