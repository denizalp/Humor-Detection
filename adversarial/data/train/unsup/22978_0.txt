$23 for the lunch buffet!\n\nI came with my friends and we waited in a lonnngggg line to get in. Actually, the line wasn't all that long but the WAIT was! We were getting a little frustrated because there were obviously empty tables inside but they were just not filling them for some odd reason, AND we were dying of thirst. We were so dehydrated and just wanted some water. So when we got towards the front, we complained to who I'm guessing was the manager because he was wearing a suit and dressed differently from the others, and he actually brought us cups of water to sip on while waiting in line! SO nice of him! I really wasn't expecting that.\n\nAs for the food, it was GREAT! I actually liked the food better this time around more than my first trip here when I came for dinner. This time, they didn't have the bone marrow or crab legs, and only one kind of mac & cheese though... but everything I tried was delicious! I really liked the shrimp cocktail which comes in shotglasses with the cocktail sauce in them already. The tritip was pretty good too! I even loved the edamame because it had this addictive seasoning on it. This buffet is unique because everything comes in small portions already and you can just grab the little plates to place on your tray. No scooping necessary, which is AWESOME.\n\nTheir gelato bar is so cute and a must try! The scoops and bowls are super mini so you don't feel so guilty trying all these different flavors. ;)
