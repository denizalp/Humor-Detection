I am only giving one star because there is no option for zero stars. Talk about a lack of customer service and this place takes first place. I walked in with a large box, about 25 pounds, and a parcel in an envelope and was told in a less than friendly manner, put it on the scale. She then went back to doing whatever she had been doing. I must have interrupted her ignoring, because I had the audacity to ask for a receipt. Still without a word, she scanned the packages and handed me the receipt. Not a word of thank you or anything, just back to ignoring. If someone is that unfriendly they should not be dealing with customers.
