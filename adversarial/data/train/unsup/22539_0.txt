So as a disclaimer, I didn't actually stay here. Nor did I game except for a celebratory pull at an oddly confusing slot machine. I was here for the Yelp Spring Break bar crawl, and the promise of $2 frozen Long Islands (basically Coke slushies, but you know what, those are damn good) from pretty girls who looked unusually happy about their jobs lured me and a few others away from the pack.\n\nAs soon as we got our drinks we were approached by the hotel manager, who offered to give us a tour of the new suites before they opened. This was notable because every other property on the bar crawl had completely ignored us, so we were quite happy to take her up on her offer. On the way we got to see some interesting artifacts from the casino's history - the first telephone in Vegas, bottles left in the attic in 1906 from drunk workmen - and learn that the elevators are used to generate energy on their way down, which is both eco-friendly AND really neat. The new suites were beautiful and extremely reasonably priced, and surprisingly quiet considering the location on the bustling corner of Fremont. \n\nBack down in the lobby we got to enter a drawing for two free nights at one of the new suites (which one of my friends won!) and approached by their casino floor hospitality manager who chatted us up and gave us his card, but definitely seemed like he enjoyed the conversation and wasn't just trying to sell the property. The Golden Gate seems like a friendly, well-run casino and if I ever stay downtown that's where I'll be!
