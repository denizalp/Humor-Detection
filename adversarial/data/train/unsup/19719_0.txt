Bought 2 granite slabs , was not able to pick them up for a year do to a fire at my home, I had conversations with them to explain this and they acknowledged my issues. When I finally made it back to pick up my fully paid for granite in the amount of 679.26 the owner said it wasn't there anymore and there was nothing he could do. I accept some responsibility for not picking up my granite sooner yes. However they would not right the situation in any way. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. Please do not pay for anything unless you take it right away.
