Oh. My. God. Truly delicious food\/drinks and super-fun atmosphere!\n\nI went to the So. Central Phx location a couple of weeks ago after a long hike and was overjoyed to see such awesome decor and cool, ghetto-fab vibe. Tried the sangria (yum) and the frozen house margarita. Sooo huge and filling!\n\nI had the Pork Pozole and was so damn good. Mmmm - I ordered the large size and had to take the rest home in a Dixie cup. It was so good that I got hungry again driving back to Fountain Hills so I drank the pozole from the cup en route. Sooo good!!!\n\nExcellent service and quick turn-around of food\/drink orders. Didn't disappoint me.
