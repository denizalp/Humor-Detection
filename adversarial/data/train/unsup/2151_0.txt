I had heard of Stoney's from friends that had been to Vegas.  So when a group of my friends and I planned a trip we planned a Friday night visit to Stoney's.  \n\nPOSITIVES: great looking facility, decent sized dance floor, free dance lessons (if you don't consider having paid a cover charge), DJ did play a song we requested even though he said it wasn't typically played there.\n\nNEGATIVES: covered charge was $10 for out of state (locals are $5), too many teenagers, instructor was too fast in her teaching, food is over priced.\n\nTo be honest I was so frustrated by being charged double to enter the club, it was hard to enjoy myself.  I feel certain I will not be good no there again.  We danced 2 nights at a club near Treaure Island.  We arrived before 10pm and paid no cover.  The floor at this \"other\" club might be smaller, but they are better at making a tourist feel welcomed.
