As you can see I've only put in a few reviews because a place has to be extremely impressive or the worst thing I've ever experienced for me to take the time. This is obviously the latter of the two. These sickos here come around at 9AM aggressively knocking and then entering your room to ask what time you're checking out. In a city where most people only sleep a few hours, that's a truly sick practice - check out is at 11am, no I should not need to put a privacy notice up before going to sleep, if I'm not checked out don't enter my room you sick sick people. \n\nAnyways, if you value the little sleep that you get in Vegas, I would not stay here - they walk down and knock\/enter your room at random and 2 hours before your check out time, I heard them doing it in mass throughout the halls like a god damn prison.
