I've driven by Sushi 101 many of times and never really had that urge to try it. My son and wife always has Japanese urges and we were in Tempe so what the heck. \n\nI walked in and the place isn't too big or small. Nothing really stood out to me. The waitress was very good in greeting us and getting our drinks. \n\nI ordered the Spicy Chicken Yaki Soba with skinny noodles. It had cabbage, carrots, chicken, and green onions. Not bad. It had a nice kick to it. Not overly spicy but probably just right. My daughter had the Chicken Yaki Soba and it was exactly like mine but without the spice. She really did like her dish and gobbled it up. \n\nAs for my son and wife, they got the Raman noodle soup. It had everything in it. Cabbage, carrots, fish cake, chicken. They both thought that it was way too salty. So they didn't like it at all. This is why I was struggling on rating this place. It's really a 3 1\/2 star. \n\nWe got all of our food before our sushi. We got the Rainbow and Dragon rolls. I thought they were sort of small but were very good. Enjoyed them. Liked the idea of presenting the rolls on tea leaves. Nice. \n\nOverall the service was good. She kept our water glasses filled and kept on checking on us. Food was good and so so (little to salty for our liking). So since my wife and son are the Japanese food lovers, not sure if we will be back again. We'll see. Again 3 1\/2 stars.
