For only being open less than a week you really can't complain. Once seated we were greeted immediately even though it was super busy. (The wait was about 35 mins) After we ordered the food came pretty quick. Our waiter Miguel was amazing, super friendly and helpful. If you don't want to deal with the wait, call in and they can reserve you a table and call you 5 mins prior till your table is avail!
