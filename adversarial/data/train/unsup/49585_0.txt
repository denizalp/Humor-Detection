Spoke with the wonderful owner. This was my first time here and not my last. This meal was probably THE BEST fettuccine Alfredo I've ever had AND I ate the whole thing. They also have a huge vegan menu as well\n\nSounds like they could use some reliable wait staff there. The service was great tonight, but they've had difficulty getting regular dedicated staff.\n\nKeep up the great work!! I'll definitely be back
