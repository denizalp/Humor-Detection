I get it- they are competing with Total Wine and felt the need to literally compete by building a spot in the same shopping center. \n\nIt's neater and nicer looking that most Lee's I've been to. In general, I can find a few beers here that sometimes isn't carried or out of stock at Total Wine. I'll always browse various stores to round out the collection of beers. \n\nHowever, the recent visit is all about spirits. The prices were more than Total Wine. We were looking  to purchase bourbon and were comparing stock between various stores of a few brands on our shortlist. We decided on grabbing Blanton's and it was $51.99 here and at Total Wine for $42.99. Of course, we crossed the parking lot and bought it there instead. \n\nWe were standing there for a while and comparing and debating. The store was empty aside from one other guy browsing and with at least 4 people not having a specific job, like the tasting booth or cashier, standing around I find it surprising that they didn't at least come on over to check on people. It wasn't until we were trying to leave did people try to ask us if they can help us with finding something. Maybe if they did approach us, we wouldn't have been on our phones looking at information and found that it's cheaper elsewhere. 5 items came up cheaper at Total Wine, 1 item came up same price. \n\nBeers I will definitely browse, but this probably is not the place we will be purchasing fine spirits to build up our collection.
