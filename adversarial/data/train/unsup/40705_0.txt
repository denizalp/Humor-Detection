looks cool and hip from the outside, but the street... while not sketchy, seemed a bit deserted for a saturday night.  i get it this is wisconsin, still.\n\ngot drinks at the bar then found seat by the front door; didn't appear there was wait staff coz we ended up waiting by the bar for our drinks and bringing them over ourselves.  oh wait, there WERE a couple of waiters--we were debating which was hotter.... or were they just bartenders?  seriously can't remember xD (sorry that was a year ago).  either case, maybe the seemingly \"lack of service\" wasn't their fault; we ordered the drinks prior to sitting down at the booth.\n\nfriend who used to live there LOOOOVES their grasshopper; insisted we both have one (coz she's not sharing hers. lol).  bartender instantly and honestly told us they might be out of one of the ingredients thus wouldn't be able to make two (but it was saturday night!!!!!), lucky at the end, he was able to produce two drinks, of the same size with the same great quality.  there was slightly a little too much ice-cream than i need in an alcohol drink (oh yes! he was afraid they might be out of vanilla ice-cream!), but it was decent regardless.\n\nlater on had a \"dirty girl scout\" shot; pretty damn good!  was trying to replicate that one after returning home, to no avail.  you're not making me fly all the way back to wisconsin for that one shot, are you???  coz i just might....  haha kidding.
