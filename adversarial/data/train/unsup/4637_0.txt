We recently stayed here for 2 nights, July 20-22.  This is yet another one of the Diamond Resorts that fail to deliver the \"upscale\" \"4 star\" experience that Diamond Resorts nationally advertises.\n\nThe pros...\n\nBeau Bryant. Beau is a great property manager.  Not only did he greet my family as we arrived... (not knowing who he was) but was always polite and helpful throughout our stay helping with luggage carts and everything.  It seems like he was everywhere checking on things and always available to assist anyone.  But when I finally went to Management over the issues I was having, he was very accommodating and understanding, and honestly, Beau is probably the reason this resort can operate.\n\nSometimes a person can make a difference, and Beau is one of those people.\n\nThe cons...\n\nThe CEO goes on UnderCover Boss, CBS national primetime TV show to advertise to the world how wonderful Diamond Resorts are... what a scam.  these resorts are nothing close to the \"4 star\" quality at any of their competitors\n\nLeaky toilets throughout the night, lights that don't work, dark shower, dust everywhere, a pile on the ceiling fan above the dining room table, dirty dishes, furniture from a Salvation Army that will break as they provide wobbly support.  You can not put your suitcase on the bench as it will most likely break.\n\nI would be giving this resort a 2 star, but Beau has earned the other 2 stars.  Lucky for DRI.
