We'll always have Paris! This charming little cafe is a great place for a rendez-vous bien sûr. The shop offers pastries, macarons, and coffee drinks. All the macarons looked delectable and I can easily eat a whole box of them but restraint was the theme of the day so I indulged in a 3 pack of mango, Earl Grey, and cappuccino macarons. I also asked about their canelé de Bordeaux since it looked like a unique and tasty treat but sadly they did not have any available when I visited. I couldn't resist getting an affogato and decided on going super caffeinated by having cappuccino gelato with the espresso. \n\nOf the three I enjoyed the cappuccino the most with its rich coffee flavor. The Earl Gray was beautifully decorated with real tea leaves on top and I liked the balance of sweetness with the tea. The mango was decent but was a little too sugary sweet for my tastes, with more of a light mango flavor, like the kind of mango flavor you find from mango syrup or mango extract. All three were delightfully light and had that wonderful interplay between chewy and crisp that I enjoy about good macarons. \n\nI really liked the affogato. The cappuccino gelato was so rich and smooth tasting, a perfect complement with the equally smooth and pleasant espresso. I would go back here for the affogato alone!\n\nService was very pleasant and sweet from the lovely lady at the counter who had an equally lovely and plaisant French accent. \n\nIn this sea of chain restaurants and shops at Desert Ridge, Paris Rendez-vous is a little gem!
