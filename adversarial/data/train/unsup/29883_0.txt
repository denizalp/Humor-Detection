We ordered 4 chorizo breakfast burritos and 15 minutes later she wants hand us 3 potato & 1 chorizo burrito. NO!!!! We had to wait while they obviously had to make the correct order . No apologies or explanation of why we had to wait!!!! I'd give negative stars if it was an option. Total wait 40 minutes.
