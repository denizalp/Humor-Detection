WARNING!!! This is IMPERIAL PALACE, NOT a new hotel as they may lead you to believe!!!\n\nWith that being said, I don't even know where to begin with the flipping list of complaints and how the IP duped and hijacked our vacation from the start......\n\nNo cell phone service= no data or communication as you please.....esp if you are ATT....\nTherefore you MUST pay 20$ a nite for the worlds worst internet service.....and can ONLY connect 2 items (phone, com, iPad, etc). Downloading ANYTHING is strictly forbidden and closely monitored= no Netflix, cannot order food, play ur games normally, etc.....\n\nConstruction= me SUPER annoyed during my Vegas vampire hours (starts at 6am). If u complain about this, they will ONLY offer to move u to another tower that is the old IP staunch.......ewwwwwwww\n\n\nRoom service? I think NOT, ONLY from 6:30 am to 1:30 pm.....unbelievable \n\nHungry and happen to want food outside that miserable time slot, then get dressed, or stay n ur Jammie's as I did, and be prepared to go hunting for your food= spending more $ at the flipping IP YOU did'nt even want to b at.....gettn pissed now!!!\n\nI wanted to order food from a service, but IP specifically câ‚¬ck-blocked that effort too......so now, ur hungover, sleep deprived, no room service, and gotta get ur lazy ass up to spend some more $$$ at this sht-hole.....food \/ effort \/ patience alone will cost u more than ur 3 nights here.........\n\nWant to complain or speak to the manager? Prepare yourself.......seriously, because this guys strategy of dealing with unhappy people as myself and my friends will only make ur temperature rise........really high. He does the ole bait and switch, or mor what u would call \"gaslight\" u, dismiss ur concerns, and maybe offer something minimal in return......ugh.....\n\nI actually began identifying and having compassion with my captor......these poor employees have to deal with the brunt of pissed people as myself ALL DAY and all night long.......jeez....I'm even sick of my own complaining!!!\n\nLong story short.....stay somewhere else, or anywhere else for that matter.....
