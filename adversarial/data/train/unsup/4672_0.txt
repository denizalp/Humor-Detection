Fausto's almost got two stars. Almost. That second star went down the toilet that I had to rush to about 10 minutes after eating their food. TMI, sorry, that's what their food did to me.\n\nI love Mexican food. Absolutely love it. Eat it as often as possible, it's delicious. After years of hearing about Fausto's and spending every Wednesday driving past it, we were at a loss of where to go last night, so to Fausto's we went.\n\nI ordered a two enchilada plate, and a taco. $7.00 for this, how is that cheap?\n\nWhen my food came out, I dove into the taco, it had a couple slivers of cheese and a head of iceburg worth of lettuce on there. After adjusting the lettuce to taco ratio, I enjoyed the flavor of the snack. $2.00 for a taco is kind of steep though, so it was not THAT good.\n\nNext up, I was curious, did Fausto's actually make their enchiladas with melted cheese inside, or are they like everywhere else and pawn off shredded cheese wrapped in a tortilla, drenched in red sauce, with melted cheese on top, as enchiladas?\n\nAs I expected, but hoped to be wrong, their \"enchilada\" was filled with cheese that looked like it was almost on the verge of melting, a drastic improvement over other establishments, but still very disappointing.\n\nThe \"enchilada\" flavor was OK, the shredded cheese inside just distracts from the enchilada experience.\n\nAlso, when telling someone their total is $XX.50, then charge them $XX.75 for using a card, without any notice or a sign stating your policy, you insure I won't eat there again, even if the food was amazing. I hate being lied to, and I hate being charged more than you just told me I was being charged.\n\nWhen looking for a table to sit at, we were relegated to the table beneath the blaring tv. Why? Because every single other table in there was filthy. They had a kitchen full of staff, not that many people ordering food, yet the dining room was a sty.
