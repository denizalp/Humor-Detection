I'll be straight up on here.  I am definitely a club rat, I love music, dancing, and hanging out w\/ friends, to have a good time, etc.  The workers at this place act all hard and sh*t.  I can expect that from bouncers, but OMG I know this guy was the manager or something.  He gave me attitude to get out of the way and walk in.  I didn't even do anything, I didn't know!  He shoved me into the other room and closed the door behind me.  WTF? Seriously?  I waited at the that door for the longest time for my friends to come in, but they didn't let them in.  This place let everyone in except my friends.  So...I walk back to the front to figure out what the problem was.  When I walked to the front, the same manager or whoever he was, yelled at me again.  He was very disrespectful and rude.  I called him out on that.  Then he tried to get me out of the club.  My couple of my guy friends barely paid to get into the door, and then this guy kicked me out, and so they had to follow.  The guy who started problems with me called his bouncer in to reliquish me.  Yea, that guy is big, ok...tell me to leave, don't shove\/push me.  I'm not wearing flats.  I will never go to this place again.  How will a club survive with bad customer service? They won't!!!!!  And who names a club \"Wild Knight\"?  Wild Night would've been better than \"Knight\"!  So gay...\n\nAlso, they put up a wall in the patio area, so you can't people watch outside.  How boring...\n\nIf you want to have a good time, DO NOT step foot into this club...
