Oh, HELLOOOOOOO! Sail away with me...on their sushi boat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n3 kinds of sashimi (sake, maguro, Hamachi) x 4 kinds of nigiri x 3 specialty rolls.\nWe chose the Ohjah roll, Show Me the Love roll, and Cowboys roll. We tried to choose the most expensive rolls. OBVI. \n\nJust having a boat full of sushi come out to you is (almost) like love at 1st sight.\nEspecially when it's $40!
