This place is bananas.  I saw Avicii play here this month and it was PACKED!!!.  By the end of the day it was tough to get around but nobody seemed to mind.  If you are looking for a wild Vegas experience I don't think there is a better day club.  If you are looking for something quiet and relaxing then be advised, EBC is not the place for you.  Just make sure to bring plenty of cash, all that fun comes at a high price.
