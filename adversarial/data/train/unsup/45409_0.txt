I'll be coming back here for sure! The extensive menu made picking a single dinner a struggle.  The food and drinks were delicious (I had the jumbo lime margarita and the Chori Pollo...the margaritas got in the way of getting a good picture). Great specials and atmosphere. Bonus:  The staff really gets excited for birthdays.  Photo credit Jose Cuervo.
