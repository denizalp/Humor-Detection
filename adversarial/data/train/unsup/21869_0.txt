Best damn breakfast I've had in a while. \n\nThere are a LOT of great options in Vegas for a hearty breakfast\/brunch, so it's not easy to find a place that really impresses. But Eat managed to serve up some ungodly portions of delicious breakfast food, with a level of quality and execution that was nearly flawless. Let's start with my country fried steak, which was fried to a beautiful crisp, while maintaining a nicely tender center. Matched with chunks of thick gravy and streaks of the runny egg yolk, each bite was beautifully savory and satisfying. The corned beef hash with eggs and toast was equally generous in portion, and came nicely seasoned with an appropriate ratio of potatoes. Each dish was hearty and flavorful, without being overly greasy or heavy.\n\nAs equally as impressive as the food, was the organization and execution coming from the kitchen. We sat at the counter and was able to observe how Chef Natalie was constantly hustling and communicating with her staff. They were like a well oiled machine, and it was both impressive and refreshing to see someone that on top of everything coming out of the kitchen. It's no wonder that the food came out promptly, was prepared well, and tasted great.\n\nSo if you're looking for a nice little breakfast spot that serves up some creative dishes with quality ingredients and generous portions, come eat at Eat. At the very least, you'll get the satisfaction of knowing that your food was prepared with some attention and care. And that's actually worth something to me.
