Came here for a Sunday morning brunch. They have some of the regular American breakfast items, like eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. But given the $30 price tag attached to the brunch, you're better off getting the prime rib, live omelette, live waffles, and live donuts. \n\nTheir interior is fantastic. It's an old railway station converted into a fancy restaurant. They also have a marriage hall in the premises.\n\nIt's not very good for groups of size more than 7. We were a group of 10, so we were split up across two tables.
