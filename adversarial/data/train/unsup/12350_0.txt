My friends and I were visiting from NYC and decided to try out Peter's spot. We sat out on the patio hoping to order some food and drinks. The music was good. We sat and waited and waited. Finally my friend went to the bar to grab a menu then we were able to request additional menus from the busser and he said he would send a waitress over. We placed our order for food and drinks and requested water. Then we waited waited waited. The patio was hot and we were dehydrated and we did not understand why WATER was taking so long. Some of the staff came to check on us and we kept saying we didn't get our water and they would say okay without going to get the damn water. Eventually after not getting water or the food and drinks we ordered we had to just leave. My friend spoke to the manager and instead of resolving the issue right then and there she started bad talking her staff and dancing and telling us to come back the next day for brunch. So unprofessional. We saw Peter on the way out and he could of tried to resolve the issue with us as well but he was acting stand off ish. But he did look sexy lol.\n\nHorrible service. Ppl really need to understand how to properly run a business and how to resolve issues to always make customers leave happy. Smdh!
