I had an issue with my back door locks - after doing some googling, found out that it was a common issue with the actuators not working.  Every time my car would hit the 10 mph speed, my doors would auto-lock, except for the 2 back ones - they would grind so loud.  My CR-V is less than 6 years old - I don't think for the amount I paid, and it being a Honda brand, should the locks already be dysfunctional - especially with my 6-YO sitting in the back.  I tried to reach the Honda Customer Service through Twitter, through FB, through my local dealership to no avail.  I finally sent a letter to the corporate headquarters and within 5 days, I received a phone call.  I was asked to bring in my CR-V to my local Honda dealership for them to do a diagnostic test on the car to make sure that it was indeed the actuators.  They ended up fixing my locks for me and I paid only a small tiny chunk.  Should they have paid for all of it?  Probably, but the cost incurred to me, wasn't worth another argument and again, was a very reasonable small price.  All I cared about was that my locks were fixed, that it would stop grinding and that my son was safe sitting in the back.  \n\nCustomer service there was great - my contact was Ryan and he was great from beginning to end.  The waiting area has also expanded greatly since the last time I was there.  And the free donuts, coffee and popcorn were an added bonus.
