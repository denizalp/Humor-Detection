Wow, I can't believe I've haven't reviewed Tokyo Boys yet.  I've told my parents and friends to come here and support this family owned one-off Japanese sushi bar\/restaurant helmed by an ex-Nobu alum but I just noticed I hadn't reviewed them after coming here so many times.  I usually forget to \"check in\" so it must've slipped my mind to give these guys a glowing 5-star review.  I usually get their bento box which gives you a variety of items (you get to pick the items)...all well executed.  Today I ordered something off the menu called a ten-toji don and the very nice server affirmed that they can make it for me...Yay!!  It turned out to be very good as well.  Sometimes I opt for sushi or a couple natto hand rolls here as well and everything is always spot on.  Service here is consistently friendly and prompt.  I am hoping if you are in the area, stop in and try this place out for some good nihon-shoku (Japanese food).  Try their sushi, cooked foods, or specialty rolls...they are all on point!   Nice to always see a friendly welcoming smile and greeting when I come in.
