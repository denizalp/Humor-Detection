We got there around midnight and the place was so packed we (3 people) squeezed in a table for two. The music was loud af you have to yell on top of your lungs to get your conversation - any sound waves - across the table. Thankfully though, you can, in turn, select what goes into the speakers from the jukebox where you could play some Canadian classic such as 'Boyfriend' by Justin Bieber. \n\nAs for food, even at 4.95$ a dish (dirt cheap), I still feel like I've been underwhelmed on most parts other than the salt profile: everything (including the sauce and soup) was saturated with NaCl (or sodium chloride for non-chemists; table salt for scientifically-illiterates). I felt like I was walking Bob, my chihuahua, down in New Orleans during hurricane season, where Bob and I involuntarily swallow a couple liters of sea water each  -- except at L'entrepot, t'was a torrent of iodized table salt and no water (very busy night, despite the numbers of waiters).\n\nWell that's that on the saltiness, other than that...\n\n5$ maple glazed onion rings sounded like a nice deal until you realize it's just a fancy name with no maple taste or maple what-so-ever. In fact, it's regular onion rings with a thin coating of burnt sugar.\n\nThe burgers, namely the 'constructeur', the 'BBQ fum√©', and the 'Swiss aux champignons' had cheap patties that 'felt like Harvey's'. In terms of dressing, I'd take a bacon McDouble over the 'constructeur' any day of the week (excluding weekends cuz I might be drunk enough to not mind). \n\n\nWith this kind of a review, why I am still giving out 3 stars? Because the place was full while the streets were empty and people seemed upbeat despite the plated salt and music (Boyfriend) by a Canadian literary genius. It's hard to argue with success.
