Franchise by Chinese people. How much of a coincidence is that!? I know my race too well I think.\n\nYes they r busy becuz it's a Quiznos only. My sandwich is not even warm after it came out from the toaster.\n\nOrdered a mesquite chicken, I can count how many pieces becuz it's so little. Alot of condiments, condiments r cheap oh pls.\n\nIs it me or is it just this Quiznos? I've been to other which I have experienced much better. \n\nI was jus craving for a sub and stumbled upon this place. \n\nDedicated to higher quality? Hmmm....think again!
