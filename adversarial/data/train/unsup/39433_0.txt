Very delicious. Arrived at a busy moment and was told the wait was 30-35 minutes. We are a party of 5 with 3 kids all under 3...waiting is always unpredictable. Waiting area is small and felt in the way with people going in and out. We were actually seated in 10 minutes! Had the table right in front of where they make the tortillas! This was great for our almost 3 year old. Wait staff was grand; never had an empty drink! Chips and salsa were wonderful! Added bonus was the grilled veggies that came first! Ordered steak fajitas for two (loved the fact you could choose rice and bean or veggies) and a children's quesadilla (had choice of rice and beans or french fries)! Fideo before entree was another added bonus!  All food was amazing! Kids started to argue over the one orange slice so asked waiter for another one, he brought six! Fantastic place and we will definitely drive all across the valley again to come back!
