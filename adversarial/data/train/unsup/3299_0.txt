His show is boring! Nothing new and nothing exciting. His acts are the same as what you already see on TV. I don't know why it is associated with Cirque Du Soleil, there is no Cirque in his show at all.  He talks most of time....about his childhood and how he became an illusionist. I mean, it's ok, but make it sound more interesting! He sounds like he is just reading someting...with no feelings at all. Lol. If you want to see magic, I'd recommend David Copperfield instead!\n\nI'll give him 2 stars since I've met him a few times at work, and he's really friendly, warm, and personable!
