Love schwarmas because of the amount of vegetables that you can have to accompany your plate or sandwich. This place boasts a variety of salads and different types of vegetables such as grilled eggplant and peppers. All the ingredients were fresh and the portions are massive! After all you are paying about $12-13 per beef\/chicken schwarma plate which is about $3-4 higher than the average price. For overall quality, ingredients were fresh just the chicken maybe need more flavour.\n\nAlso, be aware that the parking lot is not the best. It shares the same lot as Burrito Boyz and a few other businesses and there is only about 6-8 parking spots so you will likely have to park on the street if you come during lunch or dinner hours.
