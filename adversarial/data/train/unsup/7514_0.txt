I have struggled with the desire to become very fat for my entire life. That is, after one enormous meal, my immediate thought is to have another enormous meal. \n\nAfter eating a fairly hefty order of dim sum at U&Me, I decided to check out Jing Jing Bakery, which is located, conveniently for us fatties, in the basement of a building right across the street. \n\nA bakery in a basement must provide wonderful ventilation for the rest of the building. Also, this is what I love about Chinatown's everywhere. The near chaotic order of it all. There are no empty spaces in Chinatowns, everything has something in it, and it makes for very colourful, beautiful neighbourhoods.\n\nSo to the bakery, it's tiny. Really tiny. I think there are just two ovens in the whole place, but they must have them running night and day because the place is jammed with pastry. I can't even remember the name or type of the cream cake that I had (I think it was almond), but it was just amazing, and very inexpensive.\n\nI'd give this place more stars, but I've only been here once, so I can't speak to it to a level I would find satisfactory, but I am definitely going back.
