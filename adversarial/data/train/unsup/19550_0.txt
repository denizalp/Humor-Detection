Please make my noodles BY HAND! Thanks! \n\nSERIOUSLY!!! They hand pull their noodles here. If you are lucky (or you just ask) the chef will even come out and pull noodles. Amazing! And you can taste the difference! The noodles are so delicious!\n\nI always have the mushroom and beef noodles. Oh wow! So flavorful and rich. We shared the wontons in chili sauce appetizer last time and it was so good. I don't even like spicy food but it was goooooood!\n\nThis place is located in a small strip mall and you could miss it if your not looking. It is quaint and clean and the staff is always friendly. \n\nIf you are looking for not only a good meal, but a neat experience you should stop by. Trust me, Beijing is not that far! LOL
