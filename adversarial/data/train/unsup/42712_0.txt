Awesome little place I got to check out over the weekend. \n\nLet's just say I had a rough night the night before so I just ordered a hot tea haha. BUT...my friends ordered some breakfast\/brunch and the food looked delicious. \n\nIt has a great little atmosphere and they even serve Fros√©!! \n\nNext time I'm in town I'll definitely stop by again.
