No offense to my fellow ladies out there but I don't do weaves. Ever. It's just not my thang. I like to keep my hair homegrown and not store bought, mmmmk? I also let go of that creamy crack (aka relaxers) many many moons ago. \n\nSo when I relocated to metro Phoenix, I searched and searched and SEARCHED for a salon that could handle my natural black hair. I even contemplated taking the 5ish hour drive back to San Diego to go back to my old hairdresser. Then I found Mozell. And how ridiculously happy am I that I did! She is fantastic. She walked though the entire process from end to end about what she was doing, what I could do at home in between salon visits, etc. I mean, honestly, she already won me over after I found out she watched Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder, so being able to do my hair was just icing on the cake. I've already referred some other ladies to her. Check her out, ladies! You wont' be disappointed.
