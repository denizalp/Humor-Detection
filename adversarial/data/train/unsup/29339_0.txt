So, i'm not a big dessert fan.. and I've heard all the hype about these crepe cakes, but didn't see what the big stink was until i tried one.\n\nI tried the green tea matcha cake and wow.. was I blown away!!! \n\nThe cake had a perfect amount of creaminess, sweetness, and flavour and though I kept the other half of the cake in the fridge for 2 days... it still retained its deliciousness.\n\nThe cake isn't cheap by any means.. $9 for a slice with tax, but I think it's worth it.  I can't wait to go back and try the other flavours!
