One of our favorite spots! Originally located on 56th & 6th in the heart of Manhattan-its all about the WHITE SAUCE! Get extra, you're welcome. \n\nAlways consistently yummy! The yellow\/orange rice is delicious. I skip the veggies because it is just lettuce and tomato. Some people like it, though. They have platters in two sizes. You can also get a combo. I love the falafel and chicken. Again, extra white sauce! It's cheap and the service is fast as well-extra bonuses. \n\nIf you give them a 5 star   review, you get free fries and a drink! Whoo!! \n\nP.S. We stood in line on opening night for 45 min and met the owner the night before when my Nee Yorker bf \"had to have it\" and he is a super nice guy! \n\nAwesome place! Awesome food! Awesome people! \n5 stars in my opinion
