First time home buyer here and we used Johnny as our inspector off our realtor agents recommendation. He was there on time and stayed for almost 3 hours. We had the radon test done as well. He left a very detailed report and a very easy-to-use repair list guide to send to our agent. What's great is we printed out the report and we can fix things along the way at our own pace. He took his time to explain to my husband and I what he found and what he was going to include on the report. Very thorough and respectful. Will be recommending\/using his services again for sure! Thanks Johnny!
