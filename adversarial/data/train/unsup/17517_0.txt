i love chipotle. i love that when i go here my most difficult question is chicken or barbacoa? always happy with my meal. \n\nwith that said...\n\ntalk about age discrimination. they just started doing a kids meal. it comes with a small taco or quesadilla (a few other things to choose from), two sides plus chips and a drink. for some crazy $3 amount. i am very jealous of all the young people now. \n\na lady in front of me tried to cheat this kid meal system and man did the people working there handle it poorly. they were clearly talking about her while she stood right there, awkwardly waiting and pretending like she didn't understand why she didn't get her sides and drink. um ya, because its a kids meal crazy lady, you're like 30, sorry you're short but you don't pass for an 11 year old. \n\nbut ok chipotle, people. get over it. give her what she thought she was getting and let her know they cant give her a kids meal next time but they will let it slide this time. they held up the entire line while we all got to experience this awkwardness. i was embarrassed for her. i was nervous waiting in line. all i could think was 'do they need to make this so uncomfortable?' \n\ni say no more age discrimination, we should all be allowed to comfortably order the smaller portions. and lady in line before me- next time order by phone to go. that is the proper way to cheat the system.
