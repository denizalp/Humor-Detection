We heard so much about this place from a guy my husband knows from work. I will say that the atmosphere was beautiful and the service was probably the best that I've experienced. My husband ordered lasagna which he said was average and that he had much better many times. I can't even begin to describe my dinner. I ordered a pasta with a clam sauce. It had a green pasta that I think was a spinach pasta and very little clams. It was loaded with Lima beans. Imagine green pasta and green Lima beans!! The base sauce tasted like it was a chicken base which was totally odd for anything with clams. It was very expensive for a dish that seemed to be thought up by a child. I wish I had read some reviews on here first before we went there so I would have ordered something different. I also wish I took a picture of my dish to share on here!
