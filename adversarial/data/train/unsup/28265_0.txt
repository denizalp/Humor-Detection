It is very unfortunate that the Sushi Samba in Las Vegas is the closest spot to the Los Angeles area! Located on the second floor of the Palazzo Hotel, this place takes sushi to a whole new level. It was my last day in Vegas and decided to try it out with some company for lunch. The atmosphere was quite enjoyable! Loved the ambiance. The only bad thing I would have to mention is the lack of service, though it could have been due to the World Cup Finals contributing to the poor service. Nevertheless, this place has DELICIOUS sushi.\n\nCombined total including tip: $100 (4 people)\nOriginality & Taste: 5\/5\nService: 2\/5\nPrice: $$\n\nSuggested Samba Rolls:\n- El Topo ($14): My favorite. Absolutely delicious! Never had anything like it. Fresh salmon, rectangular-shaped sushi (as opposed to your typical round-cuts), melted Mozzarella cheese & crispy onions toppers\n- Rainbow Dragon Roll ($15): Freshwater eel, mango, red bell pepper, avocado. Need I say more?\n- Spicy Yellowtail Roll ($6): Fresh yellowtail topped with just the right amount of spicy sauce
