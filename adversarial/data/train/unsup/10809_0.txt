I don't know what some of  the other reviewers ate or where they went, but towards the end of last week while waiting for a bus to work, the aromas of fresh dough and sauce being prepared overtaxed my stomach. Hunger pangs consumed me, almost completely breaking down my willpower. Yet, I somehow found the inner resolve to fend it all off and punch in on time.\n\nMy brush with a great pizza still haunted me, however, so I vowed to return the next day. After all, Monte Cello's opens at 10AM, believe it or not.\n\nI marched towards the Italian eatery the following morning after picking up a lunch for later at Yimmy's and ordered up two sizeable triangles of sausage-and-onion laden felicity. \n\nThe distinctive crust crepitated when coming in contact with my teeth. The resonant sauce tasted of tomatoes harvested and newly picked from within a 10 mile radius. The seductively milky cheese did its naughty work on my palate subtly, like a nimble, curvaceous harlot wearing nothing but white lace.\n\nAnd for $6.63 including a fountain beverage, the twins may have come cheap, but each one behaved like a baroness.
