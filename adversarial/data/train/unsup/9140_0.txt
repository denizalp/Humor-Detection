There are some places that just have service that is above and beyond what is expected, and Chili King is one those that will make you feel like royalty. \n\nLocated at a place that has previously been other restaurants, we had not initially realized there was a new place here aside from the interesting new white paint spelling out Chili King on the corner top of the building. Walking inside, the interior decorations is slightly different but not dramatically from what used to be there. \n\nWe came by Labor Day, and while it was not our first choice, we weren't planning to eat in. So even though the hostess seated us and cleared off the desk, we expressed that we just wanted to do take out. Hostess calmly and politely shuffled us to another table near the cashier, and bought us a cup of water. \n\nAfter we ordered and paid, we waited patiently for our order, which didn't take too long granted we took some time deciding what to order. Although, there was a slight language barrier. Overall, I had a very pleasant experience and to our surprise, there was two free bottles of water in our take out order.\n\nThere is a mixed of authentic Asian cuisine with plenty of options of American Chinese foods to please anyone and hopefully everyone. I'd love to come back and dine in next time for the full experience.
