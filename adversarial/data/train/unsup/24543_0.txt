Ordered the Big Pimpin' with Provolone, which is the standard cheesesteak with double beef, for $12. Wonderful service, plenty of seating.\n\nThe cheesesteak was excellent. Plenty of beef, of course, but what's great is that the bun is toasted, something the other cheesesteak places don't do. Onions were plentiful, and so was the provolone.\n\nOf course, what you're probably interested in is whether this place is better than \"I Went to Philly\", the incumbent cheesesteak king of Toronto. Between \"I Went to Philly\" and Big Al, it's really down to personal preference. IWtP is like Pat's: finely chopped beef and onions, while Big Al is like Geno's: thicker slices of beef and onions. IWtP uses a special sauce when cooking in order to soften up the beef, while Big Al's does not. IWtP charges extra for provolone and places it beneath the beef, while Big Al places the provolone on top. IWtP does not toast the bun, while Big Al does. IWtP doesn't have a double-beef cheesesteak, while Big Al does. IWtP's prices are slightly higher than Big Al. The Big Pimpin' is $2 cheaper than 2 regular-sized cheesesteaks.\n\nIWtP barely wins out in my opinion because I feel its beef is more tender and juicier, while Big Al is slightly tougher and drier. Still, it's a very close call, and you might prefer Big Al over IWtP yourself! Both of them are worthy for the hungriest of carnivores, and Torontonians are lucky to have both of them around.
