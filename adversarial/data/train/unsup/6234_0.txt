When I saw $13 for a pint, I felt my stomach drop to my feet and I about ran away in fear.. then, I realized I'm a modern woman that can do anything I set my heart to, so I proceeded to the counter. **ok I know I'm dramatic** but really, that's the price for a pint! :\/\n\nThe gelato, however, was absolutely amazing. I tried the toasted marshmallow, blueberry cheesecake yogurt and hazelnut. When you get the second size up (small) you can choose two flavors so I optimized my options and splurged a little. (the pictured size is about $5) and WORTH IT! \n\nThis is definitely a place you go to for a treat and I emphasize on treeeeat (; but truly, it is absolutely delicious.\n\nThe only thing that turns me off is the price point. So good!
