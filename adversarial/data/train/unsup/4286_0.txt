I count myself lucky to have The Fairmount within walking distance of my house. I have never had food that wasn't delicious, a drink that wasn't on point, or service that wasn't stellar. I have been to countless happy hours, stopped by for many-a-nightcap, celebrated, commiserated, hung with friends, brought out-of-town guests, entertained older parents, counted down to midnight on New Years Eve, etc... at my favorite watering hole.\n\nEven when they get really busy, there is no variance in their service - so high five to whoever handles scheduling at The Fairmount (the formula for appropriate staffing seems to often go overlooked!)\n\nObviously, The Fairmount is my favorite, and I happily sing their praises!
