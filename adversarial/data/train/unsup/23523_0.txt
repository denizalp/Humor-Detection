My favorite bar in the Aria. With a real NYC feel it makes for an awesome atmosphere. They also have some really interesting cocktails. Located on the casino floor in the Aria, its very accessible and in the middle of the excitement. Sleek decor and beautiful people everywhere if your ever at the Aria you cant miss out on this place!
