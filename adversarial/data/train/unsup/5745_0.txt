\"I am so sorry for the loss of your of late husband, Rene Angelil and for the loss of your brother, Daniel Dion\" \n\nThis is a must see show, no matter how pricey, it is worth every penny. I highly recommend the show! \n\nPlease Get your tickets now., before she retires. Get your tickets ahead, as her show does sell out, also for good seats, it is best to book ahead. Check out her website for more information.\n\nAs you all know by now, Ceasar Palace Colosseum is home to Celine. This is the perfect venue for her show. \n\nThank you to my hubby for the tickets!! He booked those tickets and surprised me twice!! I had the opportunity to see Celine twice!! \n\nMy very first time was with the hubby and the 2nd time, With my mom. He knows that my mother loves Celine Dion just as much as I did, so when we had planned our family trip to Vegas with my mom, he booked ahead and got our tickets. \n\nHow often do we get to travel to Vegas, With my mom? ( Due to funds, not very often) this is why, I'm forever grateful to the hubby, for these tickets. \n\nEvery time I listen to her song or see anything Celine, it just brings back great memories of her show.!! \n\nQuick highlight: \nCeline is Incredible,\nShe sounds so much better live, her voice is breathtaking, \nShe sang all her greatest hits. \nShe sang in French. I just love her accent. \nShe talks to the audience, \nEnjoyed the slide show, with her family. \nI loved all her gowns!! She changed a few times. She looked stunning!!\nThe Show was very creative, with production and lighting.\nShe was truly amazing!! \nI really enjoyed her performance.!!!\n\nI cried both times, especially, when she sang \"My Heart Will Go On\". \n\nTips: Arrive early, Allow time for parking, expect a full crowd due to sold out shows, it can get crazy entering & exiting colosseum, be careful with crowd ( don't trip, be alert, be aware of your surroundings) after the show, best to take the stairs instead. Bring jacket, it does get cold, don't forget your tissue, & most important, stop at the gift shop for Celine souvenirs. \n\nI want to see Celine again, when my daughter turns 21. Hint... Hint... A Hint to the hubby.!!\n\nThank you Celine for such an amazing performance!!!\nTo the hubby, Thank you for the memories!!\n\n2016 #23\/100 Yelp Challenge
