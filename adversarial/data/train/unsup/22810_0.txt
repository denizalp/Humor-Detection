Once in a while I have to go in for service but unless it absolutely has to be a dealer service, I avoid it like the plague.  Not only is dealer service, in general, more expensive but with this particular dealer I went in with a complaint and they told me it was \"U joint\" and the price was so high my first question was \"is it a safety issue?\" and when I was told \"no\" I deferred the service.\n\nI later went to my regular mechanic and asked him about the same complaint (wobble on the front end)  I wasn't in the waiting area more than 5 minutes and they came and and got me to show me the car while it was up on the lift... the wobble was created by a bubble in my tire!   Now THAT is a safety issue.\n\nIn essence, Lexus of Las Vegas could been responsible for the injury or death of me or others if I bought the whole \"U joint\" line and that tire blew on the freeway or something.  Fortunately, I generally know a line of BS when I hear it and know more about cars than they know so I knew that was most likely either a lie or incompetence.\n\nI haven't experienced this at other dealers.. just the price premium.\n\nI love my Lexus and want to keep it forever.  I would probably by another if I was in need of a new car but not at Lexus of LasVegas!
