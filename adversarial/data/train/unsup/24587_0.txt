Love the @StreetsofNY lunch specials!\n\nTwo slices of cheese pizza, plus drink; or one slice, and a salad (caesar or garden), plus drink, for $5.\n\nWent with my girlfriend, and loved the atmosphere at this location.\n\nTheir pizza is some of the best to be had, and though our waitress was ostensibly unable to distinguish between ranch, and bleu cheese, it was a pleasant experience.\n\nI will definitely return to this location, as it's very close to home. :)
