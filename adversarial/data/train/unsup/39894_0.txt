One of my favorite places to stay but it is costly.  \n\nLarge luxury suites, Canal Shoppes, beautiful decor and a very large Sports Bar.  The Suites are equipped with flat screen TVs in the bedroom, living room and the bathroom too.   Be careful not to move the items in the mini bar as you might be charged for it.  \n\nTwo clubs to choose from Tao and Lavo.  Both clubs are awesome.  A little tip: I was told by the reservations specialist to eat at Tao and you can get into the club for free. \n\nThe front desk, casino and restaurant staff are awesome.  Always attentive and kind.  \n\nI will always return to the Venetian and Palazzo.
