Came here at the end of a long day of biking - two sweaty messy men in need of a couple of drinks on a hot humid day.\n\nFelt a bit out of place here - the cider house is a bit more upscale than I was expecting.  Rather than pub-like, it was trendy and full out people on dates, celebrating occasions, etc.  At least the staff made no visible judgement on our appearance.\n\nThat's a great summation of this place - on a now fancy intersection of Toronto, you will find a fancy cider house.  This is by no means criticism, just what you should be expecting.  Food is presented well, with some tasty options on the menu (we had a snack).\n\nAs for the namesake - the cider - it was interesting.  We found some of the combos (mint\/basil for example) refreshing.  There are plenty of options to choose from.\n\nI'd come back here a couple of times a year, when they rotate the flavor taps to become more seasonal, and then you can try something new.  Until then, I'll stick to their very popular, very accessible cans at the LCBO.
