Being from a restaurant - owning family, I would say that I am one of the harder critics to please when dining out. This place has won my respect and business for now on. Not only was the wait staff very prompt and friendly during an extremely busy breakfast rush, the food was quick to the table as well, exceeding my expectations of the kitchen. The atmosphere was awesome, making this chain diner feel like your hometown family owned place. The food was delicious as well, with big portions, especially for the price. I ordered the corned beef hash and was expecting run of the mill out of a can stuff. I couldn't be more wrong. The plate came out and was very obviously home made with no lack of meat. If you like diners and want to feel at home, try this place out!
