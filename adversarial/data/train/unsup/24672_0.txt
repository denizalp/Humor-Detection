Awesome! \n\nVery recommended if you love to play badminton. \n\nOnly 3 Courts, but they are very high quality. Courts are well spaced, with high side court lighting, professional mats, 30+feet ceilings, and professional nets.\n\nAll Day Pass\nBefore 4pm $3\nAfter 4pm     $5\n\nHigh concentration of quality players. For such a small gym I remember 4-5 competitive internationally trained players. A coach is easy to find. Most all other players are intermediate level or above. So if your a beginner either bring friends your level or ask for a coach. Regular players play mostly at night after work, with few exceptions for lunch break time play. So training would be good between 2-5:30. Use Facebook to ask for players in advance if you don't come during the evenings.\n\nFriendly people. Players rotate players after each set, so wait time is minimized when the courts are all taken.\n\nThey also have a nice break room with couches, tv and ps3.
