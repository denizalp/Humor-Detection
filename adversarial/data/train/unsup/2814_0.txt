I was inspired by Michael's Review of the Day yesterday to write on Tamale Store, because quite frankly I haven't had any lately because we just exited the official Mexican tamale season AKA, the three months where every hispanic relative in the state makes gazillions of dryish to OK tamales and you have to eat them because you are related and they think theirs are the best on the planet, so you better tell them they are or they are going to smack you on the back of the head- season of good cheer.\n\nBut back to the task at hand. Tamale store. We were introduced to them at the begining of last year on a day trip up to Payson, where we noticed they had just started up a Farmer's Market in the Chili's parking lot on Highway as you enter town. Heck yes, we decided to stop. \n\nLots of great stuff there, you should definitely check it out, but most notably were the tamales! I claim tamale tasting expertise based on the 27 years of consumption,and yes these are Fantastic. \n\nI became a rabid fan of their green corn, red beef, chicken chipotle. And I will never pass up any opportunity to buy these scrumptious moist delicacies.\n\nBeside the amazing tamales, the staff is INCREDIBLE. They taste out their tamales to everyone that wants some, and bags up the orders with a true awesome love for what they do. They are very helpful and informative for the tamale retarded and find the flavor that you are going to love. \n\nThey have veggie and vegan options which are great. And they sell out fast. The girl told me later in the season on another visit, that they always sell out in Payson, so if you go to this market, head to this booth early. They drive up from Cave Creek, so what they have for that day is IT.\n\nDon't pass this place up.\n\nOh, P.S. In case you were wondering....way WAY better than anything my family made this \"tamale season\"  (luckily none of them have any clue what Yelp means)
