Again, violating my rule to wait until at least two visits to review something. But dang, Inizio, you really took the cake last night. With a large variety of wood fired pizzas and quality ingredients, The Lady and I didn't have a wrong choice, but I think we chose wisely in ordering the Raffaele (tomato sauce based with sweet peppers, sausage, herbs and lots of cheese) and the Pistacchio (pesto, pistachio, herbs, big dollops of cheesy goodness). They have the standard cheese and pepper flakes in shakers, but also have fresh minced garlic as well as hot peppers in little solo containers that can really elevate your flavors. \nService was fast, attentive, and helpful. We took ourselves outside on that gorgeous patio, and our food was at our table within 5 minutes. Fast fire, man. Crazy cool. Pizza was honestly a bit chewier than I expected, but intense flavors and the crust was nice and airy.\nAll pizza comes with a San Marzano marinara sauce and I took our waitress' advice and used it to dip the crust into. Pro suggestion right there, that was great.\n\nThe Lady and I decided to share (bad idea) a cannoli to take home, so we both fought Mortal Kombat style over a pistachio cannoli once we got home. Excellent cream filling, and we saw it made in front of us! (+2). At about $15 for a personal pizza, I thought it was a bit much, but both The Lady and I managed to only eat half of our respective pies and take the rest home, so I'm calling it $7.50\/meal... but that's only when I have self control.\n\nThere's tons to return for, including features, seasonals, and side dishes like a caprese salad I saw a girl make. Also, for fall, there's a pumpkin cream pizza. I think you have to be wearing Uggs in order to get it though. AND I think I saw\/heard a rooftop.... I'll be back to check that out.
