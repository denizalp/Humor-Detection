Just ok for lunch. \n\nFor my one buffet stop this stint in Vegas, I thought I couldn't go wrong at the MGM. To be fair, it wasn't bad, but I definitely should have checked Yelp first. \n\nI guess it's alright for $23 with tax. For the most part, everything I ate was good, but the MGM really lacked that 'je ne sais quois'. Actually scratch that. I do know what it lacked. It was totally void of crab legs, sushi, creme brulee, a carving station, and other buffet elements that I would expect in Vegas. \n\nI expected to be wowed, but instead left way too full and temporarily satiated. \n\nA solid spot for a meal, but by no means an outstanding Vegas buffet.
