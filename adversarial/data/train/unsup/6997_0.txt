Review #500! Yay Me! :P\n\nLucki Thai is located near the corner of Bermuda and Silverado Ranch Blvd, right next to the Fresh and Easy location. \n\nWe've been to South Point more and more lately and wanted to find a new Thai place to try out in the area. After checking on our trusty Yelp! app., we found this place!\n\nItems Ordered:\n\n- Chicken Pad See Ewe ($8.95)\n- Pork Laab (I guess I've been misspelling this \"Larb\" recently...oops, my bad) ($8.95)\n- Side order of jasmine rice ($1.50)\n\n(+) Very friendly and attentive service! Never had to see our drinks empty the entire time we were there!\n\nChicken Pad See Ewe (4\/5) For the price, a very solid portion that was very tasty. Plenty of chicken too!\n\nJasmine Rice (3.5\/5) Kind of hard to mess this up, but they did good! Rice was the perfect combination of sticky and fluffy.\n\nPork Laab (5\/5) Best Laab I've had in this country! Seriously, prepared exactly how I love it! Plentiful portion as well! I will be ordering this dish often!\n\n(-) Only complaints with this place was that the seat was wet when I sat down today and there were a couple small, dried food fragments on one of the plates already at the table when we sat down. I just decided to not use that plate, but still not something you wish to see when you are just sitting down at a dining establishment.\n\nI like this little place a lot! The people are nice and the food is really good and all that at an affordable price! With our recent patronage at South Point, I can see myself coming back here again and again!\n\n4 stars.
