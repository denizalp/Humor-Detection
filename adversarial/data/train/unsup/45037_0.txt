This restaurant has a fun upbeat atmosphere but terrible food. The menu is really large and has many heavy fattening choices.\n\nWent with a group of 4 and ordered:\n\nApp: Full size beef nachos-- This was actually good and we finished it\n\nEntrees: Fried Bologna Sandwich, Ruben Sandwich, and half of a BBQ Chicken.\n\nThe Ruben Sandwich had to be sent back right away. It was had more bread than meat. The meat and coleslaw was totally flavorless. The bread was huge Texas Toast that was soaked in butter. This was replaced with a bowl of Tortilla Soup that was edible but still lacking  flavor.\n\nThe Fried Bologna Sandwich was pretty much the same as the Ruben. All butter soaked Texas Toast and a slab of fried bologna with no flavor. We did not send this back, but only half was eaten.\n\nNow on tho the BBQ Chicken plate. Can we say RAW chicken? When the BF ripped into this it was dripping blood. There were some small pieces that were cooked but for the most part it was raw and bloody. They tried to say it was because they smoked their chicken. Listen, I know the difference between smoked chicken ( which is pink) and bloody raw chicken. Totally disgusting and not worth going back. The BF was sick all night and serving raw chicken is dangerous!
