It's not every wife who has to wait for her husband to leave town so she can enjoy some tastefully rhinestone'd boobies. I don't know what Mike expected, but I know what he missed: fun!\n\nI had my pick of seats on a slow night. I chose the first row of theatre seats, aisle seat, right side. \n\nI'm so glad I changed my mind about an end-booth in \"King's Row.\" The poor person in the one in front of me had to perch on the edge of the seat and hang out a bit in order to see around the curving booth back. \n\nNormally I like to be really close to the stage, even for big productions like Cirque's LOVE, but in this case the table-tops looked a *bit* too close. As a \"fluffy\" woman and misanthrope, I often prefer tables for their superior \"personal space management,\" but the theatre seats at Jubilee are surprisingly spacious, probably the largest I've encountered in town (including some cinemas). I didn't even feel like I needed an aisle seat. Bonus: recline!\n\nMy section was empty until five minutes into the show when a crowd starting filing in. The disruption threw off the whole start of the show for me. Whoever's in charge of Jubilee's last-minute seat-filling could use a whack on the head. (I certainly got several as the newcomers stumbled in the dark.)\n\nSomehow I forgot that the show was topless. So, when suddenly there were nipples everywhere, I had to crack up. (And, having been online for 30 years, the sudden appearance of nipples doesn't usually faze me.) The topless aspect continued to surprise me for two reasons:\n\n1. Cynic that I am, I expected unnaturally buoyant Tatas of Size on every dancer. Instead, the audience sees a mix of everything from \"runs a tad busty\" to \"so flat that her stomach actually sticks out more.\" Hooray! We're probably supposed to pretend we don't notice such things, but the variety of boobosity underscores that Jubilee isn't a parade of over-inflated come-ons set to music. The toplessness is just a fun nod to the risque glamour of yesteryear, and certainly not the main draw of the show.\n\n2. I think I'm more likely to recommend the covered version. Unless you're like me, ticking the topless experience off your Vegas bucket list, do the early show so you can see that much more of the STUNNING costumes.\n\nI walk this earth with jeans, whatever shirt is on top of the clean laundry pile, and a naked face, but there I was, dazzled by the spectacular outfits and about one microphone away from giving breathless red carpet commentary. I expected a clone-line of high kicks and Vanna White turns, and sometimes that was the case, but usually the dancers wore variations on a theme, all of which added to the glamour of the show. (So many one-of-a-kind headdresses, too!)\n\nI've seen plenty of photos and videos of showgirls in my life (not to mention the ones who stand around the casinos for photo ops), but none of that does justice to how the look comes together on stage.\n\nAs for the actual numbers, by the second song, I started to worry. Energy seemed low. I'd seen more \"oomph\" in some cruise ship productions. Luckily the show picked up right after.\n\nThe Sampson and Delilah number was just a beautiful example of dance - incredibly fluid and complex. I thought to myself, \"You can't bring enough eyes to this show!\"\n\nI wondered how they would handle the Titanic. The numbers were reasonably tasteful, focusing more on the high spirits prior to sinking than the actual plunge. (The ship-shaped icecube trays over at the Luxor's Titanic exhibit may have kicked my bar for good taste a bit low when it comes to the tragedy, though.)\n\nThe apparently new Cirque-like bits between the numbers were actually my least favourite part, but for the same reason that so many Cirque shows (not LOVE! LOVE is masterful!) eventually irritate me: you're impressed, you clap, you see a few variations, you clap for each one, you see an even better variation, big applause... and then the entire sequence seems to start all over from the top. Thrice. Judging at how applause diminished as the (otherwise talented) acts dragged on, I don't think I was alone in this feeling when I saw Jubilee.\n\nNo other criticism, though, except that I wish they sold souvenirs. A program, a glass, something other than a photo. I guess I'll just cherish my ticket stub always.\n\nWas I impressed? Yes. Was I entertained? Usually. Was I disappointed when it ended? Pretty much. Did I walk out smiling? Yes, and not just because I was amused at a tourist being forced to delete photos from his cell phone - photos that he took of the theatre *after* the show. (Amused because he distracted security while I took my own pics, which of course came out lousy. Karma! D'oh!)\n\nWith the right expectations (old-school glitz, old-school tits), the right seat, the right price (keep it under $100?), a person with a sense of fun and follies could have a grand time.
