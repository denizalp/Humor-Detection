I come here decently often and I honestly wont stop until they close it down, or drag me out after too many sakes. Their broth is the best in the valley, and I'll fight you if you mention republic of ramen being better. Just. Don't. I've had all of the broths, and it depends on my mood for which one I choose! The staff is awesome too. I'm pretty sarcastic, and when a staff matches me in that department, they get instant brownie points.\n\n\nI crave umami while sitting in 115 degree weather. It's true. I'm a sick individual.
