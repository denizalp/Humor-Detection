I was driving by and remember they now have a Park Road location and I totally turned my car around to go back!!! Tried to place an online order while driving but this location doesn't show up yet. I was able to place a phone order. The person taking the order was very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions. \nGetting to the location may seem hard but if you continue down Abby Place and cut through the parking lot you are able to get to the parking easily. The outside of the building is very nice and they have two entrances and a patio for sitting. Since they just opened they had greeters at both doors handing out menus and give you directions to the counter. Everyone was very friendly. \nI stood in line for about a minute and then was able to speak to someone at a register. I was amazed that my order was ready when I arrived cause it literally took me only 4\/5 minute to get there. They work fast. I was also directed to the condiment station. I was able to grab some more of the yummy yellow sauce for my Arroz Chaufa \nUpon opening the Togo container the wonderful aroma of ginger hits you! The Arroz Chaufa was delicious and the yellow sauce gives it a little spice. \nI'm soooo happy they have a Park Road location. Since it is so close to home and work I know I will be a regular to this location!!!
