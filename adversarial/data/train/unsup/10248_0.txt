Shoutout to comedian Jo Koy and my gf's sister for hooking us up with tickets to Jo's show (at the Mirage) and bottle service (to his after party) at Jet. Jet is actually a pretty nice club, but it seems like its pretty difficult to get in. There is no line. Just a mass group of people trying to get promoters attention to let them in.... Ahhh sounds just like good ol' hollywood, ca! The layout of the club is nice. A mixture of an eqyptian tomb and a old school John Travolta \"Saturday Night Fever\" music video. With that said, I had 2 issues with the club: 1) Guy to girl ration was about 3:1. Doesnt matter to me as I have a gf, and maybe it was just that night, but if youre a single guy, you need to be aware of this. 2) bottle service is not in a separate area than the dance floor\/roped off. Its pretty annoying when people who arent in your group are walking thru your area\/trying to sit on your couch. Tryst and Pure do a pretty good job of separating the two which I really appreciate. But it is what it is I guess. \n\nAll in all its a pretty cool place. If youre a girl (with a group of girls) and have walked around the strip during the day, chances are you will get a a \"free admission\" card to Jet (or some other club) during the day (If youre deemed as \"special\" you will get a bracelet, which enables you to not wait in line and get a few free drinks, fyi). If you dont get either (and wanna go to Jet) just go to Mirage and walk around the casino\/hotel admission area. There will be promoters in suits handing them out. If youre a dude, you know the drill already.
