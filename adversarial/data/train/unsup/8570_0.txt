Love this restaurant's food but the service is so slow due to never having enough employees (7+ years)\nNo better way to NOT create loyal customers. \nThere are 2 tables today and had to ask twice for more bread.  Very disappointing.  \n\nPlease staff appropriately and your business would increase 50%!
