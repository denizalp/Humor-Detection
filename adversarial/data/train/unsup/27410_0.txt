During my last visit , I ordered one of their drinks which did not taste anything like the fruit it was supposed to be . I asked to have it changed for something else because the taste was off , I gave back the drink to the girl behind the register  . I was told if I wanted another drink that I would have to pay, a smoothie just cost you a customer . I know you're new but pleasing your customers should be high on your list, any other place would just exchange the drink free of charge .
