Customer service is the worst I've experienced by far!! As soon as I walked in the man and woman were both rude and it almost seemed as if it were an inconvenience for them to help me. I needed a work dress altered which ended up costing double what I paid for similar alterations at another store. I only went to this store because it was a little closer and I needed the dress done quickly. While getting sized the lady poked me with a pin twice!! The following day I called to check their store times and the man who answered mumbled and wasn't polite at all. If you don't believe they have bad service, call and ask what their store hours are. Phone etiquette should be just as pleasant as face to face greetings with customers. A simple please, thank you, you're welcome... goes a long way. I will never go back to this store and will tell everyone to stay away.
