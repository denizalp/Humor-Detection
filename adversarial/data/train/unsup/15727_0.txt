There's good news, and there's bad news. The bad news? This place is pretty dang expensive. The good news? It's totally worth it.\n\nAll good things in life come at a price, and good chocolate is priced at around $2.50 a piece for a small, delicate, decadent truffle or bon bon. If you come here on Truffle Tuesday though, they're one dollar a piece (maximum 10 pieces). And let me tell you, it's a steal for the quality.\n\nThey have other deals for different days of the week as well, such as cake slices and cookies. While I'm not a fan of their dense and heavy cake slices, I am a fan of their cookies. I definitely recommend trying them once, but I'm sure the first time you walk in the door and you're enveloped in the sweet, delicious smell of warm, rich chocolate chip cookies, you'll be convinced. They bake them fresh regularly throughout the day and the smell is like Willy Wonka's chocolate river: I want to metaphorically swim in it (without the getting sucked up in a tube ordeal). \n\nI do have one more piece of bad news to deliver and, that is, Jin Ju sets the bar way up high. It makes eating chocolate an experience, and most chocolate will pale in comparison after you try the quality I've only ever found here.
