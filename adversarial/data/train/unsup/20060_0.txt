You're going to have to give me a break. I've only worked next to Desert Ridge for three years and I didn't know this gem was here.  But it's here, kind of hidden and definitely a gem in the desert.\n\nIt was one of those extremely rare Phoenix days when you're just craving soup.  It'd been raining all day and I had to have cream of something and now!  I know Zupas was close by by what I needed was a Sweet Tomatoes.  Imaging my surprise when Yelp told me (ever so politely) that there is one half a mile away (dummy).  \n\nThe building doesn't look like a Sweet Tomatoes, it looks like a really cool old galvanized steel barn. You walk in and walk into a two-sided salad bar with all of the fixings!  Grab a tray and dig into one or more of the pre-made (delicious) salads and\/or add to the goodness as you make your way down the line to the cashier.  Lunch was under $9, less than most burger or burritos places and this was all you can eat!\n\nAround six varieties of soup including cream of potato and cream of broccoli-so good!  Had a small plate of Mac & Cheese and a bowl of ice cream for dessert topped with caramel and tapioca pudding (don't judge me :)\n\nPlace was hopping at lunch and I was shocked at all the kids in the place, obviously a fan-favorite across multiple generations.  I know I'll be back and it'll be sooner rather than later.  Great service and atmosphere, well done ST!
