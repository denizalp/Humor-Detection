My girlfriend's leg is broke so we wanted to get away for my bday after staying locked in the house for 4 months (long overdue vacation). So we decided to get the panoramic suite for 3 nights and just hang out in the room the whole trip.\n\nThe Panoramic suite was gorgeous but we didn't love the fact that they gave us one on a lower floor next to the tram, so we put in a request for another room but higher up. They only had it available the next day and said it would be on floor 27 with a better view. So the next day we go down to the lobby to exchange rooms and they were having a little trouble so they told us to come back later in the day.\n\nWe return from our day out on the town and speak to someone at the front desk about switching our room. My girlfriend tells them it's my birthday and we would love the best view possible. The guy leaves and talks to his manager then comes back and tells us they are upgrading us to the hospitality suite for our last 2 nights!! \n\nWe finally go up to the room on the 46th floor and could not believe our eyes! It was a huge living room area with a full kitchen and island in the middle. 2 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. We called everyone we knew to catch a flight out to Vegas to come share this room with us but we didn't have any luck. \n\nAnyways the rooms here are beautiful, clean and modern. The customer service is beyond amazing and the staff is definitely some of the best Vegas has to offer. There isn't a casino (smoke free) in Vdara but Cosmopolitan and Aria are just a few steps away (my girl has a knee scooter for her broken ankle so if she can roll across the way on her knee scooter, you shouldn't have a problem walking there lol. \n\nOOOOO\n5 out of 5 Afros
