Came to try Truth of Osaka High after a hiatus from escape rooms, and this didn't disappoint. The atmosphere is scary from the get-go and didn't stop until the end. Mayze is innovative with their puzzles - you will find no lockboxes here. More impressive is the size of the rooms - more than once I expected the story to end but it kept going. The puzzles are fairly linear but are challenging to even experienced escapers.  \n\nThe only thing that makes me feel inadequate is that the rooms are not especially 'Japanese' even though the story supposedly takes place in Osaka. This should have been replaced with any other location but making anything Japanese probably makes the whole theme more scary. Regardless, it's a room that's well done. \n\nAs always, there's a discount from checking in and liking their page on Facebook.
