Although this coffee shop is in an outdoor mall with minimal parking close by, it is worth walking a short distance to enjoy this spot. Maybe you'll get lucky and find a parking space right outside but expect a short walk.\n\nInside the ambience is laid-back hipster. Or maybe work meets casual with a hint of allure. There are two large blue coffee roasters that dominate one side of the coffeehouse. The walls are well covered with interesting artwork.\n\nThe coffee is flavorful and the taste of my latte is one of coffee beans then milk so one can experience the rich smooth elixir as it glides down your throat.\n\nPeople watching here is a pastime you could easily engage in as there are people coming and going all the time.
