Oy, Postino's. I wanted to smite you, because you took Kat's Deli away from me. I wanted to spit on you. I wanted to thumb my chin at you. I wanted to rattle my bobbles in your general direction. But, tonight, you made a lover of me in you. For shame, you bad bad boy. \n\nI met up with three other people tonight for a casual dinner; I brought the light rail because I imbibed in an absinthe gin martini at home while starting a cross word puzzle. \n\nWhen I arrived, I was greeted by my diner companions and a row of bruschetta. Both were lovely, but the latter were more filling. Since my late arrival, I'm not certain exactly what was ordered: there was one with bacon, one with tomatoes, one with goat cheese, one with prosciutto, among other. I macked them down double time, they were that good. But, I rather filled me up, so I wasn't able to finish my roast beef panini. Oh well, lunch for the following day isn't such a bad thing. All the food was wonderfully delicious. \n\nPostino also has a pleasant wine list and some great beers on tap (I had the Kronenbough 1664). \n\nAs for the washrooms, I liked them. The sliding door made me feel butch, like I was tough enough to drag a large piece of frosted glass across the floor. Loved that they stamped their toilet paper with their name and the logos, but wouldn't want to be the first to wipe with that portion. \n\nI understand the neighbors in the Medlock District have issues with the street parking. Hey, I totally understand your concerns. But, having a jewel like Postino in your 'hood makes up for the inconvenience of losing your street parking. \n\nBeing a reasonable walk from the light rail, I see this as a place I'll likely frequent.
