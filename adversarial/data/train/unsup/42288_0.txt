By far the best dinner we have had in Las Vegas. The service is personable and you feel like a guest in someone's home!  Ongoing service is nonstop. Water, bread, whatever you need or want is there quickly!  Our service was as friendly as could be and his understanding of food and preparation added to the experience. I very strongly recommend this restaurant!
