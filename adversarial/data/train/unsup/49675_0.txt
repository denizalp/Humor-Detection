Wonderful food that comes out piping hot; caesar salads that are the best of any other restaurants; service exceptional; cozy atmosphere; more food that you can eat so that means leftovers!  Consistent food as well as consistently good service.  Nice bar and outside patio for those who like that.  Would highly recommend that, if you haven't been here, you should try Barbarino's.
