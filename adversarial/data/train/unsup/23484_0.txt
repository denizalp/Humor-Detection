Bouchon is such a treat! And it's one of the more affordable restaurants with a well known chef. You must go here!\n\n5 stars - Salmon rillette with toasted crostini. This was one of the best salmon dishes I have had. You take the flavorful salmon spread and eat it with the crostini. Then you get the crunch of the crostini and the creamy texture of the rillette. It's served in a jar, and it comes fully packed with the salmon mixture. They do not skimp here! \n\n5 stars - Watercress and endive salad with walnuts, apple, roquefort blue cheese, and walnut dressing. This was so fresh and simple with just the right amount of dressing, so it didn't cover up the natural flavor of the endive and watercress. \n\n5 stars - House bread is worth a mention here. It is crunchy in the outside and chewy on the inside. A great baguette!\n\n5 stars - French onion soup is prepared classically. It has a cheese covering that is just the right amount to go with the flavorful broth. \n\n2 stars - Service was such a disappointment here. Our waiter did not treat us like guests at all. We were looking for a light dinner, and after learning we were there to order soup, salad, and an appetizer, he questioned us about not ordering entrees. Then on, he did not treat us with any kindness. It was as if we were a hassle for him. The busboys and servers were much nicer. \n\nFor this type of restaurant, I expect the service to match the level of food, but that was not the case here with the service severely lacking. Maybe next time, we'll get more lucky with a better waiter. That's right, kudos to the chefs because the food is worth returning for.
