This was bad...really bad.  My friend told me she got free tickets to this when she was in NY and it was bad then.  I told her I was going to hope they hired new acrobats.....  I've seen O and Ka and both of those I was impressed by the acrobats and the creativity of the set and costumes.  Zarkana I would say is the reject of the cirque shows.  There was this one moment where an acrobat fell off the tight rope, and he spent what seemed like an eternity motioning with his hands for them to lower a ladder. It took quite some time to get the ladder down.  It was just this awkward moment where it's very clear this is not part of the show and there's nothing we can do until they lower the ladder.  If this was a TV show I would have changed the channel.  Thinking we happened to catch them on an off day, I found out from other friends that this is a reoccurring mistake in the show.  We also witnessed some other acrobatic mistakes during the show as well.  If this is an analogy....this cirque show is like the D league for the NBA compared to its counterparts...they just couldn't make the cut for the big time! Save your time and money and go elsewhere, even discounted tickets aren't worth it.
