Poke Poke Poke! What about Gumby, huh?\nSeriously it's a cool place with friendly people.\nA great variety of Poke that even Hawaii can't match, but in the long run the Poke in Hawaii is a bit better, but that is because of it's geographical advantage. I must have some Hawaiian roots because these Poke items really twangs my buds!\nThe Saimin and grill side is OK too. We did try some Saimin and Udon and for the money it's a great deal. The noodles are decent, but will have to admit the broth is kind of watery and bland (at least the day we had it). No worries we did put some additional soy sauce and a few drops of sirachi and it sparked things right up. The deserts are good too. Weeknights they close at 6pm so you gotta rush in dare Brudha! Aloha, Mahola and Aloha!
