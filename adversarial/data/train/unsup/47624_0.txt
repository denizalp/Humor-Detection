I went for a formal event a few weeks ago. I spoke to the staff beforehand about my severe milk allergy and they seemed to completely understand; however, three bites into my plain spaghetti with marinara sauce, I started to have an anaphylactic reaction. I ended up leaving and going to the hospital, having a near-death experience and spending the night in the hospital. The restaurant never compensated me for my experience and refused to acknowledge that there was milk in my food. Don't go here if you have dietary restrictions.
