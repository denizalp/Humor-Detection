I don't recall ever getting a prescription filled on time by this pharmacy. Every time you call, it's a different a excuse. This place seems to care very little that their many mistakes have an impact on their customers' health. They're always ready to make some other entity the scapegoat for their inefficiency, whether it be the manufacturer, the shipping company, or whomever else.I would recommend using any other pharmacy if possible.
