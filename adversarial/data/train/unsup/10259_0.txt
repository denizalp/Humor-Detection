Came here after a nearby house warming so yes we were pretty fuelled and in a jolly mood around 12am. \n\nThe place is really new and has the kind of table layout where your back to back with the table right behind. \n\nSapporo beer on tap! That was totally awesome along with the samurai sword style beer tap which a bit later on I half expected the manager to pull out and chop some heads. We also order a cool looking bottle of sake, black and gold for $50.\n\nWhile watching Korean boy bands consisting of so many members, who are so pretty that if I saw them in the fifth I would think they were chicks and buy them a drink (before 12am), we continue with our chit chat and general merriment.\n\nMy only problem was when the manager lady came and asked us all to quieten down as other customers were explaining. WHAT!!!\n\nIts 1am there is already kpop playing in the background and the chatter of a full bar yet people come here for quiet conversation!\nIs that not like going to muzik and asking the manager to tell the prep school group to stop dancing because it hurts your eyes?\n\nDid we listen...no of course not and sure enough after I had a short stab at the complaining group they got up and left....1-0 to fun people.\n\nI would like to come back here again because the beer is so awesome and I love pissing off people who deserve to be pissed off.
