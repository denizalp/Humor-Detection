I wanted to give this hotel a higher rating I really did but there were a couple of really big downsides for me that hurt it.\nFirst the positives....\nLocation : If you're in Downtown Toronto and visiting the Air Canada Centre, Rogers Centre, Hockey Hall of Fame etc you can't beat this location, we walked to Air Canada in less than 8 minutes and there are lots of things to do around this area. \n\nCost : Our room ( Twin room ) cost about $190CAD for one night which I would consider in Toronto which is one of the worlds major cities in a convenient area to be good value.\n\nWi-Fi: Nowadays ( especially if you have a US phone and don't want to get killed in data roaming charges ) I would consider any hotel that doesn't offer free Wi-Fi to be a failure and doing their guest a disservice, I don't care if you build it into the price of the room but I don't want to get nickel and dimed with extras like Internet, the connection at Hotel Victoria was very good and all we needed was our login and it didn't cost any extra.\n\nNow the negatives...\n\nParking : Nothing on-site, but really for this area I noticed thats most hotels, we found a parking garage literally around the corner where parked for a day and a half for about $30CAD, so factor that into your cost.\n\nRoom Size : This is a small, old school boutique hotel and as such the rooms are REALLY small, we had two Twin Beds which I think is the first time i've seen that in a hotel in quite some time, also the bathroom is quite small and when you turn on the light the shadow of the person in the bathroom is clear to see through the glass in the door for anyone else in the room, great if you're a couple, not so great if you're staying with a buddy if you know what I mean. Also we got into our room and our TV wasn't working, if i wasn't technically proficient and figured out how to get the signal from the cable box to the TV then I wouldn't have been able to watch TV in the room, as when I turned it on all I had was static, something that the person prepping the room should have checked. Inexcusable lack of detail.\n\nElevator : There is only one elevator in the building, so if its busy and you have alot of people staying then you could be waiting quite some time to get back to your floor unless you want to take the stairs.\n\n\nSo there you go, weigh up the pros and cons for your visit, if it were me I may look into one of the other options in the area, but if you're not sharing a room with your hairy buddy then maybe it might be a good option.
