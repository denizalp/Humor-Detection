I just got home from Vegas. During my vacation, I stayed at the Flamingo with a friend. We got a great deal for the renovated \"Go\" rooms and stayed 5 nights. My share of the room cost $303 with taxes! As we only needed a bed and a bathroom, this was a steal, considering it's centrally located on the Strip. \n\nThere are only three words to describe the Flamingo and they are \"fabulously tacky\" and \"pink.\" In this day and age where the surrounding properties are trying to woo you with luxurious amenities, the Flamingo likes to kick it old school. Upon entering the hotel, your nose is attacked with the scent of suntan oil--an overwhelmingly sickeningly cloying fake coconut scent. It was like there was a stoner party and they tried to cover up the pot smell and bought 1000 coconut-scented candles from the Dollar Store. However, we counted our blessings, as we walked through Excalibur the other night and walked right back out because it stank of stale cigarettes from the past 10 years with a hint of raw sewage (I shit you not--pun intended).\n\nThe \"Go\" rooms are supposed to be the Flamingo's version of luxury, which is not saying much--that's like saying their standard rooms are Kraft Singles and the \"Go\" rooms are Kraft Deluxe--however, that extra serving of American cheese was oh-so-worth-it. The beds were comfortable, there were soft fluffy pillows, and there was a nice view of the pool (we were on the 21st floor). The hotel tried to get us to upgrade to a Strip for an extra $15\/night. Fuck that, man! You want a view of the Strip? Step outside! There was a refrigerator in our room, oddly enough. Water pressure in the shower was good, and there are also these two ghetto knobs that sprayed sideways. I watched a couple of eps of \"Law & Order\" in the bathroom, but otherwise, they don't have many good channels. The bathtub is bigger than your standard size. The amenities are Gilcrist & Soames' shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner.\n\nWe also liked that we could walk to any of the other resorts. While we didn't take full advantage of the monorail, the fact that you can get to MGM in 10 minutes (versus 40 minutes by walking) is a time saver, even if it costs $5 one-way. Internet costs $13.99 for 24 hours and we did make use of it several times. Unfortunately we couldn't add more than one laptop. You can charge it to the room or to a credit card of your choice.\n\nReasons Why This is a 3-Star Property and Not a 4-Star \n(AKA, I work for a 4-Star hotel and am being nitpicky)\n-- Thin walls. I was woken up every day at 6:30am by guests. Once I was woken up by the sounds of sexin'. If you want soundproof rooms, stay at Caesars. For what it's worth, I wore earplugs.\n-- Not replacing your light bulbs does not make you eco-friendly. I counted in my room, 7 bulbs that were out on the ceiling over the beds, 2 on the desk, 1 lamp that I couldn't turn on, and 2 out in the bathroom. Good thing we only slept here.\n-- Housekeeping missed the sticky residue on the nightstands. There was a cigarette stain on one of the bedsheets.\n-- Long check-in and understaffed front desk. Dude, if you are wearing a suit, don't roll up your jacket sleeves to show off your hairy arms. Gross!\n-- In-room dining carts left in the hallways for hours\n-- Someone stole the \"V\" from the Elevators sign on our floor.\n-- OS failure in the TV in the elevators\n-- Donny and Marie bobble heads are for sale in the gift shop. Donny's five-head plastered everywhere... the effect is slightly disturbing.\n-- Offering an iPod dock as a \"Go\" room feature and letting you play your music on the DVD player but charging $20 if you lose the power cord. There was no power cord available and when I tried to use my own, I saw that the place to plug the USB was bent at an angle and therefore useless.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay here. We found it to be delightfully tacky. We would probably stay here again if the price was right. We did think about staying at MGM Grand since we ate at many of the restaurants there, but after seeing that the douchebag ratio was rather high at MGM Grand, we were secretly glad that the Flamingo is mostly douchebag free (however there is plenty of old people, especially cougars).
