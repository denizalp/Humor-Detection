Came here for a late dinner one night after we came back from touring the Grand Canyon. I really like the decoration of the venue, really reminded me of Malibu. There's a certain fusion feeling to the dishes they offered and a very cali-vibe. I had the mussles and my friend had the Chinese salad. We both really like our entrees. Portions were huge--but that's because the dishes are also pricey. I wished my mussles didn't come with the frieds--it was pretty heavy. Otherwise, the taste was great. Great great service!
