My stomach was crying out for food in the middle of a night, and Chop and Wok was there for me.  This tiny restaurant not just opens late, they also have delivery service!  WOO!\n\nI ordered Shrimp with Mushroom on the phone and soon after I got a call from the front desk to pick up my food.  Super fast service!  it might be because they are only down the street from Fairfield Inn.\n\nAs I  was happily ripping that brown bag opened, my room started to smell like a Chinese restaurant but I could care less.  My first few bites were filed with joy mostly because I was too hungry to notice all the grease in my Shrimp and Mushroom.  I stopped and proceed with caution as I dig through my food to find excessive amount of (hopefully vegetable) oil at the bottom of my food container.  It scared\/convinced me enough to toss the leftovers.  \n\nI understand that Chinese food is normally greasy but it was a bit too greasy.  Besides the greasy complaint, the food tasted OK and the service was fast!  Chop and Wok earns a 2-star rating in my book.
