Finally went to the Sugar Factory to eat lunch instead of just buying the candy. We had a 20 minute wait before being seated which was good so we could go the store part of the restaurant and look around. The restaurant is pretty big and it was busy because it was Memorial weekend. \n\nWe ordered the Mac and cheese bites which were excellent and served on little toothpicks. Cute. We had a steak sandwich and a tuna sandwich which were decent. The best part of the meal was obviously dessert. We had a chocolate pizza was sort of a let down and we had  a sundae. The sundae was my favorite. I haven't had one in years. Overall the food was pretty good and the service was alright. (Our server was really busy!)
