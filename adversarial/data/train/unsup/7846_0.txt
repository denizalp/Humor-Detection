Hand-pulled noodles...enough said!\n\nNo, seriously...they are the star of Beijing Noodle Cafe and it would be a crime if you didn't order them.\n\nMy trusty Yelp app reminded me I was in the neighborhood and not only did we recently read about this restaurant in the local paper, but Paul Y. was raving about place to the Husband.  \n\nAs soon as I checked in, I realized fellow yelper Andy T. was just here and he quickly sent us a message telling us what we had to order!  \n\nLocated in a strip mall, this hole in the wall mom and pop restaurant is quaint and simply decorated with pictures of the menu items and hanging red lanterns.  Of course, the very clean fish tank is something you can't miss when you walk in.\n\nWe were given a lunch menu - on one side featured lunch specials, but the other side was where the specialty noodles were offered.  We shared:\n\n* Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup ($6.95) - Hand pulled noodles in a very light aromatic broth with wood ear mushrooms and sliced beef.  It was very flavorful and we were quite impressed.\n\n* Szechuan Eggplant with Noodles ($6.95) - Hand pulled noodles with a stir-fry of eggplant, tomatoes and garlic sitting on top.  Again, very good and quite rich.  \n\nAlthough both dishes had the same noodles, they were showcased quite differently in broth versus sauce.  Once you eat a freshly made noodle, it's hard to want anything else.\n\nWhile we waited for our order, we inquired about when the demonstration for noodle pulling takes place.  The waiter told us that the chef was out, but usually during the evenings.  The chef came in a few minutes later and he started making our noodles.  It was quite impressive and definitely entertaining.  At that point, the female owner explained more about the different sizes of noodles offered (small, medium or large - although she recommends medium), and that they the hand cut noodles into water as well.  (If you've seen Bizarre Foods, you know what I'm talking about here!)  She also mentioned their appetizer dumplings as being made to order.  We initially thought they weren't offered at lunch because it wasn't on the lunch menu we were given and per another yelper's review.  On the contrary, it IS available!  Sweet!  So we added:\n\n* Pork Wonton in Red Chili Sauce ($4.95) - Twelve little handmade morsels sitting in a deadly chili oil sauce.  They were fresh and light, and not your average wonton.\n\n* Pork and Chives Potstickers ($4.95) - They came in a set of six that were pan fried and just filled to the brim with pork and chives.  It also came with a dipping sauce, and you can really tell the freshness of this potsticker.  They told us it takes 8 minutes for them to make it, but I think it took less.\n\nWe're loving Beijing Noodle Cafe and we think you will too!  Be sure to ask the friendly lady owner for suggestions because she is more than helpful and willing to please.  You'll find out taking out-of-towners here for sure!
