Stopped in here for lunch today. I have only had Jimmy John's 1 time before at the Central Phoenix Location and a year ago, and was not really blown away by their style of Subs. Today I didn't quite few like my usual Sub stop for my work lunch break down the street, so I thought I'd give Jimmy's another try. Again I found I would only give the sub sandwich a moderate score, but it was the service and the manager (at least he seemed in charge) going the extra mile after one of their (newer I'm guessing) employees made a mistake on cleaning the windows. When the employee went to the clean the door and windows, he sprayed the Windex like crazy and the fan totally blew it all over my table. Before I could even react to the situation, the manger was correcting the employee for the bad cleaning technique decision and immediately offered to make me a new sandwich even though I only had about a 1\/4 left. In less than a minute I had my new sub, which I will actually have for breakfast in the morning. \n\nI understand that everyone makes mistakes and that often at fast food joints it is an employee's first job, so I usually expect the management to make right any of the blunders, without the customer having to raise a fuss. This Jimmy John's location has delivered that level of quality in customer service and I plan on returning. Also, after looking over the menu a bit more, I think maybe I will like the subs better if I add a few of the \"freebies\" to my sub next time.
