It's been awhile, but I happened to be in the area of Parsley over this past weekend and decided it would be a good place to grab my lunch on my way back home from shopping. \n\nI ran in while my husband sat in the car outside and found the place to be deserted. They had just open a few minutes prior, so I was concerned the meat wouldn't be completely ready - but it was. I ordered steak shwarma and opted for the wheat wrap. I got extra taziki sauce and red onion. I also got a slight sprinkling of feta cheese.\n\nWhen I got home and opened my wrap it looked good - but the taste was MEH. The shwarma was very over-done, almost burnt tasting and crispy. The lady had shaved off the meat for awhile (I wasn't sure what she was doing), but apparently whatever it was, it yielded some not-so-great steak shwarma. \n\nThis is not close to where I live so I doubt I'll be hustling to make a return visit.
