I can't give these guys a perfect score anymore, they stumble so badly for delivery and I've given them enough time to fix the problems, but they cant' seem to do it.\n\nThe pizza, while amazing, sometimes comes lukewarm because they take so long to deliver it.  The hot dogs many times come cold.  And last night particularly was the last straw, I was eating healthy and got the Chicken Souvlaki Pita, and the veggies were still crunchy and not cooked down.  Very difficult to eat when you have lots of almost raw onions!   I still think their Greek salad is one of the best in town, however.\n\nMy recommendation - go there and sit down, at least until they can improve on delivery.  Saying you can deliver in 30 - 40 minutes and then taking almost an hour and a half with cold, not properly cooked food is unacceptable!
