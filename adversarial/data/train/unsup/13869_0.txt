Why do I torture myself?\n\nEvery time I go here I always get sick (when I eat the sushi). EVERY TIME!  \n\nWHY IS THIS PLACE POPULAR?\nI have no idea why all my friends gravitate to this place. Is it b\/c it's downtown? probably. Does it have a large selection of korean\/japanese food? yes. Is the food pretty? yes. Is the food fresh? NO\n\nFOOD\nI always get sick at Ho Su and this time was no different.\n\nWhen my friends and I first got our appetizers, we picked up an edename bean and holy smokes, it stank like pure rotten food. We were all like \"wtf\".  I knew we should have left at that moment. \n\nWe gave it to the waitress and she was like, no it's fine. She then smelt it and then said she would take it to the front to ask them if it was alright.  She never came back.\n\nSo we ordered. I had the spider roll and the giant something role. gah I don't even want to remember.\n\nAnd then...yes...my stomach started feeling cramping up and I was getting dizzy.  I was not massively sick but sick w\/n 1\/2hr of eating my meal. \n\nMy dinner date got cut short and I stank up the bathroom. \n\nSick rating: 2\n1 (just a little sick) to  5 (Emergency, I think i have a parasite) \nI wasn't dying of pain but I did feel really sick.
