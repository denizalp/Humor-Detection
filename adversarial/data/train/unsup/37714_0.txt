I'm split between a 3 and 4 star for this place. \n\nFood - 4.5 stars!\nCost - 2 stars... \nAmbiance - 4 stars\nService - 3.5 stars\n\nThe clam chowder was delicious and the salmon wasn't my favorite but it was good. Lobster mashed potatoes was AWESOME. My friends and I literally put it in our mouth and had to savor it. We would pause in the middle of talking because it was pretty darn good. And the Nutella Creme Brulee.. it was DIVINE! (It tasted like melted Ferrero Rocher chocolates!) I definitely savored this dessert. \n\nThe service was quick and our cups were always full. For the most part, everything was good. Portions were good. We were thoroughly impressed. We thought for the $50 we got a good deal. \n\nUntil we got the bill. My friend and I had decided to split a \"side\" of Lobster mash. We both saw a RM Mashed Potato on the side which said $11. We were impressed by the size considering we thought our portions would be small. Boy were we shocked when we were told our mashed potato was $28! \n\nNow, this restaurant wasn't a normal place for us to dine at, but we also were aware that everything would be a bit more pricey. But honestly, $28 for mashed potato? If there were big chunks of lobsters, maybe we'd justify it a little better. But I'd have to compare the amount of lobsters with the amount of clams in a can of clam chowder soup! Really? When we looked at the menu again and we couldn't specifically find the \"LOBSTER\" mashed potato. We were told the RM mashed potato was plain mashed potato. We were beyond disbelief. We decided not to make a big deal about it but we were not happy to say the least. \n\nSo. 3 stars is most likely my final decision. The price of that mashed potato... :(
