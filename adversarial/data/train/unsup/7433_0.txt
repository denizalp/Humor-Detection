If there was only a 6th star, I would be all about giving Montauk Bar this high honour right now. \n\nThey've mixed me the craziest cocktails. They've named whiskey menus after Robyn's Call Your Girlfriend (I'm listening to it right now). They've seen me at my worst and still always treat me like I'm the best. They're all really strapping men.* I just can't find enough good words to say about this place, above all else they're creative, scrappy and good for the hood. I just asked the owner if I could bring a confetti cannon in tonight for a celebration,** and he obliged... like come on. Does it get any better?\n\nThis summer when you're finished at the hipster pool nearby, just come here for a drink. Don't go all the way back to Ossington or Parkdale. You want The shit, not the Same Ol' shit. \n\n*Seriously. Dustin. Do you require headshots with resumes? The ladies (and many boys) thank you. \n**Don't do this to a bar owner. It's mean.
