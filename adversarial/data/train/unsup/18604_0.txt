My company unfortunately booked us rooms here earlier this year since it's close to the convention center and ultra cheap (our rooms were 20 bucks a night plus the $11\/day \"resort fee\", though this is no resort)\n\nThe Riv is one of the oldest surviving casinos in Vegas, built in the 50's, and it shows. It's dirty, dingy, dark, and depressing. One of my co-workers was lucky enough to be upgraded to one of the \"new\" rooms after he complained about the bellman leaving his luggage in their \"holding area\", an oil-covered parking space in the deck. The newer renovated rooms are decent but they don't make up for the rest of the place. \n\nMy room was one of the old style, with a really tiny bathroom (more like a closet), worn out carpet, ancient furniture, pathetically thin threadbare sheets, and filthy curtains with holes in them. \n\nThose damn curtains didn't block out any of the bright lights flooding in from Circus Circus at night, so I ended up using all the pillows, the chair, the table, and anything I could get my hands on to squash them as tightly together as possible to even be able to sleep. I'm sure housekeeping thought I was crazy, but at least they left it alone for the duration of my stay. \n\nWifi is included in the resort fee, but is spotty and slow at best. And why is the safe under the nightstand, where you have to get down on the dirty carpet to use it?? At least the bed was semi-comfortable\n\nUnless you're forced to stay here, spend the extra few dollars to go somewhere else... this place is overdue for the wrecking ball
