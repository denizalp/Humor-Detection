About 2 years ago, my girlfriend and I used ABF to move what few belongings we had from CL OH to SD CA. Recently, and after expanding our family by one, we made the decision to move back from SD to CL. I was happy with ABF the first move and I'm even more happy with them for this second move. Their. Telephone agents are so accommodating, professional and friendly. I would recommend that anyone who is looking to relocate, use this service. They're great.
