Just got my car back after brake job and alignment.  Chris took care of me and I can't say enough about him!  He told me I needed 2 new tires and I told him Discount Tire would \npro-rate my 2 bad tires.  He personally took my 2 bad tires over to Discount and got the new ones and put them on!!!!  I have always found Wilhelm to be just great!  I offered to do the tire exchange myself but, he said no and did it himself!!!!  Just outstanding service!!!!!
