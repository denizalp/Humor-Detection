Overpriced, very mediocre Italian. Given the choices in town I would avoid this place. Not to mention the Mirage had a sick nauseating smell of cigarette smoke they tried to cover with a sweet smelling deodorant. It permeates the whole casino. I would vastly prefer the smell of cigarette smoke alone.
