Great experience here. Have you ever been to the doctor and wonder if he cared or even knew what he was talking about?\n\nWell, both of those issues are not apparent here. Dr. Carter and his little apprentice took great care of me. They were very busy, but nonetheless they made me feel like my little knee injury was important and needed their expertise. I was very impressed that they just took the X-Rays right there on site and reviewed them...right there on site. Very impressive and effective. By the way, Dr. Carter is the primary physician of the PHX Suns....so that should tell ya something. Any joint pain, go see these guys. Not one complaint here!\n\nI think the address listed here on Yelp is wrong. It's actually SOUTH of Baseline.
