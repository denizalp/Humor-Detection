I am a true Chicagoan and love thin crust pizza.  I had had sandwiches from Eatz's before and have always had no complaints.  Today I tried a large thin crust pizza and it was AWESOME!! Cut in squares and spot on! The gal that took my order was really nice, I ordered pick up this time.  Highly Recommend this small, off the beaten path gem!!!!
