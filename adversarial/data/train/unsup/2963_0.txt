This place has to be related to Egg Works because they are literally exactly the same. From the decor to the menu!\n\nIt's a Sunday morning so we came into it assuming we would be waiting at least 30+ minutes. Although it was packed we probably only waited between 15-20 minutes. For breakfast on a Sunday morning that's really not bad.\n\nWe got seated on the patio which is what we wanted at the time but honestly we froze to death. If you're eating breakfast before 11AM sit inside or wear like ten sweaters.\n\nWe both ordered omelettes. I had the mashed potato Omelette and my friend had the bacon and avocado omelette.\n\nHuge, huge portions! And very tasty! I had half of my omelette left over to take home!\n\nIt's a pricier place to eat breakfast you're probably looking at between 11-15 dollars for breakfast and OJ but it is very much worth it!
