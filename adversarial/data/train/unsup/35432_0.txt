The Wi-Fi is terrible at this location.  even when there is no one in it. So close to a college as big as ASU you would think they would upgrade it and add some plugs. Been coming here fur years and it's never gotten fixed.. please pass it on and get it fixed.  Thanks.. Also bathrooms are always dirty
