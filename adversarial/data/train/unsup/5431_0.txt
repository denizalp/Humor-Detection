Whoa! What a great event!\n\nThe Charlotte Food Fight is both a fund raiser and a Food Truck Competition. Anyone can come!\n\nEach year the trucks are given an ingredient to include in a dish- this year it was Cloister Honey. Regular menus are served but the sample size dishes with the special ingredients were only $3!! You\/we, the people, get to cast your vote.\n\nI tried samples from Tin Kitchen, JJ's Red Hots, King of Pops, New Wrap Order, Comfort Food on Wheels and Hart's Soda Shoppe. Just an amazing day! Of course Tin Kitchen nailed it with their Scallop dish! Fourth year in a row! But I fell in love with you Blackberry Chipotle Honey King of Pops - you burn so good!!\n\nLive band, great weather, cool Yelpers and D9!!! Excellent event!!!
