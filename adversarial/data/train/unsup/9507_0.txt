I tried three flavors & topped it off with mochi pieces:\n- gingerbread: some flavors are not meant to be introduced to fro yo. It's my fault for trying to be adventurous\/in the holiday spirit early\/fat ass, but i was hoping for a mild ginger cookie flavor (i heart ginger.) Instead, my mouth was assaulted by a fake, overly spiced taste.\n- cheesecake: way too mild. i may as well have been eating a vanilla flavor.\n- banana- this one was pretty good. i feel like freakin' Goldilocks-- one was too mild, one was not mild enough, but this one was JUST RIGHT.\n\np.s. i know they rotate flavors & that in general, that's a good thing, but I was so bummed when i didn't see the nutter butter (peanut butter) that made me fall in love with Yogurtland in the first place when I discovered them in Berkeley. \n\nEnd of bitchin' from the peanut gallery. Just because I didn't particularly love the flavors I tried in Vegas, doesn't mean I won't run up to the next Yogurtland I see, press my nose up against the glass & \"ooohhh & ahhh\" about the pretty flavors that will inevitably end up in my cup.
