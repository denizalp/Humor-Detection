My expectations were pretty high since I'm a big fan of Olive + Gourmando. Yes, this restaurant is the new outfit of Dyan Solomon and Eric Girard from O+G. And I was not disappointed.\n\nThe restaurant by itself is spectacular. The restaurant has a very welcoming and warm atmosphere, despite the industrial decor. But the superb wood fired oven is probably not a stranger to that.\n\nThe star of the restaurant is the food, which is mostly cooked on that wood fired oven. The chef is quite young but has an impressive resume. Her name is Leigh Roper, and she made her classes with David McMillan and Fred Morin at Joe Beef, Liverpool House and Vin Papillon, and interships at the well known Tartine Bakery and Caf√©, Chez Panisse et Chez Quince on the West Coast.\n\nAs our first course, we had the tiny grilled beets salad, which was perfect with the minty labneh, and the November coleslaw with spit-roasted duck. Absolutely divine.\n\nFor our main course, we had the scallops, which were perfectly cooked, and the grilled hanger steak. The steak size was generous and delicious and perfectly seasoned. No complaints there. The grelot potatoes cooked on the oven were tasty.\n\nReally, I do not have any complaints. It's pretty rare that I find a restaurant executing everything so perfectly, from food to service, from decor to drinks. If I had one negative thing to say, and its a very minor one, is that no bread was served with the meal. I love bread, and with O+G's expertise in bread, I was expecting some. But again, everything else was so perfect that it is a minor fault.\n\nI will definitely return, the sooner the better :D
