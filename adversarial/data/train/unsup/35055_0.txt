very cute cafe. all the waitresses and waiters seemed to really enjoy their job and were friendly from the start. a good variety of drinks and desserts at fair prices. but i wouldn't go there for dinner - 90% of the menu is desserts. i enjoyed the interactive concert performance. i would definitely go back again.
