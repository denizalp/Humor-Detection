This was a nice little spot for lunch. The decor is actually cute and the restaurant is very spacious on the inside -- much different than most of the very compact restaurants on Spring Mountain. Our server was a bit rigid at first, but with time became a lot more relaxed and very friendly and attentive. The lunch deal was great.. $5.99 for soup of the day which was delicious Tom Kha on that particular day and one of many entree options. I of course opted for Drunken Noodles with chicken. They were great! The chicken was cooked perfectly and not too dry which is my main contention with most Thai places when it comes to their chicken dishes. I opted for heat level 6 on a scale 1-10. It had the perfect amount of heat..and I like spicy. So be cautious..if you don't do spicy regularly go for a 4-5 tops. Otherwise, 6-7 are ideal. This was a perfect lunch and you really can't beat the price for the quality and quantity of food.
