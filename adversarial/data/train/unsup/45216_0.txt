My daughter told me about this place and I had to try it. When I drove up I was skeptical. Boy, was I surprised! The best place ever!! I had the chocolate sorbet and it was amazing! I will be a regular customer!! Try it! You will love it!!\nKid friendly and the staff is so nice. Feels like the way you would like to be treated, plus the ice cream is outstanding!! Way to go!!
