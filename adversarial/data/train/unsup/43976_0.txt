I love going to Asian markets, so I was thrilled to find a Korean market.  It was late in the evening when I stumbled upon this place after dinner.  They had a lot of products to offer, the problem is some of the aisles are too cramped.  But they did offer ready to eat items that kids love, like Gimbap and mini seafood pancake for that late night snack when in Vegas.  They also have a food court with a good selection of options to please everyone.  This place will be a frequent place to stop by when in Vegas.
