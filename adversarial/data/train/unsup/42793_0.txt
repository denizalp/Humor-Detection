So. Friggin. Good. One of the best foodie experiences in Pittsburgh and in my top 5 restaurants in town. I've been twice and made a point of trying lots of different things. The dishes are consistently interesting with complex flavors. Drinks are great and they even have my very favorite gin (Citadelle), which I've never seen in PA.
