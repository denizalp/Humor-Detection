Just bought a home in the neighbourhood and the pool was not maintained so I squandered in the neighbourhood store  and told them that I had no idea what I was doing. They were kind and advised me. Turned out with what I already had they didn't need me to buy anything else, well I will be coming here for all my pool supplies from now on. Its nice to have a kind and informed seller, thank you so much for your help. Will be returning soon!
