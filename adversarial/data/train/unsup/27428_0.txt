don't trust their techs. first of all his truck has his name on it so he probably subcontracts. apparently First american Home Warranty has a deal with their subs that they get paid a certain amount and have to pay for the parts out of that money. my dishwasher and microwave had issues that were obviously from wear and tear and he was all smiles writing broken on the work order and telling me no problem with the claim. what he told first american was totally different. he told them in his opinion that the appliances were not broken due to wear and tear. the spray arm fell off the spindle in the dishwasher and onto the heating element and melted. the door handle on the microwave was coming apart and you can see a gap between it and the door even in the picture. in looking at the pictures i don't see how any moron at first american can't see it's wear and tear but they take his word for it. other vendors told me about this. why does he do it, because he keeps 100% of the money, no cost for parts and he doesn't have to spend time coming back to actually fix it. first american inconveniences me for another service call for a second opinion while i fight with them and he walks away with all the money
