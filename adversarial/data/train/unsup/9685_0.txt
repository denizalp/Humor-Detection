God bless gulab jamun, those delicious sugary balls of honey flavoured goodness. When I asked the guy at Little India what the mysterious brown balls were called he said, \"Those? Those are the drugs.\" \n\nAnd man, he is correct!\n\nIn terms of the rest of the food, it's also really tasty and plentiful. The butter chicken is spicy but sweet like it should be, the mango lassies are fantastic and the price is right. I would give the restaurant four stars, but the gulab jamun! It bumps it up to a five.
