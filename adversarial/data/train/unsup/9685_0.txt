Came here with a group of 10 people and had a horrible New Year's Eve dinner experience.  Due to the restaurant's inability to communicate between their employees, we ended up getting seated over an hour late \nfrom our reservation (made 3 weeks prior to dinner) and had to rush out of the restaurant to make it for our NYE arrangements.  Worst of all, the hostess LIES TO US, right to our face!  Zero integrity from her part.\nAnd later when the manager came by after food was served, it was clear that he had no clue what was happening and how dissatisfied we were.\n\nFood was mediocre due to the experience, and what looms is the idea of what could be going in the background when employees realize they can lie to the customers to get out of a challenging spot, and then get by unnoticed from management.
