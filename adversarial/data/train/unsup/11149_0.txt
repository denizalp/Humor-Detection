I have a 2011 GMC Acadia that I brought in for service.  The service appointment did not go as expected so I'm sure you are wondering why I rated it a 5 star establishment.  I contacted the Service Director Tom and he listened to my issues and responded accordingly.  I have dealt with other dealerships and their response was questionable at best.  Tom took the time to understand what my issue was and offer a couple of viable solutions.  I will continue to take my car to this dealership.  Everybody makes mistake, that's a part of life.  It the integrity that you show in recovering from that mistake, that I truly appreciate!
