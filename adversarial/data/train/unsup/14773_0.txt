The day that we visited the restaurant we were greeted by a friendly hostess and she explained that the restaurant had a limited menu and if we were to order in hot foods that it would take a bit longer because it was being prepared in different restaurants kitchen. That was fine. I appreciated the honesty and heads up. She sat us and we waited...and waited....and waited...decided what we wanted....and waited again. No server came to greet us, no one to take our drink orders and mind you the restaurant was not very busy and there was about 4 servers on the floor along with a couple of server assistants. So while we sat for awhile and waited with our menus closed, FINALLY a lady wearing a nametag \"Asalia\" approaches our table and says \" what can I get for you\". No formal greeting, no mention of her name, she didn't even apologize for the wait. She took our drink and food order and walked away. She came back with our drinks. I had a soda and the third person in our party had an iced tea. She dropped the iced tea in front of me and the two of us both point out i didn't have the iced tea but she still plops down the soda in front of the wrong person and doesn't switch the drinks. Our food comes and she again puts the wrong plate in front the wrong person so we have to correct her, this time she changed it. Not even half way into our meal but when we are almost done, does she come to check on us. I needed more ketchup and soda. She asked the gentleman if he wanted more iced tea and our glasses were filled at the same height but failed to ask if I would like more soda. She was quick to clear our plates and drop the check. \n\nI ordered the Philly cheese steak and surprisingly it was very good. The meat was kind of interesting though, because it looked like big chucks of hamburger but again it was good. The french fries had an extra crispy texture which i enjoy!
