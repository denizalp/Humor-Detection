You'll be paying a lot of dough to eat at Canoe but at least they give you free bread.\n\nWe reserved a table requesting a window seat for a birthday. The host knew we were celebrating a birthday, the waiter gave us a free two bite dessert, and the host said happy birthday when we left. Our waiter was very friendly and encourages us to get up and take a view of the city.\n\nThe food was simply amazing. I remember biting down on a piece of bok choy and thinking \"how did they make this taste so good?!?!\"\n\nFinally, you're paying for the view which is second only to the CN Tower revolving restaurant. Canoe however offers a view of the CN T so you can't go wrong with either.\n\nWill come back when I make more money or if I win the lottery.
