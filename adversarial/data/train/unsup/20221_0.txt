I have been wanting to try Komex for a long time now and finally stopped in for lunch. I ordered the fusion nachos with the beef and my husband ordered the fusion chimichanga with the bulgogi beef. While we were waiting for our food to come out we were served a basket with chips, salsa, and guacamole.  The salsa was okay but I was impressed with the guacamole. It was a bit more chunky than what I make but had super good flavor!\n\nOnto the nachos and chimi, we were both pleasantly surprised how well the sweet garlicky beef married with the Mexican flavors of the nachos and they didn't skimp on the toppings.  I asked for hot sauce and our server brought out a caddy that had 4 different ones. By far our favorite was the chunky salsa that was spicy and sweet at the same time.  The true star of the show was the finely chopped bulgogi beef,so tender and delicious. \n\nWe will definitely come back!!!
