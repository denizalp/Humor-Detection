Went here for dinner on a Tuesday night after work. It is far from a fancy place and the the only decor I noticed was a multi-coloured disco lamp. However, there is a kitchen in the back that seems to be run by a nice vietnamese family that knows how to cook. This is a place to go to for a home-cooked vietnamese meal. We had the shrimp fresh spring rolls as an appetizer and the vermicelli with pork and a spring roll. Both were fresh and delicious. The restaurant looks like it seats about 20-30 people. On a Tuesday night, there were about 12 of us dining and multiple people coming in and out for takeout. Vietnamese food is not easy to find in the east end of the city. I would recommend this place for a low-key dinner for those craving vietnamese food without any frills.
