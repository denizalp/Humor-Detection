I ordered about $190 in party platters for a dinner party on 12\/3, picked up at Peoria location. I gave our credit card over the phone, as is required for catering orders. I used a credit card that we haven't used in over 60 days. Today we received a call from our bank that there have been 63 charges made on the card from all over the country, as well as outside the country.  These fraudulent charges occurred after using it at your establishment (again our only charge in over 60 days). It is apparent that someone working at Carolina's is selling charge card numbers.  I'm highly disappointed and will not be patronizing your restaurant again. I would warn anyone paying with a credit\/debit card at Carolina's.
