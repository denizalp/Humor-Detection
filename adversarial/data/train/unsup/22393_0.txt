Here in San Francisco... there's a known quantity in the bar & restaurant industry known as \"oh, that's a Bourdain spot.\" Meaning: watch the shit out for the hoards of people -- and when we mean people we mean the opposite of the regular clientele. Meaning: the original, authentic experience is slightly askew. It might not necessarily take away from a given spot, but things have changed. \n\nExample: Toronado in SF. Mainly surly old bastards that love their beer amongst a chill neighborhood crowd who enjoys drinking the best beer at 1230pm. Now, those wonderful mixed nuts with guys with parts and sweaters around their neck. Or people that take photos of the beer board before they order their beer or realize it's cash only. \n\nHaving said all of that rant... I was really worried my Ronnie's experience would not be what it was pre-Bourdain, as it was featured on his Layover: Tarana episode. However... I think I hit the right timing as I was there just about six weeks after airtime so the travel plans haven't been arranged yet... also maybe Bourdain's Layover isn't as big as his original series. At any rate, this was a real cracker of a time. It's what I wanted, and there were plenty of seats -- especially in that back room of hodgepodge chairs with that crazy mural of a beast staring at me. \n\nPlus, a lovely surprise of ample outlets back there for phone life saving. \n\n\"What's your cheapest beer, Ronnie?\" \n\n\"Well, six bucks. They're all six bucks.\" \n\nDelerium Tremens it is, young man. \n\nThis is one charming place if you're into dimly lit, mildly dive-y, leave you be bars that might be playing incredibly loud TV on the Radio. I'd imagine that even without Bourdain the patio out front in the warmer months is packed. I'll take the back room then. Give me a round, a four top with three others, and we'll come to new conclusions about ourselves, like... we fucking adore coat racks at bars.\n\nPOST HOLY FELICIA HUXTIBLE SCRIPTUS: I just read in a three year old review from Kat F that you, Ronnie, held a Cosby night!? Where sweaters adorned earned treats or you had them at the ready for people!? With Jell-O Shots. WHAT! Ronnie, I'm returning in exactly a month from today, and I'll be returning in Cosby garb.
