Everyone who works there is so nice!!  The service is great, and they don't care if you hang out there for hours and drink only one cup of coffee.  I had problems with wireless at home and worked there for several days. Plenty of places to sit and plug in your laptop.  Free WiFi.  They really appreciate your business and do everything possible to make certain you're satisfied with your order.  Great place to meet friends - it's comfortable - impeccably clean - and you feel welcomed.
