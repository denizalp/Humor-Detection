Literally one of the best burritos I've ever tried. If not, it might actually be the best....the fries supreme look like something out of a fairy tail. Hot sauce is decently hot. Very consistent. \n\nOrdering system could be cleaned up. The proper system should be. Order, pay, receive order number. Sometimes they forget to ask for payment all together.\n\nOther than that best burrito in town.
