Easley's really is the best you can get in town. I have been to a number of shops, and you are wasting a ton of time at those places....really you are\n\n~What to Do~\nAnytime year round you can stroll in here looking for any combination of costume-wear...like wigs, accessories, actual costumes and rentals. \n\n~The Good~\nThis place is designed to be a one-stop shop, and believe me when I say they are just that. Plus its local, how can you beat a well-run local retailer? They have everything. I mean...everything. I went as Brick this year for H-Ween, and Great Odens Raven, they had a trident! The hair product to change my hair black worked like a charm, and in previous years each time i needed a small item, they had exactly what I needed. Its a treasure trove of awesomeness peeps. DO NOT go to a cookie-cutter shop when you can find the costume you are looking for, and in many cases numerous versions of said costume.\n\n~The Bad~\nBecause its so popular, things rarely run out...but it will happen, this place is popular. So being popular, you have to come during non-peak times of the year to get what you want....just come prepared and early for H-Ween!! The parking lot is small, so that's another negative come H-Ween time. The staff are running everywhere during peak season, so do not expect amazing availability of reps. They also at times can be a bit short...Its not ultra-alarming, I'll gauge this as I continue to shop here. I'll update if it becomes a continuous issue. \n\n~The Down Low~\nThis is the best shop in town, so no need to explain their rating, they get 5 stars across the board. No costume shop in the valley is year round and stocked as full as Easley's. Come down for virtually anything and they'll have it...bank on it.
