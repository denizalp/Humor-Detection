A co-worker of mine once described it as a big, blue phallic symbol rising from the desert so now I cannot drive past it without chuckling internally each time I see it! I use it as a navigation point when I am in the area especially at night since I am not a local and not that familiar with the area. \n\nI happen to like this landmark if for no other reason than it provides some colorful contrast to the otherwise uniform appearance of the area. It is nothing more than an artful, tall spire that is aqua in the daytime but lit up deeply blue at night. I have been told that the city of Scottsdale has some pretty heavy external business appearance codes and frowns on things such as colorful signage, buildings that aren't uniform, and things that don't blend in well with the brownish desert landscape. So every strip mall and industrial office complex in the area looks very similar and boring. This spire helps to break that image up for sure!
