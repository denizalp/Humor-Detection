Upon walking in the door i was taken over by such a wonderful pork smell... I can only hope its still lingering on my coat (for the enjoyment of others) I had never had a Porchetta before, so I opted for the plate, instead of the sandwich. I wanted to make sure i tasted this thing the way it was made! The porchetta was incredible. Perfectly seasoned, and flavourful. I didn't use any of the mustard they gave me. Some of the pieces were a little fatty - which i LOVE... But the lady wasn't so into. The only complaint I can possibly come up with is that i was left wanting more. Maybe they should offer a small\/large plate option?
