I've tried Golden Egg Roll twice. Once for delivery and once in the restaurant. BLECH! Both times. Actually ICK the first time, MEH slash ICK the second time. The delivery is quick and efficient. I ordered the House Fried Rice and a veggie egg fu young. I was grossed out by the shrimp in the fried rice. I could SMELL my shrimp before it even entered my mouth. Sounds normal right? No it was FUNKY shrimp that was slightly slimy. Blech. My Fu Young was unremarkable after you got past the saltiness of the dish. \nMonths later, I was asked by a coworker to have lunch. I let her pick the place... I will never make that mistake again. She picked Golden Egg Roll. The restaurant itself is nice and clean from what I saw. I chose the orange chicken. Again with the salt! I was baffled and I asked the other ladies I was with if they were having the same issue. Yes, they were! Well that summed it up for me. \nI probably won't visit Golden Egg Roll again. What a bummer, they have all this swag from a service (they probably paid for) naming them one of the top Chinese restaurants in the area. I'm uninterested in giving this joint another shot, unfortunately. There are too many other places to try.
