Very disappointed.  I got the an acai bowl called the Super Bowl. I have had acai bowls in California and I am obsessed with how delicious and filling they are. The one I got her at the Raw Bar was just OK. The size was extremely small compared to what I have had in California for the same price. The container it came in was literally a side dish topped with one sliced strawberry, half a kiwi, and a sprinkle of granola for $8.50! I would say that this was a ripoff.
