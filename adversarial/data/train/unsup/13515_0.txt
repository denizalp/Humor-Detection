I was a tad bit anxious about finding a barber that caters to African Americans in small but fun Madison. I conducted some due diligence and discovered this place that's about 4 miles away from the capitol. \n\nI happened to schedule a hair cut during the unfortunate tragedy that befell Ghana during the world cup quaterfinals, but it was all good. These guys gave me such a clean cut that I was impressed. It's staffed by 2 African Americans and a Latino who all seem to be adept at what they do, so I highly recommend the place. I'm not giving it 5 stars because I found them to be a little pricey. I was charged 15 bucks for a haircut, and when I offered the bloke my card, he asks me how much I'd like to put on it, as though he's expecting some fragging tip. \n\nI understand that sort of bollocks when I'm in downtown Chicago or fragging manhattan, NY, but in Madison, WI you don;t charge me 15 bucks for a hair cut and expect a tip. I let it slide because they'd done such a good job on my hair. Good ambience and overall experience. Be sure to schedule an appointment before you visit. Cheers mates!
