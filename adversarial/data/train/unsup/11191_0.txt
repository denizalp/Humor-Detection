You threw my sandwich away... my sandwich.... MY SANDWICH! \n\nToday, we went to Shorty's Sandwich Shop for lunch, and it was very good. I've had many sandwiches from all over the valley and the folks at Shorty's are doing up sandwiches right.\n\nShorty's offers great lunch specials.  You can get a sandwich and your choice of potato salad, macaroni salad, chips, cookie and drink for under 10 bucks.  Today, my lunch companion and I had the turkey, roast beef,  and provolone  with a side of potato salad and chips.  The sandwiches are large, fresh, and the potato salad is some of the best I ever had. \n\nAll the breads at Shorty's are made daily. If your in the area give Shorty's a try.  Expect great sandwiches, salads, soups, desserts, and the best customer service.
