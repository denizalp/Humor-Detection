I got one of their frequent flyer instructor belt several years ago which was a great fit. Pay attention to the video how to determine the correct size. They know what they are talking about.  After much daily use the hook\/loop material became frayed and didn't cinch up as well anymore. Checking the website to buy another and found they have a recondition program to replace the material. Cheap if you carefully cut off the hook\/loop yourself but they will do it for cost. Mailed it in and returned about 1 week. Looks almost brand new or it is a new belt. Yaaa!!
