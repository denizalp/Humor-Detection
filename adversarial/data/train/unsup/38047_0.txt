Waited so long for a Cheesecake Factory to open in Canada! And only to be disappointed after our first visit. Waited almost 3 hours for a table. Fine. Because we were told 2.5 hours wait. Then our food took 45 mins to arrive, because they left our order. No apologies. Then we finally got to order our cheesecakes. Another 20 mins. Got our cheesecakes and asked for the bill and got our bill. Another 15 mins for the machine to arrive. We ended up in Yorkdale for just over 5 hours. Remember not to park your car in the underground lots when you eat here, cause it's only free parking for the first 5 hours.
