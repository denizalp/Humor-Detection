Best Italian restaurant in Henderson HANDS DOWN! The entire staff is super friendly and accommodating. The food is just to die for!! We feel like part of the family every time we dine at this place! The chef comes to check in EVERY TIME to make sure things are up to par. Only one complaint, PLEASE BRING BACK THE MOTHERS DAY CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH CAPPUCCINO GELATO. Oh my goodness, that was the best chocolate cake I've ever had. \n\nSeriously, you have to stop in and get some authentic Italian food. This is the real deal!!
