Dr. Steinbrunner needs to take a patient\/ doctor communication class. Be honest, explain treatment, results, possible risks and outcome.  After 4 weeks from the 1st root canal on 1 tooth, I now have  an \"nasty\", (assistants words), infection they are trying to get rid of, last week I was told to take penicillin \"just in case\".  How do you know a week later that I have a bad infection?  After telling the dentist I was frustrated he stated, \"I can give you another antibiotic if you want?\"  I said \"I 'm not the dentist, last week you told me to take penicillin just in case?\" then he said \"well, I'll send you to an oral surgeon and he'll pull it out right now!\"  That was the end of our relationship.
