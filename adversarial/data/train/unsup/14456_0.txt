My 1st \"one star\" review is awarded to this place! Much deserving I may add. Customer service is HORRIBLE... I literally had to use the step ladder to get the product I wanted. Nobody asked me if I needed help the WHOLE time I was there either, as if a dreadlock wearing 6 foot 1 inch buff black guy is hard to miss in an Asian owned establishment! I ended up spending $22 in this place for shampoo and conditioner, along with 3 prong clips. I returned the next day to exchange the shampoo\/conditioner due to it not being the exact kind my lady needed. It was never used or opened and I had the receipt as well. They told me I couldn't exchange the items because it was a liquid! WTF? So instead of being the angry black guy I told them I was going to Yelp their businesses. I doubt they cared or even knew what yelp is. LMAO
