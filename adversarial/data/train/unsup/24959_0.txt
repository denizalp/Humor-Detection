I can't lie. Somebody would have to pay me to set foot into Circus Circus again. Ewwweeee it's nasty and old and depressing and kinda gross. The whole place for one night probably added several years to my body age. Here is what I liked: the west tower room was better than expected (but dirty, yes) and the kids enjoyed the free circus acts in Midway. Here's what I didn't like: gross carpet, smells, unhappy staff, pedophile looking guests all over the place, and well, everything. I am gagging just thinking about Circus Circus. In the words of my 4 year old it was \"kinda creepy.\"
