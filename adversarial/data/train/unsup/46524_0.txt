Eggslut is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino. I really love the name and was thrilled to give it a whirl. The line was relatively short on Thursday at noon-ish. The service was \"okay\" however I was happy to get to specialize my sandwich with no meat and added arugula. The orders were prepared correctly and we didn't have to wait long. My lunch date thought the presentation could have been better, but it was a casual to-go type eatery so I was fine with the seemingly, eco-friendly containers and wrappers. The reason for the three stars is because the brioche bun was dry (stale?) and it really impacted the sandwich in a big way. A fresh, soft bun makes a BIG difference! I would try this place again, but if I got another stale bun, I'd probably ask for a redo (even though I hate to be \"that gal\/guy\").
