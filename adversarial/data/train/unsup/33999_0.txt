I was a member here for 2-3 years. I found the space too cramped for comfort. Too many machines combined with not enough space to move around. \n\nThe gym does well because of it's location in the middle of Case\/UH but in terms of the gym experience there are better options. I have since joined the CrossFit CLE gym downtown and I LOVE it.
