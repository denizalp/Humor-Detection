Lucky number 200. \n\nCame here with some friends and was excited by the concept. I really wish they served food, but this place is pretty bad ass. I think that would be a great addition. Such a fun environment. Plenty of video games to choose from. Many coin operated games as well as more modern games you can play at the bar. Great selection (if only they had Bomberman, sigh).\n\nThe bartenders are quite friendly and helpful and I was very pleased with the drink options. I got the Blinky, while my fella got the Pac-Man. Yum.  I wish the drinks they were slightly less pricy and had a little more kick (if you know what I mean ;).\n\nOld School meets New School games. FUN! Next time, we'll aim to get a booth all to ourselves, hehe. \n\nIt's definitely a nice addition to Fremont Street. This place is awesome, minus some unfortunate thumb blisters, but I guess that just comes with the territory. Not sure I'll be back regularly, but it's a nice concept.
