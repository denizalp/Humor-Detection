Giving this review even tho I havent had any major surgery - yet.  I have been here twice for consultations...trying to work up my nerve to get the surgery.  I have been seeing Dr Mathys who specializes in the more difficult eye correction surgeries.  \n\nEvery time I go everyone is so sweet.  Staff members jump in to help when others are running behind.\n\nThe location is very easy to get to and there is a huge parking lot so you never have to worry about parking.  \n\nThe waiting area is HUGE and cozy.  They have never had me wait more than a few minutes before taking me back.\n\nThey put you through a dozen or so painless tests and tell you what surgery you would do well with. \n\nThe costs are very high but from what I hear - these guys are the best.  They have financing if you can't afford the lump sum payment.  Everyone is very nice and will help you every step of the way.\n\nSo hopefully I will work up the nerve to get the surgery soon....I am a scaredy-cat when it comes to these type of things.  But I think the reward is well worth it.  Thanks guys!
