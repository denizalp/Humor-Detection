Dont believe the hype! Uncle Sals is very average.  I love good Italian food.  I only gave it 3 stars because I couldn't give 2.5 stars.  The Cesar salads had to be 80 degrees and lacked any real spice, 2 croutons.  My Wifes veal Marsala was tough, the sauce was lacking, the green beans were mush. My veal parameasan was good but it had an inch of sauce on top, the alfredo was ok.  I dislike meat on top of pasta or potatoes  because when you cut it you crush it into the pasta  The wine list was good, the teramasu was good. For $240 for four people it wasnt worth it, subtract $78 for wine it was still high.   Overall the restaurant was average not at Marcellinos five star rating by any means.
