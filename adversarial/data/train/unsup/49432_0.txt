I had my very first donair from Jimmy's about 2 weeks ago when I was in Calgary visiting my cousin. \nI had an amazing experience. The staff are very friendly, and the food was amazing! \nI got the beef donair with garlic sauce. DELICIOUS. I got a small. It looked like it was bordering on a large. I also got a Jamaican meat patty. My first ever Jamaican meat patty, and it was delicious as well. Cousin and I each had a baklava. The baklava was a perfect dessert. \n\nOne word sums up Jimmy's: DELICIOUS.
