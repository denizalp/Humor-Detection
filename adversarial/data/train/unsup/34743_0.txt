At least my boyfriend likes his shish kebab plate, despite not being given some of the veggies or pita it's supposed to come with. My chicken pita trio was sad. My pita had no flavor in it what's so ever, not to mention fell apart soggy from the water off the lettuce, it wasn't even closed at the bottom. I asked for half potatoes and half salad (they had 6 salad choices that looked decent) and was handed flavorless\/textureless potatoes and a \"salad\" of the plain julienned lettuce they use for wraps, and when I say plain I mean with zero on it, not even a sauce\/dressing. Seriously? I ordered from this place once off Just Eat and thought the awful order was a fluke, I was proved wrong.
