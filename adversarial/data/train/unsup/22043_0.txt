After reading all of these reviews I'm highly disappointed in what people call good food. This food was beyond below average. I ordered shrimp Kung pao and 8 winglets. \n\nThe shrimp Kung pao was upsetting because I only received about 3 shrimp. Then to add insult to injury the food was just nasty. I have ordered this dish from DC to ohio to Atlanta to San Antonio to Houston. And this was the worst one ever. \n\nThe wings were so small I thought I would die from still being hungry. \n\nThis place was a big let down. You all need to reevaluate what you consider good food.
