This restaurant is AMAZING. The food is bomb af and the portions are huge. It kind of gives me that Kinton Ramen vibe cause of the decor, but it's a little hot inside - they had a small fan and the windows opened but it didn't do much tbh. \n\nMy friends and I ordered the Carbonara Cheese Katsu and the Spicy Garlic Chicken Katsu. The Carbonara one was sooooooo goooooood. It was creamy with shrimps and bits of calamari. I also asked them to make it a little spicier by adding more chili flakes in it. The spicy garlic sauce was also really good, but it was a little overpowering. The fried garlic chips gave it a good crunch. Perhaps they can have the option of ordering a smaller portion and lowering the price instead of paying $18 for a huge dish that a typical Asian girl can't finish all on her own haha. \n\nOverall, it's a small and cute lil restaurant with amazing food and great service. The waiter even brought us takoyaki as an appetizer and said it was on the house! I will definitely come back again :)
