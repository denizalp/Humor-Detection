I had an extremely horrible experience here my first day moving to Vegas. An older gentleman reached down behind me and into my pants and pretended like he didn't know what was going on. When we called the manager, he tried grabbing her chest. Again, this was my very first day in Vegas. It took me awhile to get over what happened since I was so shaken up- I absolutely hated Vegas for a long time and thought things like \"This would never happen at the SSF Costco\". In any case, the manager did her best, but I was so traumatized at the moment. I wish I had called the cops or done something more. We learned later that the man's wife eventually came and Costco management had talked to her about what happened. It took me a long time to be comfortable eating here again and when I do, I'm super vigilant about it. \n\nPeople here get kind of weird in general. I've left my food at a table for a minute to get soda, and multiple times I've seen people already eyeing it wondering if they should take it. The staff here is efficient, they try to clean up messes as soon as possible, and things are mostly stocked. Food quality is better than other Costcos.  It's really the patrons that make things difficult and unruly. It would probably be better if the food court had a separate entrance and was separate from the store so it doesn't feel like all hell is breaking loose.
