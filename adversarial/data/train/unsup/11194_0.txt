This was my first time dining at a filipino restaurant.  Surprising considering my gf is filipino, and I'm an honourary one.  I came here with my gf and 3 of her relatives.  \n\nPositives:\nFood quality - I really enjoyed the food.  The lumpia shanghai rolls were delicious, as always, no matter where I go.  The fried chicken is what they specialize in, and is a mandatory order, also good.  I also had a vegetarian dish which I thought was really good, even though I don't usually eat vegetables.  \n\nInterior - Better than most other asian restaurants.  This place is new, and so the decor reflects that.  It is a comfortable place, despite the slow service and wait to get a table.  \n\nLocation - Decent.  I'm not from the area, so I can't really comment.  But its on a main road, and not out of the way.\n\nNegatives:\nService - the servers had a good attitude, but they are highly understaffed.  The enitre meal took us about 2.5 hours to complete, from the time we walked in, to the time we left.  When we first got there, it was rammed.  They told us it would take about an hour before we got seated, and they were right.  After we finally got our table, it took a while for our watier to take our order.  And even longer for our food to get delivered to our table.  It's not the waiters fault, he has so many table to look after.  \n\nAll in all, I would recommend this place, but be prepared to wait to be seated, and to wait for your food to arrive, and well.. really just be prepared to WAIT.
