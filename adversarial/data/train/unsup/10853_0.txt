Still one of my favorite bars in Downtown Phoenix! Ross serves up great drinks and their food menu is definitely exciting and is best described as a fusion of Asian flavors with an innovative touch.\n\nI came here with a couple of gals for a GNO (girls night out) and started with yummy cocktails and some small plates to share. I decided to go with something a little different instead of my go-to Whiskey or Rum and went with a Gin-based cocktail, the Singapore Sling. For food we shared the Smash Chips and \"Yum Yum\" Noodles with Chicken & for dessert \"Campfire\" Marshmallows.\n\nThe Singapore Sling comes in a tall glass, filled with ice and topped with cute garnish. Lovely, refreshing and light. Tropical and fruity, plus with Gin you know it's going to make you feel nice and relaxed, which was exactly what I was going for.\n\nI've had the Smashed Chips and \"Yum Yum\" Noodles before and feel that both are strong in Asian and Spanish flavor. The Sambal chili type of flavor and the Salsa Verde, Avocado & Crema work well in this dish. Very interesting. This is definitely one to share as it is very filling! Hello carbs!\n\nThe \"Yum Yum\" Noodles use egg noodles and reminds me of a Mi Goreng meets Pad Thai, pretty good but something I feel you could order at any other Asian restaurant. \n\nThe only let down was the \"Campfire\" Marshmallows. Don't get me wrong the presentation was lovely. It was presented with squared marshmallows on pretzel sticks in a wood holder and served with a side of chocolate. The marshmallows were very airy, didn't have much flavor and the \"roasted\" parts seemed soggy like they were pre-made as they were room temp. The pretzels seemed a bit stale, no crunch to them and the chocolate which I was expecting to be a rich, decadent Ghiradelli or high quality chocolate was runny and tasted just like Hershey's syrup. Boo! Do not order this dessert as it was not worth the price.\n\nBesides the dessert here, everything I've had thus far has always been amazing. The service is always spot on and fast. Great spot to hang out with friends and the menu is always eclectic and changing.
