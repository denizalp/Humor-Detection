It's Bdubs - what more can you expect? This location is fairly large, but despite the obvious availability of tables I'm usually waiting for an employee to amble over and get us seated. Luckily, there's a parking lot out back so you're not worried about your meter running out.\n\nThe cool thing about this Buffalo though, is that it's home to the Sporcle trivia nights on Wednesday evenings. No charge at all to play, just go to the Game Master (sitting with his mic and laptop next to the bar), pick up the answer forms, pick a team name, and play. The game play is a little different from traditional trivia nights I've been to, but it makes it more interesting wagering points on your answers based on how confident you are. \n\nSince you're inevitably going to be waiting, you can ask your waiters for the handheld trivia game device which lets you play against other people nearby. A good way to pass the time and learn random facts. Or train for Trivia Crack I suppose. The other obvious choice is to open your mind to the hyper-stimulation provided by virtually every sports channel you could desire (in the US at least) arranged in collage-like fashion on the walls. Come to think of it, I don't even really know what color their walls are because my eyes never make it past the monitors and I've only gone at night.\n\nTuesday (or Thursday?) nights are $0.50 wing nights, which is a good deal if you're a fan of their wings. Unfortunately, I've always felt like I was taking a gamble whenever I get their wings since some of the flavors that sound appealing are either way too saucy or just plain yucky, and others (that I wouldn't order myself but sample from friends) turn out to be decent. I'm actually more of a fan of their appetizers, which turn out to be surprisingly filling as well. \n\nThe bathrooms are similarly hit or miss. Sometimes there's only one toilet that has been spared a messy fate and there's no more soap, and other times I emerge feeling refreshed and  clean.
