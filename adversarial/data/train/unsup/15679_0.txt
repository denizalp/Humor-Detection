I've been a customer of Cox Cable for probably 20 years. Always paid my bill, even when they would arbitrarily raise my rates without notice. Finally the bills got too high ($140\/month) and I switched off the cable as I really couldn't justify paying that much, and I really should be outside talking to actual people instead of on the Northwestern with Captain Sig Hansen. \nI put my cable box back in the box it came in, and affixed the shipping label in the spot deemed proper by step 2 of the Cox instruction page and took it to the post office.....about 2 months ago.\nLast week, as if to penalize me for turning off cable, Cox slapped me with a $180 bill for not returning my cable box. Per one Cox employee; \"Yeah, that was an old shipping label and sometimes the older labels get lost, dontyaknow\" They are currently \"looking\" for it. But unless they miraculously find it in the pocket of a jacket they haven't worn in awhile, I'm stuck with the $180 penalty. \nAt this point I really wish I'd just kept the silly little box...I could wear it as a hat..or tie it to my foot as a snowshoe..or give it to the hobo down the street and tell him it plays VHS tapes.\n20 years Cox...at an average of $80 a month, that's $19,200...and you just had to grab that last little bit on the way out. I hope your dog farts in your open mouth every night while you sleep.\n\nDave.
