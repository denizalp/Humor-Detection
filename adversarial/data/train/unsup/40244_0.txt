I've been going here my entire pregnancy and the staff is awesome. Dr. Mary Deka is a total sweetheart and makes sure you're happy and comfortable. She cares about her patients and is very knowledgeable as are the nurse practitioners I've had to see when Deka is out delivering a baby. The office is really nice and quiet. \nThe only thing is the wait can be a little bit overboard sometimes. I've waited up to an hour to see my doctor. Not so great when you have other things to do afterwards or somewhere to be.
