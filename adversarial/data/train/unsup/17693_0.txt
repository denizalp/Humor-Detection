When the Better Half and I are in the Palazzo, Double Helix is a must stop for us.  We love how the bar is in the middle of the shopping mall in the Palazzo.....it's perfect for people watching, which is one of our favorite pastimes.  We'll saddle up to the bar or relax in the center of the lounge area.  Either way, it's a nice break from the action.\n\nThe prices for Wine in the Wine shop is pretty reasonable too and I heard they deliver to your hotel room.....much cheaper than room service and better quality Wine!\n\nReturn Factor - 88%
