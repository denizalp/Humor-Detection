I'm from Hawaii and have had my share of Hawaiian fusion, Asian fusion, Pan Pacific, Pacific Rim, whatchamacallit cuisine.  Roy's makes me happy... the food is excellent and service with warm aloha spirit brings me back to my hometown, Hawaii.  The fish there is so fresh (melt in your mouth fresh) and the food light and delicious.  A must try for sure!
