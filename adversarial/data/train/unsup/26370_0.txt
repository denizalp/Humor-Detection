I've been going to this place for a year now almost everyday right after I work out. Lately their customer service has been lacking. New employees are easily overwhelmed with big orders especially the bowls and the smoothies. I recently went in and bought a 16oz shake with protein which is $1.50 extra (I think?) and I watched the the guy put all the ingredients for a shake into the blender but leave out the protein and then I finally asked if he had added protein in there he immediately apologized and stopped blending to add the protein. This incident happened and I forgot all about it until I went in on Friday and bought my shake and another juice making my total $24.23 and I handed the clerk $40.23 (making my change $16) He proceeds to hand me a dollar and I had to remind him that I gave him $40 and he actually told me I handed him $25 (which still doesn't make my change $1) Anyway he figures out his error and then doesn't know how much change to give back. He actually asks me him to help him with the math. I helped him I told him he owed me $16 he doesn't believe me and pulls up a calculator anyway and finally gives me my change back. Right before this whole thing happened he rang me up too quickly before I could give him my phone number for my loyalty points (10th juice free) he takes down my phone number and tells me he'll text his boss to get me my points. I was a little annoyed by the whole transaction. I just feel like if I'm going to spend that much money on a shake and a bottle of juice the employees can at least know how to do their job. I understand people can be demanding and being new doesn't help in this case I think the owner needs to spend more time training and addressing issues.
