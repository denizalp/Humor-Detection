Great value. Food is primarily Korean, but sizeable portions and good price. Very down to earth, don't expect white glove treatment since this place caters to the working class. My brother and I ordered 2 entrees, the meal could have easily fed 3 people. Tasty too.\n\nThey have long tables connected together, so I could see this place being good for groups.
