I was in Vegas for work last week, and for the last night there I brought a coworker with me, we'll call him Mr. K, and explained that this might be the best beer bar he has ever been to.  I know.  I know.  That's a lot of build up.\n\nThe receipt said Wendy and Jeff, and if that's accurate, both of them took excellent care of us.  They are funny, friendly, and knowledgeable about beer.  I love them.  OK.  I don't LOVE them love them. I'm not a complete weirdo.\n\nI was the DD so had to select my one drink very carefully.  I believe it was a New Belgium\/Lost Abbey collaboration, Brett Beer.    I think this is supposed to be a sour ale, but it's not very sour.  I was calling it a farmhouse ale, but I don't think that's right.  I enjoyed it.  \n\nI don't remember exactly what Mr. K had.  I do know that one of his beers was aged in Wild Turkey barrels and he liked that a lot.\n\nNormally I am in awe of the beer, which is expected, but the food that night.  The food was amazing.  So simple yet so good.  I had the grilled cheese with cheddar, slices of apple, and bacon.  Need I say more?  Yes I do.  I also had the Arrogant Bastard onion rings, and when I forced one upon Mr. K, he said that was the best onion ring he has had in his life.  Yeah.  It's that good.\n\nHe ordered a pizza with I think shrooms and sausage and possibly pepperoni.  I forget, but I swiped a piece and it was very good.  The crust is not too thick, not too thin, just perfect.  Delicious with the beer.\n\nNow I remember why my memory is so bad.  We were carbo overloading.  I've been thinking about the beer bites since the last time I was here and we started with those.  Just as good as I remember and I was happy to share since I knew we weren't done yet.\n\nI love this place.  And I mean really love it.
