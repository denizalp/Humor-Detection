Our bartender Mimi is the *BEST*!!! Superb customer service and always had a smile or joke for us. The happy hour menu is very reasonable - plates and drinks are basically half off of what you would pay at dinner time - although only 2 cocktails on the happy hour menu (a mojito and a caipirinha). We had the crispy yellowtail taquitos, the lamb chops, the salt and pepper calamari (just ok), and the truffle fries.\n\nThanks for a great experience, Mimi!
