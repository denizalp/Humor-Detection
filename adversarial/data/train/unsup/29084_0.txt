Been to this Famoso three times the past month and a half. Each time my wife and I have been impressed with the entire operation...from the polite, courteous and upbeat staff to the delicious food, great atmosphere, this has become our go to place.\n\nWe would totally recommend it and caters to all ages. It is a perfect spot for a date or an outing with the family.
