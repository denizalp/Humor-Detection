This place is not in the best neighborhood, but the people are harmless. A few friends and I rode our bikes downtown for some drinks and we stopped here on the way home. We were actually trying to go to the Mexican food truck that is usually parked nearby, but it was pulling away as we rode up to it. So we rode our bikes back up to Tacos Mexico. Sure there were some weirdos lingering around this place, but nothing too crazy. \n\nGreat place to grab some tacos or etc on your way home. We weren't the only ones grabbing food, there seem to be quite a few with the same idea. I got my usual carne asada tacos and they were really good. Soft corn tortillas are my favorite way to have tacos. I love that they are open 24 hrs. Staff is pretty friendly.\n\nPro Tip: The salsa stand has really small 1 oz. portion cups , but you can ask for bigger ones behind the counter.
