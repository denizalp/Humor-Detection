A few of my customers & a few people I work with rant about how good this place is.  I guess a lot of them grew up on this place in cali. To be honest the food wasn't good. The chili didn't have a taste at all and I'd rather of got chili out of a can from a store and put i on my burger and fries. Sitting there with my girlfriend l, as we both ate we looked at each other and pretty much both said Wiener schnitzel had better chili. I'm giving it a 3 only because the service was good and place was clean but it would of got a 2 star if the service was also bad.
