Dairy Queen and their blizzards are obviously amazing, but this review is going to go much deeper than this. This review is going to talk about their blizzard ice cream cakes. Yes you read that right. Blizzard ice cream cakes! For my husband's recent birthday, I opted for his annual ice cream birthday cake but this year, we live in a different area which means the Baskin Robbins ice cream cake wasn't going to cut it. I had heard about the Dairy Queen ice cream cakes, so I decided to give it a try. Blizzard cakes take 48 hours prep time because they are made to order, but I promise you it is worth the weight! I ordered the peanut butter cup blizzard cake. The verdict? My husband was thrilled and so was I! The cake was the perfect combination of ice cream, blizzard mixture, peanut butter cups and fudge cake. If you need a cake for a special occasion, remember that Dairy Queen offers much more than just drive through frozen treats. They also sell delicious cakes!
