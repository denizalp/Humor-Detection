I was craving Pad Thai for lunch the other day, and this was one of the first things that popped up on Yelp. Although we just missed lunch time with the $8.95 version, I ended up getting the dinner portion of chicken Pad Thai ($11.95).\n\nFirst, this place is crazy fast. We were in and out in 40 minutes, which is really good in Oakland for sit down. Unfortunately, the food was only OK. The other reviewers are not over exaggerating on the spice levels being non-existent. I ordered my food at a 4, and there was 0 spice. My lips did not even tingle. Pad Thai is fairly bland so this was a big let down.\n\nService was very polite and obviously fast. If you need a quick lunch in Oakland, this is an OK option.
