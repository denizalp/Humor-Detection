I prob would have loved this experience but let me just say that the promoter was really stupid. We had a big group, 10 guys and 9 girls. We were on the glist and just because we had one guy more than what we initially told them (9x9) and since one of the guy wasn't on the glist, they were going to make all the guys paid. When in fact, the promoter said it was okay if we had one more guy. But the people who works at the front of line didn't agree. All the men who works there are all assholes as well. Literally, they are so rude! They wouldn't even let us wait for our promoter to give them the yes so we just left. Too strict! But again, they could of made money off of us. We didn't lose anything, if we had known they were gona be a bitch about one person, we would have gone to Hakkasan or Marquee instead. All them bouncers need to know if they keep up with their rude ass, they gona lose customers and soon lose their jobs. We can make your paycheck from 1k to 0 real quick. \n\nAnd not to mention, I did take off my heels as we walked out since my feet got blisters. Had bitchy securities following me to tell me to put on my heels. Like what? Was I going to get kicked out? Cus I was already heading my way out, no fcuks given. Anywho, thanks XS for ruining the night because we had an extra person. I get it, it's Vegas and yall are strict but damn, we just tryna have a good time. Especially that it was the birthday boy and birthday girl's night. We'll know not to return.\n\nDrai's Nightclub did us better!
