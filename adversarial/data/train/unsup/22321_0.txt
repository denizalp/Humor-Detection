Great pizza, great service. Pizza was really good although just a tad disappointed with some burnt pepperoni and edges. \n\nSome like it, but most preferred it wasn't. Still very flavorful. Garlic Knots were tasty and you can't go wrong with \" Free\"  when you check in on Yelp. :)\n\nStill Highly Recommend! Enjoy! :)
