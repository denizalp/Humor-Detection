This place is very extraordinary! They really go above and beyond to make your experience memorable in terms of receiving great customer service and awesome food. Not to mention the house drinks they offer. Thank you Tanya for really going above and beyond. \n\nHere's my salmon plate and after school special drink. Definitely a must try!\n\nI'll come back here if Phoenix!
