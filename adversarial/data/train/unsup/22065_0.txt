Great little cozy, kitschy breakfast place. \n\nI love the setup of self - service... I  get to monopolize the jams and hot sauces without judgement. \n\nWe ordered the cherry scone,  chocolate croissant,  raspberry scone,  the Works (toast, choice of meat - bacon, skillet potatoes, and two eggs), and chorizo scramble; comes with toast and potatoes. \n\nThe scones are what they are famous for and they exceed my expectations. Crumbly yet rich, flavorful goodness. They had easily a handful or more choices today. The croissant had a crusty exterior with a soft doughy interior with generous amount of milk chocolate. \n\nThe breakfast plates were also phenomenal. Crispy bacon and potatoes. Eggs cooked just how you like them and the salsa that came with the scramble was fresh,  almost straight from a garden fresh! \n\nAll that for $25 before tip.  Beware, checks and cash only.
