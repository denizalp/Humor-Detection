I just can't seem to get on the Cafe Rio bandwagon. Oh, I've tried and tried and tried. \nThere are some things I like about Cafe Rio: \n1) location. It is less than a 5 minute walk from my office. \n2) the staff are super friendly and super quick, even when the place is hopping \n3) it is one of the cleanest restaurants near UNLV. \n4) tres leches. Oddly enough, the tres leches here is actually pretty decent. Its not the best, but I've had a heck of a lot worse at places that serve better food. \nIf this is all it took to get me to love something, my wife would be worried. \n\nBut the things I don't like are the reasons I just can't believe in the CR dogma:\n1) The food is just bland. Granted, I am limited in my options since I don't eat meat, but the salsas and sauces just don't have much flavor. I am not expecting a spicy explosion of flavor, just something I can taste, but I can't get this here.\n2) Price. Just under $10 gets me a burrito and a soda. I can get the same at Chipotle for a almost $4 less, and they have better salsa. \n3) The feeling. After eating CR I feel like I was punched repeatedly in the stomach. Ok, its not that bad of feeling, but I just feel icky. I don't know why, but I don't get this same feeling from other burrito joints.
