Oh my god.. Thank you, yelpers. I've been looking for good Mexican food since moving here. One thing you should be advised about if coming here for the first time, do not order too much. I'm so used to small portions, I didn't realize. I had my boyfriend go and pick up some food. I got nachos and two beef hard tacos. I could barely finish the nachos that I found out was \"half size\". I saved the tacos that came with a large side of beans and cheese for lunch the next day. Really great food. Hope to come and eat inside next time.
