This is one of the most disgusting places I've ever eaten at and let me tell you... I've seen some sh-t.\n\nFirst of all the place is filthy and falling apart. it smells,the seats are dirty, the carpet was peeling off the floor and the walls were dirty and splattered with old food from 1998.\n\nwe ordered the spinach swiss omelette with three pancakes - the pancakes were inexplicably chewy and tough (frozen). the omelette looked like someone threw up in some eggs and had no distinguishable listed ingredients.\n\nThe french toast was something like 8 f-cking dollars for three chewy, MOLDY slices of toast and packaged butter from Chernobyl and some packaged sugar liquid called \"breakfast syrup\" in little containers.\n\nWe also got a side of \"perogies\" because why the hell not.\nI'm sure you can guess how great they were. again chewy flavorless frozen little nuggets of history microwaved to perfection !\n\nour \"food\" took a very long time to be microwaved and our server came by once to take our orders, again to give us our drinks, once more to give our food and then we had to release a search party to get the bill from her.\n When I brought up the french toast was moldy she asked the assistant manager to comp it but he couldn't as he was not in charge. Yes, thats right. the manager was not in charge and nobody could figure out how to take the french toast off our bill.\nWhich is a dilly of a pickle if god forbid a server punched in the wrong items for a table... they would have no chance but to pay for hundreds of dollars of mistakes since Golden Griddle is not responsible!\n\nWe got the bill, it was not our bill..  so after more waiting we finally got our bill and paid in full for one of the most disgraceful, disgusting meals of all time.\n\nand lastly, I had the unfortunate experience of using the bathrooms.\nThey were filthy, one stall was out of order and there was no toilet paper despite there being a signature in the slot saying the bathroom had been restocked and cleaned just one god damn hour before we got there.\nalso the graffiti inexplicably advertising a dildo shop was a nice touch to read while I reached at the empty toilet paper dispenser. \n\nI'm going to go ahead and assume all these great comments are complete fabrications and were paid for...\n I wasnt expecting some great experience going to this place.,.. but to be called GOLDEN GRIDDLE and not even make fresh pancakes or have real maple syrup at the table or have fresh fu-cking bread for the french toast... ihop has more authentic \"breakfast\" food than this pile of crap. No wonder why Golden Griddles are slowly all closing..
