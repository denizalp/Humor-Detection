Just had the Butter chicken schnitzel this time with rice and beans and it is to die for. Also picked up the cauliflower and potato pakoras and they too were amazing. Not greasy. Toasty and crispy in all the right places. The coleslaw dressing was interesting, I think it's based in yogurt. This place needs to open up more restaurant space so I can bring my friends, but I know that side of the business can be tough, while balancing high quality food with reasonable portions, and keeping it affordable. I'll just have to get catering one day to evangelize everybody I know. I'm so down to try everything else.
