I cannot say that I'm a fan because I can't eat most of the food here. Since most of their baked goods are shipped from somewhere else, I cannot bring myself to give them a higher rating than 3.\n\nMy mom likes to buy the ensaymada here, but it is made with margarine.\n\nI found out why!\n\nMargarine actually helps extend the shelf life of their product. Obviously it's found in cookies, crackers, and many \"manufactured\" packaged foods.\n\nThe employees were nice and sweet, though I did try their ube cake. It was edible, but I couldn't finish it since I'm on a diet.
