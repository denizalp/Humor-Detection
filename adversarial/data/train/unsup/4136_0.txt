I've gone MAD for Teriyaki madness!!!  This location is about 8 minutes from my house so it's nice to have a healthy option nearby.  I ordered the orange chicken with steamed rice.  I ask for the orange chicken to be done extra crispy which gives it a crispy texture yet still juicy on the inside.  The mac salad is a great side option to go with the meal, i only wish the side could be a bigger portion.  You get plenty of steamed rice in the bowl as well as chicken.  Great quick place to eat, especially if you call in your order ahead of time as they can get pretty busy being in the same shopping center as EOS fitness gym.  I will definitely be back again and again!
