Crave those crazy squares!! Not breakfast cereal, White Castle burgers! \nIf you didn't grow up with this chain, you don't get it. Yeah, the meat is a super-thin mystery but it's a nostalgia thing, there's nothing like the WC flavor. Summers in Ohio with my cousins would always end with a trip here. Back home in Texas, my dad would crave them and have to settle for the frozen-aisle version. \n\nFinally, Vegas got an outpost! The prices are jacked up for the Strip location but the taste is all 1994. It really is a trip to finally be able to taste real White Castle burgers again: hot, fresh, crusted in onion bits and topped with a single pickle. You gotta get them with cheese for the full effect. Add ketchup at your own risk!\n\nService is pretty organized: the kitchen is open and everyone is working hard, order numbers are both called out and posted on a screen. Somehow I got skipped, but they remade my order and tossed in dessert, too.
