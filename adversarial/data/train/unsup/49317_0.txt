This is our FAVORITE restaurant by far. The service & food are always perfect! We have a 4 yr old & have been coming since she was born. They ALWAYS cater to her. Our must-have is the fried zucchini. Sometimes we order 2 orders because it's THAT good. The sangrias are another must have-red & white. The pizzas are thin & the sauce is sweet- just the way we like it. The wings are huge & flavorful. I could seriously suggest everything on this menu. I love their specials. I had a walnut encrusted chicken breast with white wine cream sauce once that was out of this world. Just sad it's not a regular on the menu, but that's the fun part! You just never know what you'll get each time! If you're in the area, there isn't a better place to get a meal! I noticed some poor reviews & I'm shocked. We come at least once a month for the past 5 years & LOVE it. I won't go anywhere else in the Waterworks area & we live within 5 miles. The other places are way too pricey & greasy. This is real food & real service.!
