I would like to give Lazy Dog's a four-- for service, menu choices & the food itself, but--- yesterday we dined on the patio from 5-6:00 & there were 10 dogs sitting there during that period.  Two sets of barking dogs got in a tiff & that was broken up by owners.  The staff sets out plates for them & have more work to do since dogs are now allowed.\n\nBut, most of all, it begs the question:   who is more important, dogs or customers?  Because if it continues (we choose outside because of weather & noise factor inside) they may lose us as clientele, as well as our friends who don't believe dining with strangers' dogs is their favorite way to dine.\n\nVALERIE
