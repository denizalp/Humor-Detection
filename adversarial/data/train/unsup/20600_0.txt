This review is long overdue!\n\nI relocated to Las Vegas for a couple of months for a temp job, and didn't have time to get my hair cut and colored before I left Austin.  So I got on trusty ol' Yelp! and did a search for the hair product that I like, and lo and behold, Joni's profile came up.  She even had a discount deal available, which I purchased through Yelp!.  \n\nShe was able to fit me in right away, which was obviously very awesome and convenient.  I have had a lot of issues getting hairstylists to color my hair the way I want them to.  Either they go too dark, or my hair turns red.  There's just something about my hair that pulls red.  When I try to explain this, it seems they don't really listen.  I knew Joni was going to be awesome when the first thing she asked me was, \"So, do you know your formula?\"  YES!  Awesome.  And I told her exactly what it was, and guess what?  She listened!  When we got to talking and I told her a little more about my problem, about how my hair pulls red, she was very familiar with the issue.  In order to get my hair the soft brown with caramel highlights, you have to add a bit of Ash Green.  Most stylists for some reason just WILL NOT believe me.  But Joni is a pro.  Not only did she listen, but she said we could also add a little blue to tame the red, and since she really seemed like she knew what she was talking about, I let her... and guess what?  My hair came out better than it had in a really long time.  Joni is awesome.  She knows what she is talking about, and I'm kinda sad I don't live in Vegas because she would definitely be my regular hairstylist.  Hell, I may just fly out to Vegas every 2 months just to get my hair did. ;-)  She really is a color specialist.
