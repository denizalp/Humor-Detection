So. much. stuff.\n\nI really enjoyed my first visit here and, though I was overwhelmed, I felt like this place was the most organized shop of its kind that I've ever been to. It didn't feel dirty, cluttery or scary. Some things felt a little pricey for what they are, but it's vintage and I have no idea how things should be priced, I'm just cheap and have a love for vintage. \n\nThere were some moments when I felt like I had wandered a little far into grandma's storage closet and peeked into the wrong corner. In other words, the sheets and curtains are in some tiny cubby holes that feel like I could end up in a weird Narnia. \n\nI fell in love with pretty much all of the furniture and ridiculously wonderful kitchen decor and appliances. I have a serious thing for canisters with green and yellow flowers on them...or brown and green...or orange...you get the picture. (I already have a seriously stunning set that I can barely find uses for, and I want more. Sigh. Practicality keeps whispering in my ear not to keep buying things I don't have room for in my apartment). There were plenty of temptations here for me and luckily I had just spent some money on drinks and dinner, so I wasn't in the mood to spend more, or else my kitchen would have gotten an entirely unnecessary makeover.
