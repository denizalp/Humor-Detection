Very nice entry way, and my suite was nice  room 21_215 , the fast food court was unfortunatly better than the steak house food that ran 120.00 dollars, heard it was bank owned, the slots were very tight in my opinion. They were remodling ,painting. People kept stopping me while we were walking over and over asking me to sign up for stuff
