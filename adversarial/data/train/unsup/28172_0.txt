This location has never once got an order of mine wrong and it still impresses me. I just left this location and I had an amazing conversation with Janice. She came over and cleaned the table I was sitting at then we had a great 5 minute talk and it made my day. Great food and even better customer service. Thank you once again for setting the standard of quality.
