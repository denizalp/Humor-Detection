Move over Tevana. You now have competition. Located in the upper level of Ross Park Mall near American girl this store is very similar to Tevana. They serve you a couple of samples upon arrival. Take you inside for a tour. The sell loose teas, teapots, ice tea pots where you can instantly freeze your homebrewed tea.  They even sell a tumbler where you can mix your tea with wine for a difference taste to it.\n\nThe teas we sampled were very good.The prices however are just as expensive as Tevana. The more you buy the more you save. You can even buy teabags where you can put your loose tea to steep them in as well as a Breville teamaker. Many of these items I have seen elsewhere a lot cheaper.\n\nThey handed us a brochure so we could see the fall offerings. It doesn't list prices but there are asterisks showing showing you the different pricing levels. In addition they have a rewards program and yes there is an app you can download and link a credit card with it to pay for your tea.What we sampled was quite good but also quite pricey. Keep that in mind should you decide to purchase here. It will be interesting how two major tea chains will survive in this mall.
