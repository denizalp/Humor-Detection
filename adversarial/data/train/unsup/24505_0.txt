Beware of the grumpy workers that work there! This place is fun for sure! (Until someone ruins it for you) There are so many old pinball games, and old video games for different ages.\n\nOur kids are both 7 years old, so they're going to get excited about what their playing. The kids are playing and having fun, and the worker comes up to me and says, \"Excuse me, can you pls tell your kids to use their indoor voices while they play bc it's distracting the other players while they play.\" WTF?? Uhh, they are kids. What do you expect? They are having fun! And we are not the only one enjoying the arcade! How are just our 2 kids distracting everyone else when they're also enjoying their games too! SMH. \n\nFunny though bc we read other reviews and there are many other ppl not too long ago complaining about the same thing, being mean to kids and rude to visitors! He was standing around us making us uncomfortable so we just left. We were waiting for him to say something again, but he didn't. It took a lot for me to not say something back to him! We are never coming back! If you do visit, it might be a good idea to not bring younger children with you.
