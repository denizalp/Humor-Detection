Since I don't like to party too much this was a great way to see Nevada.  One of the highlights of my trip! \n\nWe had a good time.  The staff were great!  We had Jaime as our tour guide and he was extremely friendly and nice. He picked us up directly from the hotel and dropped us off.  We did the morning tour and had the entire day do the other Vegas things.  \n\nWe went to Red Rock Canyon. The cool thing the scooter is so low to the ground your passing by watching everything on group level.  It's cool driving through traffic, I felt safe and we were able to see so much! \n\n***  Make sure to bring sunglasses and watch the weather, it might be cold. **
