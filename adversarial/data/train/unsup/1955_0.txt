This place had good reviews but I was skeptical. After trying it all doubt has been wiped out. I was never a fan of burgers priest and found holy chuck to be slighty better but still very similar so I was expecting this place to be more or less the same.\n\nWhile they are all of similar ilk, I can honestly say that fresh burger for me had the most properly seasoned patty out of all of them. I actually enjoyed the flavor of the patty. Other than that, one is not much better than the other which makes me glad this place is in richmond hill.
