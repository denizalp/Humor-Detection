Spectacular Sicilian food from something that looks like a pizza joint from the outside. Wow! Prices are generally reasonable, but ask about the prices for the specials BEFORE you order to avoid surprises.\n\nIf you have a chance, call ahead an arrange for a tasting, which is a 4-7 course meal consisting of samples of different foods (pasta course, fish course, meat course, etc.) for somewhere around $50-$60 per person. \n\nThe food here comes as close to Italy and Sicily as anything I've had in the Pittsburgh area and the fact that you may need reservations on the week shows that I am not alone in this thought.
