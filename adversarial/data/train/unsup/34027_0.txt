Can I give these guys ZERO stars???  \n\nThey owe me twenty bucks!\n\nOn April 18, 2013, I unfortunately took a Yellow Cab from the Phoenix Airport to my hotel.  The driver RIPPED ME OFF!!!  \n\nFirst, he \"forgot\" to start the meter when we pulled away from the airport.  We were already well off of the airport property before he \"remembered\" to turn on the meter.  Seriously?  He's a professional cab driver!  How often does it slip his mind to activate the meter?  That's like a baseball player taking the field and forgetting his glove or a football player forgetting his helmet.  It's basic.\n\nThen he took me all around the mulberry bush before finally taking me to my hotel.  I asked him to take me directly to the Best Western Sundial at 7320 Camelback Road.  He took me on the 101 and I remember passing Indian School Road and then seeing it again.  \n\nWhy would we need to see Indian School Road TWO TIMES?  I'll tell you why:  the Yellow Cab driver was padding the fare!\n\nBy contrast, when it came time to return to airport, I called DISCOUNT CAB (totally awesome!!!)  and got an honest driver.  He took me from the exact same hotel to the exact same airport.  I remember being shocked at how much quicker the trip was and how much less it cost.  \n \nThe route with an HONEST driver was only about 8  1\/2 miles long and took less than 20 minutes.  The route to the hotel, with Yellow Cab's  dishonest driver was much longer in both time and distance.  The HONEST driver from Discount Cab started the meter immediately and charged me $22.95 for the base fee.  The crooked Yellow Cab driver \"forgot\" to start the meter and I believe it registered $33.83... and then he added a couple of dollars to make up for his \"mistake,\" for a base fee of $35.83.  So, even though I was going between the exact same two locations, there was a price difference of nearly $13!!!  \n \nSO BE WARNED:  horrible and dishonest taxi cabs run out of the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.  I am shocked that airport officials would grant such a lucrative contract to vendors who rip-off tourists.\n\nAnd, if I ever come to Phoenix again (and believe me, this has really left a bad taste in my mouth), I will never EVER give you guys one more dime of my money.  I will use a shuttle - any shuttle -- to ANYWHERE and then contact an honest taxi company to take me to my destination.  It sure won't be Yellow Cab.  Those guys are crooks!
