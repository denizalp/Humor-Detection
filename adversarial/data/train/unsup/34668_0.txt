This place is so average!!!! I don't understand. I guess it has good happy hour deals and a good location but the food is so unbelievably average, ESPECIALLY if you're looking for gluten free or dairy free options. The service also sucks. Do yourself a favour and go to una or blaze pizza. Both close in proximity and incredibly better choices than this poor excuse for a pizza place. The manager literally laughed and made a face after he asked how our food was and we told him the GF\/DF pizza option wasn't good. He said \"ooh yeah that wouldn't be good.... our GF\/DF dough is frozen and not very tasty.\" WHO SAYS THAT ABOUT THEY'RE OWN RESTAURANT
