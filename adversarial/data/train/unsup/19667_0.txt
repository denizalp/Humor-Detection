The lovely folks at Bakersfield treated our Supper Club group like royalty tonight. Supper Clubbers can get a little bossy, a little feisty, and apparently a little drunk (I'm looking at you, Sheena), and they dealt with our snark and sass with style. Brandon and Dreamy Matt were our servers; both were super friendly and attentive. We also had visits from GM Neil and Manager Joe Not Joel; it was clear that they all wanted to make sure we had a good experience, so thumbs up all around, gentlemen. Thank you for your patience with our obnoxious group; service was impeccable for a place that's only been open for a couple of weeks.\n\nMost of us opted for the Selecciones menu (essentially $15 for a more family-style sampling of apps, salad, and tacos...groups of six or more only) which was a great way to try a lot of the offerings. I think my favorite was the queso with the pickled jalapenos. The tacos were tasty although I actually think some of the fillings needed salt. I'm not a heavy salt user, so this surprised me, but it may be because the tortillas seemed on the bland side. That might sound like I didn't enjoy the food, but that's not the case. I liked the ingredients in the tacos, especially some of the more acidic\/pickled touches. The salad that we had was fabulous!\n\nThe margaritas here are great, too. By great I mean better than the Barrio margaritas that everyone raves about. By great I mean miles above your standard Mexican restaurant. By great I mean: potent enough that after two, one of your best friends starts trying to set you up with the waitstaff despite repeated vocal pleas for her not to, your rampant embarrassment, and his polite disinterest. Sorry, Dreamy Bourbon Matt. \n\nService was legit, food was tasty, margaritas were memorable, price was right. I would truly look forward to my next trip to Bakersfield if I weren't too mortified to ever show my face there again.
