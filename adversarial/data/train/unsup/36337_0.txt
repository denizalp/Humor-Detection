So our water heater wasn't working and I called the company that installed it 6 years ago and the guy answered,  but said he was driving and would pull over as soon as he could and call me back in like 5 minutes... needless to say an hour went by and no call.... so I decided to look on Yelp and I gave this company a try.\n\nthe gentleman who answered my call was polite, responsive, and took down all my information as well as the information on the water heater to see what was covered under the warranty for me. The next morning, he called me when he was fifteen to twenty minutes away... and showed up right on time, he was pleasant and professional. He went straight to work figured out the problem fixed it immediately gave me some good suggestions on what it may need in the future, but didn't try to push me to buy right away. I could tell he was honest about our equipment and everything  turned out to cost less than what I was expecting.\n\n I will definitely use them again it's refreshing to have an honest and reasonably priced company that I know I can call for future work.\n\nGreat job!
