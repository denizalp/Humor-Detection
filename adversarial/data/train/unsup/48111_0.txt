A group of us ate here by recommendation and it did not disappoint! We were going to attend a basketball game and this was in a fantastic location (right across the street!). We ordered several dishes and a few that stood out were the butcher's platter and the scallops! I felt like it was a bit overpriced but it was a very busy restaurant and I can see it is a very popular place to go. I recommend it to others who are looking for a good place to eat! (Great ambiance too!)
