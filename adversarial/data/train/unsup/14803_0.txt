Centrally located, so it's a wonderful place to grab brunch and get your day started on the strip, which is exactly what we did when I brought my parents here.  \n\nWe had a reservation for 10:30 and I was a bit annoyed because I told them my name and for some reason the hostess kept coming over and loudly insisting \"RICHARD?????\" in my face.  Lady, I told you 3x my name is not Richard, your screaming the name in my face is not going to change that fact.  \n\nDespite that, however, the service during our meal was very good.  Our server was Jose and he was very busy but quick and attentive.  We had coffee, a bellini and a mimosa and all were strong and delicious.  \n\nI had the steak frites, my dad had the mushroom omelette and my mom had a breakfast croissant sandwich, and we all split the fruit bowl.  \n\nEverything was quite good EXCEPT FOR MY STEAK FRITES.  It is double the price of the other breakfast entrees and the meat was tough and the fries were weird.  I spent most of my meal wishing I'd ordered something different.  \n\nThe decor and ambiance here are lovely and reminiscent of Thomas Keller's Bouchon.  I'll probably come back here for breakfast\/brunch next time I'm in Vegas but I'll definitely be skipping the steak frites.
