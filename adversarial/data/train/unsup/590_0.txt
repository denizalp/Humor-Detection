Ive been here few times and I cant believe I never wrote a review lol. \n\n\nFirst of all the ambiance is great!!! I also like the fact I dont really smell like Kbbq unlike other places because the vent is underneath. \n\nThe meat is fresh and theres a lot of selections. \n\nI wish they still offer seaweed salad and squid legs for appetizers :(\n\nOur server OZZY is AWESOME!!!! He is soooo nice and always check up on us. Ive never had a server that attentive at this place.
