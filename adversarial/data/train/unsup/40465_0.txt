Outside of some of my own veg dishes (I can assure you I'm in no way biased), this place is probably the best vegetarian meal I've had in a restaurant to date.  It's not easy to do good creative veg dishes, but here, it was exceptional.  You don't even think about the fact that you're not eating meat.  We had the fried dumplings with sweet and spicy sauce and the \"shrimp\" hot and sour soup with lemon grass to start.  Both excellent.  For the mains we had the crispy duck with soy sauce and spinach, which I marveled over (probably the reason for this 5 star) and the spicy rice noodles with black mushrooms.\n\nThis place put veg dining on a whole new level for me.  New York restaurants now have something to shoot for.
