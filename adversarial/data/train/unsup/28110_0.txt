Stopped in for a quick bite while visiting the Heard Museum. It's a bit pricey (what museum eatery isn't?), but the apps we had were very good, and the entrees being delivered to other diners looked delicious and attractive. We opted for the chips and guacamole and the shrimp ceviche. Lots of chips and healthy portion of guac. Ceviche was flavorful and had plenty of tiny shrimp. The service was adequate, although we would've appreciated water refills (we had to ask a couple of times.) \n\nThe café is small, but bright and welcoming. There are tables available on the outdoor court patio. The water feature in the courtyard creates a serene setting. The café is located outside of the museum entrance doors, and is a great place for lunch at times other than a museum visit. \n\nThe Heard Museum is one of Phoenix's treasures and this little café is also a gem. Only am giving three stars because we only had appetizers - we'll be back and order some \"real food.\")
