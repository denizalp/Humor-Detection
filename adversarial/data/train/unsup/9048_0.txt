This place is great. The office looks like just in the pictures very warm and welcoming the staff is great and extremly helpful. Phoenic Family Medical Clinic is great for those who dont have insurance and \/ or are underinsured.\nI dont think i could have gone to a better place  its was fast and easy and they answered all my questions they even do priscription.
