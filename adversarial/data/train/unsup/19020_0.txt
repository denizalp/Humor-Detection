I had wanted to stop and eat here for awhile. I was so happy we finally made it there. The gentleman working was very nice and he explained that they always have cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, sausage pizza, a veggie pizza, and a special of the day pizza. We bought a piece of sausage and a piece of BBQ Chicken pizza. We thought we would start with those and then try another piece or two . . .until we saw how enormous their pizzas are!!!!  I have never seen pizzas that huge!!! . Each piece of pizza was $5. Plain cheese is $4. Whole plain cheese pizzas are $30 and others are $35. The pizzas are so big that you could feed two to three families from one pizza. The sausage is not your typical sausage. It is sliced and the size of pepperoni and not crumbles. I wish that they weren't sliced so thin. It was very good. The BBQ Chicken was our favorite of the two. The BBQ sauce was finger licking good. The chicken was real. It was in nice size chunks. I wish the pizzas had a little bit more cheese on them but the pizza is very good. The pizzas are very thin crust until you get to the edge where it's more like a typical hand tossed crust.  Even though the crust is thinner it stands up to the toppings. \nTake a group of friends and go try it. Enjoy all of the artwork o the walls!!
