This isn't the original location, but it might just be better.\n\nAces & Ales started as a bar in a quiet neighborhood on the east side, a spot that still draws plenty of locals and boasts 20 craft beer taps (give or take a Goose Island or two). This newer outpost on Tenaya dwarfs it with 50 taps. If you want a more varied selection of craft beers and distance isn't a concern, that's clearly a big selling post.\n\nAlso, most if not all of the annual events now take place here. Stone Domination, Strong Beer Fest, and others are always here and not at the one closer to me, likely to take advantage of the higher number of taps. And if anyone is curious, Strong Beer Fest leftovers are priced such that it might actually be worth it to pay the entry fee.\n\nAs with the Nellis site, happy hour is offered daily 4-6pm, except for Sundays when it's all day and grants 50% off growler fills. Pricing is $2 off apps and drinks (except for taster pours) and 50% off pizzas. This location also does \"Sinners Sundays\" brunch (9am-1pm, see web site for details).\n\nI could go on and on about each individual beer in the multitude which I tried today with my friend. They were all served at an appropriate temperature, and flights (of up to 4 per flight holder, but price individually) were labeled by number to correspond with the menu (see web site for updated list). By the way, most beers run $6-8 for full pours ($2-$2.75 for 5 oz pours), although special event \/ rare beers will justifiably be priced higher.\n\nFood is also really solid here.\n\n- Bacon Bombs ($9, or $7 during happy hour): identified by our server as a particularly popular item. After I absentmindedly devoured them, I realized how addictive they were. Think bacon-wrapped jalape√±o popper, and then realize how badly you want to order it.\n\n- OG beer bites ($6 \/ $4): think fancy pizza crust balls with both marinara dip and beer cheese dip available. I wouldn't have ordered them on my own, but they worked well after downing a few alcoholic beverages.\n\n- BBQ chicken pizza ($18 for 16-inch, $14 for 10-inch, half off at happy hour): surprising in that it wasn't overwhelming with BBQ sauce. Actually, I'm not even sure that there was typical BBQ sauce present. For the happy hour, it was a deliciously topped chicken pizza with a fairly crispy crust. For regular price, it would be decent.\n\nIt might be a daunting drive to get back here, but Aces & Ales Tenaya is now on my craft beer map for good. Aspiring craft beer explorers should definitely check out their happy hour.
