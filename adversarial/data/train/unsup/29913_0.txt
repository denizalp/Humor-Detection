I live nearby, so it is easy for me to visit regularly.  The restaurant reminds me of many places in Europe.  The inside seating is very tight and cozy.  If you are looking for a private little corner, there just isn't one.  Some people will like it and some will hate it.  I'm personally happy with the seating.\n\nThe main attraction is obviously the food.  And, it is great!  Paninis and Burgers are available for lunch.  Rack of Lamb, Filet Mignon, Poached Tilapia, and several other entrees are available for dinner.  Hors d'oeuvres, pizza, salads, pastas, and risottos are available all of the time.  I've had every burger on the menu, and they are all great.  There is so much flavor and they come with a nice candied nut and strawberry accented salad.  I've only been there a few times for dinner.  The pizzas are more Italian than Americanized pizza.  So, don't expect pepperoni and sausage, but there should be something for your liking.  The main dinner entrees that I've had were all great.  However, the risotto is what sets this place apart.  It's phenomenal!  The chef told me he makes it fresh every day and he takes great pride in his recipes.\n\nI'd highly recommend Centurion and hope you can give it a try.  The owners have very friendly and have provided some perfect recommendations to make the meal more enjoyable.\n\nI recently asked about the liquor license.  Its still in process, but should be available very soon.  I'm not much of a wine drinker, so I'm hoping to see some good beer on the menu soon.
