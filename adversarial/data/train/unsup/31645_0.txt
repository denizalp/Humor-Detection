This was a great experience. It was my first time at experiencing this particular type of massage (reflexology) and it was very relaxing and helped to work out a few of my kinks. \n\nNot to mention they currently offer a tray $40 special for a 1 hour massage plus 30 min foot detox. Glad to say, it was worth it!!
