I recommend Justin DeKay. My husband and I were dreading getting a new car based on past negative experiences with car dealers. We were pleasantly surprised with bell honda. We immediately felt comfortable with Justin. He kept the process moving smoothly so we were not stuck there all day.  Overall, the staff was nice and the process was not draining or too stressful. Iron in finance was also pleasant to work with.
