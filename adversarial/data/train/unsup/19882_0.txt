I have to laugh at myself as I write a review on the Franciscan Renewal Center right after I did my Talking Stick review! Yep, this is were I go to pray for my sins the night before. The FRC has always been welcoming to us sinners and thankfully I am able to enter without bursting into flames. Fr. Peter is a very engaging and thoughtful man who is easily approachable. Just one of the many brothers who oversee the center. Now if you have dogs who are sinners too (they say dogs are just like their owners) FRC has a blessing of the animals every October. The Friars will bless your pet and is a wonderful place to bring your dog or animal for the afternoon. This is a great event which will never be missed!!! Thanks God and for all my blessings!!
