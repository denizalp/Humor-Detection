Found this gem in the strip mall on the corner of Macleod Trail and 94th Ave SE after buying some books from the Chapters nearby.\n\nIt was around lunch time, so we decided to try the $8.99 lunch special which came with butter chicken, naan, rice, samosa, veggies, and a veggie ball(I totally forgot the name of it, but it was good!). Such a deal for so much food and it all tasted great! I love that their butter chicken was not overly sweet and it had a bit of a kick to it. I am already getting hungry thinking about it.\n\nThe dining area is clean and the service is great. Ambiance is okay, as it feels a bit more like a cafeteria setting more than a restaurant. Would definitely come back for to order their lunch special again or maybe try the rest of their menu when we're around that area.
