It takes a serious lack of service and quality for me to give such a negative review.  \nI am not impressed at all by this place, for a few reasons.\nThe service was slow, slow, S L O W and the atmosphere was so noisy you couldn't hear yourself think. The general vibe given off by the staff was, \"This job sucks and I can't wait until I can leave.\"  The most cordial employee was the gentleman who brought us glasses of water.\nThe waitress was mediocre; we ordered our sandwiches (corned beef and roast beef) and waited thirty minutes for them (30 minutes to slap two cold sandwiches together.). The bread was unremarkable, and the corned beef had a fair amount of fat chunks in it (so you're not getting pricier extra lean meat). These sandwiches, 2 soft drinks and a little basket of potato chips were most certainly NOT worth the $30 check!  This place offers nothing that justifies the price.\nJack's deli and 5th Avenue Deli are much better quality and the prices are much better as well.   The service and food are both fantastic at these places, so much so that when you come to C&L you feel like someone took all your money and gave you an empty plate.\nThe icing on the proverbial cake was when we went to the counter to pay...the cashier was stand-offish and rude; I paid with my cc and when she retuned it to me she FLUNG IT ON THE COUNTER and walked away.  No greeting, no asking about the food, no thank you for dining with us.\nThink before you give this place your money, as there are better delis around!\nNever again!!!
