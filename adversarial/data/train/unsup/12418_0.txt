In Jan 2014 I walked into the Venetian, stopped by one of the staff and convinced me to buy a deal they had, which I did.  I called and booked a room in Jan 2015 for June 2015, I was given a room in The Palazzo.  Came June 19th, when I try to check it, I had the most horrible experience with the front desk staff, she was rude and to an extend RACIST, she rudely told me that the type of room I booked, the Bella Suite was not ready and being cleaned (mind you this is around 4pm when I check in), which I replied saying but checked in time is 3pm, she answered back without even looking at me, \"Well check in time is between 3pm to 6pm\", I was shocked and said that I had book this room since January 2015, I don't understand why it is not ready. She still continues to keep up with the rude attitude and tell me well she can move me to the Venetian.  I was upset because of her rude attitude and said no because I can clearly hear the staff next to her is offer one of the guests the BELLA SUITE, she again rudely told me that well then I need to wait until 6pm for the room.  At the point I was too tired and exhausted to deal with the bullshit so I took the room.  I realized that the only reason I was treated that way because of the deal I bought.  I BOUGHT THE DEAL FROM THEIR OWN HOTEL and only end up being treated like some trash from the street.  First of all there's no where stating checking in is between 3pm-6pm, it clearly state check in starting at 3pm.  SO IF YOU HAPPEN TO WALK IN EITHER HOTELS AND BEING OFFER ANY KIND OF DEALS, PLEASE DO NOT BE FOOL AND BUY IT, OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE TREATED LIKE TRASH.
