Our son and DIL had highly recommended this restaurant. Four of us went to celebrate my husband's birthday. We were seated promptly by a lovely, gracious hostess. Our waiter was attentive without hovering. Warning to those who are used to having a quick dinner...this is about experiencing fine dining...savoring the drink..the food..and the relationships of those with whom you are dining. The atmosphere was exquisite, the food sublime. We savored every moment of the experience..never hurried...reminded us of dining in Europe. It is our new favorite restaurant.. BTW the waiters recommendations were \"spot on\"
