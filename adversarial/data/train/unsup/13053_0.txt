Momo Sushi is my go-to spot for dinner when I'm in Boulder. In a small town like Boulder City, vegan options are a rare commodity indeed. However, vegans can usually DIY something at Japanese restaurants (think edamame, veggie tempura, tofu, etc.). Momo Sushi is nice enough that they accommodate my off the menu requests. I order tofu with steamed veggies topped with teriyaki sauce. If I'm extra hungry. I'll order a side of rice ($2). My DIY meal is actually under $10, so it's super affordable. There's also a veggie roll on the menu that I'm definitely ordering on my next visit. \n\nI've been to Momo's with my husband and friends, and everyone wholeheartedly gives their approval. It's a cozy little restaurant with super reasonable prices. In fact, on our last visit, our dinner came to $18.95! Gotta love that price tag.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017: #6
