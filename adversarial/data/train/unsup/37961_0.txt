Absolutely fabulous. Came here with my daughter and the customer service was great. While checking in one of the staff ; Anthony played tic tac toe with my daughter in the lobby. The pool was so relaxing with great views and we had some tasty non alcoholic drinks made for us. We had an early flight and they had a town car waiting to take us to the airport . Also they gave us great recommendations on nearby by food. Such a relaxing trip!
