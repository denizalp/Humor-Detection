While on a work trip, we choose to dine at Andrea's special to try the Impossible Burger there. They serve it in 3 forms - Slices, Lettuce Cups, and Mapo Tofu. Incredibly innovative menu options, with an Asian twist. I've tried the Impossible Burger several times in various restaurants, but I have to say that this was my favorite experience! Perhaps I'm biased because I have a more Asian palette, but everyone at the table really enjoyed the Lettuce Cups and Mapo Tofu.\n\nOverall great meal - everything else we tried was equally delicious. We tried the hamachi sashimi, a variety of rolls, and the black cod. For dessert, we had cake pops and shaved ice. Even the midwesterners at our table whom have never had shaved ice, enjoyed it! Lastly, the wine recommendation the Som gave us was great! Surprisingly low priced and paired well with our selections.\n\nService was also noteworthy!\n\nIt's been 2 days since I dined there, and I've raved about my meal to at least a dozen different people! I'm sure I'll reach digger dozen before the end of the week.
