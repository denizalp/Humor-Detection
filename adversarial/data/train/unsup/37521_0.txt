I visit this lovely nail shop on New Years Eve and called myself making an appointment but still wasn't seen until almost an hour after my appointment time. The shop does get busy really fast but the customer service is spot on. It's rear when you go to a nail shop where the staff interact with the customers vs one another. This shop is a bit on the smaller size but I may this this being it was jammed packed from the time I arrived and was still busy when we left. \nI plan on going back to get my nails done. As far as the pedi went, I like the clean approach they take with each bowl, lining it with a plastic insert that hooks into the water system. The nail artist also seem pretty good at seeing your nail art design and make it come alive. \nI came here being I learned that this location has the best reviews in Mesa. Thank you for the excellent service. We shall return\n\nThis is an update from my last review! I've had my new full set now for three weeks. I came in this passed weekend 02-19-2017 for my 2week fill and sad to say here it is Wednesday 02-22-2017 and I already have a broke nail. Personally, I feel we pay too much for our nails to break after a few days from service. I could understand if I completely neglected my nails and went weeks on end not care for them but come on, this is a new full set and I got my fill in a timely manner! \nI give the employees there 4-5 stars for always being nice but I change the quality of work down to, 2 stars. \nHope there's no problem fixing my nails as I can't get there until this weekend!
