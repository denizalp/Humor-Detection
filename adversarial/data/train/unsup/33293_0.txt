I was so excited to have a good pita tonight at my first visit to Pita Jungle. I was so impressed by all the healthy ingredients on the menu and delicious-sounding dishes. The hummus with a mild kick and tzatziki sauce were wonderful although the pitas disappointed until my husband's gyro came--I realized I should have ordered all Greek pitas, which are thick and soft opposed to dry and tortilla-like. The falafel in my falafel pita was slightly over-cooked, and I needed a side of tzatziki to add to it to make it moister.  One edge of my pita was rock hard, and I had to tear it  off. The fresh made lemonade did not taste like it had any lemons in it - - it tasted more like a sweet mango Agua Fresca. My husband said his pita was perfect. I think I will enjoy coming back again if I order slightly differently than I did this time.
