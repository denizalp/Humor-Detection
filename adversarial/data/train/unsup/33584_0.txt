I am Chinese and I have been to almost every Chinese restaurant off the strip in Vegas and I had been to some high-end strip Chinese restaurant such as Jasmin. I have to say Fu is an unique Chinese American fusion culinary experience and it was worth every penny I paid. Like many Chinese, I was initially skeptical about over priced Chinese food. But boy was I glad I made the choice to come here.\n\nFor a party of four, we ordered the miso sea bass wrap and the baby back pork rib. Both were outstanding. For main entrees, we had grilled beef tenderloin with Fu sauce, wok fried salmon with creamy Thai basil sauce, eggplant with pork, and garlic noodle. I was so impressed with the uniqueness of the sauce, and the perfect balance of tastes in each dish. For dessert, we ordered the mango pudding and the banana spring rolls with ice cream. That topped off an outstanding meal with great company.\n\nYou cannot view Fu in the same category as your traditional Chinese restaurants. Fu epitomizes what a good Chinese fusion restaurant should be. It introduces new senses to the palate, and it boldly adds new flavors to some otherwise very simple dishes. It truly is worth the money
