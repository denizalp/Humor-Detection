I was in the mood for sushi and wanted something close by and good. Thanks to my fellow yelpers I tried No. 1 sushi. It is a small restaurant so keep that in mind if your looking to dine in. \nI ordered the #2 special,  spicy tuna, California rolls, and choice of miso soup or seaweed salad $10.95. I also ordered spicy salmon $5.95. Prices were on par with other sushi restaurants in my opinion.  \nThe rice was cooked well and the fish tasted fresh. I didn't give this place five stars because the spicy mayo and spicy sauce was a lot...too much. I ended up scraping off some of it. \n\nOverall it was a good meal with a minor hiccup. \nI also want to add that this establishment is very friendly and personable.  I was in and out in ten minutes.
