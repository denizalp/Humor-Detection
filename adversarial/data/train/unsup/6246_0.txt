I suppose I'm taking out my disdain on Las Vegas itself - it is certainly not for me.  Depressingly trashy and full of boring chain restaurants, I don't understand why anyone would waste vacation time here.  We were on our way to Zion and Bryce Canyon and had to fly into the hell-hole known as Las Vegas.  We initially booked two nights because we'd never been, and we were both ready to leave by the morning.  Thank God that Red Rock Canyon and Hoover Dam were nearby.\n\nThat being said, Treasure Island the hotel itself was nice and cheap.  They probably hate people like me, who get a $40 room and are expected to make up the difference by gambling hundreds of dollars.  No thanks.  They do up-charge for WIFI, etc.  The rooms were upscale and beds were luxuriously comfortable.  The hotel has everything that you could expect at a hotel in Vegas- robots sitting at slot machines with a lit cigarette, a cheap drink, and permanent frowns plastered on their face.  It also had cheesy places like \"Kahunaville\" and \"Senor Frogs\" in the bottom of the hotel.  Having heard glorious things about buffets in Vegas, we had to check out the one at Treasure Island.  Think: cafeteria\/jail food quality.  \n\nThe Treasure Island Pirate (\"strip\") show is definitely for adults only- not sure why people had their 12 year kids there.  Definitely plenty of immature innuendos going on, while prepubescent boys drooled with desire and dads guffawed at the scantily clad pirate strippers.  \n\nWon't ever go back to Vegas, so won't have the pleasure of staying here again.  And if I somehow do find myself here, I hope there's a loaded gun available.
