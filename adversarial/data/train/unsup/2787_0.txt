My boyfriend LOVES this place. Absolutely loves it. \nMe.. I'm kind of over the fact that the burgers are kind of expensive for what they are, and they don't even include fries. Not a huge deal, except for the fact that if you order the fries separately, you'll find they really aren't that good. Nice and crispy, but they lack in seasoning. I tried the truffle fries, and the sauce was good, but the fries were still flavorless. \nThe last time we were here, I ordered my drink and waited 20 minutes for the server to get it. He had completely forgotten about it, and the restaurant was empty. And no, he didn't magically remember, I had to flag him down to inform him of the obvious. No refills either. \nCome here for a tasty burger, not for the service, or for the fries.. You want that, go elsewhere.
