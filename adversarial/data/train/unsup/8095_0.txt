On another return visit to the recently remodeled dining room of Vino's, another Italian dinner was enjoyed here.  After very good Garlic Breadsticks and filling Fried Mozzarella Marinara, I addressed a cool and overflowing House Salad with lettuce, Black Olives, tomatoes, and Italian Dressing.  Then I dove into a bowl of rich and hearty Minestrone Soup, which contained zucchini, celery, kidney beans, green beans, carrots, Ditalini Pasta, and a tasty broth.  As a change of pace, I ordered the monthly special, Ziti Senese, as my entree.  This dish was a combination of penne, ultra-mild sausage, and some cheesy sauce.  It was good but bland.\n\nService was good except for a longer than normal wait to get the bill, due to our server waiting on a group of 12 in the private party room nearby.  And I liked the redecorated, sleeker-looking digs.
