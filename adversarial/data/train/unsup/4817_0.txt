Honestly I don't know what's with all the bad reviews.  Yes it's pretentious and yes there are a lot of fake people, but it's what you make of it.  Maybe it's because I went early on a Sunday and left before the crowd was reallllyyyyy drunk\/god knows what else (left around 7:30pm) but my daytime chill session was great.  Earlier in the day the waitresses are nicer, you get ample seating, and $20 cover makes up for itself considering there's free pool and jitone tables.  The drink prices are comparable to other clubs, and their shisha is worth it if you just want to sit and chill.  At least it's not $50....
