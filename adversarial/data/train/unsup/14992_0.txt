STAY AWAY!!! My husband ordered my 30th birthday cake from here (after I saw Emily Maynard Johnson posting her beautiful cakes from here on IG and I begged him) needless to say, we were very disappointed. My husband asked that they do a 4th of July themed cake with a design on the top. When he placed the order he told the person on the phone that he'd seen their cakes before and trusted them to do something creative.\n\nI was SO excited about the cake I actually stopped with a family member to pick the cake up myself. I was so embarrassed when I picked up a totally bare cake with some ribbon around the sides and nothing on the top. I could have gotten a better design from a pre-made grocery store cake. My name or \"Happy Birthday\" weren't even written on it!!!!!!\n\nWhen we asked to have something written on the top because the cake was so bare, the employee seemed completely put off and irritated. I would have walked out had my husband not already prepaid for it.\n\nWe had 30+ people at my party and they knew my cake had come from here, they were actually laughing at how sad this cake looked. This bakery is not worth the hype! They offer \"WOW\" alright! Wow as in, \"WOW, should have gone somewhere else\"
