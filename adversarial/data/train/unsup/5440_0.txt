I love this place! Seriously! We have a membership and definitely use it! My boyfriend actually tells me to only go once a week... because I'll go 2 or 3 times. LOL.\n\nI suck at getting my car on the tracks, but the people who work here are very helpful and don't laugh much at me. The car wash itself is awesome! The lights and everything that goes along with it! The soap also smells super good.\n\nThe best part is that the dyers work so good! My car is pretty much completely dry and there was no water spots. The vacuum is also a great thing, the spots are shaded and the vacuum works super good! My BF sucked his sock up on accident, whoops!\n\nGet a membership and enjoy a clean car!!\n\nYay!
