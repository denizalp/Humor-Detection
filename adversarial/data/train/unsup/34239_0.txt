Rude employees, place is dirty, food was alright, not the same as back then.\n\nWent around 7ish to get a burger, when I went to order the guy sounded mad and annoyed, if you don't like your job go find an other job. Guy was rude when I was ordering, would cut me off and literally tossed my food and jerked it my way through the drive thru window.
