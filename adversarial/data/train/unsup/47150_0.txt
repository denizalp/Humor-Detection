Great service and amazing food. Had the biscuits with honey butter and apple butter. It was delicious. Also ordered the meat and cheese platter and the fried chicken and waffles. Best chicken we've ever had! Hot sauce that came with was a hot and sweet. The bourbon maple syrup for waffle was amazing as well.
