Great little market with attached restaurant (or dining hall). Weekdays they have a buffet, which is always well stocked with the usual Indian fare, incl. veggie and meat dishes as well as salad and desert. You get free Naan and they make a very good and strong iced tea. It's in walking distance from where I live, so I am lucky and get to stop by often... :)
