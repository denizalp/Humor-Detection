This little gem is hidden between a Chinese restaurant and a Mexican restaurant. The waiter was super nice and the food came out quick.  The Tikka Masala was amazing.  I was full and continued to eat it because it was so good. We had leftovers. There is an Indian store right next store so if you want more you can go there and get everything you need.
