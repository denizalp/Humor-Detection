Don't waste your time with either of these places. Plan B Cafe, owned and operated by the teenager cum owner - spends more time  smoking outside the shop and worrying about the decor than actually learning how to make coffee or figure out a way to make the \"plan b\" cafe accessible to serve sandwiches or any type of food. At best, you  may be able to ogle at the displays while waiting for your pretentious and incompetent barista to serve you a half cold terrible tasting cup of coffee. Quite honestly, I felt as though they should pay me for the inconvenience they caused me and the fact that after waiting, I showed up to work late feeling ill from the terrible cup of coffee I had just overpaid for. \n\nThe t-shirt shop is even worse.  The senior staff can usually be found smoking up in the back alley, and the owner spends most of his own time  taking advantage of people, and lying to customers. He is argumentative and will not listen to the customer's needs, will not provide you with information in regards to his \"eco-friendly\" products when asked, and do not count on your order being as per the original quote or completed on time.  Dealing with this Jerk was the worst mistake I ever made, there are far more and far better t-shirt shops in Toronto--- do not go to one this. \n\nI absolutely give this place 0 stars and would never step foot in this place again. I'm not surprise that there are so many other negative reviews of this place.
