This review is solely based on their Greek food. I also think I should add that the restaurant itself is really clean. The kitchen is open and I noticed the overall cleanliness in there as well. There was a lot of take out orders going on (which makes sense, because the service was slow).\n\nI (should have) didn't order any of their breakfast items, burgers or gyro's. One in my party had the gyro and french fries (really good fries, I didn't try the gyro but heard it was good). The other did just a standard breakfast item, he felt everything was good. He stated he would be back for breakfast or a gyro again. \n\nHere's where it hit the fan... I had the spinach pie or spanakopita and the cheese pie or tiropita (just feta cheese filled filo dough). They were inedible. I took a bite of each, one I had to spit out, the other I was able to keep down, but it was just horrible. The server took them away and removed them from the bill, so good work there. The grape leaves were similar to what I have had at other Greek restaurant (never as good as grandma made) but same flavor profile. However, the rice was complete mush (not the right texture at all). The tzatziki sauce was just how I like it, just the right amount of garlic.\n\nAll in all, this is not the place to fulfill your Greek food craving. I don't like bad reviews, so I will probably go back for breakfast and update my review. Or maybe a gyro for lunch, who knows. Either way, I will stay away from their so called 'Greek menu.'
