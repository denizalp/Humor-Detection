It appears previous reviews about the service are quite misguided, since those with whom we interact are always a reflection of our selves.  \n\nI am a regular here and I find the staff to be extremely friendly and always helpful.  They know me by name and I know most of them by name.  Yes, the atmosphere is great.  Even on a busy day you can feel as if you belong.  \n\nIt helps that I'm a fan of Second Cup to begin with.  But just as others are a reflection of us, a staff is always a reflection of their management.  The franchise owner, Harry -- who also works there -- is a really nice and friendly man and he has imparted that nature to his baristas.  \n\nIf you are fortunate enough to become a regular patron, rest assured you will be known by name.  \n\nExtraordinary customer service with beautiful, genuine smiles!  This -- along with great coffee -- is what keeps me coming back.
