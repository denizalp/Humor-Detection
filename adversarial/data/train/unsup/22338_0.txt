Boba? On this side of town? Yup! Located just off the highway in a hidden shopping center, Tea Time Caf√© has a surprisingly large menu of beverages, simple sushi rolls, and snacks. Service is polite, space is decorated like a teenagers bedroom (not necessarily in a bad way), and the snacks are pretty decent.\n\nICED PEPPERMINT GREEN TEA w\/BOBA: I could drink this stuff daily. I will likely come back specifically for this beverage and try to order it as my regular drink at other boba places. The mint is artificial tasting but it's very refreshing, boba was decent.\nRICE BALLS: Your choice of salmon or tuna, in a rice ball, lightly fried exterior drizzled with furikake and eel sauce. I paid the upcharge for salmon and what I received smelled like tuna and was fairly tasteless. Maybe this just isn't for me.\nSUSHI ROLLS: The rolls available here all seem to be simple variations of the California roll. The roll I selected had \"crispy onion and tuna\" but  was crab and avocado, topped with those fried bits that really aren't onions at all, along with a ton of spicy mayo. Tasted decent, portion was good for the $7 price. \n\nIf I was in the area more often, I'd probably hit this place up regularly but it's not worth going out of the way for. I'm glad I didn't encounter any of the service issues cited in other reviews, but found it odd that two out of three items seemed to be somewhat incorrect compared to the description provided on the menu.
