the 2 doctors my wife and I have seen are excellent. DR Foggio, cant remember the other one.\nThe practice is a mess. When you call to make an apt you get a voice mail stating they will call back in 24 hours. If they call and your not home, and you return their call you get a voice mail they will call in another 24 hours.and on and on. Today sept. 19th they called and I was home. The appointment I got was December 1st. 71 days. I started this process to see an ENT in august so its closer to 100 days I have had this problem. Part of the blame belongs to united health care. Its the only ENT they authorize and their part of the process was slow. Good luck trying to talk to anyone at their offices. They act like they are doing you a favor. Curt is the word I was looking for. Definitely not patient friendly. This is what an hmo is all about. I guess. I'm just paying out of pocket to see another ENT..9 day wait
