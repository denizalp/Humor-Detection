Heard this joke while I was at Nodo - Why are a lot of Italian men named Tony? Because when they migrated over to the states, they wore name tags To NY.\n\nThis is a cute cozy restaurant with great food and service.  I came for dinner with a group of 6 and had a great time.  There are many great options on the menu including soup, pizza, calzone, mussels, octopus, rigatoni, and gnocchi.  Complimentary bread was brought out with olive oil after we ordered.  The food took a while to come out, but it was delicious.  \n\nArancini $9 - These were more like rice cones, crunchy on the outside and cheesy on the inside.\nPappardelle $19 - This duck ragu ribbon pasta dish was excellent.  The meat was like pulled duck, flavorful and tender.  The sauce went really well without everything.\n\nStreet parking on Dundas is free on weekdays after 6p.  I was able to find a spot across the street when I am for dinner on a Wednesday night.  There are also paid parking lots nearby.\n\n....| \\      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,      \n...\/  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \\ -  ;  ;  ;  , _    \n..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .
