I have been here about 5 times now, and as you could probably guess, the care you get completely depends on the doctor\/nurse practitioner! In general, they do a good job, but since they don't know much about you--even though they can theoretically read your whole UPMC file--they are hesitant to do much more than \"put a bandaid on it\" until your PCP or specialist can take over.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and quite efficient. The facility is new and very clean.\n\nCase 1: Husband, hurt foot. They take x-rays and say that its broken. They give him a foot thingy and crutches and send him to sports medicine. Pros: we got into sports medicine much faster. Cons: foot thingy useless and was given a boot; had to pay for all new docs and x-rays to be told that it was broken.\n\nCase 2: Me, Bronchitis. It's around the holidays so my PCP isn't in the office. I call back after 10 days because I'm still sick and getting worse. They make me see them again because it's been too long since my last appointment. What? They won't give me antibiotics until they confirm via chest x-ray that part of my lung has collapsed! Pros: I had a doctor when I couldn't have my own. Cons: You have to be pretty sick to for them to diagnose you with other than \"a virus.\"
