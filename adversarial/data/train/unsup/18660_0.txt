I went to Chabrol on a cold winter's evening and felt like I stepped into a someone's personal, warm, bustling kitchen. It is a TINY SPACE. For a second I was certain that I was in an escape room and there was a secret door I had to uncover to lead me into the actual restaurant, but in fact they really did manage to cram a kitchen, bar, and all 19 seats into that space. How they manage to create such delicious full plates from what appears to be a kitchen the size of an Easy-Bake oven is beyond me; the chef is obviously a tiny and magical wizard. \n\nWe started with the pork liver mousse and roasted squash frisee salad. The mousse was delicious, the salad unique but not something I would order again. Then we shared the Ttoro - mussels, shrimp, and white fish served in a saffron broth. This was served with fresh crusty bread to mop up the outstanding broth. We then shared the lamb, which was moist and served in a flavourful jus. I didn't love the turnips that were served with it as they were kind of bland. The escarole and celeriac gratin was INCREDIBLE and was my favourite savoury dish of the night. I should note that this was an excessive amount of food and if you intend on going, I would skip the lamb. This is primarily to save space for the apple tarte dessert which should be ordered in advance as it takes 20 minutes to prepare. THIS. DESSERT. IS TO DIE FOR. You could even come and order JUST this dessert and your life would be complete. The chef apparently makes his own puff pastry every morning (a very labour-intensive job according to YouTube). The combination of this buttery, warm, fluffy, slightly chewy puff pastry with tart apples, caramelized sugar, and freshly whisked calvados sabayon sauce is GENIUS. I can't even. Just go.
