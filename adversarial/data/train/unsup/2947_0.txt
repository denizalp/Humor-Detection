As a newbie to the Richmond Hill area, I have been on a hunt for a new hairstylist for a couple of months now and i'm sure most girls would agree that it is one of the most stressful things to do. After all, finding a new hairstylist is practically the same as searching for your soul mate, it does not come easy and once you have one you hold on for dear life. \n\nWell ladies... and gents, I've found my soul mate :).  \n\nI came across Vanguard Hair Parlour and Spa on yelp.ca, because I use yelp for like EVERYTHING now, and I decided I would take a leap of faith and give it a go! \n\nThe salon is beautiful. Very rustic, industrial and yet, comfortable decor.  The staff are welcoming right when you walk in. They introduce themselves, take your coat and (my favorite part) offer you a coffee and chocolate biscotti from the \"self-serve\" coffee and tea bar.  The bar wasn't very \"self-serve\" as the staff were so accommodating I didn't even lift a finger :). \n\nI was paired up with Paula who is the hair color specialist. First she asked me about my hair and what I would like to have done and then offered her suggestions.  I was so impressed (and for once felt no anxiety) that I let Paula do whatever she wanted and I'm so glad I did. \n\nAfter a few hours, a couple cups of Bora Bora tea ( a must try!!!) and a complimentary hand massage, I was all done.  My hair looked exactly as Paula said it would and for the first time exactly how I wanted it. :) \n\nI highly recommend this salon for everyone! I know I will be returning indefinitely. \n\nI've got a white knuckle grip on this one and I'm not letting go! :)\n\nTiff
