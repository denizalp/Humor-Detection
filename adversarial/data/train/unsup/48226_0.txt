It is my opinion that this is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in greater Montreal. \nThe first night we went, we were excited by the flavors and freshness of the selections. \n\nThe restaurant is casual, bring your own wine, and family owned.\nIf you do not see exactly what you want, just ask the owner woman or her daughter and they are so happy to go out of their way to make something just for you.\nThe beef pho is AMAZING with rich flavor. The fresh rolls with shrimps, mint, and noodles with peanut dipping sauce are a tease. So good that you can not wait for the entree to come. \n\nPho Viet is now a must stop for Dennis and I when we visit Montreal. \nWe came here TWICE in one week as it was so good!!\n\nSteps away from the gay village and rue St Catherine.
