Ordered the awabe kip beef and the lamb with the vegetarian combo and salad to start. Way too much food for three people! Thankfully the waitress stopped us before we could also order a chicken dish.\nFood comes on one large platter with injera bread so be prepared to get your right hand dirty and get sociable!
