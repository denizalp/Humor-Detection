I fondly remember a favorite back at school in New Haven CT that we frequented called Mamouns and this has been my comparison scale on ALL middle east \/ greek food that i devour down when I need my gyro fix. \n\nHere, the customer services needs work, they need to be a bit more helpful and understanding when new customers come in. Yes, I'm familiar to this style of food, but not your menu setup and I need you to walk me through it. Sorry, it was a turn off for us when pressured to order faster. We walked in and no one was here yet. But as soon as we placed our order the place seemed to fill up quite fast. (Good timing on our part)\n\nFood was just... just.. okay. A little dry, a little garlic-y, maybe this is the 'Chicago Style' ...not sure, but it was just okay in my book. Now don't get me wrong, I WILL return to give them another crack at it, as I sample a few other menu items, and will update my review as I go.
