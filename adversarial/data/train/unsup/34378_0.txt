Was curious to check this place out after seeing it on restaurant rescue. \nFor one, it looks amazing! Was happy to see they put tv's back up after. Though the wiring was a mess. I install home theaters for a living so I'm going to notice these things in a place that is otherwise pristine. Staff was super nice and attentive. \nNow, food. The menu is slim, good thing though. Do a few things well, much better than having a horde of items half assed. \nI ordered the stuffed banana peppers. They looked great! But, were barely warm. Not sure if the sausage was cooked the whole though. It had a strange texture. Something I'll update tomorrow. I.e. will I be ill later...\nMenu is priced nicely except for the pizza. A notorious margin machine...\nI'm going with 3 stars for now, mainly on aesthetic. Will come back to sample more.\nUpdate soon...
