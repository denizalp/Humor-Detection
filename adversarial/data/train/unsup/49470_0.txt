If you want to get in, get your produce and get out, and you live on the North or East side of town, check it out. They have pretty much everything you missed at the Downtown market the day before (except for Spicy Cheese Bread- haven't seen much bakery stuff there), but without the crowds and paid parking. The vendors are great. Some sort of prepared food is usually offered, and sometimes there is music and cooking or canning demonstrations.
