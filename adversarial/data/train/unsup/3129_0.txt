I wouldn't even give this company one star! I called for \"immediate\" service! I had been in the emergency room all night sick, and was released early in the morning.. I waited an hour and a half for the cab(which by the way, never showed up!) I ended up checking back in to the emergency room because I couldn't get home to take care of myself! Thanks guys! Round of applause for you!!!\n\nWould have gone with discount cab, but their line was busy.. this explains why..
