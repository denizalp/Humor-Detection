We were in Vegas casino hopping and ran into this this. We always watch Guy's Diner, Drive-ins and dives and thought lets try it. Decided to split the bacon, mac and cheeseburger it was very good. I don't think it's a 20.00 dollar burger but being it's at a hotel I can understand the price. My favorite was their fries, the mix every fry in the book and let me tell you hands down some of the best fries I have had. If you're in town and looking for a fresh burger and great fries give it a try.
