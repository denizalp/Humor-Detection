yes and yes. i went here recently with a girlfriend and her boyfriend for some Rock 'n Bowl action. i hadn't been to a bowling alley on the weekend for about...10 years?\nwow, have they stepped it up a notch. no longer is it black lights, disco lights and bad alt rock. now they have huge, drop down screens that play videos of top 40s while you bowl - and i dont know about you, but justin timberlake really helps me work on my 65 average.\n\ntip: the bud light bottles that are shaped like bowling pins seem like a fun idea, but - guy or girl - it is totally inappropriate to drink out of a bottle shaped like that, and you will feel ridiculous trying to do so.
