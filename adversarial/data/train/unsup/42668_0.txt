My experience with Progressive was subpar.  After six months, I found an insurance company with a much better rate for car insurance (with same, if not better coverage).  Progressive charged me a $50 early termination fee to switch.  The other insurance company was a much better deal  (even with the $50 fee) so I still decided to make the change.  I will never use Progressive again.
