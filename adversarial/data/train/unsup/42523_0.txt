Came in twice to get something printed up, I got helped by one lady who was completely useless every time there would be a pause  the lady would  just go to the next customer and just pass me by.\nCustomer service sucks, then a second young lady from Hawaii or somewhere tried to help me, and she acted like she was completely drunk or on drugs, just saying ridiculous things off subject not helping me. Useless. There's one woman there that works there but she'll be quitting to become a school teacher - she is excellent, they are really going to lose customers when she goes. The other women are just unhelpful and just ignore your questions and go to the next customer.
