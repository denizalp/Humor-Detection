Was in the immediate area and thought I would bring home a sugary, carbohydrate laden pill for the GF.  Sadness, as they did not have a French Cruller to order, and even sadder when I found out they do not make them. I took an Old Fashioned which I found to be fresh and moist.  Averaging out everything including the friendly service, Coco's is A-ok.
