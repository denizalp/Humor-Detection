The place is really nice... the DJ (Franzen) truly makes me miss his old Bay Area days which is probably the only reason why I gave this rating at least 1 star because it should get 0 stars. There is this one  security guard whose name I dont member... but he completely sucks. Extra high powered. I'd be willing to bet his courage comes from an illegal substance.
