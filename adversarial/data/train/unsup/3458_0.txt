dear rhythm room,\n\ni am so sorry that many great artists will be skipped over from playing in your gem of a venue due to the hipster ballroom that opened up and stole your indie spotlight. i will unfortunately have to patronize them due to my love for these buzzbands, but you  and your sweet, cheap draft beers, scuzzy bathrooms, random table & chair sets, awesome bartenders, dingy dark atmosphere, incredible sound and intimate stage presentation will forever hold a special place within me.\n\nthe best shows i've seen in phoenix have always been in your belly.\n\nthank you, from the bottom of my burning indie heart.
