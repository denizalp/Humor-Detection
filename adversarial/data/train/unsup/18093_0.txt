This place is the definition of disaster... I usually NEVER go to Indian restaurants because they cheap out on everything so you know that theyre going to give you cr@p quality food, but i went here one day to get samosas... If you like surprises with your order, then I would totally recommend Sweet India... Especially if the surprise belongs in the Insect Exhibit at the Science centre, because I swear to you there was a cockroach inside THE DAMN SAMOSA! When I confronted the owner he offered me a free meal?! Im like you honestly think im going to eat here again? Did the health inspection agency skip its visits to airport road for the past decade? how is this establishment still in business?
