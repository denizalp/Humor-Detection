I stopped because it was very early (before 8am) and I need to pickup three things, I only expected to be able to get two here, but figured I'd try anyway. It looks like the remodeling is nearing completion, still work to do but getting there. I asked a few people they did try to help but after 40 minutes found nothing i was looking for. So I did what I should have done, slept in and went to Target across the street. There I found 2 0f the three things I went out for. I had to stop at a craft store for the last item and pretty much expected to. Thank You Target for being there, I will just sleep in next time, Promise.
