Pho Noodles is a welcome addition to the midtown\/Melrose area. Although the area does not have a shortage of other Asian restaurants, people in the area usually had to go farther into the west side or to north Phoenix to get good Vietnamese food. This restaurant is cozy, very clean, and conveniently located in the commercial complex at the northeast corner of 7th Avenue and Osborn. The staff is friendly and the food is inexpensive and really good. The other reviewers have already discussed how good their pho is, so let me just mention that I love their crispy banh xeo, which is a must-try for people who want something a bit different from the usual noodle or rice dishes. And their Vietnamese rolls are really good, especially the ones with tofu and vegetables - the ingredients are really fresh and the rice-paper wrapper is tender and not rubbery, unlike in some Vietnamese eateries.
