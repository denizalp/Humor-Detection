I had no idea how much I would like Asian Tapas, but they were pretty darn good.  I am a fairly adventurous diner, which definitely is preferable at Sens, though my less-adventurous dining partner still found many items to try and share. \n\nMy favorite items were the chicken and cheese wontons, Hong Kong Noodles, and Pineapple-Ginger fried tofu.  Ohhh... that tofu was something magical - and I got it all to myself!  The lemongrass chicken was also good, though I would probably get something a little more exciting next time.  I wasn't a big fan of the mango-papaya spring rolls or the 5-spice chicken wings.  The skin on the wings was rubbery and kind of off-putting, so we didn't end up finishing those.  Be warned about the sauces that accompany most of the tapas - they are HOT!  I love spicy foods, but still found that scooping out some of the chili paste before mixing the sauces together was necessary, so I didn't light my mouth on fire.  We finished with the green-tea cheesecake, and were pleasantly surprised at the flavor.  Tasty, and not too sweet.  The lychees on top were a nice touch.\n\nWe had fantastic service, despite arriving on First Friday without a reservation.  We enjoyed sitting at the bar, though we will remember to call ahead for a table next time.  I'm glad that I was finally able to try Sens, and look forward to returning.
