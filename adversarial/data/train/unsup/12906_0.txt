Tiny gas pumps and a Redbox kiosk. \nWhen I say \"tiny\" gas pumps, I mean there are four clumped together so close that really only one car can be on each side at a time. But most 7-11s don't have gas pumps in the first place, so it evens out.\n\nService inside is quick, people are in and out fast, and concessions area is organized. Not one of the seedier convenience stores, but I've only been here during daylight hours- seems to be mostly a neighborhood stop for quick snacks or items you forgot at the grocery store.
