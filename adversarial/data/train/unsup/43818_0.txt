Whether I am staying here or not, I come on the last day of my stay for breakfast (since I'm always so full afterwards) and order the chocolate chip pancakes. They are the fluffiest, most decadent pancakes I have ever had. I do recommend getting the half order or sharing because it is a huge stack. They also have a nice selection of tea. Service is always great.
