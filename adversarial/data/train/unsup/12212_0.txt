I've always been wanting to go here every time I drive by it on Camelback and when I had time to go, it was definitely a great experience. The exterior and interior of the restaurant is amazing. I've only been here a couple times at night and I still have yet to go during brunch or during the day time. I ordered the Korean skirt steak on my first time and then the 4 time after that, I still ordered the same thing. It's just SO GOOD. The garlic fries here are pretty good here and I recommend sharing them cause it's a pretty big portion. I will definitely be coming here again, but I can't guarantee that I'll order something different, I'm too addicted to the korean skirt steak.\n\n#CERTIFIEDBANGER
