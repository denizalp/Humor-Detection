Drai's is awesome! I was there for a bachelorette party and we all had a great time! Our table was right next to the DJ booth (3lau was playing that night). Lights, music, and the drinks were all great. The club is huge with a really big dance floor. Our promoter Chris T. definitely hooked us up. We'll b back next time we're in Vegas for sure!
