I found this place thru yelp since I moved here from California and was nervous. But walking in was greeted by polite young lady's . There's a girl named Monica with red hair that was so nice she did a great cut on my husbands hair and helped ease my scare of eyebrow threading . I'm excited to go to her for my next service.
