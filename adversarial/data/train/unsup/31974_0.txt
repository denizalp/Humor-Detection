I wasn't going to write this review, but after contacting Archie's and not getting a reply to resolve the issue, I figured I should share. On Tuesday 5\/15 a co worker and I got lunch pick up. I ordered the garlic pepper chicken. After only a couple of bites I noticed something firmly attached to a piece of chicken, but hoped it was a seasoning. Unfortunately I pulled it off and it was a shorter black hair. I was unable to eat my lunch after that. My $12 lunch was in the garbage. Such a waste. I know these things can happen, but fix it for your customers. Wasted food and money.  See attached photo.
