There aren't a lot of good bagel places in Scottsdale...,this place is ok but certainly not 4 stars.\n\nBagel quality is fair, not great. They're small and not full\/shapely like good bagel places have.  They have a basket with old bananas and a small tray of muffins sitting out that's sometimes empty. The service is ok as some of the workers there have friendly faces.\n\nAgain, it's ok for a quick bagel stop but definitely not worth 4-star rating....which is what prompted me to go there in the first place.
