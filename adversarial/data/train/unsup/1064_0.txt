WARNING: THIS TGIF DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE UNLIMITED APPS PROMOTION (pretty whack considering TGIF is a large chain) \n\nWe walked in a couple of months ago for the first time to take advantage of the unlimited app deal advertised all over tv and the corporate website. We were pretty disappointed to be seated and told this location does not honor this deal. Instead we settled for a happy hour special blue moon and spinach dip. They were alright, nothing special. I gave a star because our server was good, not great. \n\nI also called in a couple of days ago to see if they offered the updated promotion where you can mix and match unlimited apps for $12. Still a no. To be honest, I'm not sure how this place is still standing. This is a huge promotion that should bring in a lot of business, this location is passing up a good opportunity if you ask me. \n\nWon't be coming back here without an exceptional happy hour or the unlimited app deal.
