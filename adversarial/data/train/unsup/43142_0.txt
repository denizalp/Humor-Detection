Came here with a group of 5 other ladies with reservations. We were a few minutes late but I called and they were very polite about saving out reservations. We were seated right in front of the swimming pool with the shark tank so it was a great view (although if you don't want to see half naked people while you are eating you might want to sit inside). \n\nWe had one drunk person in our group who was having a lot of trouble ordering (and comprehending anything). Our server handled it amazingly. He pointed out something he recommended so we ordered it for her. When he brought it, he let us know he would bring something else if she didn't like it. Luckily she LOVED it! The bread and dipping sauce was amazing. I had the spaghetti Bolognese and it was just okay. \n\nThe only time the service was noticeably slow was when we were waiting for our checks. The restaurant seemed to also get busier (around 8pm). \n\nThere was a walkway splitting the restaurant, so you do get some sketchy people walking by. But we didn't have any problems.
