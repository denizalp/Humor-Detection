This hidden gem sells some of the best pastries and coffees around the airport. During my recent visit here during the Yelp event my husband and I got to sample white chocolate macadamia nut biscotti from Enrico biscotti in the Strip district. The coffee they were serving was Segafredo casa whole bean coffee. Delicious!\n\nWe decided to look around and check out their other goodies inside. Most of their pastries come from various places but a lot come from Mediterra bakery located in Robinson. I have always been pleased with the baked goods from Mediterra and you can find their breads and pastries either at Whole Foods or other coffee shops in the city. Other baked goods come from Paragon. They also sell sandwiches and paninis. In addition you can  shop for foods and canned goods if you have arrived home and want to take them before you claim your luggage.\n\nBottega is located towards the right end of the shops the line the back before you enter concourse B. Do yourself a favor. Next time you have a flight, skip the food court and come over here for your grab and go. You'll be glad you did!
