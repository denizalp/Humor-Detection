I use to think no one made better grilled cheese than my mom... then I went to Melt! WOW! They know how to make a grilled cheese! \n\nI decided to venture away from \"The Kindergarten\" and be spontaneous and order a grilled peanut butter and banana melt! Possibly the greatest food decision I've ever made in my life! I am proud to say I ate the ENTIRE thing and still have dreams about this sandwich! I need to make another trip up to Cleveland soon just so I can go back to Melt! \n\nThe service was great- we had about a half hour wait for a table on a Saturday afternoon- but it was well worth the wait!
