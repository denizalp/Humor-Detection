I went here because my favorite Pho soup restaurant was closed. I was skeptical with the word \"fusion\" on it but decided to give it a try. When I walked in I was greeted by a \"tired\" looking lady who was trying to be nice but you could tell it was not in her. I ordered the Beef Pho soup and what I got was far from Beef Pho. When it was a clear chicken broth looking soup that lacked many of the traditional flavor of a authentic Pho soup. It honestly tasted like Campbell's chicken soup. The beef was not sliced thin like a traditional Beef Pho instead it was hard and rubbery pieces of beef that had so much gristle inside it that I was unable to eat it. It was a major turn off. I had also ordered pork egg rolls and you guessed it...it had rubbery pork pieces inside it with mushy cabbage. I finally just put my fork down and kindly paid my bill and walked out. While I was there I couldn't help notice that they had a sushi station and that they also sold Thai food, Chinese food, Vietnamese food and Sushi. These are way too many items to have a one restaurant. The problem is that when places like this offer different items they tend to do them below average instead of concentrating of doing one type of food good and this is the case with this place. It tastes horrible, stay away.
