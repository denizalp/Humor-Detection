Capitano Burgers & Gelato has two of my favourite things:\n1) Burgers!\n2) Gelato!\n\nI've been tempted time and time again by the sign stating:\nBurgers! Gelato!\n\nToday, I gave in and I have no regrets.\n\nI really appreciate the fact that all the ingredients are locally sourced.\nEven though burgers and gelato might not be the best foods for you, \nCapitano serves up these eats as clean, fresh, and natural as possible.\n\nIf you get a regular burger, you can top it as you please.\nThe price is fair at $4.95 - $5.95.\nBeef, chicken, haddock, or soy patty.\n\nI'm pretty lazy when it comes to burger toppings, I generally go with burgers that are dressed up for me.  The dressed burgers range in price ($6.50 to $8.50) \n\nThe Capitan burger was my burger of choice and one of the most popular.\nIt was $8.50 + $3.50 to make it a combo.\n* The burgers are a perfect size\n* The fresh baked organic flour bun was fresh and chewy\n* The horemone-anitbiotic-free angus beef burger patty itself was tasty but slightly overcooked.\n* The deep friend portabello mushroom-cheese patty wasn't as crispy as I would have liked on the outside and not very cheesy but not bad\n\nThe gelato is made in-house and it surprised me!\nIt looked a bit melty in the display, but very thick and firm once cupped.\nThe pistachio had chunks of nuts, the coconut still had yummy coconut bits.\nI like how it wasn't completely smoothly blended.  It was more fun to eat.\nThe size small is pretty small though.\nGelato has no additives and the fruit flavours are dairy free.\n\nThe owner was super friendly and proud of their food.\nThey mentioned that they want to venture into more adventurous meats, bison and even alligator, but they will see.\n\nOverall, I was very satisfied with my burger...and  I've eaten a lot of burgers.\nThe poutine here seems promising.\n\nI'll consider ordering it next time when I'm back for burger! gelato!
