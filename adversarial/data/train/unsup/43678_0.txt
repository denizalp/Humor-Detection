Food is good for its price but I have tasted better. My favourite thing on their menu is the takoyaki. IT IS SOOOOOO GOOOOODDDD. Remember to try it out !!!! :)\n\nOnly giving it 4 star because they didn't give side dishes last time :'( && of the creepy pictures in the bathroom stalls on top of the toilet !
