For lunch, I generally go to the same places and felt like I needed a change and since it is winter and I didn't want to go outside, I took the metro from where I work in the underground city to Plaza Alexis Nihon and went to the IGA supermarket there.\n\nThe IGA is large and looked very nice. I walked around the grocery store before going to the area where they had their prepared food\/meals and decided to order a \"chicken breast meal\" which came with rotisserie style chicken breast, coleslaw (or macaroni salad), dipping sauce, and fries. They give a choice of what type of fries you want and I decided to go with the seasoned fries. They put everything into a cardboard box and then you go to the cash register to pay.\n\nPaid with my credit card and IGA uses AirMiles so if you purchase over $20 worth of items within a single visit, you might consider using your AirMiles card to collect points. In my case, including taxes, my item costs only $6.31 so it didn't make a difference. Paid with my credit card and then left and went to the metro level where Plaza Alexis Nihon had their tables\/chairs for people to eat. When leaving, I forgot to get a plastic fork and plastic knife which they had at one of the counters close to the exit so I had to return there. They could probably find a better place to put these items (perhaps in the section with the prepared food\/meals).\n\nThe chicken was very good as was the coleslaw. The fries that I picked were also good and weren't overly seasoned.\n\nI have no problems returning here.
