I'm a Torontorian looking for delicious famous Alberta beef. I found this store from Yelp before the trip, and got there right after arriving Calgary airport. The staff has not let me down, knowledgeable, professional, friendly, and accommodating. Store is clean, yet a bit tiny without any display, but I guess it's better off to keep the meat fresh without pre-cutting the meat. And it's because of lacking of regular supermarket display, I was a bit lost at the beginning about what kind of beef is available, and what kind of cut is available. So I discussed this with the staff, I suspect he's the owner, and told him I'm a tourist and I'm looking for tasty steak. So he has recommended different steaks for me, and providing me some ice for my long drive to Banff.\n\nWriting this far, I think I haven't mentioned the most important thing, the steak. They are extremely tasty, fresh, and with tons of flavors packed in it. I got tenderloin, striploin and the Rib Eye. All of them were good, but I love the Rib Eye the most as it was extremely marbled and flavorful. It is still one of my highlights in my Banff trip. lol\n\nThank you
