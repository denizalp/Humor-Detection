I travel all the way from Scarborough just for this resturant. The food is amazing and the portions are huge. The Mexican omelette is my favourite dish; the omelette is huuuuuge and they have the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. And it even comes with a massive pancake, all for about $12. The one thing better than their food is their customer service. The owners are so friendly. The resturant is run by a couple. My first time walking into the resturant, the chef greeted me like he knew me his entire life. The server, his wife, spent about 5 minutes getting to know me, which was so sweet. The food is amazing and the customer service is amazing. It's definitely worth the wait. I recommend this place to everyone!
