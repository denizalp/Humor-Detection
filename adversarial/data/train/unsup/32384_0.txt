My husband went here for his exam in September, and let me tell you. If he didn't post a review I was going to. this place is Fantastic! The doctor is extremely thorough and the staff is so sweet. I love the girl with the short hair, she made the expierence of picking out his first pair of frames extremely comfortable and very informational. The young man at the front desk was extremely polite. it is safe to say our family will be back again.
