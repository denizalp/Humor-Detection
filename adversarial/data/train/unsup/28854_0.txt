So I should have ordered the fajitas.  They look and smell amazing.  I work graveyard and I was craving my standard a chimichanga.  But I thought I would throw caution to the wind and also order a fish taco.  \nSo I have never been here before and I show up at 1pm and I am seated in the bar.  Holy cow, if I knew that the chips and salsa and beans and grilled onions and peppers were showing up I would have NEVER ordered so much food.  Either way.......\nMy chimichanga was served with some kind of red sauce on it.  Not like advertised which said it would be served with guacamole and sour cream.  I really did not care for it.  My fish taco was right next to this red sauce drenched chimi, so I couldn't even pick up the taco.  The fish was blah and semi cold.  I was not impressed.   My service was impeccable.  I will be back to give it a second chance.
