Stopped by for a quick bite to eat in the afternoon. The food, simply put, was not good, with typical Burger King problems: flavorless fries, bland nuggets, etc. the onion rings were the only good thing. As for the dining area, I didn't mind that it looked like it hadn't been updated since 1992. There were no ketchup dispensers so I had to get a couple packets at a time from behind the register every 3 minutes. Half of the buttons on the pop machine didn't work, some labels were lazily taped on, and it was literally falling apart: pieces were just hanging off, and when they went to clean it, a piece fell off. The staff was nice enough, buy the manager Tracy was not nice to the rest of the staff. She even got a bee up her butt because there was water on the pop counter near the grate (gasp!). So who did she blame for it? The new girl, who was working behind the register! I hadn't been to Burger King in a long time just because of the cruddy food, but now I have even more reasons not to go.
