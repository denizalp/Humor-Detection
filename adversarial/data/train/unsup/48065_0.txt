The chocolate chip pancakes were delicious! The edges were crispy and they were full of mini chocolate chips. The alarm clock frozen coffee was very good and I was glad they had almond milk as a dairy free option, as I am lactose intolerant. My boyfriend had the mango strawberry smoothie and loved it too!
