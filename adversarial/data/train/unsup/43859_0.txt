This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas. It is cozy, off the strip, and has food like mama used to make! Entr√©es are reasonably priced and come with pasta or salad and garlic bread. My personal favorite is the eggplant, but lasagna runs a close second! And you can't go wrong with the cannolis.  The service is quick, the staff is wonderfully friendly and it's a great place to enjoy a casual dinner.
