I have taken all my 4 dogs to Dr. McComb who is very knowledgeable and works with you as far as price and times you can take your pets in. The staff is very nice and helpful every time we have our appointments. There is no other place I would have my pets.  \nWe are now seeing Dr. O and she is fantastic as well.  I highly recommend Crossroads Veterinary to anyone.
