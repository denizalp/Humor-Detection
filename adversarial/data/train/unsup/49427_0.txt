Tonight was our first visit to Tender. \n\nOur order was as follows:\n\nMyself: organic grain fed rib eye, exotic mushroom soup, fried potato wedges and a margarita. \n\nMy husband: new york strip, green salad, short beef ravioli and a glass of pinot. \n\nWe shared the sampler trio for dessert. \n\nOur wait staff consisted of Emilio and another gentleman (I forget his name). \n\nOur total was $190, we used the $75 mlife credit.\n\nI don't see how anyone can say a bad thing about this place. We never felt rushed to order or to eat. Excellent service and amazing food.
