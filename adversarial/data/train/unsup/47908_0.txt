thought I could use my groupon but it was only valid for Tapas Wednesdays.   Nevertheless, we had already walked the few blocks and decided to check the place out.\nNice ambience, wine bottles lining the walls, the bench seating running along the wall was high, which was good coz I'm petite.   The a\/c was running well which was a relief from walking outside in the late summer heat.\nThe Portuga white wine was refreshing.  Now, I'm not a wine connoisseur but this wine was crisp, clean and like I said, refreshing.  I had 2 glasses, it was hitting the right spot.\n\nOrdered the brie in puff pastry with raspberry jam inside - the jam was in the middle so didn't get to taste it in the first bite.  puff pasty was flaky good.  I think it could've used a tab more brie in there.  It was like a teaser.\n\ntheir blackberry panini was ok.  It was a bit dry, I thought.  Maybe it was the combination of the filling with the panini, or not enough filling.  The panini with whipped butter and jam would be very good but as a sandwich, it didn't work for me.  The side salad of spinach (included with sandwich) was good - I like feta cheese and spinach so they got me there.\n\nThe definite winner was the pizza with chorizo, manchego and mozzarella.  You can taste the chorizo on the cheese.  it was like the chorizo I had in a Barcelona tapas bar, yum!. The dough was thin and just right.   If anything, I'd come back for that.\n\nGot to sample their margherita pizza also.  That was good, the roasted roma tomato complemented the dough and cheese.  \n\nOwner mentioned some off menu items (something with Maximus in its name) which we would have to come back for, when it's not busy (that would be around 1ish).
