I loved the decor, the bar, the sweet bartenders (most of whom exemplified the name of the place if you know what I mean), and even though they got my order wrong at first, they fixed it quickly and petite filet was melt-in-your-mouth.  The hand cut fries were popular in our group, as were the miso black cod lettuce cups. Wine list was no more overpriced than everywhere else in Vegas. \n\nFun enough for a birthday party (of which there were three when we were there) and austere enough for a client dinner.
