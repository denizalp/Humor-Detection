I am obsessed with eggs. I can have it anytime of day. And I especially love ANY hot sauce with my eggs. Unfortunately, this place doesn't even have it as an option. Like, nothing. \n\nA little too confident\/cocky with their recipes if they don't want to accommodate customers' personal preferences. Kinda rude. \n\nNot impressed. Sorry.
