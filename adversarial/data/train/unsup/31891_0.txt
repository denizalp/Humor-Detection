Really really good! We got the deviled eggs for appetizers. The salmon roe and smoked paprika really give them a unique flavor to make them stand out from your ordinary deviled eggs. For our  brunch entrees we split the Fried Green Tomato BLT and the Chicken 'N' Waffles 'N' Watermelon. The chicken was cooked perfectly being juicy inside and crispy on the outside. We also had the Bloody Mary's and a Southern Revival. I'm so glad we stopped here during our stay in LV.
