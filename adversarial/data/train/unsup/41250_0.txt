Very interesting! I've tried korean\/mexican fusion but this is my first time trying chinese\/mexican fusion and I LIKE it! =D\n\nGot the combo plate with Hengrenade Chicken, Machaca, Black Beans and white rice....the Hengrenade Chicken was really kicking my butt! The spiciness doesn't kick u in the mouth until a few minutes later after swallowing it. Nonetheless it was very delicious..I didn't get anything that was Chinese but my bf did order the Carnitas, Jade Red Chicken, Black Beans and plain fried rice combo...the Jade Red Chicken was really good. So for a combo of two things and the choice of rice and beans is $7.25....it doesn't come with a drink but it does come with a delicious snickerdoodle cookie! \n\nNeedless to say we both enjoyed our yummy lunch here today. The only thing was I got a cup for water but I didn't drink the water because it was tainted with something pink....and I was a bit afraid of drinking it...=\/ It's not a true hole in the wall restaurant so it was pretty spacious and clean. \n\nWill definitely come back!
