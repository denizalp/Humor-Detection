This place should be called ravi soups and wraps. The wraps are juicy and flavourful and dare I say more amazing than the soup. I personally am not a soup person, I'd pick something solid over liquid. I've tried the curried apricot soup, chicken hot pot broth, some sort of squash soup, and corn chowder. The apricot soup is my favourite so far followed by chicken hot pot and corn chowder being my least favourite. I definitely recommend this place to anybody visiting Toronto, if not for the soups then the wraps.
