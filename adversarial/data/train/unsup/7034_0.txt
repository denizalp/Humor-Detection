We had friends come in from out-of- town who wanted to see the historic homes in the Fourth Ward via a carriage ride so we decided on Sunday brunch at Halcyon. The decor is just beautiful, tables made out of cross-sectioned tree trunks, lights flooding the room from the huge windows. It made a beautiful day even better. \n\nI ordered the kale salad with salmon, it was delicious.  My husband had the shrimp and chickpea salad and he loved it. And our out-of-town friends got the house roasted turkey sandwich which they loved and told the server that they need to call it something else because the menu description doesn't do it justice.\n\nThe service was attentive and everyone was friendly.  I don't know if it was an off day but it was a light crowd for the Charlotte brunch set.  All in all, it was great and we will return!
