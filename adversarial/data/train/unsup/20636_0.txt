Several years ago I had a renter who is Phillipino. Every so often, they cook Lumpia (phillipine verson of Chinese egg roll). It is home make style, it is dee -liceous. Since they move out, I sure missed Lumpia.\n\nThree months ago, I by chance saw the sign 'LUMPIA factory', My mouth begin to watering. My thought was could it be my former renter?. I step inside, nop, they were phillipino...but not my former renter. I order several 'LUMPIA' it is just as good.
