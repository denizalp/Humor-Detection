With all of the nice lighting and the music blaring, this seems like a cool enough place to chill and smoke. The list of flavors is tremendous, and the place is always crowded. This shows all the signs of a place to become a regular.\n\nThe pieces themselves are pretty nice, and they use wood-fired coals (great!). Too bad the coals are way too huge and they will always, ALWAYS burn your bowl. Like, they know how to prepare a good hookah, and mix the right flavors, but 20 minutes into it it will always scorch. I partially blame cheap shisha (Note to hookah bars: Al Fahker or Deja Vu should be your standard shishas), but a skilled nargile craftsman will know how to keep it smooth from start to finish.\n\nOh, and that music gets downright BLARING some times. Having to yell to the person next to you isn't fun. I'd forgive it if the environment was fun, but it's not. There are many individual seats instead of couches, and stuff is often spread apart creating an experience less social than it should be.\n\nThe clientele also looks like a bunch of faux-gangster douchebags, but I can't fault Casablanca for that. It's not a BAD place by any means, but for $15 a hookah there are better places you can go.
