We love them. My husband has purchased earrings, a couple watches, a ring and a ring upgrade.  We have been in for multiple cleanings, watch fittings and i even had my heirloom ring repaired there. Every single person we have dealt with has been pleasant and professional.  We have NEVER been pushed to make a purchase. We have been treated the same way for purchases big or small.  I just love love love HOLLY --- but everyone is great there.\n\nI have to add this: i have observed some walk in customers who seemed a bit grimey but they received just the same treatment that we do.
