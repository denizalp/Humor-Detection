Went here for a happy hour and it was a good local choice if you are looking for something convenient to Solon area and aren't looking to spend too much $$.  The appetizer portions were lower priced but definitely smaller.  Drink menu was actually decently diverse beyond beer.  Ordered dinner as well, while bummed that they didn't have veggie burger substitution option, I enjoyed the veggie quesadilla.
