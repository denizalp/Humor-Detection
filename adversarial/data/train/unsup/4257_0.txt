Ok, I've been attending bikefest for 7 years now. I'm thinking this will be my last year. Although it takes place in town, I feel it's no longer worth the trip. It seems as if every new bikefest is nothing more than a recycled version of the previous year.  \n\n   Every year it's the same welcome party, same bike show, same poker runs, same vendors peddling their crappy wares.  Every year there is some guy who had a beer keg chrome plated, and he's trying to sell you chrome polish.....as if he actually shined up an aluminum keg!  \n\n   This year they raised the prices for everything, including the admission to cashman field, just to see that chrome polish salesman. There seemed to be quite a few less booths and tents at cashman this year, too.\n\n  They really need to step up their game and come up with a more original events, instead of just rehashing the old ones.  The only thing worthwhile at bikefest is the wet t-shirt contest at LVHD.  I think I'll just wait for Laughlin.
