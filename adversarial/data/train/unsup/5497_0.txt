W O W .  \nI was privy to have the opportunity to check out the Skylofts.  My friend and her family were in town and stayed in one of these babies... and oh, may I say... F A N C Y ! ! !  \n\nDO:\n-enjoy the views... it's extravagant!  It's TWO floors! \n-know that it's like a party in the lobby!  Dim lighting & lounge-y beats... \n-munch on the candied almonds & fancy chocolates.  They look like plastic, but surprise... it's edible!\n-be warned that the lighting remotes are a bit annoying.  You'll see...\n-take advantage of all the amenities!  ...mos definitely worth it! \n\nDON'T:\n-hate that you have to shuffle through the MGM crowd to get to the lobby.  There isn't a separate entrance to the Skylofts.  :-(\n-hate that there is no kitchen, microwave, or refrigerator (at least not in the 1-br.)\n-forget that you can get limo service back to the airport! \n\nSERVICE:  ***** [got a butler?  oh yeah...]\nAMBIANCE:  ***** [This is LUXURY! ]\nPRICE:  [I didn't pay]\nOVERALL:  ***** [5-stars top notch!]  \n\nNuff said.
