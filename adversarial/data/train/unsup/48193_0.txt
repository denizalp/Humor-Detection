After having an issue with the parts department, in the end they came through.  They apoligized for the delay of what I had ordered and the communication of not keeping me informed.  They received the item and gave it to me free as a good gesture to make things right.  I appreciate what they did and they should be held in high regards for satisfying it's customers.
