This place is close to my house so I go here often but I also like the service. It's my go to place on a Sunday after church. A nice pedicure while sipping wine and getting a massage courtesy of those amazing massage chairs. The pricing is comparable to other nail places in the area. \n\nThe eyebrow waxing by this one middle aged lady (that rarely smiles but she is super cool) is on point. I'll have to get her name and update the review.
