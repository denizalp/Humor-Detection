My analysis of the myriad of glowing five star reviews:\nA.) This place is the default \"most expensive food in Vegas\" so I think it attracts people who aren't accomplished in much other then spending cash.\nB.) When you drop 500-1200 a person on dinner it is really hard to admit that the food and experience is less the five stars.\n\nI have enjoyed opportunities to dine at some really swanky places with prices that do command a healthy cash flow.  Joel Robuchon was by far the most overrated, unimpressive, and exorbitantly expensive meal I have ever indulged.  \n\nI guarantee if you are dropping the cash on this experience your are likely not staying at the MGM where the restaurant is located.  The MGM Grand?  Come on folks....  The place is like a goddamn amusement park and holds ranks and class with the likes of the fabulous Luxor and New York New York.  So they pick you up at your far more modern and luxurious hotel in a funky ass, old, skankafied beige limo that says \"MGM Grand on the side.\"  Right on!  \n\nLike everyone gushes, you are rolled up to some ally entrance in the back of the hotel and are ushered in to an impressive hotel that you will NOT be staying at anytime soon.  Personally, if I was dropping 5K a night to stay at this private hotel, I would be pissed off that they shuttle some two bit strip dwellers through my private space so they can ooh and ahh while strutting through.  The whole entrance thing is complete theater, at the end of your tour you are dumped out into the reality of the MGM's casino floor area.  The hotel is old, and dumpy.  \n\nThe restaurant design is classic stuffy french with a large helping of schizophrenic circus flare.  Don't be put off if the hostess, captain, and most all the wait staff put on a strange stuffiness that is not warm, nor is it directly dismissive.  It is the perfect balance of cocky that makes most general, submissive diners feel they have been blessed with the opportunity to dine.  \n\nThe bread cart is a complete exhibition and a method to fill patrons up on inexpensive bread.  You won't find warm, fresh bread.  Just a bunch of gimmicky ass, stale, cold pieces of herb, cheese, and bacon bread.\n\nI ordered the full tasting menu.  In asking my options with the Sommelier, I was offered the option of three tasting costs.  Never have I been offered the option to choose my wine pairing based on cost levels.  To top it off, the price levels were some bullshit like $299, $599, or $999.  Let's just say, 300, 600, or 1000 for christ sake.\n\nI went with the most \"modestly priced\" wine pairing and I was blown away with the swill they poured me. \n\nThe food was interesting, it was prepared well, some items were delicious however most of the 16 were just uninspired combinations of expensive ingredients.  An example was a piece of cold asparagus, cut down the middle stuffed with beluga..  Yay!  Most dishes that should have come out hot or at least warm, came out cold.  Pretty, but cold.\n \nDessert was ridiculously long winded, as they felt the need to review two dozen little candies on yet another cart.  \n\nMy share was $900.00 and I left with a huge chip on my shoulder.  Never again.
