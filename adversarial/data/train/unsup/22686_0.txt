Good Vietnamese fare, good value!\n\nRecommended!\n\nMy friends and I wanted to find a new place for lunch today, and a quick Yelp search turned up Max Saigon. Given the positive reviews, we agreed to give it a try - and we were glad we did!\n\nFood:\nWe were all very happy with our food! I ordered the Chicken Curry with Bread (N10) and a hot tea. The curry flavor was good, and not too spicy. In fact, I added a bit of chili sauce (which you can ask your server for) to kick it up a notch. The bread was fresh, and a nice change from rice or noodles. The curry was loaded with dark meat chicken, which was tender and flavorful. It also had a few potatoes and carrots. The only issue was the tea was only lukewarm - not hot at all. The refill was somewhat better, but still not what I consider \"hot\".\n\nMy friends ordered the Crispy\/Softly Pan Fried Egg Noodles with Seafood (N16), and the Pho Fillet, Beef Ball (P5). As with the curry, the dishes were very good, with ample portions.\n\nCost:\nThe cost was reasonable. My Chicken Curry was only $6.95, and the tea was $1. Considering the portion size and free refills of the tea, this was great value!\n\nService: \nThe staff was attentive and came by to check on us a couple times to refill drinks, etc. Our food was served at different times ranging from 9 to 23 minutes after we ordered. It would have been nice to get everything at once, but the wait wasn't terribly long.\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe place is quite spartan inside. We sat at a booth, which was comfortable. Still, come here for the food, not the atmosphere!\n\nOverall:\nThe food was great, and they have lots of interesting items on the menu. We all agreed, we will be back!
