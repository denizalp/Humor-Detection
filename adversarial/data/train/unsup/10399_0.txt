Copper Blues is one of my favorite downtown bars!  I usually come here if I'm going to Stand Up Live to see a comedian.  They offer a great selection of beers at a very good price.  We come early for the great Happy Hour with drink and appetizer specials.   We also have come after a show and there has always been good live music!  The waitresses are usually very friendly and offer great service.  \n\nOver all, I love this place and think its a very cool place to hang out with friends!
