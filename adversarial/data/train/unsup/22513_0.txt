Let me start off by saying we went on a Sunday for lunch the place was busy over 50% full so food was turning over quickly and we eat Chinese at least 1-2 time per week. Hot and sour soup was all sour no hot at all. The sweet and sour chicken was overly breaded and very hard. The fried rice was dry some was so hard had to spit it out. The orange chicken was not good didn't taste like any ones orange chicken I've ever had. Honey chicken was good though their cream puffs that you buy from Costco were nasty tasted very stale (I normally love these) the strawberries didn't look or taste fresh at all they were soft my 2yr old didn't even want to eat it. The waiter\/ waitress were nice had a hard time asking and them understanding water light ice and a lemon. \n\nAll in all this is the first and the last time I will go to this restaurant I'd I could have I would have given it a 0 yes zero stars. \n\nGlad my mother in law paid for lunch is all I got to say
