We watch diners drive in and dives and had to hit this place. As we're waiting, the plates coming out of the kitchen were huge. We were lucky enough to sit at the outside rail for people watching purposes. Service is a bit slow due to the fact they're crazy busy. The food was amazing. Macaroni bacon cheeseburger was awesome. My wife ordered the beef supper. This was also huge and full of flavor. Great food experience.
