stayed here this past weekend and was overall left with a great impression. would book again if looking for a cheap yet nice room to stay at :)\n\nPROS:\n-spacious!!! felt very nice and big for the amount of people in the room\n-kitchen, washer\/dryer, hot tub, pull out bed, strong shower pressure (so important to me)\n-GREAT staff! so friendly!!!! every time we walk in we are greeted by the staff at the desk, i ordered in the cafe and was in the middle of doing my hair and forgot my id for my credit card payment and she said she could call me when the food is ready and i can pay then and finish getting ready, and last encounter was when we were leaving and saying bye to the friends left in the room and the room service woman shouted bye from down the hall and that left me with a smile on my face and prompted this urgent post :)\n-lots of free, close parking\n-cafe open til 10pm!! priced very reasonably (not that overpriced vegas stuff)\n\nCONS:\n-many uber drivers get confused on the location (even myself when trying to find the hotel) and most go to other Hilton Grand Vacations so make sure if you uber or are telling friends to meet you pin your location or tell them its on Paradise\n-not the vegas vibe (we joked its for the old folks) but once you get past that its a nice getaway from the strip to relax
