Seriously the best place ever. This is all gluten free, but trust me it's better than any gluten filled brunch you'll ever have. Specials are great, always new treats to try, and great coffee. Best part is it's locally owned. I've watched these ladies hustle their way from farmers market to brick and mortar and I couldn't be happier to see this place succeeding. I don't even know what of recommend for someone to try because everything I've eaten here has been incredible.
