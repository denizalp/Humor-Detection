I like ordering from jade garden.  It's cheap, it's fast, it's open late, and they peanut chicken.... having said that it is by no means high end chinese and there  buffet, though well priced was unwhelming both in offering and food quality.  \nHaving said that... I'll likely be back.  It's cheap and they have peanut chicken.
