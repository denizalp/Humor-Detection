I looked very much forward to sampling offerings here, but the visit itself yielded mixed results.  \n\nThe ambiance was colorful, loud, lively, and bright--until lights were seriously dimmed for the night service. French Onion Soup was only okay, with a minimal amount of cheese and broth that tasted like Lipton's boxed onion soup.  To the contrary, the three meatballs covered with Marinara Sauce were very good as a featured appetizer, and Diane's trio of Fred Macaroni & Cheese Pops were nicely filled with gooey Mac 'n Cheese.  The Tomato Soup that accompanied her Grilled Cheese Sandwich was also creamy and delicious, although the sandwich itself stuck to the bread, was too dry, and the two slices were clumsily and unevenly joined.\n\nWhile the soups and appetizers came out quickly, there was over a 45-minute wait for our entrees.  My party of three sat and sat while we watched other diners be seated after us, receive all of their food, and leave.  Our server said that our entrees would be coming shortly, but never admitted that a snafu had occurred in the kitchen.  This was very evident when I was presented with a bill for double what we had ordered in salads and Grilled Cheese Sandwiches.  This was promptly corrected by our server, who then acknowledged that our entree orders were rung up twice (for unknown reasons).  At least the Chicken Salad with Ginger Dressing was abundant, moist, and very good; the hand-cut French Fries excellent; and my sip of Diane's Chocolate Cookie Jar Insane Milkshake through a thick green straw, with the taste of caramel coming through the chocolate, simply outstanding.
