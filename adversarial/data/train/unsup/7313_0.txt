What an awkward little mall. \n\nKaraoke, Dim Sum restaurants, odds and ends shops I don't get, and of course a Dairy Queen make up this bizarre bazaar of Chinese tricks. \n\nI'm not one of those people that hates Chinatown. In fact, I love buying party odds and ends, vegetables and blindly ordering snails off of menus while indulging in cold tea. But this mall is like a sterile insane asylum lined with stores that just don't. make. sense. \n\nPEPPER'S PISSED at the mailman. When a package is missed it's sent to the basement of this place.
