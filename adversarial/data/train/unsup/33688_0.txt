Sanitizing guide lines are not met. I watched my nail tech take dirty tools from previous clients pedicure chair,  rinse under water then put back in her drawer. When I said those are dirty she dipped them in barbicide for one second and immediately tried to use them on me (barbicide does kill blood born pathogens but must be soaked then rinsed as it's bad for your skin) when I asked her again if she had clean tools she said it's fine and I walked out. \n\nIt was my birthday and my boyfriend bought me a gift cert that I was trying to use so I brought it back in and the manager said she \"doesn't know what's wrong with me\" and said they wouldn't refund me. \n\nTerrible customer service and Very very dirty . The whole shop is a hot mess.
