What did I just walk in to?  \n\nI have never seen so much camo in my life.  I think I've seen enough to last me a lifetime.\n\nWhile this may not be my cup of tea, I do appreciate the grandeur for people who are into this sort of thing.  It's like a Disneyland for gun-fishing-hunting aficionados.         \n\nWhile I was there \"touring\" this place while awaiting my table at Cracker Barrel, I encountered the NRA booth near the gun cases.  Holy cow!  Walking this place sure feels like I've been warped into another part of AmeriCUH.
