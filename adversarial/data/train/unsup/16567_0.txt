I've been meaning to downgrade my two original glowing reviews for some time now and just haven't had the heart\/time to do it. I've been back to Pan Asia probably 3-4 times and each time I feel like I'm climbing up a hill that's getting progressively muddier. And no one at Pan Asia seems to throw me a lifeline, or even notice that I (they?) are slipping BIG-TIME. \n\nSushi fish that used to be fresh no longer is, Chinese food that used to be a few steps up from take out is now barely passable (the fried rice is notably disgusting), drinks now take forever to be delivered, the gap between the sushi and Chinese delivery has grown into a chasm and worst of all, the service is schizo and un-apologetically so. I shouldn't have to make it look like I'm going to walk out without paying to get someone to come to my table. \n\nPan Asia owners\/managers, this is my advice to you: Stop focusing on creating a thousand different confusing specials (Who can keep track of things like \"Chinese is 30% if you come between 5:15 and 5:30 but only if you take it to go after purchasing a drink at the bar\"?!) and trying to be everything to everyone and go back to your roots. Produce quality sushi and hot entrees that are well-timed and focus on giving great service, and then people like us (who actually are willing to pay full price for food) won't be so damn turned off.
