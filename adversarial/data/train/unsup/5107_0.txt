And then there were three. It's awesome to see an empire in the making. I've been to VDN's stores on Eastern Av. and Flamingo and recently visited their newest on Decatur. I like to work out at the different LVAC's and there's a VDN close to each one. This new one has the same unbelievable selection and amazing customer service as the first two. They need to hire a few women, though. It's like a sausage-fest in there. :)
