Staff was friendly and service was quick. Only one of the registers was working. Ordered the small spaghetti and it was the biggest ripoff. $4 for a little bowl of unsalted, watery, old noodles with a spoon of sour tomato sauce on top. Got a stomach ache before I could get back to my room upstairs.
