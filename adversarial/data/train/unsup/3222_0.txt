I loved Zarkana! The only other Cirque show I watched was O and that was fabulous--so I feel like i have something great to compare Zarkana to. \n\nI was blown away by the set design...some of the decor reminded me Wicked's set for some reason. Bottom line: it's a beautiful show to watch. \n\nThere is supposedly a story line, but it gets lost amongst the set design and the acrobatics. And there is some operatic-type singing but again unless you understand the language, it won't really matter. The performers are great at what they do--some of the segments are better than others of course. But they were thrilling as any Cirque show should be. \n\nOne thing that seemed unique to this show is the lady that did sand-art with just her hands--it sounds lame, but it's so cool when you see it in person.  \n\nI normally don't go for slapstick comedy but the distractions that the clowns provide intermittently throughout the show were actually welcome--and surprisingly funny.\n\nGood way to spend a couple of hours in Vegas--and best thing of all, they let you take drinks into the show. Be careful how much your drink because there isn't an intermission--and you don't want to miss any part of this show.
