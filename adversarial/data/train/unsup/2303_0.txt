I know people had very high hopes for this restaurant at Pearson Airport, but I do want to point out, it's in an airport. If it's better than a $22 cold chicken salad sandwich, shouldn't we rejoice? \n\nThis place is A-OK by me, and if I need to grab an entire meal in Terminal 1 Domestic again anytime soon, I'll be returning to Twist. \n\nI had their pasta with prosciutto with a sauteed spinach side, and it was great. My husband's lamburger was decent and our bloody caesars hit the spot. The entire thing came to $75 which was a bit of a bummer, but again I remind myself...\n\nTwist is in an airport.
