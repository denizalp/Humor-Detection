As a local, I come here pretty regularly for the movie theater, restaurants, and sportsbook. Location is convenient, and this is one of the more family-friendly options. Unlike other off-Strip spots, this one is good about ventilation, and there isn't much of a smoke build-up.\n\nWe recently had a staycation here for a three day weekend and the rooms were nicer than expected. Beds were cushy, decor was modern, bathrooms are huge, come during the summer to take advantage of pool access or you'll be even more irked about the resort fee.\n\nWould stay here again and will continue to visit for dining and entertainment. That said, I'm looking forward to how the recent ownership change will affect pricing, amenities, and service- perhaps they can staff more than one guy for check-ins after 8PM, there seemed to be a line every single evening!
