Went back to Babu for cheap dinner options.. Sometimes you just want to veg out at home and eat in your PJ.\n\nGot the Half Meal ($4.50) taxes in!! Yes the receipt said they pay the tax for us :).\n\nButtery Chicken with rice and veggie.\n\nThe Buttery Chicken so nice and spicy! Hmmmm Yummmm When I said spicy, trust me is spicy! :) \n\nThe rice is the long grain rice, a little harder than the usual Chinese rice I have.. but I have to say it is perfect with the sauce!\n\nBTW, why not 5 Star... My server was not too friendly, not too interested in my order..and just want to try to get rid of me! Not even a thank you or a smile...\n\nBut I will still be back just for the food!
