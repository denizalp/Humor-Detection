Wow their monster pizza is just that it is a MONSTER! It's ginormous! Definitely something fun to order for a super bowl party or get together of friends. The pizza was pretty good. They didn't skimp on the toppings which is nice but it wasn't my favorite. The crust was a little soggy for my liking and they put the brocolli stems as a topping as  well. Usually you have just the florets but they chopped up the stems and put them on their like soggy bell pepper. Kind of weird. \n\nWe also ordered fried mozzarella sticks which were okay, they tasted like the frozen kind you buy at the grocery store. The fried mushrooms weren't very good, half were overcooked\/burnt. The potato skins were dried out and lacked flavor. I did enjoy the Italian wedding soup though. It has good flavor and tons of pasta and meatballs. \n\nProbably wouldn't order delivery from them again considering that the only thing I enjoyed was the soup.
