Wow is this place a slice of my childhood! I remember coming here with my grandmother as a small child and she would tote behind her one of those two wheel shopping carts. \n\nIn many ways this place has not changed since that time. You can find all sorts of ethnic food varieties and tons of homemade sausage and other meat products. Nowadays there are also Asian stores and other ethnic varieties although when I was a child it was limited to mostly Slavic type of food. And some Italian. There's a great selection of fresh fruits and vegetables and they have enclosed the fruits and vegetables area now so you don't freeze in the winter.\n\nThey have a great little middle eastern place that serves a fantastic falafel sandwich in the back corner. \n\nSome of the best sausage I have ever had comes from this market and I make a point to head up there every year with a cooler that I bring home with as much sausage as I can stuff in there and freeze. \n\nYou can get homemade pierogies, all sorts of different pastries, and just about anything you want including lots of hometown hot sauce.\n\nSometimes parking is a challenge.  The city has put a couple pay lots in to alleviate that issue. The neighborhood has also come around with a lot of cool little bars and restaurants so you can make your visit into a whole day trip. \n\nIf you're into that sort of thing the downtown Cleveland Casino is just a five minute drive. \n\nThis place is a can't miss for Cleveland visitors.
