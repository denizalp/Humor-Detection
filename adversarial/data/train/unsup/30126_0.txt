Not impressed. Ordered the patty melt and fries for lunch. Food arrived in less than 10 minutes, so I have no idea why fries weren't piping hot and instead, barely warm. Patty melt cheese wasn't melted. Pretty bland sandwich. Served with 1000 island dressing (no, it wasn't a reuban ).  Generous wine pour though. Sat on patio around 12:30. Crowd was light.
