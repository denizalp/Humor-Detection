I found a coackroach in my pho.  It was a tiny roach maybe the size of a penny coin.\n\nThe owner was really apologetic about the cockroach.  He waived our bill for our party of 7.  He apologized repeatedly about it.\n\nI wasn't upset at him nor the restaurant.  I know it was an accident and they didn't want it to happen.\n\nI'm kinda scared what is in the kitchen tho.
