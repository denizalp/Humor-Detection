Key Features: The Option...\n\nSo here's the deal - everyone says this is the best burger in the city.  And it's a tasty burger.  It is.  There's no denying how tasty it is.  And, when they put \"the option\" on top, well - that's a little something special as well.  \n\nWhat is this option?  It's a giant mushroom, stuffed with cheese, deep fried.  Sounds good right?  But to get it on your burger - you're looking at ten dollars.  Ten dollars!\n\nYou just made the trek all the way out the east end of Toronto.  Some might argue, they should be paying you for taking the trip - but, no, the East End is growing, and - so - why shouldn't it have a lovely little burger joint?  \n\nIf you charged me ten bucks for a burger, I'd sit there - I'd eat it.  I'd like it.\n\nBut the thing is, you can't sit there.  You just can't.  Eating inside is not allowed.  And there's nowhere around to go.  So, either you spend twenty minutes walking to the beach, and eating it there - by which time your burger is cold.  Or, you sit in the KFC parking lot, and scarf down your meat-wich.  \n\nThis aspect?  It's not ideal.  \n\nSure, the burger's good.  It's really tasty.  On its own, there's no reason not to love it.  The option makes it a flavour treat you can't get anywhere else.  But - the price?  That takes it down a peg.  The inability to actually enjoy your meal, due to seeking a place to eat it?  That takes it down a peg.  \n\nGo there once, say you've done it, and appreciate the experience.  If you have a friend with a car - trick them into taking you back.  After all, that burger tastes a lot better sitting in the passenger seat, than it does sitting, cold, on the curb.\n\nBut, if you're looking for a good meal, well - there are probably better... options... out there.\n\nOhh - and it should be noted, one ten dollar burger probably won't fill you. So, that's strike three, I guess.
