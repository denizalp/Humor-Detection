My mom never made food for us that SHE didn't like, so I grew up through a childhood without chili, Mexican food and biscuits & gravy. Sickening, right? Once I grew up old enough to buy my own food, I realized how much she truly deprived me. First off, Mexican food is my all time favorite, so it really is a crying shame that she did that to me. Secondly, due to my sheltered past the only kind of biscuits and gravy I've ever had is Grands biscuits with gravy from the grocery store. I never realized how life changing homemade biscuits and gravy can really be. Bluebird Kitchen has the absolute best ever--unless your mom made them for you homemade, then you might not think they are the \"absolute best\" but you can't dispute that they are darn good.\n\nThe biscuits were flaky and had just the right amount of crunch to go perfectly with the gravy. The gravy had homemade sausage in it and was lick the plate good. I also had the fried egg sandwich with homemade sausage. That was really delicious too. The best part of Bluebird Kitchen is the fact that everything is locally made and that they use quality ingredients.\n\nOnly downside was that it was a little slow but keep in mind they are making everything fresh for you -- it hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp for an hour. We weren't in a hurry though, so I'm not docking them any stars. There was a girl that decided to cancel her order because she was in a hurry and didn't have time to wait.\n\nService is always #1 to me and there was the nicest guy working the counter. He apologized to us for the long wait and was very pleasant. \n\nThis is another spot that I have Yelp to thank for leading me there!
