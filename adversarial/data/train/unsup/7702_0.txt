I have had my haircut here once before.  Above average job.   I would have continued coming here as I just moved around the block from their shop, BUT....   \n\n2 problems \n\n1- I think it's rude when 2 people speak another language in front of you.  Switch back and forth between English when they want you to understand them and conversely when they don't.\n\nI speak other languages as well.  But it's bad manners to exclude the people that are right next to you entirely while they stare into space wondering why they talk in another language as your looking at them.\n\nI could get past this.  They are young and a tad  immature.  We all were at one point.\n\n\nBUT....\n\n#2 I called yesterday and asked \" Hi how are you\"?  \n\n\"Fine\"\n\n\"Are you busy now or is it good time to come by\"?\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Ok thanks I'll see you soon\" CLICK!!!  I had been cut off and hung up on after the one word answers.\n\nWTF?!\n\nAt the end of the day there are a ton of places to go.  Not paying someone who is going to be consistently rude to their customers.\n\nY'all failed.  \n\nNo matter how well you cut hair you need to up your manners game.
