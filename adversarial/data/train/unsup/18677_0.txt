I have been coming to Dr Don for almost 5 years now. From valeting and working in a nightclub. My back is always tight, sore, basically in pain. \n\nDr Don always is able to adjust it and loosen it up so I am able to function. And the neck adjustment, as sick as it may sound, feels good when it cracks. \n\nThe staff is all great and very nice. It is the best feeling when you go somewhere and they remember you every time. Not just me, but you can hear them make small talk to other customers too. They ask about work and family and care about how you are away from the office. \n\nI've referred plenty of people there and I will not stop doing so. \n\nPlus a nice extra is Dr Don is a Dodgers and Lakers fan, so it's nice to talk about sports when being cracked and stretched.
