So today is my birthday. I pulled up to the stop at the LV South transit center with a few minutes to spare before my departure time on my way to get on this bus (or so I thought) to LA to see my family now that schools out. I was mistaken and started off my birthday with a wave goodbye from the driver. May as well have been a middle finger. I admit I should have been earlier but I along with other passengers pulled up to a confusing transit station and both got left together earlier than we would have ever thought. I may be wrong, but if a departure time is at 9:45 and your wheels are rolling at 9:43, problems arise. Thanks for nothing bolt bus. I'll wave right back at you next time..
