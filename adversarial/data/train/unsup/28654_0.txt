Michael Cordova and his associates handled my case like true professionals. They addressed my concerns and did a great job communicating the pros and cons of my case. Although there were cons, there was always a concrete plan of action to move through them. \n\nI liked how Michael planned out the case and executed on what was promised. It was not a painful experience, like I expected. If you're looking for one of the good guys, then it is definitely these guys. They performed up to my expectations and ended up winning my case. \n\nBravo!
