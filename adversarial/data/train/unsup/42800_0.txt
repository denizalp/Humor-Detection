I haven't had this in a while so I can't really give a ton of detail but I have been here a few times. It's a traditional japanese restaurant and from what I remember the food was decently priced maybe a little more expensive for dinner than other places. The thing I remember about this place that I really liked were the lunch bento boxes. They had a ton of food and miso soup and all that and they were a great deal, I don't know how much they were but it was very cheap for what you get. The service is only average but for a cheap lunch with more traditional sushi I would definitely hit this place up.
