I had never stayed at this hotel, but chose to on my most recent trip to Vegas because, in my experience, rooms that didn't cost much were dirty and smelled like cigarettes. So, I decided to spring for the more expensive hotel with the hopes that I would have a 5-star experience.\nI was checked in and upon arrival in my room, I promptly found peanuts on the floor. I called guest services and asked if this room really was clean, as the peanuts were obvious. They said housekeeping would immediately come take care of it. After about an hour, housekeeping came and vacuumed up the peanuts. Right as soon as she left, I spotted a condom wrapper sticking out from under the bed. I was disgusted. Look, I know that it is Vegas and lots of things happen in these rooms....but remember, I was paying more because I wanted top service and no evidence left behind of other people's sexual encounters in the room. I immediately contacted Marriott customer care, who said the GM would contact me. Never did.\nI checked out yesterday. I left at 4:30am and got my car out of Valet. It was early and I was tired, so I didn't check my car out before leaving. I guess I should have. Once I was about half way home and it was light out, I noticed that the panel underneath the glove box was ripped down, gum was on my passenger side floor mat, and cigarette ashes were in my center console. My car is 6 months old, and I do not smoke. NOBODY is allowed to smoke in my car. Since I had left the property, I just knew that they would not take responsibility for this.\nSo, with an $800 price tag for three nights, I got a condom wrapper, peanuts, damage to my car, and someone smoking in it. I will be contacting Marriott customer care repeatedly until SOMEONE takes responsibility for this. I took pictures of it all, so we will see.
