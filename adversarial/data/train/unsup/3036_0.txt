This place has some issues to work out. Walking in the smell of sewage was overwhelming. Everyone I was with decided to just walk out and eat somewhere else. The smell was so bad it made my stomach feel sick. The employees opened the door and made waiving motions trying to get the stench out. Something that smells that bad needs more attention over a open door. The employees were laughing and seemed to find it funny. One of them also had a hat but no hair net and kept tugging at her hair and rubbing her nose.
