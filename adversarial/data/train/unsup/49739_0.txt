Sushi as good as anywhere - save for Sushi Yasuda in NYC.\nThe high volume of product that moves through this place ensures freshness. The lunch buffet, no doubt, helps, too. (but I've never been for lunch) \nThe seafood here is top quality. We've enjoyed fresh Sea Urchin, Squid, Conch & Sea Eel.\nBEST THING I'VE EVER EATEN HERE? Hamachi Kama, or grilled Yellow Tail cheek. If you LOVE salt water fish - try it!!! It's found in the appetizer section of their menu, is big enough to almost make a meal of... and for less than $8 - what a bargain!\n\nSit at the bar if you'd like an amuse bouche of cucumber salad. \nAnd don't be afraid to ask the sushi chefs about what is freshest or especially good... they're nice guys. (Actually, many of the kitchen crew are Latinos {go figure!} and speak English.)\n\nEnjoy the yummy journey!
