I've been going to New Life New Image for about 1.5 months now, and my experiences have been amazing. I've gotten blue light treatments & hydrafacials, and I am 100% satisfied with the results. Plus, what made my experiences even better was that their staff have such great, positive energy which makes you feel very comfortable during your treatment. I highly recommend getting a consultation (it's free!) before you book any of the services so that you know exactly what treatment you need for the type of skin you have. They have summer specials going on right now, so make sure to check them out :)
