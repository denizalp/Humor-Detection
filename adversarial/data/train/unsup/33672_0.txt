My 2 year old is absolutely terrified of haircuts, and the staff here did a great job handling his fear and suggesting things that may help calm him down.  They were very understanding, and allowed him the time he needed to play and get comfortable with his surroundings.  Lauren worked around his needs and was so gentle that he didn't even realize she was cutting his hair.
