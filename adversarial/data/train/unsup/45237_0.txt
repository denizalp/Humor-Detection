Got a booklet for the Lakeridge Ski and had to come to this place to pick it up. The farm is somewhat hidden, so it's easy to miss it. Had to do a u-turn since our GPS was set as 5450 Lake Ridge Road, Uxbridge instead of Ashburn. This place sells mainly pies. Looks delicious so a friend bought some mini ones to try out.
