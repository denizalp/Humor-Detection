Maizie's (note: whoever started this review thread spelled her name incorrectly) is an AWESOME place.  Very friendly, good food with ample portions, and a wonderful bar\/wine selection.   It's a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere - although - it can be overrun at times by the residents of the Landmark Condominiums, because it's on the ground floor right there.   But I can't blame them for hanging out somewhere that they can simply stumble home!    It's a fun place, try it.
