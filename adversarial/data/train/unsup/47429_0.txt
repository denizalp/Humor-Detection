Bottom line: the food here is excellent. Everything had fantastic flavor and was cooked to perfection. We had:\n\nGreen papaya salad (awesome)\nThe braised pork belly (juicy, fatty richness)\nPad thai with omelette on top (really good, although the people sitting next to us also ordered it and their portion was significantly larger)\nCrispy duck panang curry (good, although Lotus' is better... Tip: ask for the sauce on the side! They give you more and you can pour it over rice)\nSaut√©ed pork with raw garlic and Chinese broccoli (waiter recommendation that was on point!)\nGrilled prawns and eggplant (Would not be anything to write home about except for the cilantro dipping sauce which our group started eating by itself over rice it was so good!)\n\nThe main drawbacks are the small portion size, which is not ideal for larger parties, and the service is a bit slow (although there was a gigantic party eating at the same time as us, so that may have had something to do with it.) Make reservations for sure, as the space is rather small. But definitely go!!
