Haus Murphy is getting 4 BIG stars! Why not 5 you ask? Only because they are in Glendale and it takes an ungodly amount of time to trek out there. With that being said... \n\nI have been to Murphy's 3 times and have enjoyed it immensely each time. I have never been to Germany or another really authentic German restaurant, save the German buffet at Epcot Center, so I don't think that really counts. The restaurant is on the smaller side and it can be very busy on the weekends, so make a reservation. They do have a nice beer garden outside where you can eat as well, weather permitting. They have a few larger booths in the front room, but have a large open area with tables and some community type tables in the bar area. I believe they have a polka band there on the weekends also. So if polka music is your bag you should check it out. \n\nOn to the important stuff. Food and beer! Again, their food has been consistent all 3 visits. They have a simple salad that comes with most entrees, but the dressing is awesome! The mushroom soup is great too! They also bring out warm, fresh pumpernickel and sourdough I believe. I have tried the chicken with mushrooms and cream sauce, the rouladen, and the meatloaf. I can't remember the name for the meatloaf, but that is essentially what it is. It comes with mashed potatoes and cabbage. It is fantastic! I believe it was served with a brown sauce\/gravy. The offer a very large selection of beers. I have had the Spaten Lager and the Spaten Oktoberfest. Both quality. You have to get them in the large glass steins they offer. Lets keep it authentic folks. \n\nThe desserts are pretty good too. The Apple Strudel was very good, but does have nuts. If you can pick around them I would suggest it. The Black Forest cake was a little dry, but good. \n\nIf you live nearby or don't mind driving go and give Haus Murphy's a try.
