Don't be fooled by the boarded up exterior, this place is open for business.  I hope they're just doing renovations because a giant piece of wood with the words ABOUT U spray painted on it doesn't exactly scream 'come on in!'\n\n\nI'll give it to them that the inside of the salon is actually quite nice, once you pass the sketchily constructed entrance.  It smells really good, they have nice music playing, and it looks extremely clean and professional.  The inside is nice, even though the outside tells me they're going out of business.\n\nAnd perhaps they are.  I wouldn't be surprised judging by their prices.  I mean, a bikini wax that starts at $80?  That's not even the whole lady area, just the outer edges.  And a cut and colour starting at $110.  Who do these people think they are?  I'm surprised anyone goes there... unless they're looking to throw their money away.\n\nSorry About U, it would seem that you aren't about the customer at all.  Maybe you should add an 's' to that 'u' and change the name to About US!
