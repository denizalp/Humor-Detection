We got there on a Saturday night at around 10pm and the line was INSANE.  Thankfully it was just me and two other girls so the bouncer let us in really quickly.  Sadly we still had to pay the $20 cover but eh, it could have been much worse.\n\nThe club is GORGEOUS, the most beautiful I've been to in Las Vegas... actually probably ever.  While you're waiting for the dance floor to heat up, I recommend grabbing a drink and walking around the beautiful pool area a couple times.  The cabanas on the second level are pretty incredible too, but a word of caution for people considering renting one -- they're a bit far from where the action is.  If you can, get a table by the pool or inside near the dance floor.\n\nThe drinks are a bit weaker I found than at the other Vegas clubs I've been too, which is a little annoying considering I had to pay cover :(  But still had a pretty good time.\n\nMy major complaint is the dance floor.  They way overfilled the club and the dance floor was dangerously packed.  People were pushing, shoving and being out right rude.  \n\nDear Dude who stepped on my foot:\nYou don't get to hit on me 10 seconds after you've stepped on my foot!!!  Not cool....\n\nI think I could have tolerated it a bit better if it weren't my 3rd consecutive night clubbing, so I'll give XS a pass on this one.  But I recommend coming on a less crazy night like Monday, I bet it'd be just about perfect then.
