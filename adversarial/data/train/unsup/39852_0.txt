I love this place. Both the banh mi and pho are great - extremely fresh and well-seasoned, and the owner is a lovely man who truly seems to enjoy seeing people enjoy his food. There's a sweet little patio out front that's a nice quiet place to sit and drink a beer, but because it's at the end of the street, a lot of people miss this gem. Go here! Even though I'm there at least once a week, I can't keep it in business by myself.
