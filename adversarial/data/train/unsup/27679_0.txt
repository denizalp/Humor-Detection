Skye is truly a hidden treasure! We have been there twice in the last week and have had amazing meals each time. I enjoy good fish, but it can be difficult to prepare. Both meals, however, were perfectly done. Last week, it was barramundi; this week swordfish. Perfect! Tonight my husband had pork tenderloin, which was also wonderful. Skye is becoming the best restaurant in the area! Kudos to the new Chef, Joe, who is both artistic and able to handle the demands of a busy restaurant! Our server, Armando, is also a long-time pro and makes the experience memorable. Michael is the GM and deserves kudos for putting this great team together! You must try Skye soon!
