First off, Id like to say that I had the highest hopes for this buffet. Seeing fellow yelpers reviews\/photos made me soo excited!! \n\nSTAFF: very friendly and attentive. Our dirty plates never sat on our table for more than five minutes. I also think it's very helpful that they give Bacchanal first timers a tour of the buffet.\n\nFOOD: mehhhh. Many of the \"hot\" dishes were not very hot. It was more like cool\/room temperature. It is not fun to eat cold lobster corn chowder (I was VERY excited for this). \n\nTIPS: wear long pants or a maxi dress! While I was in line for the carving station, someone had dropped a plate and the glass had shattered and got caught between my sandal and foot. There was also a woman between me and the person who dropped the plate. Good thing she was wearing a maxi dress! Lol. \n\nSIDE NOTE: good thing I looked at yelp pictures before the buffet! There were absolutely NO signs for the food. Like uhhhh I think this is clam chowder? Could be cream of mushroom soup. Who knows!
