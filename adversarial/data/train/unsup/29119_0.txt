This is easily the WORST apartment complex I have ever lived in. The new management company ConAm is crooked and will take advantage of you any chance they can get. The water is constantly being turned off throughout the community and we still get charged for it, and then rather than just admitting fault they try to blame the City of Las Vegas. There are massive cockroach, scorpion, bedbug, and pigeon infections all over the complex and I have talked to MANY of my neighbors that have been blown off by management when they requested pest control measures be taken. A big problem is how the staff will lie to you and say anything to get you to move in, and then switch everything after you sign the lease. I was shown a unit with brand new appliances, new paint, and upgraded features. Then after I was told the price and signed a lease I was moved into a unit that had dirty, stained carpets, old, worn down appliances, and grimy sinks, showers, and toilets. A 2 bed room 2 bathroom unit here, should be $900 being that it is run down and falling apart, and they are charging almost $1100 or more in some cases. Peoples cars are constantly getting giant, non removable, orange stickers put on them and are being towed for having out of state registration or no registration. I had a neighbor with a classic collectors car, who only registered the vehicle during summer and kept it covered and parked the remainder of the year, who had their vehicle towed away while it was sitting for less than a week without registration.\n\nThis new management company is made up of criminals hiring criminals, to criminalize tenants!!! Trust me... RENTER BEWARE is an understatement!!! ConAm and their Assistant Regional Manager Sergio Garcia are going to take advantage of you if you let your guard down for even a second (have a lawyer review your rental agreement and tape record EVERY conversation with staff at this location)!!!
