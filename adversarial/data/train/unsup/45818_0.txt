The worse company around they turn up late as always and this is the third trip out here to try and fix my Aircondiaion and they still cannot fix the unit they give you bad information and the wrong information. They don't know what the problem is I would not recommend them to anyone, save your money as they will not fix the job..\nI would get a qualified engineer to fix your problems as DR Cool will not fix the problem they will make it worse... also they don't keep to the times that you have been given so you wast your own day...
