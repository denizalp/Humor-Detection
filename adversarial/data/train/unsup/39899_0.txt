This Home Hardware location is special because it has a department for electronic hobbyists. If you are looking to experiment and build projects with electronic components, this is one of the places to check for those hard to find pieces. Arduino is proudly advertised on the storefront window, and if you want to jump start your projects, this controller board is what will help you on your way. They are behind the front counter ($25) and the staff will happily point you to the aisle of components and breadboards in the basement if you ask. Sure you can pick all this stuff up online, but if you are near College Street, there is nothing better than handling the items and chatting with the staff before buying.
