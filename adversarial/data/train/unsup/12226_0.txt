Not a bad brewery by any means, but not really my cup of tea. It is probably my least favorite brewery in the Charlotte area. It didn't feel very welcoming, but more like a local spot where local people who know each other hang out. They have a lot of sour beers and if you like sour beers this is your place. Unfortunately, I am not a big sour beer girl so I wasn't too impressed with my options. They have a bunch of IPAs on their site but only had 1 on tap when I was there. I will try it out again and hopefully they will change my mind.
