I wish I could give this location zero stars.\n\nEvery time I come here I have to wait in line for more than 15-20 minutes. If it's busier than usual then there should be more than 2 people on cash!!!\n\nIt's rare to find an employee who is polite and willing to help. Every time I ask someone a question they seem annoyed.\n\nI'm not saying that every staff member who works here is rude but the ones I've dealt with have me turned off with this location completely. Smh Zara!!!
