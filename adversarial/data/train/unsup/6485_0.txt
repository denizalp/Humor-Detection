I debated about writing this review for a long time because it is so personal but honestly HCG through Red Mountain changed my life. I know that sounds beyond cheesy but honestly it's true. \n\nI've been a \"fat girl\" my entire life, like since elementary school. When I turned 23 I weighed in at 200 pounds and realized I had to do something drastic. I had heard about HCG (sounded too good to be true) but at this point I was desperate so I though \"screw it; let's try it.\" I lost 20 pounds my first month and after four months I lost 50 pounds. I went from a size 16 to 8. Incredible. I literally never thought it would be possible and I owe it all to Red Mountain. \n\nA couple things to know: 1.) yes; it works quickly but don't kid yourself this is NOT the easy way out. You have to follow the rules and you CANNOT cheat. 2.) who you have is super important. I had mostly one nurse Beth and she was great. Never made me feel bad super encouraging and always supportive. One time I had another nurse (Kathy? Can't remember) and she was awful. She's the reason I'm docking one star. After losing 50 pounds she basically still told me she thought I was fat (um wow not what you want to hear after 4 months of hard work) but whatever f*** her as far as I'm concerned I look great! 3.)it's expensive. Like seriously if you are on a budget this isn't for you but honestly I found the fact that it was pricey to keep me on track. Why cheat when you're investing all this money? At the risk of sounding like a spokesmodel if you are like me and have suffered from being a \"fat girl\/guy\" all your life do this and never look back.
