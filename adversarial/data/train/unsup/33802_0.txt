Great little Italian restaurant. The bread and lamb chops appetizer were the standouts. They put a little too much dressing on salads. Both the Caesar and spinach salad were tasty. Had the pasta with garlic cream sauce with prosciutto which was too salty for me. My friend has the veal which she enjoyed. Would go back and get 2 of the lamb appetizer as a meal! Don't have any pics as I was too hungry and forgot. Service was also great, Carlo was nice.
