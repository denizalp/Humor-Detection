This was my second visit to 7th District.  I went solo this go around for some me time and brunch.  I had their salmon and grits with french toast last time and I wanted the same meal.  I was seated immediately and I ordered an Amaretto and Orange Juice.  They were out of Amaretto.  That was disappointing, but I can understand that they may have sold out from the night before.  My food arrived.  The salmon was grits looked perfect, but the french toast did not look like it was cooked thoroughly.  Even the server mentioned to me that it didn't look right to her but the cook said to bring it out anyway.  I sent it back and when it was brought back out, it still looked uncooked.\n\nIssue #1 - the french toast being undercooked.  French toast is something that is SO basic, so to screw it up TWICE is unacceptable.\n\nIssue #2 - I'm fairly certain that the Owner or Manager could not have been present or have been made aware of this because there was no concession.  There was no apology or an offer of something else.\n\nI wont say that I'll never go back because their salmon and grits is really good!  And so is their french toast (when it's actually cooked all the way).
