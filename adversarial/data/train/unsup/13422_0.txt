A hip and modern salon experience.\nI had the utmost pleasure of working with Brin who was extremely attentive and observant my entire stay. She took everything I said into thoughtful consideration then walked me through a detailed gameplan for my hair (dark to light ombre\/balayage). Brin was a blast to spend three hours on the chair with, I always enjoy learning about other's life stories. She made me feel relaxed and at ease during the whole process (but I'm not one to cry much about what my hair looks like anyway). I left hotbox with a lighter shade on my head, satisfaction, and a smile on my face, feeling like jamie lee curtis leaving the salon in freaky friday, not to mention with a massaged scalp which could have put me to sleep. Thank you Brin and Hotbox!
