Found Chris through Yelp.  Shop is clean.  I came in because my mechanic found an exhaust leak, but he doesn't fix kind of problem.  Chris showed me the problem and fixed it in less than 30 minutes.  Afterward, he showed me his work and the welding looked perfect!  I'll definitely be using him again.  I have a 2006 Ford Taurus.
