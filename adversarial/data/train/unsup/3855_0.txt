Did you know they sell coffee? Because they do!\n\nYes, in the midst of walking home from east Gerrard I was looking for a washroom and spotted Cogs. I walked in, it was empty. Guilt immediately flooded over me that I wanted to use the facilities without buying something, anything. Is that... an coffee menu? Part bike shop part... Italian espresso bar? \n\nWell, that's cheaper than buying a bike so I went with it and ordered up \"whatever is closest to a normal coffee\". Now I felt free to use the (staff) restroom while the shopkeeper\/barista made my drink. The washroom looks like it was customized for a person my size, and being 5\"1, that was kind of fun. However, you had to go down stairs and walk around the dingy basement\/crawl space to get to it. No seating to enjoy the coffee but I was on my way anyways. \n\nSorry that this review has nothing to do with bicycles. But if their coffee is a reflection of their bikes, bike repairing and service then go, because that coffee was pretty good!
