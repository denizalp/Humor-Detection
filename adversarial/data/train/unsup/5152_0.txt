I think my expectations were too high. This was not a bad experience by any means, but I have had better meals at some of the other high end restaurants in Vegas. I treated a friend for their birthday and we opted for the early evening dinner three course menu ($59 pp) with wine pairing ($29 pp). \n\nThe restaurant is classy and beautiful with plenty of quite and intimate space. Our server was attentive, but overbearing at certain points. Overall, I think he did a great job, so I won't really nitpick there.\n\nWe started off with an amuse-bouche consisting of kampachi and mango. The texture and flavor was incredible. I started off with a chilled sweet corn soup while the other party opted for a fresh vegetable medley. I absolutely devoured my soup, it was perfect. Her veggies were completely unoriginal, they tasted fresh, but that is about it. There was no interesting spin or vinaigrette to accompany the meal. As my entree I opted for the Pacific Yellowtail Kampachi with chanterelle mushrooms, bacon, manila clams and black grapes. The fish was not cooked evenly, but the overall flavors worked superbly together. The other party opted for the flat iron steak which ended up being $10 extra on top of the tasting menu price. It was a generous serving of protein that was cooked perfectly.\n\nThe final course was the dessert, and that was heavenly. It was a caramelized pineapple mousse with all sorts of other goodies added to it. To acknowledge her birthday, it came with a single candle that I though was a nice touch. Overall it was an enjoyable, yet not a mind blowing meal. Especially for $250 with tip.
