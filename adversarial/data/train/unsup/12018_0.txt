**WARNING** DO NOT COME HERE THINKING YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET \"ONLY\" AN OIL CHANGE AND CAR WASH!\n\nI came to this Danny's because I figured it was a convenient location in a huge shopping area - I could drop my car off and run errands.  All I wanted was an oil change and car wash, and they weren't having it.  The guy haggled with me for literally almost 15 minutes to get their other detailing services or window tints.  Dude, I just want an oil change and a car wash!  After about 10 minutes I got fed up and wanted to get on with my day, so I figured I'd throw him a bone and asked for the wheel polish service since they were kind of grimey anyway and that was the cheapest \"additional\" service.  Still, he was RELENTLESS in selling me the full detailing package, at a mere 5x the price than for just the oil change and wash!  After another 5 minutes of haggling with me, I finally caved and got the full service for only 3x more than what I wanted.  What a deal!\n\nSo we agreed on the price which was \"all inclusive\" (even tax) and I was told that the car would be ready in an hour and a half.  After 2 hours I called them up, it seriously took the girl 10 minutes to find out if my car was ready, and of course she told me it would be another 10 minutes.  I went to pick up my car and found out that they were charging me $20 over the quoted price because \"my car needed an extra quart of oil\" (is my oil reserve somehow bigger than normal???!!!!) and \"a special oil filter\" (???!!!).  To me, when someone says \"all inclusive\" that means there will be no additional fees. Apparently I was mistaken.  Thanks for ripping me off Danny!  Of course arguing with them did me no good, if I didn't pay up they weren't giving me my car back.\n\nWhat takes the cake is that on the receipt it said they \"checked\" my air filter and \"noted\" that I need to get that changed.  If you're already checking the air filter and selling me services I don't want or need at 3x the price of the basics, then just freaking change the damn air filter.  You can even charge me for it and claim it was just as \"special\" as the extra quart of oil and the oil filter.\n\nThey did do a really good job though, and the car looks fantastic inside and out.  So if you really want to shell out a lot of money for expensive detailing services, this is the place.  But I will never be coming back for \"just an oil change and car wash\" and I don't recommend anyone else to try to get away with that either!
