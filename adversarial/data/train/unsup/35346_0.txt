I came across him singing at the Santa Monica pier in California and I could not continue on my journey. His voice and depth of feeling stopped me and I was drawn into the love that was radiating through him. His voice is soft and the words are romantic and peaceful and seem to bring out the best in people. What a refreshing experience that my wife and I shared together as we and thought of our own precious times together as Terry Prince and his beautiful music surrounded us with love. Unfortunately I cannot find his albums for sale anywhere.
