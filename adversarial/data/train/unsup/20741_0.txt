Having been to Gyukaku, Yagyu(closed), Honey Pig, Tofu Hut, Korean Garden BBQ House, Sura and Gangnam, I feel like Hwaro is just another mediocre addition to AYCE BBQ spots in Vegas. \n\nSERVICE \nBest one by far, compared to other BBQ spots around town. We had about 3 servers constantly checking on us. All of them were friendly and attentive. Thumbs up for their service!\n\nCLEANLINESS \nTook a star off of this. I understand it is difficult to deal with oily stuff. Table was all oily but that's expected (I would appreciate if they took more time wiping the table). What I can't stand was the floor covered in oil. One of the server slipped by our table because of how oily the floor was. We had multiple servers telling us to watch out the step and I was scared getting up from the table. The floor was so slippery! Perhaps wood floor is a bad idea for BBQ place? Or they just have to clean more? I don't know how they can solve this but they definitely need to do something about it before someone gets hurt. My tip would be to wear a slip-resistant shoes. Any shoes with grip will work. \n\nFOOD\nAnother star off. We ordered short ribs, marinated pork and brisket. Nothing spectacular. You get banchan like any other KBBQ place. I would say the quality of the meat didn't match the price. Considering Tohu Hut has a late night special for $13.99 AYCE, I would much rather deal with their rude  service than to pay over $20 for AYCE BBQ that is about the same quality, if not Hwaro is slightly better. I also wouldn't mind paying a little extra and go to Gyukaku, Honey Pig or Korean BBQ House for better quality meat. \n\nCONCLUSION\nI wouldn't mind giving them a second chance but there's definitely a better AYCE BBQ options in Vegas so this place wouldn't be my first choice. Quality wise, Gangnam, Honey Pig and Gyukaku would be my top choices. Tohu Hut or Hwaro if you are feeling broke\/just want to get your BBQ craving satisfied.
