I was over charged on my rental, talked to the girl giving me my receipt she said I can't help you go to the guy in the booth about 50 feet away. I go to the guy in the booth he is complaining about some customer he just had on the phone before to me. I tell him I was over charged he tells me he can't help me I need to go up stairs wait in the long line and ask to speak to a manager. So I go up stairs wait in line explain to now the third person I was over charged according to my reservation. He than tells me to just wait while he goes gets a manager. So I wait about 15 minutes or so a manager by the name of Henry comes out asks what is the problem. I explain it one more time he looks at and says well do you remember who you spoke in the Hertz Gold lobby downstairs when they didn't have my car  fi had reserved. I said no but here is what he looked like. Henry now tells me he needs to speak to that person first, so I said okay do I go with you or wait here. Henry tells me he will speak to the guy I described and call me back in 2 hours. I never got the phone call or the extra charges refunded to my credit card. That was a week ago I'm back out here working in Phoenix again this week so I was hoping I could find the lying manager named Henry but no luck no one I asked seems to know when he will be in next or be able to give me a direct number to call him. I guess it is now time to call a corporate number, I am a Presidents member with Hertz and have never had a problem at any other location until now. If it was only a few dollars I would say screw it, but it is almost $200.00 in over charges and hate to be lied too!!
