The food here is absolutely amazing. We sat outdoors in their garden area and it was so beautiful. The service definitely deserves 5 stars. The rum cake was well worth the wait- I got surf and turf which was a lot of food! I wouldn't recommend getting it unless you are really hungry. Pricey but if I'm ever in Scottsdale I will definitely return here!
