Absolute disappointment! Service was poor and food was worse. Waiter didn't crack a smile all night and had    to go ask someone else to answer each question we asked. I had difficulty chewing the tough steak and had to leave a mouth full in the napkin. Portions were lean. Interior decorating was high end but layout was labyrinthal. This is an honest review of my experience. I'm not a basher at all, but it really was a huge disappointment especially as the whole experience did not match the prices ( $110 for porterhouse ).
