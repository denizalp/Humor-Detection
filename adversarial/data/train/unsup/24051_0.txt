Easily the best BBQ in town.  And I've tried all the places.  \nEverything served with sauce on the side.  That's one way you know the meat you're getting is high quality - they don't cover up poorly cooked\/sourced meat with a ton of sauce.  The meat and rub can stand on it's own.\nThe ribs are tender but not \"falling off the bone\" overcooked.  The hot links have a nice snap and fantastic flavor.\nI'd say the brisket is the star of the show.  You can get decent ribs and hot links at other places - but haven't seen a place in town that has good brisket.  And this brisket is GREAT.  My only quibble is they don't offer burnt ends - those are the salty, crispy, fatty ends of the brisket that are considered a black gold delicacy amongst bbq fans.  They throw them away.  It's absolutely loco.  \nSides are pretty decent but I judge a bbq place on it's meat.  And the meat here is....wait for it......top notch.
