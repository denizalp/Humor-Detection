Portions are HUGE \nI don't believe I've ordered something that I have disliked.\nMyself and my boyfriend are regulars there and the waitstaff is very friendly, they always try to get us \"our\" booth when we come in. \nIt's one of my favorite dinner spots. \nI recommend the Candi's apple cobbler desert.
