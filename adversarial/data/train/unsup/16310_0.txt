I went with my family. They told us on the phone it would be $28 per person. We got there and it was buffet style, all u can eat salad, and various meats brought to your table and sliced onto your plate.  Appetizers were brought to our table also. The atmosphere and food is impressive and they've got 5 stars so far until I get the bill. They charged extra for desserts and drinks which it was assumed came with the buffet. $7 per dessert and about $3 per drink which made the bill about $30 more than expected. Those hidden costs were pretty underhanded because they even brought the dessert cart to the table and asked what we wanted for dessert. It would be just as unfair as finding out that the various poultry meats offered contained an extra charge.There were no menus and nobody told us drinks and desserts wouldn't be included in the buffet. I hope you scammers go out of business for pulling that crap.
