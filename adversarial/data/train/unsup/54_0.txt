NOWTTC is the first and only \"TTC\" containing entity that puts a smile on my face! What really makes this a wonderful relationship is the fact that you are pretty much guaranteed a good mojito, LI Iced Tea or Riga Black Balsam specialty drink ( http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Balsam_(drink) )\n\nThe setting is a weird mix of what looks like retro Brit pop decor, mingling with what would look like a modern lounge in Brooklyn! Overall it allows for a pretty cozy atmosphere that is chic without being pretentious. There are some really low chairs set along the wall that are best avoided by patrons who are over 5'4\". Instead, you may find comfort on the cozy couch by the fireplace (probably the Colonel's spot), or in the patio out front.\n\nOverall a great place to catch up with friends over some refreshing drinks as long as you avoid the community choir nights and the low chairs.
