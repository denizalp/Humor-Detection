12\/15\/10\n\nCame here to meet w\/ a Yelper friend to check out the Phoenix Public Market fare at night- all of my previous visits had been in the mornings.  Most of the vendors and food trucks were the same as those I've seen before, but there were a few new (to me!) and notable, too.  One in particular offered ultra-thin sweet Dutch stroopwafels (cookies) I was tempted to take home, but the $9 sticker for about 7 or 8 pieces kept me at bay.  That, and the calories that they promised to bring w\/ them, as well!  Hehe.  But I am getting ahead of myself...\n\nFriend hadn't arrived, yet, but I went inside the market to order the BBQ pork sandwich, which I'd been eyeing for a couple of visits, and a black cuppa at the Coffee at the Royale.  All the tables had been taken, save for one, which I soon found out had wobbly legs, so I asked the man w\/ a laptop nearby if he could share his table w\/ me.  He generously obliged, and I sat down thinking I'd be able to write a few reviews while waiting for my friend and sandwich to arrive.  As it turned out, I didn't write any reviews that evening, for soon we were talking about our food adventures in the valley-- funny how effective an icebreaker the love of discussing good food is, eh?  After a few minutes, I went to check on my sandwich and arrived at the table w\/ it, plus a chocolate-dipped almond cookie.  Since the cookie was an impulse-buy, I decided I'd share my sandwich w\/ my new acquaintance, so that I may save some room for the tasty cookie!  Loved the pretzel bun and all of the veggies that came w\/ the sandwich (red bell pepper, caramelized onions, and even green beans!), the shredded pork was OK-- I would've enjoyed it more had it been less shredded, and more chunky in texture.  The cookie, a little chewy on the inside and a bit crumbly on the outside, was absolutely delightful, especially when paired w\/ my cup of black coffee.\n\nFriend finally arrived, so we said our long goodbye to our new acquaintance, and headed outside to see what's new... Truckin' Good Food was out there selling homemade cocoa for $2- it tasted fantastic, and perfect for a cool evening in December...\n\nNow that I've thought about it, I should've bought some of those stroopwafels!
