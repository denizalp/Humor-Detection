Love this Ah-So! Service and food never disappoint. We have been to other locations and they don't compare. This is an older and smaller restaurant. Could use an update of decor but it's still clean and cozy. There is a large bar to the left, large pond in center of the restaurant, and dim lighting to make it cozy. \n\nWe came in on Sunday for the lunch teppanyaki special served from 11:30pm to 3pm. You can't beat the low prices on the lunch special! Same great experience as dinner with a few less things such as salad & shrimp but still large portions, same entertainment by chef, and great food. We were greeted right away and sat down with another couple. Our server was outstanding! He always stayed on top of our refills and clearing dirty dishes. \n\nThey start you off with a light broth soup that is simple but really delicious. It was served hot and lots of flavor. For the meal I got the teriyaki chicken and my husband got the filet. Both our dishes were incredible. The chicken was juicy and teriyaki sauce was so tasty. My husbands filet was melt in your mouth tender!!! Might get the half chicken half filet next time! The fried rice was also a huge hit! It Paired well with the shrimp sauce or yum yum sauce (few different names for that yummy pink sauce they serve) it was excellent. Large portions so we left feeling super full for hours. The chef as always was amazing! Even for our small group of adults he was still fun and entertaining. \n\nOverall everything was outstanding. Highly recommend this location!
