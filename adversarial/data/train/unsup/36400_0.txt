Came here for the first time for dinner and OMG seriously one of my new favorite places to eat at.  The salsa, the queso, and best of all the guacamole (made fresh by your table as you order) are a must have!  Definitely try the tacos, can't decide which one's you want, you can pick 2 or 3!  It's awesome!  Tried the fish tacos and the Paco's Taco (beef brisket taco) and they were amazing!  Our waiter Tucker was awesome!  Will definitely come here again and try their margaritas!
