I visited the restaurant at 6 in the evening. There were good number of people.\n\nWe initially planned to pick up food, but looking at the ambience we decided to dine in.\n\nThe food was good. Service was excellent. We had ordered 2 curries which had the same ingredients. The manager was kind enough to let us know that both would taste the same. So we changed one of the curries.\n\nThe staff is very courteous. This is the best part about this place.\n\nI would recommend this place to everyone.\n\nPrice is decent. $25 per person average.
