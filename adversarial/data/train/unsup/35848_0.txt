I tried this service for three weeks and was very disappointed.  They were disorganized and sent a different crew every week, after telling me I would have the same group every time.  The second week they forgot to even send a crew and I had to phone to find out where they were.  The bird week, the 2 women did not know how to change a duvet cover, damaged a good top while ironing and did not have the courtesy to tell me, they just hid it.  They were asked to wash a few dishes left in eh sink.  When I went to put the dishes away they were all greasy, the fork still had dry food on it and the glasses still had liquid marks and lip imprints on the rim.  Seems like they just rinsed them.  One woman was a smoker and left a lingering smell of cigarette smoke in my home.  When I emailed about the shirt and mess and asked for a partial refund they ignored my email.  When I tried to call them they hung up the first time, put me on hold the second and then disconnected the call, and did not answer the 5 times I called after that.  They are an expensive service compared to other services and not worth the money at all.    Terrible customer service and cleaning quality.
