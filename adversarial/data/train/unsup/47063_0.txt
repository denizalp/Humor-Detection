I haven't been to this dentist in years, and Dr. Levine and his staff were always very nice and pleasant to work with.  However, my review comes from the fact that EVERY time I went in I had \"Two baby cavities\" that should be filled.  Every time.  Now, I take good care of my teeth and just find that hard to believe.  Finally, I went in one last time, had two cavities!!!  Never got them filled, and never went back.  Been going to my new dentist for years now and have never had one cavity, when technically I should have two right?  One time my new dentist had to replace a filling that was coming lose, and actually said when it was out, that he wasn't sure why it was filled in the first place..
