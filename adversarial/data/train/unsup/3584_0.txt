I love this place.  It is so unexpected.  A restaurant at a car wash\/gas station\/market\/etc.\/etc.  The place is so clean and eclectic, I love it.  The carne asada tacos are amazing, as well as the barbecue.  I tried all the sauces and they are awesome.  On my good behavior days, I have one of their salads, but when I am bad, I go for the Bourbon Pecan Pie,  yes, it is awesome and it will go straight from your lips to your hips, but it is so worth it.  I will be going to the gym, on a Sunday, to try to compensate for my little indulgence.  Thank goodness I have hubby to eat more than half of it.
