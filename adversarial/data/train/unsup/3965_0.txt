I had such a great experience here.  I came with a large group so we got the cool table in the back.  The table looks like its very low to the ground but once you get closer to it, you see that there is a space for your legs under the table.  Some people may not like it because it is a little difficult to get in and out of but i thought it was fun and different.  Food and drink prices were very reasonable.  I tried several different sushi that night but the Rice Crispy was my favorite.  The only downer was that we had such a large group (14 people) and they were not able to split the check so we all had to pay in cash. A few people didn't have cash so there was some borrowing going on.
