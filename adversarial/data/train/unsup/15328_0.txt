Somewhere between a 3.5 and 4\n\nI came to the Hershey centre to cheer on a bunch of great kids play hockey in a tournament.  I have to admit the whole place is spacious and fairly well maintained.  Lots of parking for the many events occurring here.\n\nI do have one big biiiiiig rant ... I get it that we're in Canada and we're supposedly a hardy bunch but just... turn... on... the... heat.  In the middle of an arctic air freeze, and they dont have the place heated.  With my full on outdoor winter gear, I still saw my breath when talking and was chattering.  No relief between sitting in the rinks and the halls ways.  The only ones that were ok were the kids just coming from off the tournament.  \n\nIf I could enjoy the day without worrying I'd lose a limb to the cold, then it'd be a great arena.
