Is it wrong for me to admit that I love strip clubs? As much as my husband?  Maybe I just missed the pole when I was 21 and could have actually stripped\/danced to put myself through college, LOL.  That being said, SR is my, oops OUR second-favorite strip club in Vegas.  Only second because it's way too cramped.  It's a comfortable place for couples, although the dancers tend to pay more attention to the groups of men, perhaps not realizing that women are more than capable of dropping every bit as much cash as the guys. Not to mention that many ladies (and by that I mean ME)  enjoy lap dances as much as their male companions.... Big plus:  clean and attended ladies room where you can actually chat up the dancers in the light and invite them to stop by your table if you like. \nAlthough if you call ahead, they will in fact send a limo for you, I strongly suggest  using your hotel's town car\/limo (the valet will hook you up) because using the club's limo can be costly in the time department and you can end up sharing with people picked up at other hotels, which can be a roll of the dice. \nAlso, since we're well dressed and tip well, the door-guy-head-bouncer at SR is always happy to find us a great place to hang out, we're treated very well there, so I suggest dressing in something other than jeans (for more than one reason, wink wink) and finding the right guy to grease.\n Pole dancing is very high-quality, these girls know how to work a pole, big time. The exceptionally  good-looking girls are VIP only, so be prepared to venture on back if they're the ones who catch your eye.\nAll in all, a fun place, very busy and crowded.  Be prepared to either stand or tip well to get a table.  A wide variety of girls, all very attractive.  Many VERY young girls, if that's your thing, you'll be in heaven.
