I would give it 5 stars but I'm really pissed they don't accept credit cards...I had the fried needle noodles with beef, shrimp and eggs. It was pretty good, I wouldn't say anything special. WARNING the spicy paste they have on the table is SPICY AS HELL. \n\nThe best were the pork cutlets with cheese and stuff on top on fried rice. They were so soft and gooey and cheessyyy. Yum.\n\nCurry chicken was boooring, so boring. It comes with steamed rice and isn't that impressive.\n\nIn case anyone is wondering, yes I tried all 3. I am a so-called \"do you wanna finish this\" receptacle, so i usually get to try many things at one place!! Yay me. \n\nThe actual restaurant was buzzing at 1pm on a weekday, we had to make a reservation so got seated right away.  All in all I really liked it, there's so much to choose from I almost had a stroke.... next time I'll try more and bring cash!!!!
