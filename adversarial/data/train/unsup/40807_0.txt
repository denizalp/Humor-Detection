This is my first review ever, so it's saying a lot that I am even writing one. Maria did a fabulous job with my chiffon dress that I needed promptly for a wedding. Not only were her services excellent, she is the most caring lady I have met in a long time. I promise if you go to her you will not be disappointed. I cannot recommend her enough!
