Do not hire for catering events.... as the food was not bad the service was and is terrible.   I was not only over charge more than the agreed amount contract. . But also the additional labor request was a waste of money... they did not have the Staff bus anything as agreed.  Via email amd text message. We were prepared to hire bus staff from another vendor but they stated they had to have their own team bus the tables and serve.   They didn't do anything.\n\nNow they are not responding to any of the items we have in writing and i will have to bring in our lawyer. \n\nNot worth the headache. And if you saw the mess they call an invoice you would understand why they do not have any kind of business skill other than cooking.\n\nI would suggest using any other BBQ company in town to not have to deal with this chef and his lack of business\n\nOne more thing.. if you do use them be sure to check the math .. as I had to correct it for them during this process
