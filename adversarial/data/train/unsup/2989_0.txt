So here's my deal. \nLast time I was in Vegas I was part of a bachlorette party and promoters approached us nonstop. \nThis time around I was nervous because I would be going to Vegas with the family.\nThe familia agreed to watch the kids for one night while the hubs and I partied it up. \nBUT!!!\nPromoters don't approach you if you're surrounded by kids and grandparents. \nThats a fact. \nSo I contacted Stacia and she was freakin AWESOME. She hooked up my husband and I with VIP entrance into XS!!!! \n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, whether with the family or a big ol group of girls, I'm definitely contacting Stacia. . . .AND YOU SHOULD TOO!!!!!!
