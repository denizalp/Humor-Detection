The worst French food experience I have ever had and mind you, I have had way better French food in San Francisco!  First of all, the waiter exuded impolite, pretentious, haughty, pompous attitude towards me and my family.  He treated us as if we didn't know anything about French food.  Because of this experience I must advise people to beware!  The waiter will dismiss you if you ever make a comment about French food in general, positive or negative. He said that he has been working there for 16 years.  He tried so hard to entertain us and yet I was bored to death!!!  Gag me with a spoon!  He also had a habit of banging on our table when he wanted to emphasize his boring story about his growing up.  He pounded on our table at least twice.  I found that behavior in peculiar and very unprofessional!  In summary, French food lovers--beware of this place!!!!
