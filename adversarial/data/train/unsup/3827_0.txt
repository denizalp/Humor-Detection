\"NOT SO SECRET PIZZA\".\n\nYes, there was a line.\n\nPizza was good but not mindblowing.  \nThe crust is super crunchy..\nThink I prefer more of a rustic style pizza that is a litte more burnt around the edges and slightly more chewy.\n\nBut it was good and very affordable.\n\nBeer prices seemed good until they hand hand it to you in a red cup...\nTalk about TINY...  It was like 8 ounces?\n\nDefinitely worth a try if you're staying in the Cosmopolitan, but I'd say skip it you're coming just for the pizza.
