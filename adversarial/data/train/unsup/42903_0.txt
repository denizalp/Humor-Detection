Cody was our server. We both checked in and there was an offer for a free refillable beverage. He comped one of our drinks. \n\nWe decided on our entrees and had ordered. Cody walks over a few minutes after and apologizes to us for stuttering because he just worked a grave yard shift the night before so he is kind of out of it. We didn't mind. \n\nThere could have been a mix up with my order but I'm glad Cody made sure what my order was the second time before an error occurred prior to meal delivery. \n\nThe food was good and I enjoyed my meal as well as my bestfriend. \n\nIt wasn't busy for a Saturday evening. The hostess was kind.
