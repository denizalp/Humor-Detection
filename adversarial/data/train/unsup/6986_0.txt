This was a sight for sore eyes on Sunday morning. I had a long Saturday night, so a gently-lit room with soft music was the perfect place to get my brunch on. The long line was discouraging, but the staff was speedy, and the ordering process was highly efficient. Take a number, and they'll find you.\n\nNo more than five minutes later, my order arrived with a smile. It was the advertised lunch item, the \"BBLT\". I thought the extra 'B' stood for the balsamic vinaigrette that ruined robust, locally-grown tomatoes, and I was wrong. It was emphasis on the supposedly generous portion of average bacon in the sandwich. In that aspect, it was mediocre.\n\nTo make matters worse, the mayo on the sandwich was...very acidic, to say the least. Wedged between what I believe to be lackluster sourdough, this sandwich tasted way too tart. I don't even like their bread, I can say with confidence it ain't up to snuff after visiting some REAL bakeries in this town.\n\nSo after looking at the menu online, I see they enjoy taking a simple breakfast\/lunch food and spicing it up a little...they shouldn't try so hard. My stomach churns at the thought of them messing up the paninis. Maybe I'll be back to try a breakfast panini, as they were pretty cheap (chicken sausage and apple? Hmm...)\n\nBasically, there are some decent items to be had here, I'm sure. But...can you find a better brunch or sandwich for around $10? If you're on Yelp, you already should have. The food is 'meh', but at least the service is great. And that black currant tea. I want a tank to myself.
