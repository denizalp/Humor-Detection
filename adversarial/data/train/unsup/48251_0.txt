Around Midnight on Monday my family and I were headed home to California about 15 minutes outside the strip our alternator went out. We called our insurance for a tow and the representative told us the cheapest price she could find me was for $450 because we would be paying cash, so I told her that was okay not to go with it and that I would figure something out. So I decided to call around myself to price different places and the first place I called was Larry's towing. A woman, who's name unfortunately I don't remember, picks up and asks what I need. I tell her and she cops an attitude and tells me she already spoke with my insurance I tell her ok and hang up with her. My husband asks me to call back and ask how much for a tow to the next exit so we can at least get it off the highway. I call back and tell her I just called and asked her what the price would be for the tow. She again cops an attitude with absolutely no intention of hiding her annoyance with me and asks me exactly where I'm at. I hand the phone to my husband because I can't deal with her snarky condescending tone. We were 7 miles from the next exit and the price was still $300. I already was having a rough night, I had my kids in the car, and this woman wants to treat me like dirt for no reason. There was no friendliness, no compassion towards our situation. I'm not mad about the price, I understand with cash there is a risk, but at least be nice to your potential customers. You know you attract more bees with honey than you do vinegar.
