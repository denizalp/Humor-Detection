Yikes - it's been three years since my original review of this salon, and it's definitely time for an update... \n\nNail Spa at Lincoln View is now my go-to nail salon, and it has been for quite some time.  I started going here consistently for one reason: Lia!  Lia has been taking care of me for at least two years now.  I followed her to this salon and haven't looked back.  It is a bit on the pricier side, but it's worth it.  \n\nThe owners, Jimmy and Demi are super friendly, and of course, Lia always takes amazing care of me whether I see her for a pedicure with acupressure\/reflexology, a manicure, a wax, etc... She does facials too!  Lia has taken care of me through both of my pregnancies and she really knows her stuff.\n\nThe salon is clean, the semi-private rooms are great, and they actually recently added on to have some additional rooms including a party room for small groups.  This salon offers their customers a bottle of water (nice touch), plenty of magazines to choose from, and pretty much any color of the rainbow when it comes to polish.\n\nI recently had my husband join me for a visit and since it was his birthday, I let him have the appointment with Lia and I had Annie do my nails... she did a great job also.  I had her do an accent nail on each hand, which was a fun twist for me.  \n\nThey do take walk-ins, but I'd recommend making an appointment (especially if you'd like to request Lia).  Go pamper yourself and enjoy!
