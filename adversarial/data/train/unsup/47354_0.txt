I want to give 4.5 stars, but I can't... so 4 stars it is.\n\nOkay, out of 10:\n\nCream of mushroom soup = 12 (yes, out of 10... AMAZING!)\nFilet mignon = 10\nMashed potatoes and creamed spinach = 7\nService = 9\n\nI was so happy with my steak and the soup.  I was a bit underwhelmed with the sides.  All in all, I walked out a happy girl.  My date had the strip steak and loved it.  He's a meat kinda guy, and was more than satisfied.\n\nCraftSteak and Nero are still my two favorite steak places in Vegas, but Tender places above Cut...
