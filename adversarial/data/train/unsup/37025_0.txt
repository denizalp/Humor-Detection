Located in the middle of the strip. Former Imperial Palace Casino Hotel and future Linq.\n\nHotel is not completely updated as of this review. Many years ago Imperial Palace was purchased by Total Rewards (Caesar Properties) to run the center Las Vegas strip and improve property values (not as though it was needed).\n\nFirst thing after purchase was update the casino. During the visit the casino was undergoing massive updates to stay modern and be current as the old owners had no investment other than ownership of the property. \n\nFirst hotel stay. Casino was undergoing the Multi year remodeling. Hotel however was not. \n\nHotel first. Check in was fairly quick for the spring break period. Room preferred (non smoking) was unavailable at check in. We arrived late due to a late flight and was unable to get our preference. We reluctantly took the room.\n\nSmoking room was located on a high floor. It just smelled like smoke. The sheets, curtains and towels. It all smelled as we came into the room. We had opened the sliding door all the way to get outside air. It was still bad.\n\nRoom upkeep was more than needed. Decor from sheets, curtains, and office chair were all quite dated. Carpet had stains all over and the bathroom had mold among other things. Bed was lumpy and the air conditioner were not in working order. \n\nFirst thing in the morning, we checked out quick.\n\nHotel visit was unfavorable as was the casino undergoing renovations. We have visited the completed casino renovations. Hotel is undergoing renovations now. We might give it another shot when rebranded until then just one star.
