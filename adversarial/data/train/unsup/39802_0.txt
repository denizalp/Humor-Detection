I tried this place for the first time using Postmates. I ordered the Santa Fe Bowl and a muffin from whatever assortment they had that day. The bowl was ok but not out of this world amazing. I'm not a big fan of corn and the black beans\/red bell pepper\/corn was predominatly a corn relish. But regardless, the bowl seemed to lack a lot of flavor. I heard better things about the bakery over the actual cafe food so I was excited to try the muffin. Again not bad but a little dry. I know it's gluten free flour but maybe more bananas or something to have it not be a dry baked good.
