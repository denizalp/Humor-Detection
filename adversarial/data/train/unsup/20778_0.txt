Awesome. Saw a snake in front yard. My wife nearly peed herself. She was convinced it was the devil himself sent here in the form of a snake to punish our family for not tipping well enough at dinner last week (sorry Applebee's waiter, the service was slow.) \n\nWhile monitoring his advance toward our home from a safe distance, I grabbed my phone to lookup snake removal on Yelp. Found these guys. Before calling, I stopped to tell my wife the snake was now near her leg. Between fits of laughter, I called the number and immediately spoke to a hero snake charmer. It was 7:00 at night, and the guy answered within 60 seconds. That sounds fast, but it was more than enough time for me to update my wife that the snake had now moved into the house (it hadn't, but her tears were worth it).  \n\nSpoke to the guy for a few seconds when he suggests texting a picture.  I gather my courage to confront the beast directly.  It may have been my fear, but I swear the snake smiled and said \"pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name.\" With snake selfie in hand, I text the pic to the snake hero. \n\nMoments later, he replied with the best news my wife heard since learning of my rich uncle with cancer and no known heirs, the snake was simple gopher snake. Harmless.  \n\nSuffice it to say, these guys made no money from me, yet saved my night.  Will definitely call when Satan returns.
