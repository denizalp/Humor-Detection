Ordered grilled chicken wings and brisket sandwich. You may find the chicken wings quite different from what's served at most other restaurants; instead of being doused with sauce, they have a nice crispy glaze (rather than breaded) tasting of smoke, hint of sweetness, and dry rub.  The side of regular BBQ sauce is tasty, but not phenomenal.\n\nI was pleased to see that the thinly sliced brisket had a definite smoke ring. The brisket is more of the \"dry\" type suited for sandwiches rather than the part from the fattier part of the steer. I prefer a drier brisket; served with spicy BBQ sauce on a soft bun, I was definitely pleased.\n\nThe seating space is counter top and carry out only 20 minutes prior to close.  The restroom location is a little bit of an oddity; basically you go out to the backyard to enter the restroom as there is 1 restroom for the small building.\n\nWould go back again and recommend the brisket& wings!
