Great donuts and reasonably priced.  We have something similar in san diego but a dozen here is about $12 versus san diego $36.  We had 12 different ones and they were all great.  The filled donuts were smooth, creamy and flavorful.  The apple fritter is the size of a dinner plate but not too heavy.  The blueberry crumb cake was my second favorite.  My first was tie between the caramel chocolate cake donut and the chewbecca.  My sister in law leaves in mesa and we will stop here every visit.  hurts
