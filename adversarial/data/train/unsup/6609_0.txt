My brother and I ate here in January - he is a vegan and there is a shortage of restaurants in Las Vegas that have any idea what that is. Well, Wing Lei's menu wasn't much help - but he did manage to find a few suitable items. The room decor is nice, the food pretty good but they don't give you much for the price, the service mediocre. \n\nHonesty, I thought Red 8 was the better Chinese restaurant at Wynn. Though there was nothing actually bad about the place, to me Wing Lei offered nothing worth the very high prices - though maybe I am spoiled by the Chinese restaurants in San Francisco, where I spend much of my time.\n\nFin at Mirage is a better choice if you are looking for upscale Chinese food.
