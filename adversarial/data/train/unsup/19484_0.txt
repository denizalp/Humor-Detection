Attention Guys: BAIT AND SWITCH!!!\n\nOn both vegas.com and on the official website for Tryst (trystlasvegas.com) the cover charge clearly states that it is $30 for men. Waited in line for an hour and the cashier said it was $50. I promptly left, furious that I had waited in line and wasted my time.
