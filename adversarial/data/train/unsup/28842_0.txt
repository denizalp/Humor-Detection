I love the food at Panera. Only thing about this place is the slow service. Staff behind the counter chit-chats with guests and doesn't seem to notice all the people waiting in line. I seem to always wait in line during my hour break and I'm always rushing to eat to make it back to the office. I also ordered a salad with no cheese but for some reason, they always add cheese and I always have to return the food to get the order corrected and wait even longer.
