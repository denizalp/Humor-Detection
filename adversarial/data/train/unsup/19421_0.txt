As good as it gets! They are pros at making the freshest seafood taste absolutely delicious and stunning! I was left in awe after the meal. \n\nOrdered their lunch 3 course meal for a very general price of $20.12. They apparently increase the price one cent a year. Get it?? ;)\n\n1) Sashimi grade Octopus was cooked to perfection! I could understand why they had to charge extra to get that as your appetizer. It was worth every penny. It was cooked so well, not chewy or undercooked and bursting with flavor from their salt\/pepper, onions, capers, and lemon. Definitely recommend! I could understand why it was a top item to order.\n\n2) Scallops - skewer style grilled and it was sooo good. Think this is the best cooked scallop I have ever had. Definitely recommend it. It was perfectly seasoned and absolutely cooked to perfection.\n\n3) Lavraki - grilled bass - this was surprisingly very good. I don't usually eat the fish skin but boy this was soo wel flavored, I ate everything but the bones. It was that good. Definitely without a doubt recommend this fish to order!\n\n4) Walnut Cake was pretty decent too. Not too big of a fan with walnuts but I'm sure any walnut lover would love this dish.
