This is some of the best BBQ we have ever had.  Ribs were fall off the bone tender and moist, nice and smokey.  Choice of sauces at the table--all were delicious--none of the overly sweet syrupy sauce variety.  These were tangy and well-balanced.  Very little seating in the restaurant, and you do have to get there early as they start to run out of items.  Prices are reasonable.  Absolutely recommend it.
