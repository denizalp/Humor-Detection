Ordered a Capastrami for delivery with the dressing on the side. The restaurant called to ask if I meant extra dressing on the side, or no sauce on the sandwich, only the side. I informed them the latter. When my order arrived, there was no sauce either on the sandwich or on the side. Contacted the restaurant and informed them of such, to which they told me they would have their driver bring it back out. I received a call about 15 minutes later stating that they apologize, but they manager Ronnie said they could not send a driver out to deliver only the sauce (which THEY forgot) They said I could go pick it up, or they could give me a discount on my next order. Why should I go out of my way to fix their mistake,  and why would i want to order from such a poorly run establishment again?The fact that management is telling them not to correct their own mistakes is plain bad business.
