This place does what it says!  It's a great local place with pretty fabulous food (for a bar) prices beers and cocktails.\n\nI've been coming here for years. Whenever I stay at the Marriott, it is my go-to lunch place and a fun place to hang out for beers in the evening.  \n\nOne of the things I love about this place is the staff. The girls are super friendly and attentive, and it's easy to strike up a conversation! All in all, this is a chill Sports Bar.\n\nSo give the Diamonds Sports Grille a try the next time you're in the area. You're sure to have a fun time!
