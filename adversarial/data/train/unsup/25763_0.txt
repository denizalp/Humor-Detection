Recently had lunch here with my son. He ordered the chicken sandwich and chips, while I had the turkey wrap with a side of chicken and dumplings. My son was very happy with his sandwich and after taking a bite (or two) I have to agree. It was delicious! My turkey wrap was ok. The dumplings were meh. Coming from a southern family, I know what really good chicken n dumplings should taste like.  If we return, we will be ordering more chicken sandwiches!
