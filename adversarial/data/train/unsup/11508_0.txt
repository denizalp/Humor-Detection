I think I've found a new favorite place in PGH! I drove by the other day & was reminded of Eataly so I knew I had to stop! My hubby & I made a point to stop in Oakland on our way home. And I'm SO glad we did! From the moment I walked in and saw Italian sodas on tap I knew I'd be in love! \n\nI got the chef's choice Piada, and it was honestly amazing. Like an Italian burrito, but so much better than that even sounds! The peppers were sensational & not something you find a lot at fast food places like this! The little cheese bread thing they add in your bag may have been my favorite part. The olive oil and cheeses were top notch, you could just tell!\n\nEverything single staff member we interacted with was friendly and knowledgeable!\n\nI've literally told 15 people about it already and can't wait to go back!
