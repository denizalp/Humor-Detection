As I am half Native American I was really excited about trying this place out hence the name.. Upon entering and ordering from the menu it became quite clear to me this isn't a Native run business and there isn't any Native food on the menu anywhere. I was really let down . Just another store exploiting the indigenous culture because it sounds or looks cool.. lame ..
