First of all,I would like to thank Cebu Inasal for giving me food poisoning.  My wife and I came here once before a couple of months ago for lunch.  Food was OK, but nothing memorable  About 10-minutes after leaving, both of us started to become quite sleepy and nauseated.  Signs that they use MSG in their food.\n\nFast forward to this past Wednesday night.  .We decided to eat dinner here since they are now offering $8.99 buffet.  We were in the area, wanted Filipino food and figured that we would try them once more.  \n\nWhile the service was very good, I cannot say the same for the food.  Some choices were OK, most were not.  After only eating 2-plates, I had had enough.  On the drive home, both my wife and I felt very uneasy.  You can literally taste the MSG that they use.  If they cooks feel they need to pack it in the food and not let the flavor of the food shine through, maybe it's time to change your recipes.  \n\nI have stayed in the province where they don't have strict sanitary regulations like the USA and never once have i gotten sick.  There are a lot of better choices than Cebu Inasal.  If you want to eat MSG laden food and get sick, this is the spot for you.  If you want authentic Filipino food that tastes better and you want to stay healthy, keep driving on by to another restaurant.
