Bellissimo. The entrance of this Casino is surrounded by waterfalls and what nature's also brings.\nMy family had it all plan out for the entire weekend. I could only handle 1 day at Circus Circus,however enjoyed being with my cousins.\nStayed here saturday night and what a beautiful casino, from the moment I entered, I was greeted and welcomed by the employees.\nStayed in one of their suites and I was in Heaven, with all the amenities and then some.\nStaying here really felt like being on vacation for the hospitality we all received from the entire staff,for this I personally commend the management staff for training your employees and giving them the tools necessary to do their job to the best of their ability. Great Job.\nThe View,unreal especially at night.Perfect place to stay and enjoy.\nAll your needs are all in here, why would you want to stay anywhere else.\n\nThe shops are very high end stores, and the shows and most of all the variety of top end Restaurants.\nThank You for a pleasant stay. See you all soon again.\n25\/100 Yelp challenge.(2018)
