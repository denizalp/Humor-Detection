Please read previous review...\n\nMy bank says that since Mia did not give me proof of the $100 I gave her in cash and since they did not void out my debit transaction they are not going to fight 3D. No cash receipt=She ripped me off.\n\nEvery time I call the salon they act like they do not know what I'm talking about.\n\nDo not go to this place. They make up prices...notice the place has ZERO prices anywhere.\n\nThey charged me $81 for a pedicure and a gel nail fill. Of course I tip high and I made the total equal $100.\n\nThe owner of this place will not return my calls and now they decide they will respond on here? \n\nWhat a joke!\n\nThey cost me $100x2!!!!!!!! Plus a gel fill that lifted two days later!
