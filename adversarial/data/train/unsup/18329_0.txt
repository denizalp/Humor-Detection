Fu Manchu rawked it up pretty good 70's Sabbath-by-way-of SoCal style this evening. The sound was MUCH better this time around. It's still not very roomy, and the parking is limited, but the staff is really cool and friendly, and that even includes the imposing Bill Goldberg lookalike. \n\nSPEAR! JACKHAMMER! \n\nYa think he's gonna kill ya until he smiles and says hello. \n\nI'll be here again next month for The Misfits.
