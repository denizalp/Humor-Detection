Have you visited the younger, sleeker, sexier Jean Philippe yet?\n\nI really think you should.  If you've already seen the original Jean Philippe at the Bellagio -- with its (in)famous chocolate fountain -- you might think you've seen all there is to see when it comes to Jean Philippe's sweet treats.  \n\nBut you'd be wrong.\n\nThe new Jean Philippe in the Aria is completely different.  It's stylish and contemporary -- a work of art that seems to arise out of nowhere in the midst of the sprawling Aria casino.  There's no shortage of beautiful things to look at here.\n\nThere's also no shortage of amazing things to taste.  Although savory items such as crepes and sandwiches are available, I'm all about the gelato, chocolates, and pastries.  There's far too much to try in a single visit, so I recommend getting a few small items to sample and share.  In my case, it was an assortment of small chocolates, a raspberry macaron, as well as a small cup of hazelnut gelato.\n\nThey're all absolute perfection in terms of quality.  I doubt you can do better anywhere else in Vegas.\n\nThat's why Jean Philippe in the Aria is a must for any tourist with a sweet tooth.
