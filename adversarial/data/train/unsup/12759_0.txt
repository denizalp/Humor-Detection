Antonio W is obviously an Executive Catering employee or investor. He has one review on Yelp and it's amazingly 5 stars for this sh*thole. Yelp aren't these reviews suppose to be filtered? \n\nAny person who would give this venue 5 stars is either an employee or has the taste of a starving dog. The food is beyond inedible. In the past the owner has been charged in schemes and bribes. Is this the type of person you want to deal with in your wedding planning?? \n\nBobby Y said it perfect. Just watch the Robert Irvine show which Executive Caterers is on. What a nightmare!!! \n\nUnfortunately I was sentenced to attend a wedding at Landerhaven this summer. The dinner looked like Gorton's fish sticks and Encore frozen tv dinners. Since it is a known fact how bad the food is, we stopped and ate before the reception.  The cupcakes were great, as they were brought in from an outside vendor.  \n\nScandalHaven
