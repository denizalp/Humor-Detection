I can't say enough about this place. Prompt and professional service, knowledgeable staff, warm and caring demeanor, the works. I was kept informed about the entire repair process from start to finish. I never felt out of the loop or forgotten. The staff was obviously very knowledgeable and skilled in electronics repairs, and they stayed in close contact and treated me like a valued customer and a friend. The repairs were completed quickly and expertly. Couldn't be more satisfied!
