Went for UFC 100 [first time watching UFC, and this was the only place in the area that showed it]  Got there at about 9:30pm, and at 10 they started into the Karaoke.  This was my first time being in a bar where people sing, so it was pretty funny actually.  There's nothing like hearing a 60 year old intoxicated man belt out 'New York New York.\"  I was amazed that some people were pretty good minus the DJ who wore a Tie-Dye shirt, and sang half the songs himself.\n\nDraft beers cost about $7 each.  I didn't order any food or look at the menu [for which my belly the next day was chanting the mantra \"thank you... peace on earth.\"] \n\nThe atmosphere increased considerably as the night progressed when hoards of people crowded the bar for the UFC.  What struck me as odd about this pub were the conflicting medias\/attractions.  Some people came for UFC, others for Karaoke.  But which is it?    For at least an hour they did both.   I found it to be an odd combination - Karaoke music & large sweaty men pummeling each other mercilessly on a big screen.  At one point they turned off the Karaoke for an hour or so to focus on the main events of UFC.  \n\nIn conclusion, this place was fine for what it was  - only bar in the area to show pay-per-view UFC event.  But for any other purpose, I would skip it.  I don't know if I could take the singing again.
