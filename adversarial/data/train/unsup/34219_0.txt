Ok, so this place is a cute little \"after the club spot\" it has board games in the corner and about 10 tables for seating . The music is good a current and the paintings on the wall are so nice . The atmosphere is definitely friendly. \n\n\nNow the food . My wife and I got two meals and a beer during happy hour and it was only 23$ including the tip. We received 4$ off of our order because we ordered two meals and the beer was half price . \n\nI especially liked that you can give a funny name and they actually call it out . Super cute place would definitely come back . \n\nI got the #3 Buta burger sooooooo savory and juicy . \nMy wife got #2 the popular tamago burger . It comes with egg and a different kind of savory sauce . \n\nThe Jazz fries are pretty good but not to my taste buds . The mayonnaise they use is too sweet for my liking . Other than that really great
