Parking was in the back at a strip mall, but it only went up from there. Took my family of 7 out for a late dinner (we were all hungry) and we were all impressed by our first visit.  Service was best I've ever seen ... I think all of the kids got 4-5 refills on their sodas.  The kids meals were huge! Pizza was not quite as big, but big enough.  Burgers were 1\/3 pound and delicious!  Restaurant was clean, albeit loud. I'd come here as a businessman, with a family, or as a couple. Joclene was our waitress and she was busy...and incredible!  Fatheads was awesome, but Joclene could make any restaurant look good.  I'm still nibbling on my salad...and I'm a 250 pound man...the thing was HUGE. We ended up taking home despite large appetites and splitting courses. I didn't mention the obvious, but the beer was incredible.  I had the heffeveisen, the Belgian triple, and a session ale. For a small restaurant with two? Locations, the theme was clear but didn't distract from the quality of the meal.i type this as the kids speak of how great cedar point and the food was...\n\nI may never have a reason to visit North Olmstead, OH other than Fathead's...but I'll be back!
