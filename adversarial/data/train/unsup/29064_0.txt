I'm not sure what they did to the pizza the day that Guy Fieri went in there. I checked it out shortly after seeing it on TV. I was less than impressed. The pizza wasn't bad, but it surely wasn't great. Not worth the line you have to wait in. Didn't live up to any hype and I've been to a few places that have been on Fieri's show. Hodad's in SD is phenominal. Pizzeria Luigi in SD is better than Al Forno. I've been to the best pizza joints in the country and Al Forno is average. I'd eat at Red Devil before I'd eat at Forno. Red Devil is my fav AZ pizza, not my favorite pizza joint in PHX though. I like Pizza by Napoli.
