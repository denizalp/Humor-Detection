The food here isn't bad , and I enjoy the apps - veggie rolls and chicken quasadillas are very tasty. \n\nPrices are rock bottom. Definitely a place to bring your cheapest friend. I always do LOL !  \n\nService is decent , can't really expect much at 3.33 a beer, if I served here I wouldn't give a shit either lol! \n\nCheers to going out for 20$
