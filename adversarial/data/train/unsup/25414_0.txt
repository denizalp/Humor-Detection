Came tonight with some friends and got seated pretty quick, considering it was pretty busy. Service was decent and the food came out on time and correct. Water tasted unfiltered though, like tap on ice. Not so refreshing. Note for service staff, I'm in the biz too and understand it's busy for this smaller sized restaurant but slow down a little bit. Watched a girl run full sprint like a NFL try out into the kitchen through the double doors and could have done some real damage to herself or someone else. Remember, your on stage at all times and ppl are watching you. Tacos fiesta!
