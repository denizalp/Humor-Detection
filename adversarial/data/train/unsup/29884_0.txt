I always purchase candles when there's a sale. I'm absolutely in love with the fall and winter collection! Personally, I find the best scents to be mahogany teakwood, cinnamon donuts, and cafe latte. All the products make great inexpensive gifts (when on sale). Without the sale, a single candle is $25.00. That's ridiculous IMO. \n\nThe staff is extremely friendly and update you on sales without being pushy.
