Been here twice and really enjoyed it.  I typically like more mellow places that are a little bit more quiet or low key but this is a nice change.  Mix of young and old, reasonably good list of wines by the glass, the food is pretty good as well.  had a french dip this last time that was great.  The flat bread pizzas a good too.  Nice atmosphere, busy on weekends, and around 9 or 10 it transitions to being a little louder with a lounge\/club feel.  Cool place for the east valley.
