Wow. This place truly lives up to not being much of anything. From the 'rough carved' sasquatch family in front to the decidedly not family atmosphere inside it manages to be spacious but yet cramped. Games area outside is right next to an area that would probably be a great stage for live music but is overtaken by a lounge? Or maybe just an uncomfortable seating area? The food is mediocre but expensive. I had iceberg lettuce on a $12 burger that tasted like neither habanero nor parmesan! The green chili pork was bland (my mom would probably think it was spicy, but this is occupied Mexico). \n\nThe 'craft' beer menu is about as pedestrian as you can get with nothing truly interesting. Which doesn't matter because a frozen beer glass freezes the water in your beer anyway, why even have quality beer if you are going to destroy it before it even gets to me?  The 'lodge tea' is large (16oz) but tastes too much like the flavoring in flavored vodka, very chemical flavor. Not sure if the wood smell is piped in or what but the place smells like treated lumber. Music was just awful...bro-country mixed with contemporary pop bs. The huge tvs make everything seem even more cramped and it is impossible to hear the people sitting next to you.
