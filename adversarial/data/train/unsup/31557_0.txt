Love this place because of their Laos Style Papaya Salad!!\nIt's so hard to find really authentic laos style food. This place is pretty consistent when making this dish. \nI order it with a side of Crispy Pork. It's soooo good!\n\nI also love their Spicy Eggplant and pad prik king. \nSometimes I order Pad Prik King with no meat and add Eggplant and that's really good too.\n\nI only wish they had Pork Jerky.
