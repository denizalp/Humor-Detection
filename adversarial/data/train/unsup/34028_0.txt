You can drink and play games with friends for hours. Awesome music, delicious drinks, and good food too! They have a little 'cafe' in the corner away from the bar and noise. It was a little weird getting your picture taken when you were carded in though, and a lot of staff seemed to be confused about pricing & usage policy on pool tables (I'm guessing because it changes depending on how busy they are). Parking around the area is also a little tricky, but it's downtown. Overall, great fun.
