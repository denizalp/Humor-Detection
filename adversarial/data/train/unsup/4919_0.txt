I like the look of the remodel, but they just took the same space and made it less functional while spending a whole lot of dough doing it. They should have hired someone to \"plan\" out a better restaurant instead of trying to look like the more \"upscale\" Mickey D's and failing miserably in the process.\n\nThe food has been growing ever more lackluster with every visit to the point where I will most likely never be back (well, maybe to see their next remodel in 20 years).\n\nNice to see portions have shrunken considerably while prices have risen equally. My small chili only filled 2\/3 of the cup...WTF? I guess I'll waste my fast food dollars where I know I'm being ripped off and yet I still don't care... Helloooo McD's!
