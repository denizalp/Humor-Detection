Got our laptop back yesterday, or should I say paperweight. Was 2 days late for getting out of pawn. I had to buy it back from them for $500+. So I understand that they have to wipe the CPU, and restore it to factory settings. Well they completely wiped it, operating system and all. They couldn't fix it so I had to go to Apple. They couldn't fix it either. Apple has to send it out to get fixed, and hopefully they can or like I said, it's just a paperweight. SuperPawn offered my $ back for the purchase of the CPU from them, but to get a replacement CPU comparable from Apple, it's over 2K. The thing that really pisses me off about it is that Apple said there is nooooo way that it could have been wiped completely clean like that by accident. Someone has to go to a specific place in the CPU and click a couple of things to do that. That makes me wonder what they were doing with our CPU that they needed to do that. Were they downloading kiddie porn? Stealing identities, or doing some other illegal things with it? When asked at SuperPawn why it was wiped, the employee was quickly hushed up by the mgr and said after due date, they can do whatever they want with it. Well now I'm questioning what was done with the CPU before the due date. Don't take anything there to pawn if you plan on getting it back. Go to a different location. Shady things happen at this location.
