This is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE CDS SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nLOVEd the music, LOVEd the staging, LOVEd the artists, & LOVEd everything!\n\nThe first act was overwhelming in a good way!  There was so much to see, I didn't know where to focus on.  \n\nOur seats were a lil too close (7th row) and some of the things happened behind us and all around, it was exhilarating!\n\nI didn't grow up listening to Beatles, so I didn't know many of the songs, but the music was great!  They also incorporated many non-released tracks and you get to hear them talking.  It was like they were in the show.  Its great!\n\nI would definitely come back again.  For Sure!
