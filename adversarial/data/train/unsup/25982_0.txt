This was actually my first Cirque show, honestly I never understood the hype; but my best friend wanted to see this for her birthday, so LOVE it was.  I must say, it was an amazing show! If you're not a Beatles fan, probably not the show for you. I loved the timeline they set up with the music during the show!\n\nIf I saw the show again, I would definitely select different seats.  The tickets were quite pricey since it was a Friday show, so we decided to save some money and were in section 306, row AA.  While I could everything, we did have to lean forward the entire show to see everything.  I recommend sitting in one of the lower sections if you can afford it.  The show takes advantage of all the space in the theater, both high and low.
