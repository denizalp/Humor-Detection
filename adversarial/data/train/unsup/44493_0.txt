Welp, I live right across the street from  here- I will agree with some of the other posts about this place, basically average menu\/ foods found at most chains and service depends on what you get. Many drinks equaled great service, hanging out for a simple bite? Not too attentive. That proved something to me, I haven't ran back to the place because of this. The people seem nice,  they just make it obvious what they're there for... and it isn't you!
