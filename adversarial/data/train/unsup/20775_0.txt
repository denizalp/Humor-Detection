I really like the whole package that Kintori offers.  It is about how inexpensive or expensive it can be, based on what you order.  There are options of inexpensive ($2) and expensive snacks (approx $10).  The rice and noodle, meal entrees that fill you up, are generally inexpensive.  \n\nI came to Kintori with a big group.  While I only had one premium tapa ($9) and one yakitori don ($7), other people ordered many things.  From what I could see, they looked well made.  The fried chicken wings looked so deliciously saucy.  The beef sashimi on salad looked healthy.  The presentation of every dish was pretty.  The two items I had were fresh and tasty.  \n\nThe restaurant is nicely decorated.  I enjoyed my experience of sitting here with a group.  The waitress didn't bother us.  I think Kintori is a good place for a reasonably priced casual date.\n\nFood alone: 3.5 stars.  Overall 4 stars.
