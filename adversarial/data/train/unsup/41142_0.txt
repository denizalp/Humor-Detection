We normally stop here for our pho fix when visiting Vegas and after trying other places out, this is one of the better pho places in Vegas. The pho and bun bo hue are both good. \n\nThe sandwiches here are so good here! The cold cuts and the egg and Chinese sausage sandwiches are the best. I really think the bread is what also makes it so good. The bread is fresh and perfectly crispy!\n\nThe service is always great. The employees are always friendly and patient.
