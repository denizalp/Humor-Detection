Yama I LOVE You!!!  Mmmm!  Two Diners and several Lunches!  Until last week it had been a few years since my last visit... Everything is still Fantastic!  The only Huge improvement was there GINGER Sauce (they will tell you it is a Steak sauce)... This ginger Sauce is the BEST I have ever Tasted anywhere!!!  Tempura and Hibachi  is Excellent!  Last week I had Chicken with Fried Rice and Vegetables! \n\nNice Looking place and it better be in this Neighborhood!  Modern with a Japanese (I guess) Flare (not Rick)... Tacky would NOT have worked here!  \n\nThe Service is Always GREAT!  They have always treated me with the GREATEST SKEPTICISM as I expect everyone to!  It's a HUGE compliment to me when someone is incredulous! You want to look smart???\n\nNo Food fights here, no chef to catch something on fire and throw shrimp n you lap...I'm great with \"Japanese\" Cookes stay in the kitchen and I can enjoy my own company or ____!\n\nIf I were more of a \"Japanese\" \"Food\" American style Japanese so-called food or if I were a fan of Rice or Rice rolled up with other untasty or barely tasty ingredients and called Sushi... If I had only Rice or Sushi (I know the word \"Sushi\" IMPLYS more in America) to eat I would NOT starve to death - I might die of a Broken Heart, because this is not on my list of food that I want to eat, so I would not starve, though I would not be even one pound overweight because I would be eating only for nutritional needs and ZERO enjoyment!   \n\nIf I were a fan of Sake (never had one I liked and never tasted any here) They have a selection beyond what I knew existed!
