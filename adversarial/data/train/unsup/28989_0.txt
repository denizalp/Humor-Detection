Ate here for the first time today, it was amazing! Had the lunch buffet, everything was so fresh and they even make the naan fresh on request. The owner was very nice and helpful and I can't wait to order takeaway sometime soon. Thanks so much and will definitely recommend to everyone that loves Indian food. Happy to find a new place!
