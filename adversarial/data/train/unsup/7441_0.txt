I've always been a Nike girl...well, I still am but lululemon is just as rad. They have yoga pants, workout pants, jackets, sports bras, tops, headbands aka bang busters, socks, yoga mats, bags, water bottles and other yoga supplies. They also have yoga classes in-store on weekends which is pretty cool.\n\nThe whole vibe of the store is positive. The store is bright and colorful yet calming. Even their shopping bags have positive messages written all over them. \n\nPrice-wise, they're more expensive than bigger sporting brands. But most of their stuff is organic and very very comfortable. \n\nThe employees here have pleasing personalities too. They're not annoying or pushy. They're just chill and helpful. The fitting rooms are huge you can do yoga in there! They have a clearance rack but of course, nothing in my size...but it's fine. I always walk away with tops and pants...I'm addicted to this place.
