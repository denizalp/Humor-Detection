Had a scheduled MRI for my noodle because of a car accident last year (one of many), first thing in the morning. Was greeted by the receptionist in front where I signed in and gave up my ID and insurance card. \n\nAfter filling out only about 5 sheets of paper and turning it back in I was called within 5 minutes, SCORE! Maybe because I scheduled the appointment early I got called so fast? \n\nI put my belongings in a locker and went into the MRI room, the tech was super cool, asked me what kind of music I liked. Wasn't sure what they had or what my selections were so settled on top 10's. \n\nThe whole thing lasted 18 minutes, so fast. Was in and out of the place in under 45 minutes. Definitly faster than Steinbergs, would prefer to come back here for any future scans I may need.
