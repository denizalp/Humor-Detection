this is the best public library. its free book so why would any one would leave a bad review for this place is beyond stupidity. s. \"cookie\" a. you belong to these categories. you are the only person that every wrote a review for this public library because you didnt get what you wan and trying not to pay your stupid fines. seriously why yelp continue to let you write review for anything is beyond me.  none of your review are valid because you are just another rambling idiot.  what if someone from the library god not let you check out book anymore? how would you feel? and you start attacking the people that work there? seriously? you say you religious person but obviously by your review and your word and your attitude and whining behavior. one can easily tell that you have no soul and you will have no peace in your heart.
