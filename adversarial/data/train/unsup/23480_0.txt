Ok, I just do not get this place. At all. Packed with traveling insurance brokers, horny 30 somethings, and desperate housewife wanna be's, the scene is kinda terrifying. The bar was ok, except we had these meat head types breathing down our necks behind us because they couldn't sit at the bar and were obviously bent out of shape about it. When the hostess finally came to get us,  she told me I wouldn't be seated in the dining room unless I removed my hat. Is that a promise or a threat? When we were finally seated, the waiter was snooty. Snooty! Why?? You work in a glorified TGI Friday!! \n\nThe food could have been outstanding (it wasn't) and it really wouldn't have mattered. There's so many better places to eat in this town.
