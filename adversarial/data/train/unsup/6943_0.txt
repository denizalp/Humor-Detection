\"She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.\"  -Han Solo\n\nBorn and raised just outside of Philly, I get personally offended when I see a menu offering up \"Philly Chesesteaks,\" when clearly they've never even seen one. Call it a steak sandwich all you want, but put \"Philly\" in front of it, and we expect - nay, DEMAND - something very specific. And 99\/100 joints get it dead wrong.\n\nThis place is LEGIT. From the outside, or upon entering, it may not look like much, but then you hear the clatter of the spatulas on the flattop cooking up that meat wit onions, and you already know you're on the right track. \n\nDisplaced Philadelphian? Come here and get your fix, you won't be disappointed. The red sauce is reminiscent of places farther north like Allentown and Bethlehem, but you can order the steaks without it. \n\nWhen I miss the food from back east, this is where I come.
