Wow. Probably some of the best tasting food I've had in a long, long time. Asian food with some unique and stand out twists. The crunch pork sisig has a great mouth feel and mixes well with white rice. The Filipino spring rolls are delights. The kare kare reminds one of a sweet peanut pad thai but without all the bothersome parts.  \n\nThe halo halo for dessert was another surprise. Similar to Korean patbingsoo but with a great purple yam ice cream in the center. We have so few purple foods and it's nice to see one.
