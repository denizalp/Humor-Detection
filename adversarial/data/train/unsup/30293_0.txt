This is a hands down homemade Mexican ice cream shop. Everything here is excellent. I read some of the other reviews and these are your typical Dairy Queen customers expecting to come and come out. Not here, there is a line for a reason! Every person is helped individually from beginning to end to make sure their order is fulfilled, and you get everything you came for. Definitely recommend trying it out. Reminds me of our Mexican ice cream shop back home in homestead, florida. You may pass right by the location but it's inside a little small strip mall.
