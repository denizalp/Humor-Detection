LAME. The only thing thats worth ordering here is there organic coffie and thats only if they dont screw it up. My Girlfriend got a coffie here once, it tasted burnt and all the lady behind the counter had to say was \"maybe your tastebuds are burnt!\". Serriously!?! Also stay away from there tripple chocolate muffin, it had almost no flavour and still managed to make my teeth hurt.
