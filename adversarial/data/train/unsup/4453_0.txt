Probably the best place in the food court. It's open late, and for $9.99 you get so much! I could only eat half of my bowl! I got the combo bowl which throws in beef, chicken, rice, salad, bread, white sauce and a strand of spicy sauce. I love spicy and I  was a little thrown off when I only got a small strip of  spicy but I was pleasantly surprised with the level of kick! Rice is full of flavor, salad is crisp, cheap, quick, ample and delicious!!
