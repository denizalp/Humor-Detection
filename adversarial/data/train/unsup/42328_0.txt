I have run a full marathons, half-marathons, trained at gyms, taken personal training, hot yoga, HIIT, Bodyshred and more. In all my experience, I would say that this is one of the most intense and well instructed exercise classes I have ever attended. Greg and his team of trainers really know their stuff and will push you to your limits. I will say the Conditioning classes are personally much more challenging then the Strength & Conditioning.\n\nThe atmosphere of the gym is very friendly, everyone seems to know each other on a first name basis and you feel a strong sense of community right away.\n\nWill definitely be attending 2-3 times a week.\n\nYou have nothing to lose by going to a free trial first class!
