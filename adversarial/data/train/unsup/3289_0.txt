I went here for lunch with my wife and must say that it was a very warm and welcoming dining experience.\n\nLet me begin by saying that mistakes can be made by any waiter in any restaurant, no matter how fancy or how casual - the key is how the restaurant deals with the error.\n\nIn my case, I ordered the pulled pork eggs benedict, but accidentally got the pulled pork sandwich.  I didn't mind very much because the sandwich was delicious, but most importantly, the waitress was extremely apologetic for the mistake and offered to replace the sandwich with the correct order (this even after I'd eaten most of the sandwich).  Furthermore, the chef\/owner himself came out and apologized for the error and gave us each a free experimental pear\/lime mimosa for our trouble.  We got to talking with him and he seems like a genuinely nice and friendly guy who is eager to please his customers.  I happened to mention to him that I am a big coffee fan, so he brought me out a delicious espresso along with a story about the guy he buys it from.\n\nHere I've talked all about the experience and not about the food, which was perfect.  The club sandwich my wife got had a really nice touch of blue cheese and the avocado flavour\/texture really stood out.  Even the ketchup they make for the french fries is in-house - it's very tasty, a bit reminiscent of pizza sauce.\n\nAs for the ambiance in the place, it's awesome.  The details are beautifully done, from the tin ceiling to the fantastic wood work around the pass-through from the kitchen to the dining area.  Even the menus have cute french-style pictures on them.\n\nUltimately, this brand new bistro in Liberty Village is a star - I would come back in a heartbeat.
