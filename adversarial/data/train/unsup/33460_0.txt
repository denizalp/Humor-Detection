I usually love this doctor's office but I have never been shamed for wanting an anitbiotic for a sinus infection like I was at my last visit. I felt so talked down to for needing an antibiotic. Then when I called with question left a non urgent medical message I never got a call back. I sadly will be looking for a new doctor's office.
