Obsessed with this place. Just moved back from NYC and was looking for a waxing place. I've been to two other places in Charlotte and didn't like them as much (European wax center, and one on east boulevard). Paige is amazing. I'm dying laughing the whole time and she makes the whole process just easy. She takes time out of her day to focus on making sure that my skin is as healthy as possible. Came here for a Brazilian and won't ever go anywhere else now! Pumped!
