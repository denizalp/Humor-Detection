A bunch of goobly goop that tastes the same or rather doesn't taste like anything , steak was burnt, sausage and steak tasted like steak, the taco's were be burnt covered in hot sauce and guacamole type sauce , the one good thing were the authentic Mexican soda drinks. Not sure if this is what authentic did should taste like but I was disappointed regardless.
