Popped in there today after lunch.  This place has still retained its standards in terms of variety, especially for bottled condiments for Chinese, Vietnamese and Filipino cooking.  Their packaged noodles section is extensive, with many different varieties of packaged noodles representing different provinces in the PRC.  They don't carry too many Korean or Japanese products except for cookies and a few soy and wasabi pre-mixed sauces from Japan.  The fruit and vegetables section is hit and miss but they carry a good selection of produce.  The Moose is always a good place to shop.
