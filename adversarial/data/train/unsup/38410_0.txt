OK... so I went to Restaurant Cuisine Cantonaise based on the one review on Yelp; I was not disappointed. Being from LA, we have a great Chinatown, Thai town, Korea Town, Philippino town, etc etc so I'm no stranger to great Asian food. This place was exactly like I thought it would be, bright, thin on ambiance and kick ass food. \n\nThe Wonton soup was the best I've ever had. The pork dumplings (which were actually sui mei) were good but not the best and the chef special could also have been one of the better dishes I've had but they deep fried the shrimp. That is the only reason I gave this place 4 instead of 5 stars. \n\nThis is a great restaurant in a great city!
