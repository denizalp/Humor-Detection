So the dirty old men I work with like to tell me they go here for the yoga pants. I have to say that I've seen many yoga pants in here, but I guess I'm not old enough to have that low of standards. Mostly soccer moms with nothing else to do but put on workout clothes and go shopping as if that was the workout they dressed up for. And there were a lot of 60lb teenage girls who think they're fat. Lol... that's Scottsdale for you.\n\nNow, the juices and smoothies and whatever else they serve... delicious. My wife craves these things and so do I. We'll actually probably go here right now...\n\nOh, and I don't know how they do it, but all of their juices\/smoothies have ridiculously bright and neon like colors. It's crazy, my Jamba Juice never looked this cool! Just a weird observation both my wife and I had.
