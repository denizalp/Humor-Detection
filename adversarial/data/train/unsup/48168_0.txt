My husband requested this restaurant specifically for his birthday. The food was really good, drinks were strong and the service attentive. \n\nAs prior Yelpers have stated - you have to have a real easy going sense of humor and not be turned off by cursing or insults, because you WILL be insulted in good fun. My husband took a happy birthday call from his friend right when our appetizer arrived and the server says \"Well I GUESS someone is too busy to eat his f***ing food!\" Also they give you really dirty, suggestive paper hats that again, if you're not a stick in the mud you'll get a laugh out of.
