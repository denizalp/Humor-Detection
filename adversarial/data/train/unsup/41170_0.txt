Had dinner here last night with a buddy of mine.  Place was jumping - wound up getting a seat at chicken the bar fairly quickly.  Service was good - table side guacamole was terrific.  I had the chimichanga, my friend had fajitas.  Fajitas were good - better than Chili's, but similar.  The chimi was like a chicken loaf - a round football shaped thing filled with rice, chicken, maybe beans, blah.  Just kind of a big fat mess.    All in all, gotta be better if you're going to hang in there.
