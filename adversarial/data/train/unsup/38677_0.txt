dennis took my call told him the problem. only had to wait about 2 minutes for him to finish another customer. Gave me the estimate and set up an appointment. This is my second experience with them. The work is excellent and top notch. On the first occasion I got 3 estimates since I was paying for the damages myself. They were within 50 dollars of the others \n(frank's auto body and VIP). thought it  would be more because of the facility\nHence the company name is right on... Service King\nDennis keep up the good work but hope I don't need you for some time
