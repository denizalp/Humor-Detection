Nice to get some craft spirits to compliment all the beer that's out there these days. We had a couple of cocktails and were hooked. The bar shared a few recipes, and we left with a bottle each of Whiskey, Rum, and Ouzo. Yeah! You can even go home with a barrel. Looked fun.\n\nWas there on a sunny day so took a spot at the picnic tables out front and enjoyed a well mixed cocktail, including their take on a Sazerac and a rum-based manhattan served tall in a pint glass. Both were excellent.\n\nFYI, we stumbled on this place looking for Underground Meats. They share a building, but if you want to buy their charcuterie, go to Willy St Co-op. It's not for sale here. Just in case you were looking...
