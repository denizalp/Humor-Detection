Overall, I would recommend the place for fans and visitors (just don't let them give you a low battery device even if they say it'll last). Personally my experience was a bit of a bummer. It's not cheap, but you can easily find discounts online and all of the Vegas books in the hotels so there's no reason to be paying full price. The reason for the 3 stars is because of the hand held devices.  They are an important part of the whole experience, but unfortunately 3\/3 of us had issues.  Two of them died in the middle of play. We were given new devices, but the progress was lost. Also, the agent that gave us the new device told us to keep the dead one (to return up front at the end) which meant we had to carry two devices each and our personal bag until the end. Not a problem, but it was an inconvenience on top of another inconvenience.  The last one didn't die, but during a fight scene at the end it stopped working. Lastly one of the exhibits was frozen on a screen so we were unable to see the film memorabilia underneath.
