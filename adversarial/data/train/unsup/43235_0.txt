Been going here since I was in the womb lol. Edward and his family sold it to the new family and we miss them, but he at least sold the recipes to them too. Thank God cause this place is my comfort food. The sizzling rice soup is a fave especially when I'm sick and he gave my husband pick it up for me. The egg drop soup is just as yummy. The food is all amazing... Never eaten anything I didn't love. Nice large backroom for parties.
