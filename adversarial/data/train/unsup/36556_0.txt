One of the few late night eats locations in the MGM. Ordered the ahi tuna wonton. Turns out the wonton is just chips covered in sesame seed, That was a little disappointing. The fish was fresh though. Also got a jalapeno mule, which is like a moscow mule made with tequila and jalapenos.Overall the meal and drink was just ok. I think I just had higher expectation because of the Wolfgang name. It was also a little pricey for $22 for such a tiny dish.
