We came on cinco de mayo, busy as heck but these guys killed it!  They were very attentive and the food came put perfect!  I ordered the fajita el Valle and left fuller than full.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the salt on the rim of my margarita.  It was mixed with citric acid, I think, making it super sour.  Other than that A+
