Every time I go here I wish I were a girl and didn't have to pay the $40 - $70 cover. I guess everybody wanted to see Kascade that night.\n\nAnyway, this is one of the hottest new clubs in Vegas competing with XS. The layout is pretty novel. There's an elevator that takes you up on first entry. Once in, you can go to three levels. The hip hop floor, the main floor which has a pool and the top floor, which is more of a lounge. Personally, I've never gone to the top because I never knew it existed.\n\nThe best part about this club is the re-entry. Which means you can go out, get some cheap drinks and come back in. The only problem is the maze you have to navigate through and the 15 flights of stairs you have to walk down and then back up. And also, depending on the time, you may get blocked from re-entry because of the sheer amount of people. Luckily I got back in 20 minutes before they shut it off.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty nice club. There's a waterfall in the back, pool on the main floor, dance floor in front of the DJ, tons of people to talk to and heat lamps outside for when you get cold. I can't tell you about the drinks because I'm sure it's $15 for a jack and coke like the rest of Vegas.\n\nProbably the funniest part is continuous line of people being wheelchaired in and out. Makes for a good drinking game.
