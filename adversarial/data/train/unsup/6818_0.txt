If it starts with the letter D it's usually a good sign, Dana, Devils food cake, dancing, ding dongs, delicious, desserts and best of all donuts...\n\nOne of my favorite donut shops in the US is District Donuts. They are in my top 3 of best donut shops nationwide. They reside in New Orleans but they just expanded and opened a shop in Las Vegas. To say I was excited was an understatement. \n\nThe donuts are SUPER bomb. When I go to Vegas the goal is to fit in a dress for the clubs so it is always a dilemma how many donuts to order. My friend wouldn't share with me so I was all on my own here. I ordered the Cinnamon Roll and the Brownie Batter donut. Sooooo good! I ate the Cinnamon Roll in the shop and saved the Brownie Batter for after the club. My only gripe was I wish the donuts were served a little bit hotter. I like when donuts are straight out of the oven. \n\nThis District Donuts isn't as big as their other store, it's kind of like a mini version. However, the donuts didn't disappoint. I brought a box home and everyone loved them. Keep in mind these donuts aren't regular donuts, they're definitely specialty. You won't find average donuts at this donut shop. \n\nDonut lovers donut miss out!
