I recently tried this place with a few friends on a recent trip to Vegas.  I have always walked into the store to get candy for my niece and nephew since  they have things like Angry Bird gummy candy or Hello Kitty lollipops.  We always passed the restaurant and wondered about the food so we made reservations and had lunch there.  I got the Monte Cristo sandwich which was delicious!  I ate the whole thing even though I probably shouldn't have.  The prices are typical for this kind of place in Vegas, I wasn't shocked.  The wait staff was a bit slow but it's probably because it was lunch rush hour and there was a kids birthday party thing going on.  Try this place at least once.
