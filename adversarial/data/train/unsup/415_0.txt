I've been going to this little pizza joint since the late 80's. It's a family owned spot that hasn't experienced much change since opening in 1974, except for the name (it started as a Pizza Inn). Somewhere along the way, LJ bought out the franchise and the legend of sauerkraut pizza was born. Yes I said sauerkraut! That's only one of very unique specialty pizzas on the menu (one of my personal favorites, along with the barbeque). In my nearly 20 years of making the occasional afternoon trek to Mesa from central Phoenix I have always been treated well by the wait staff (most of which have been there that entire time), have never been disappointed in the pizza, and usually look forward to the mini ice-cream cone served with every meal (except when I have returned to the buffet line one too many times). \n\nIf you are a first timer, I would suggest going for the lunch buffet served Monday through Friday from 11'ish to 3'ish or on Saturday evenings from 5 to 8. You get to sample every pie they make and if you don't see it on the serving line, just ask, they will have one made up just for you and deliver it straight to your table within 15 minutes.\n\nAs the other reviewers have stated, don't go for the decor, but the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. Speaking of comfy... take the big pants along, or make sure the ones you are wearing have an elastic waist. Don't head my warning and you may risk physical injury as overly tight pants are known to cut off critical blood flow to the remainder of the body.  : )
