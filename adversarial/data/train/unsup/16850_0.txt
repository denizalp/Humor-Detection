Last Saturday, I went to Char's Bar\nBecause it wasn't very far\nRiding bitch on a scooter\nIn a mini skirt barely covering my cooter\n\nThis was my first time\nWhich should've been a crime\nCuz' this place was poppin'\nMy booty was droppin'\nMy head be boppin'\nWhere all the ez katz are flockin'\nDrop, pop the collar lockin'\nAll shades of colors hoppin'\nTo the beats that be rockin'\n\n$6.00 was the door fee\nStiff drinks? Yes please!\nShots of Patron I was takin'\nIn hopes of later dirty baby makin'\nAnd even morning breakfast serving bacon?\n\nOnly complaint is the restroom\nVery slimy, tiny, and grimy\n\nShe sang with soul and funk\nNothing dull or bunk\nDamn, I'm gettin' drunk!\nSinging some James Brown\nThe crowd was gettin' doowwwnnn\nNo one with a frown\nUp in this Blue's town\n\nI danced and got jiggy\nFlirted like Miss Piggy\nWith all this fun\nUnder the sun\nI was done\n\nBut I'll definitely be back\nReady to attack\nThis place was so cool\nNot at all whack\n\nEyes were closing shut\nBaby making, what? What?\nNot tonight, don't wanna to fight\nCan barely stand with all my might\nLosing sight\nGooooooood night!
