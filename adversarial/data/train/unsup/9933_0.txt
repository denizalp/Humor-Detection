Not to be confused with the larger Mitzi's Sister on Queen, Mitzi's is a tiny cafe tucked away on Sorauren Avenue in the middle of a completely residential street, and I'd like to say it's a secret, but judging by the Aunties & Uncles-esque wait times on a Sunday morning, clearly it's not. There are a few tables indoors and then a picnic table and small patio area but I'd say the capacity of the whole place is 30 people at most. \n\nThe Mitzi's spot has existed since 1905 and when it first opened it was a grocery store that sold milk for $0.15, later renamed \"Sorauren Grocery\" and then \"Superior Groceries & Meat.\" It became Mitzi's Caf√© in 1996. \n\nThere are no paper menus and the selection is limited to about seven or eight breakfast items that are outlined on a chalk board. I ordered the poached eggs (my favourite!) on spiced black beans with tomatillo salsa, sour cream, lime salted tortilla chips and home fries ($13.95). Absurdly pricey for breakfast\/brunch but at least the portions are big. \n\nThe poached eggs were perfectly cooked and the spicy black bean mixture was ungodly good. The potatoes were smothered in some sort of savoury sauce that tasted a smidge like tamarind but the server couldn't confirm it as it's a \"secret recipe that only two people know.\" I was personally not a fan of the tomatillo salsa but it may have been psychosomatic - I just couldn't get past the pale green\/snot-like colour. It sort of reminded me of relish, and really, who likes relish?\n\nService is on the slow side despite the ample staffing and small number of patrons - I got the impression by today's visit that a lot of the customers are locals and regulars, so it makes for a lot of chatting\/catching up that results in less attentive service. It took so long to get our bill sorted I felt like perhaps I had missed a memo about paying at the counter or something.\n\nCash only.
