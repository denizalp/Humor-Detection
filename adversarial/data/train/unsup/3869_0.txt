My husband and I had tickets to see David Guetta on March 14th here. The line upon arrival moved quickly and it was easy to get in, get a cocktail and a spot on the dance floor. \nThe club itself is really cool and very pretty - would be nice to see \/ experience it during the warmer months out by the pool as perhaps it would be better. \nMy gripes however are as follows:\n1. They WAY oversold the event. There wasn't room to move around without getting shoved\/ spilled on\/ groped, or threatened to be thrown out by a bouncer for 'not moving' when it was impossible to get anywhere.  \n2. After ordering 1 old fashioned, they ran out of bitters. This was before midnight. I then tried to order a Manhattan but they were out of vermouth. Be prepared. \n3. David Guetta did not come on until 2am. I realize this is Vegas but that is ridiculous. Maybe that makes me old but I don't desire to stay out till 5am. I work for a living in a different time zone - so that was rough. \n\nThe house DJ however before the main act was fantastic.
