I don't think Vegas hotels get much better for this price point. Our room had a beautiful view of the Strip. But going to the Wynn and staying in your room is like going to Disneyland and staying in the parking lot! There's lots of shops, restaurants, clubs, pool parties, etc. in the facilities to blow all of your casino winnings on. You could stay here for months and never run out of things to do!\n\nLove it :) Love it :) Love it :) Love it :)
