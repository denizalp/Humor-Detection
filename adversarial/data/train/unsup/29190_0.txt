Dr. Barakat is fun, vibrant and very thorough! Her consultations are free and include a 3D Icat scan for diagnosing your bite. She is contracted with many insurance companies which means you are given a much lower fee for services. When you check in on Yelp you get free whitening! Her staff is very friendly and take great care of their patients. This office doesn't feel like it's just for kids, but there are iPads for kids to play games on.
