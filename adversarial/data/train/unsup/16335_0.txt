Maybe we're spoiled by going to Carrigan Farms up in Mooresville, which is about 10 times the size and with a real bathroom (opposed to NASTY porta potties). But it wasn't just the small size that was a disappointment. \n\nThe maze, logs, and slide were cool, but I think the maze was made out of garbage bags. As far as the strawberries go, there were barely any to be picked and we were only given one box due to the low supply. The organization in the tent was ... unorganized. And the fresh donuts were boxed. I thought we would be eating a just-baked donut. Truthfully, there wasn't much to do here. We left after 10 minutes.
