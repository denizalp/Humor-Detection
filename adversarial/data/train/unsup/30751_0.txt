Celebrated our 1 year wedding anniversary here and our experience was wonderful! We were asked to wait in the bar before we were seated and were  offered drinks right away. We were then seated within 5 minutes. We started off with muscles and three different breads with broth and butter as dipping sauces. Very delicious! As for our main dishes, hubby ordered the halibut with lemon and caper butter and I ordered the Alaskan king crab legs which both dishes were shared. Diana, our fabulous waitress, cracked the crab legs for us at our table so it was easier to eat. For dessert, we shared the amaretto cheese cake, which was very tasty and not overly sweet. \nFor those who are slightly claustrophobic, you actually don't feel so closed in with the restaurant being underground, so I don't think it would be a problem. It was a great experience with delicious food, elegant, but casual ambiance & wonderful service! They have a separate bar service to make sure your drinks are full throughout dinner. \n\nIt's such a neat and romantic place to dine for any special occasion!\n\nHighly recommend this place!
