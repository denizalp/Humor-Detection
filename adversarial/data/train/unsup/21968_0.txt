Our original plan of just hanging out in Quebec City went awry as I investigated the possibility of a turn around bus ride to Montreal. We booked our tickets for the bus ride and embarked on our trek to the bigger city! I tried really hard to get reservations to Au Pie du Cochon because of Anthony Bourdain. After relentless attempts, we were not able to get in! This is where Yelp helps! Looking at the myriad of restaurants, we made our way to L' Express without reservations, we walked in and were able to get a table but needed to be out by 7 because someone was smart enough to reserve a table. We were nicely greeted with a humongo jar of tiny pickles and bread,  boy were those pickles nice and sour! I started with the duck confit salad, it was excellent, with nice tender pieces of slow cooked duck meat cooked in its own fat. I then proceeded with the bone marrow. I was in heaven as my plate made its way, there were enough bones to feast the eyes! The marrow was succulent ad seasoned just right. Slather them bad boys on some toasted baguettes and you just died and gone to heaven! To drink, we tried the house local blonde which was amazing!\nAll in all, I am glad that we stopped in, I think you will be too!
