My friend got my room here for me I originally booked a room at The Rio and he told me to cancel it he'll get me a room here at Vdara. This hotel is located next to the Aria. First thing you'll notice when stepping in is a strong smell couldn't really describe the scent I think it was more flowery scent which was ok at first but then after coming back several times the scent gets to you. This is a small hotel no casino or any gaming here you just have a cafe, lounge and Starbucks. They have conference rooms. All of those are on the same floor and area. The 2nd floor is the SPA and Gym. The 3rd floor is the pool. That's basically it at this hotel. The rooms are very nice and walking distance to the Bellagio and they have a tram that takes you to the Aria and the other way as far as the Park MGM. Room service is provided by little robots like an R2D2 robot from Star Wars. It comes to your room the top opens up and you grab your food I wish I tried it thought about it before I went to bed and forgot when I woke up also you can place your order at Starbucks like using the mobile app. I should have done that but instead I went and waiting in the line. Overall this is a very nice hotel I would definitely stay here again.
