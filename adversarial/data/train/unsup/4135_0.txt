Right.  Let me say that i know how to put things in perspective.  Speaking of perspective Ghost Bar affords you with perhaps the best view in Vegas and one of the best views from a bar anywhere in the world (I would venture that it is in the top 20).  \nDon't go there if you want to dance\nDon't go there if you want cheap drinks\nDon't go there if you want friendly personable service\nAnd for Lord's sake don't go there if you are afraid of heights\nDo go there because you want the experience of your friends freaking out as you jump up and down on a plexiglass floor panel that bends as it tries to keep you 55 floors up in the air.\n(But don't actually jump on the panel.  I'm trying to stay on management's good side)\nDo start out your night there or go when you are still very sober.\nRemember when you are in Vegas things aren't cheap.  Let your credit card off the leash and have some fun.
