\"As seen on TV\" all over the place...\n\nThat is my one memory of this hotel \/ casino...when you go to check your point balance there are piles and piles of \"As seen on TV\" things that you can trade your points for.\n\nYou know that's what I come to Vegas for...to lose my money and get a special thing to grow hanging tomatoes in.  \n\n4 to 5 stars for the rooms\n2 to 3 for the location\n3 for the parking\n\nThe only reason we ever stayed here was because they had a free room promo for out of towners shortly after they opened.  They have BEAUTIFUL rooms.   Every single time I have stayed here I have been very impressed with the room.  The parking is somewhat confusing...there's a huge parking lot and a smaller parking garage.  I would assume the big parking lot is made for all the RVs and big trucks that they would want to stay here.  The parking lot is the reason we made sure to stay here when we were moving from SoCal to Utah.  We could park the 16 foot truck in the parking lot and not have to worry about it...\n\nMy one other complaint is that even though its really nice here it is pretty far from the strip (a couple miles I would assume) and you have to take a shuttle or drive if you wanna hang out on the strip.  When you are staying on the strip you can leave your car parked all weekend and just walk everywhere.\n\nI also wish they had a little better selection of newer slots but that would just mean there were more ways for me to lose my money...and that is never a good thing.    \n\n:0)
