I really like Ten Spot, and they do a great brazilian here. Always a good experience, despite the pain!! Only thing is, it's stupid expensive! That makes this my \"special occassions\" waxer. All the girls that work at Ten Spot are really nice, and the service is great. I love that I can book an appt online, easy easy. Having tried both, I definitely prefer Ten Spot to Fuzz Wax Bar, check my profile to compare reviews.
