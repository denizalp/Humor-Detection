One of the cleanest, safest transit systems I have come across in any city. \n\nBack home, I'd be hidden beneath a hood and large headphones just to avoid the inevitable crazies who have made it their life's mission to torment everyone who rides the rails. Here, I didn't even see anyone who looked remotely crazy. I rode twice - at rush hour and about 9 pm, and everyone on there was either a smiling face or looked like a working professional minding their own beeswax. I was even so bold as to ask a random stranger for directions while at a stop. Something I'd be very particular about doing on the nightmare back home.\n\nMy experience was a one time thing, so I can sympathize with those frequent riders who are requesting more routes, extensions and so forth. But when I can hop on downtown and end up clear on the other side of the city with no delays and for dirt cheap, I'm not going to focus too much on the downfalls or needed improvements. Calgary doesn't have the best transit system, but their setting an example for countless other cities in far worse shape, including my hometown of Sacramento.
