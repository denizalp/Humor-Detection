Had the pleasure of visiting Downtown Cleveland at the Butcher & The Brewer on 10\/02\/2015....didn't know what to expect but that in itself was a treat.....the drinks and food were AWESOME!  Our bartender Kristen suggested some really good ones and each one you thought it couldn't get any better but it did.....I love my libations the food is just a bonus but the  put the 2 together and OMG.....I recommend this laid back atmosphere if your looking for something to do on Friday night......I'll be back!
