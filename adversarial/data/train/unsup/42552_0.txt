Creative spin on bistro fare for lunch and dinner.\n\nBrunch: The quinoa skillet is quite hearty, with roasted tomatoes, tomatoes quinoa, and eggs. Remove the eggs and it's vegan, and I think it's hard to find a savory hearty egg-free breakfast option in Madison (I did enjoy the eggs, though).  Frites are very reasonably priced and a wide selection of sauces.\n\nAs for dinner, the cheese curds were overdone and\/or the oil was a little old (we ordered later in the night).  The sauce with dill was a good addition.  I heard that the salads were amazing, and they were right!  The rocket salad had a very interesting honey lavender dressing and good quality blue cheese, as well as large portions.\n\nService is attentive and very well organized, especially in light of the absolutely enormous space. The decor definitely has some inspiration from Colectivo Coffee's garage door windows, and there are several different areas in the restaurant so you feel a slightly different theme in each area but with a unified theme.  Free wifi, ask the host for a password.\n\nA welcome addition to the Hilldale area.
