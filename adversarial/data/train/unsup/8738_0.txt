Beer o'clock, we dropped into Duckworth's with some sports on the television and a medium busy crowd of after work folks. We took two seats at the bar and ordered our beers. With the beers, a plate of \"ultimate chicken nachos\" that took about ten minutes to arrive while we sipped at beer.\n\nYou don't want to order this by yourself. In fact, it's probably too much for just two people. A full pound of nachos (we were told they fry them here in the kitchen rather than buy them already cooked) and a pound of grilled chicken with a lot of melted cheese, chopped onions and scoops of sour cream and guacamole. We had the jalapenos on the side. It went down well, though I was bummed there were no refried beans under those chips. Isn't that how nachos are supposed to be done?\n\nAnyway, our bartender was friendly and a nice enough guy even if he is a Jets fan.
