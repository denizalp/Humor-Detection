3.5 stars\n\nAfter a failed attempt to dine elsewhere, we ended up at King's.  Unlike Maria Maria, King's was more than happy to promptly seat us without an unnecessary wait.\n\nThere is quite an extensive menu, and a lot of complaints on Yelp about price.  I didn't think it was all that expensive.  Most of the entrees were under $20 and that includes two sides.\n\nI had the crab cakes with french fries and mac 'n cheese.  The crab cakes were good even if not the best I've had.  Mac 'n cheese fell a little short for me.  Not much cheese.  More like mac 'n bread crumbs.  My husband had the king crab legs.  Expensive ($43) but 1 1\/2 lbs and tons of crab meat.  I tried and it was delicious.\n\nWe had excellent service.  Could not have asked for better!  My one suggestion would be to serve the sourdough bread warm!  At least until June!
