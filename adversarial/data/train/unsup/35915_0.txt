This DQ is always clean and friendly.  We went to the drive through the other day, and they forgot a cone, so I went inside to get the forgotten cone.  I wasn't upset, it happens and I just showed my receipt and asked for the cone.  The employee went straight to the manager, who sent the drive through guy over with a card for a free Blizzard and an apology!  I really didn't need all that, just the cone would have been fine, but it was such a grand gesture in this day and age!  I was SO impressed with their customer service.  That is how things should be done!  Kudos!!
