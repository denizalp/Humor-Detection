At first it took awhile getting used to this park, but after moving in the area it became a common hangout for me. Yes being on Queen Street there are lots of hipsters and some of them do things like play with hula hoops, slack line and kick a bag around. Anything but real sports because its pretty tough in skinny jeans to kick a ball.\n\nThis winter though has been something else and just as I decided to embrace Canadaism further, and take up hockey as my winter sport.\n\nThe ice rink here is great, the schedules are available online and it is never busy for public skate as some of the more commercial rinks. Usually I go when there is adult shinny and have to say the guys have been pretty welcoming allowing a newbie like me to join in and play, even though I spend much of my time falling over. \n\nSo NHL might be not far off but in the meantime I got this great park to live with and although during the summer it can be full of weirdos; there are none at the moment so take your sledges and go ride into some dog shit.
