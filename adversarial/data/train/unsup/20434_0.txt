Slipping...\n\nThings continue to slip here & that makes me very sad. We've been here on a handful of occasions and really enjoyed it but the last few times haven't been up to par. \n\nLet's begin with the good stuff. Wine, wine & even more wine! This is how the conversation goes with the waiter ~\n\nWaiter: White or red?\nMe: Both please\nWaiter: (laughs) So you've been here before...\n\nYou get wine with your meal & I'm happy to say that I've never once left here not tipsy :) \n\nDoes the food taste better when you're tipsy? Sure it does...\n\nWe always order the same two meals; cheese ravioli with a marinara sauce and Chicken Rio (chicken breast smothered in a creamy white sauce over noodles and veggies on the side). Both are usually good but on this last trip both were barely warm and our chicken dish had hardly any sauce on it. Each meal comes with a soup or salad and we get one of each. My man gets the minestrone which was sent back this time because it was lukewarm & poorly seasoned and I get the salad which is really consistently great. This time I noticed they added croutons which is unnecessary and they were so hard that one of them left a little cut in my mouth :( \nPlease get rid of these hard croutons....\n\nThe garlic bread is fantastic here and always comes out straight out of the oven and you also get sweet cappuccinos with whipped cream for dessert. I love the sweet ending! Let me also mention the old school ambiance that looks like a hoarders dream. I dig it and it's fun and on the dark side which is always extra romantic. \n\nService has always been great and not sure what's going on in the kitchen but we hope they get it together. We might give it another chance but no more after the next try if things don't improve.
