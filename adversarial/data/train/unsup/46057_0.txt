Just got back from Vegas and was here on Saturday for labor day weekend. Incredible! Just think of it as the playboy mansion on steroids!\nGot here around 1pm with hardly any wait at all. Steve Angello was spinning and kept everybody pumped. \n\nThis place is a must for everyone vacationing in vegas. I'll be back for sure!
