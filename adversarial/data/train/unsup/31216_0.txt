Ate here last night and the BBQ plate that I had was so so.  Beef brisket was tough, shredded chicken was a tad too dry and the pulled pork was ok. Ended throwing away the brisket! The corn bread was so small it shouldn't be considered a side!  It was just meat and 2 sides and they don't even give you bread or roll.  In Texas where I came from, BBQ there is so much better and they give you all the hot rolls you want!!  Since moving back to Phoenix we had tried other BBQ places here and they were better!\n\nWell tried this place one more time 5-1 -17. Most likely will never come back! Had their pulled pork sandwich and the bun was very stale and hard! Pulled pork was terrible and had so many hard pieces in it. Had a side salad and it just came with lettuce and a couple of cherry tomatoes with ranch dressing that tasted like it was old! I think I'll go now over to Dickeys instead!!
