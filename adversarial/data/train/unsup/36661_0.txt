Clean, bustling restaurant with solid Taiwanese dishes! Came here around 7:30 and waited a solid 45 minutes before we were able to be seated. Fortunately, service here is REALLY FAST and our first dish came out within 5 minutes of ordering. We got the braised beef noodle soup, bok choy with oyster sauce, pork soup dumplings, and minced pork noodles (zhajiangmian). Everything was really good. You can choose either thin or thick noodles - we got thin for both and it was pretty good.\n\nBeef noodle soup - definitely hits the spot when you're having a craving. Large pieces of beef and good broth (just slightly bland for my taste) I was surprised to see broccoli in my bowl though as I'm more accustomed to bok choy.\n\nBok choy - not much to report here. Good serving size and you have the option of either pork or oyster sauce. Server recommends oyster sauce.\n\nMinced pork noodles - this was amazing. It reminded me so much of home and the ratio of noodle to toppings was perfect. This is not the sweet kind of bean sauce FYI and make sure you mix this thoroughly! I will definitely order again.\n\nSoup dumplings - did not have high expectations for this to be honest but these were actually very good! They're on the smaller side but the peels were thin enough to not be overly chewy and still thick enough that they don't break easily. Comes with the vinegar sauce and optional ginger (I recommend). So good and glad that there's a good soup dumplings place in Pittsburgh!
