We used to love this bar and grill, but not anymore! Ribs were fatty, chicken fried steak was all breading, chili was horrible with a big ball of frozen sour cream in it!! Service was horrible!!  Prices too high for the quality of food.  We have never been so disappointed.  Coffee tasted like it was weeks old.  Needless to say, will not be back!
