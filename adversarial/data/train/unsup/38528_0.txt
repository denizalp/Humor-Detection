I recently visited Banner URgCare at this location and was impressed every step of the process. Check in was quick and easy. I was immediately taken to an exam room, my vitals taken by a very kind med tech who showed concern for my comfort. The Physician's Assistant was professional, caring, friendly and expertly assessed my injury and sutured my hand. The facility is immaculate, organized, well staffed and efficient in providing exactly what   I needed --urgent care. The following up visits were just as easy and pleasant for both check up and suture removal. This office provided me peace of mind for any situations where my husband or myself need immediate care. What a great addition to the neighborhood. I would highly recommend to friends, family or neighbors!
