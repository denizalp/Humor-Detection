Quite possibly the best bar food I have ever eaten. \n\nCod tacos? Bacon and cheese burger? HOLY MOLY. \nThe burger was, by far, my favourite... ever.\n\nBar food prices for amazing quality, I was very impressed. The service was great, our servers were helpful and so kind. The bar wasn't too packed, but pleasantly active. \n\nI will definitely be coming back for more!
