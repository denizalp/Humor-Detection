\"I'll rip you a new one!\" Is what the owner said to me if I reviewed him on yelp! Can you believe that? Well here's my review! Love to see what response I will get from him! \n\nFirst off, I purchased a livingsocial deal for my husband and I for the detox package. Essentially, I called to get info before purchasing. After a few days, they called back and told me to book online and I mentioned both my husband and I would need services together and that we both had livingsocial deals and they said NO PROBLEM! \n\nWe booked it and was excited to go. Drove 40 mins to get here! When we got there, the owner said to us that we couldn't use the deals together at the same time even though we are two separate people! Said something about livingsocial doesn't allow it and can't separate appt. Essentially gave us some BS. \n\nSo we said fine we'll just get a refund from livingsocial and he proceeded to go off on us...telling us to go right ahead and get a refund. Then threatened to \"rip us a new one\" if we write a bad review...really?! The best part is that he threatened to track my husband down and write a bad review about him because he was wearing a work shirt!!! Never came across such bad business ethics...please save yourself the trip and confrontation with such a terrible person - you've been warned!!!
