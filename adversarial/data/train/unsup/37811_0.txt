I really like this place. My car was cheap, I got a free upgrade, and I got a chip in my windshield and they waived it due to the damage waiver. Staff were busy but they took the time to drive me to where I needed to go so I wouldn't have to take the bus and be cold.\n\nI've had other experiences here that were good too, but this time they went a step above and I really needed that (car broke down). Staff were very friendly.
