I only make it out to Downtown Container Park when we have out of town guests and want to show them a different side of Vegas. Luckily, I had a guest last week and took advantage of the visit by sneaking over to JinJu Chocolates. We were greeted with samples of pecan caramel clusters and in those few bites, I finally got to taste what everyone was raving about. Their chocolate is well-crafted and leagues above your average Hershey's bar. The price point is steep in comparison, but the quality cannot be beat. I ended up buying some pecan caramel clusters for later (and got a free one upon yelp check-in) and also purchased some chocolate covered pretzels to give to coworkers. They packaged the chocolate in a cute paper bag (which you could use as a gift bag) and inserted two small ice packs at the bottom so the chocolate wouldn't melt. Their thoughtfulness and tastiness warrants return visits :D
