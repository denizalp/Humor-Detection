I bought my Mini Cooper-preowned in 2008 and have had it consistently serviced at Hendrick Mini.  My service rep, Dana, has always worked hard to make sure my car runs great.  She goes the extra mile to make sure that I am happy with the service. Due to the great customer service I receive from Dana, I will be a Mini owner for years to come.
