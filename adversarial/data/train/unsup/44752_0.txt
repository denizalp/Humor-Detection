Today, I ordered from here for my daughter because she wanted BBQ wings for after school. I haven't been here for 20 years so I really wanted to find a good wing place. The stench when you walk through the door should of sent me running, but against my better judgment went in anyway. So I ordered the honey BBQ and the garlic parm wings. 20 some dollars later with a 5 dollar tip, I left for home. When my daughter opened them the plastic  container they put them in was open and the sauce was every where . OMG some plastic wrap would of fixed that ,but you have to care about your product.  So we looked in and noooo they were both buffalo wings . So I call to tell them they got our order wrong. A sorry would of been enough for me but no they seriously tell me that no, they remember the order and that it was put out right. And after a few minutes of  back and forth I bring them back to show them that yes you gave me the wrong order. So I go back and they take them back in the kitchen. I could see in the kitchen  and the chef was laughing at the fact that I would bring them back I guess. Then the girl comes out and tells me that  the order was correct  and because they cannot  tell which one was which they would remake the BBQ wings. What you can't tell but we should be able to? The other girl asked me if I wanted a refund  and the first girl says no no refund. By the way, I didn't ask for one. I told them I wasn't  looking for free food and they could keep it. They had poor customer  service and where was the manager, hiding in the back???? If every wing you sell tastes like every wing you sell, count me out. There are way better places to get wings like across the street . You messed up. You could of done the right thing and gained a loyal customer. But you chose to  go the other way. Shame on you one star is one to many
