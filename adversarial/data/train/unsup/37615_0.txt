Worst experience ever. Do yourself a favor and do not use western States flooring (somehow they are the only company home depot uses). Home depot will not schedule your install and western States flooring won't contact you until well after your order arrives. It's taken well over a month and guess what my floors still aren't done. Then home depot calls and says western States flooring won't be there today like they are supposed to and if I'd like to reschedule I would need to contact them. Well why didn't western States flooring just call me then??? So I call western States flooring and...no answer!!!
