Praise God.....for someone FINALLY getting it right!!!\n\nPulling up into valet, I knew instantaneously that my stay here would be a pleasurable experience. The location alone sold me, especially after I'd cancelled my reservation at Luxor due to their hot tub jets not functioning! Who the hell wants a hot tub with no jets? Come on now!!! I've got a bath tub at home. \n\nAnyway, as I digress on my vent fest - I booked a suite at Rumor and upon my arrival I immediately took notice to some mongoloid visiting from out of town and\/or attempting to argue with the front desk associate on shift at the time. This \"soon to be guest\" held up the line to check in for a good 20 minutes arguing over the $11.99 \"Las Vegas Resort\" fee. Are you kidding me??? He testified to the Holy grail that the Rumor website and\/or Expedia didn't advertise this fee. To speed up the line, I offered to pay the damn fee for him! \n\nHell, after suffering through 5 hours of traffic from LA to Vegas - the last thing I want to hinder me from enjoying myself is some idiot arguing over twelve damn dollars! Compliments to the guy on shift (I don't want to give out your name) but his composure was above reproach as I surely would've caught a case over this entire ordeal had I been in his position.\n\nMoral of that story: Beware of incompetent out of town idiots....ya' can't please everyone!\n\nMoving on .....passing up the bar where I requested a pineapple kamikaze (you've gada' try this!!!), I went on up to the room and one would've thought I'd opened the door to Heaven. The white decor' aside of the gray and purple theme was absolutely captivating. It reminded me of my own home and in turn I was entranced by nothing short of an inundation of modern, chic - comfort. The photos don't do this place justice. \n\nBedding arrangements - PLUSH. Noise encountered by way of other guest(s) - NONEXISTENT. The staff - WELL TRAINED and patient (see story from above). The decor - STRAIGHT OUT OF COSMO or TRAVEL MAGAZINE. The location was just off of The Strip so I was able to avoid traffic and fyi, Hard Rock, located directly across the street, has a 24 hour restaurant allowing you to dine locally and come back to enjoy your room alongside a martini or 2. The purple hammocks by the pool area were a nice touch as well...\n\nLove it!!!\n\nSuffice it to state, I've located my new favorite hotel. I look forward to my next visit.
