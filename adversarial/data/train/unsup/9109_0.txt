Out of town and realized your hooha hasn't seen the daylight? Didn't realized you're off your dot? Perfect! Time to bear fruit. \n\nI was able to make an appointment within hours and they have a special rate of $20 for first timer and $35 after for a full Brazilian wax. The receptionist was quick, but a little too fast where I can't hear what she was saying. Lol. \n\nThe receptionist red head lady can use a smile once in a while. Either she has a RBF or having a bad day, either way her tone was not friendly. \n\nMy esthesian was Jennifer. She was super friendly and does an amazing job. I've been waxing for 9 years and been frequently wax the past 3 years - by far this was the least amount of pain I ever felt! \n\nOverall happy camper. This could be my gig if I decide to move here for a traveling job at a hospital nearby.
