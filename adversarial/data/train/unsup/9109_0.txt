The food here is good.  The location is less than desirable.  Chicken Katsu was good.  The sweet BBQ sauce it comes with is great.  The spicy chicken plate is probably my favorite of what I have tried.  The macaroni salad that comes with each plate is just ok.\n\nThe shopping center this place is located in is fairly run down and the interior of this place was a bit dated.  Go for the food and forget the ambiance.  Overall I'd eat here again.
