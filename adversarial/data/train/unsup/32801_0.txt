I came here once with a medium sized group and I seriously can't wait to come back and try more! I had a few tacos and drinks (be sure to redeem their Yelp deal, if they still have it!)..everything was delicious and priced great.\n\nThe guac was awesome and all the other food (nachos, other tacos) smelled and looked amazing. Definitely going to be planning a trip back when I can order a bunch and try it all.
