We went there with a voucher. We wait about 30 min to have a table ready for us. Every items we ordered was in the middle range. Notting special. I had better sushi in the other restaurants with better prices.\nUsually I never go to this class of restaurant. I just went because Of the promotion. I don't think I go to this restaurant again.
