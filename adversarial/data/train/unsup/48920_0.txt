First time here and last, there are to many other places to eat decent sushi that I won't have to go back to this place. When I got there on a Friday night after 8:00, we were seated at the last table that was part of the prep area or kitchen not sure which. I asked the server if they had any happy hour specials and she said no, I turned the menu around and they had a big red area that said happy hour! I asked another server if this was good right now and she said yes, so I guess the first one didn't hear me correctly. Anyway, the sushi tasted like it was pre packaged and not good. I can't figure out where all the 5 star reviews come from.
