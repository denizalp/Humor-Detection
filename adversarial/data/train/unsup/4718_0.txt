Who thinks of breakfast when you think of Sonic!! Absolutely me. I usually go to sonic for the Cherry limeade my favorite, tots an chili dogs, but not this time. So French toast lover that I am I decided to try the French toast sticks an wholly Moses I'm glad I did. They are the best French toast sticks since jack in the box which doesn't have them anymore. They are full of cinnamon goodness. An they smell as good as they taste. This has become my new favorite fast food French toast stop. I have also tried the breakfast sandwiches an they are great as well. So longer is sonic just my cherry limeade place. So if you haven't tried them for breakfast you should. Everyone is always friendly an I get great service. An if it's busy the line always moves fast.
