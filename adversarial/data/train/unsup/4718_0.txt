If you love chocolate, you will definitely love this place! Every time I am in Vegas, I make time to visit this place for some cookies to bring home to my loved ones...by that I mean my left overs (joking...kind of). The desserts here are great! I enjoy the cookies and brownies. They store staff are friendly and quick. You can find anything Hershey related here and its great. They have a huge selection on souvenirs you typically do not find else where. This place is definitely worth a visit!
