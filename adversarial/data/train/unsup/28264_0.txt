Apparently an appointment time is of no relevance.  Made appt for 7:30 and lobby was full of about 20 plus people.  I was told by the receptionist my wait time was going to be at least hour and a half.  When I asked her what the purpose of an appointment time was and why I was told to come at this time she was rude with her response that this is what it is.  Will be going elsewhere....
