@ Steve S. Why would you give 1 star when you haven't tried the place and are asking a question?  Well the answer to your question is YES the pizza is as good if not better.  Since the new owners took over my orders don't get messed up and WOW have they cleaned the place up!  The Big Boy slice is a great lunch deal.  The staff is friendly and the cooks don't stand there and mumble to themselves.  I really like what they have done with the place and will be going back for more!
