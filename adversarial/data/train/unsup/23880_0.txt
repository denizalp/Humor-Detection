2.5 years ago a tech came out to look at my 2 year old Trane unit. They replaced the motor and sold me on a Preventive Maintenance program so they come out once per year to check the unit & do a tune up until 2015.  5\/14\/11 they came out because the unit stopped working.  The tech said the motor was toast & fan blades damaged.  He said (not knowing that their company had just been out months before) that whoever worked on the unit last was responsible for what happened because they moved the wires for the motor over so that the fan blades were hitting them.  This caused serious damage & burn to the fan blades & it's what caused the motor to go out.  The last person to touch that unit was the tech from Ace Air that came out to do the preventative maintenance a few months ago!  Then they try charging me $968 for the new motor & fan blades.  1st of all my motor was under warranty since they just replaced it 2.5 years ago & 2nd of all they're telling me that their tech that came out a few months ago is the reason anything happened to the unit.  It took an hour & a half of the tech going back & forth with the office just to try & resolve it. They tried to ignore everything that my Preventive Maintenance contract promises (lifetime warranty on parts replaced, 20% off of new parts, & labor rates) which is what took so long. I ended up paying an agreed price for fan blades & labor.  When they called to schedule the time to replace the fan blades we discussed what the tech said.  After calling the tech they came back & told me they would not charge me for the fan blades (which I had already paid for on 5\/14).  After never receiving a credit I called & they told me that they didn't owe me a credit because the invoice showed that I only paid for labor.  So basically after talking to me & hearing that I didn't have a receipt they changed the invoice to show the same total but for only labor (at $98\/hour more than my contract price).  After about 3 weeks of going back and forth now, nothing is resolved.  I have never dealt with such a unethical and shady company.  I have a copy of a maintenance program that I purchased, yet they don't want to honor anything it says in it.  I would BEWARE of doing business with Ace Air.  Every minute of my interaction of them over the last months has been horrible.  It's one lie after another with them.  This should have been a simple thing & 2 months later I'm out $239.  At this point I could care less about the money, people just need to know that they don't honor the contracts they sell to people.  There are many other AC companies in AZ, I would definitely skip doing business with Ace Air!
