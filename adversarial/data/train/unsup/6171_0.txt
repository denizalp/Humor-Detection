the heydays of vegas are officially OVER.\n\ngone are days of free booze, superb service, and free parking.\n\nit's been a while since we've visited vegas via car and were greeted with a $15\/day self-parking charge at the encore.  what i don't understand is the need to nickle and dime customers, especially hotel guests!  hotel guests should be exempt from this parking fee nonsense, esp when we're already paying $39 \/ night resort fee on TOP of our nightly rates.\n\nthere goes $30 we could've easily handed over to the casino from gambling, but nope, paid ot towards parking fee.\n\ndear vegas, if you want to nickle and time your guests, be prepared for some tight purse strings from us.
