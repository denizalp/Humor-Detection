The music: LOL at the reviewer below, who said, \"I refuse to believe that hip hop is dead, but Light nightclub likes to say it with an exclamation point.  How can you not have a hip hop room???  Not everyone in Vegas is poppin Mollys to enjoy EDM all night long!\" READ MY MIND. When the featured DJ Alleso came around around 1 AM that's when the music actually started to sound like music... but for the 3 hours prior, it was a tragic train wreck of EDM beats. Can we all return to hip hop please? Or at least quality DJ's all night long. \n\nThe ambiance: Design-wise, Light doesn't really stand out in any way. I really wish it did, as that's what makes a club unique, stand out, and have curb appeal. I'm sure if you turn on the lights (har har), it's just be an open, two-story space. It's their sirk de solay (JK, Cirque de Soleil) that they're known for. BUT... Am I the only who thinks it's entertaining in the moment, but also creepy as hell?? These are the stuff nightmares are made of! I can't tell if these aero bound entertainers are male or female so it's definitely not sexy. Actually, yes, creepy is probably the best word. Then you have these creepy men on pogo sticks hopping around, and a BDSM guy dancing on the ledge and I'm just fearing for his life and safety. The full screen display of the half naked dancers ups the cool\/creepy factor. It's like you're watching them dance in a steamy shower room, if that's what you're into... \n\nThe space: Crowded. Human sardines. Pilgrimage ship. I wouldn't have been to fond of it had we not had our own table, IMO. This seemed to be the general group consensus. \n\nThe drinks: Patron shots were good...went down smooth. But then again you can't quite mess up on that, can you?
