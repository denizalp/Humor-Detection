Dined here with my hubby during our Las Vegas honeymoon. We were seated downstairs immediately and approached within moments by George, who was very knowledgeable and gave wonderful recommendations. \nMy husband ordered the Cioppino and I ordered the Crab Duo, both were absolutely delicious, best cioppino I've ever tried. \nOur next trip to Vegas will definitely include another dining experience here.
