I have been dying to try The Peppermill Restaurant since I moved to Vegas and I finally did. The atmosphere is really Vegas, from the lighting, decor and vibe. The service was great and the food was really tasty and were huge portions. I decided on the chicken Alfredo and it was creamy and delicious. My wife ordered the Pesto Burger with fries and she said it was great. My daughter had the kids pancake and it was huge. We will be back soon!
