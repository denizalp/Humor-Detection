It's time to update my review and give it a more fair assessment. I've been a member for almost a year now, and this gym just isn't the same. Before I continue, I am going to say that I cancelled my membership last night.\n\nI had a brief conversation with Stan W. on Sunday about gyms, and it got me thinking about my choice in facilities. I started thinking about LA Fitness in a more critical light.\n\nThe equipment is all the same, but isn't maintained the way it should be. When a machine needs to be repaired, it may take two-to-three weeks. \n\nThis has become such an overcrowded gym. During peak hours, and even on weekends, I've found myself waiting for benches, cardio machines, cable machines and such for upwards of 15-20 minutes. \n\nPeople don't re-rack their weights here, both on the bars, and with the dumbbells. It's like the idiot meathead convention all showed up to this particular location. You'd think the staff would take care of this, but no. They are too busy selling memberships and keeping this place overcrowded.\n\nThe overcrowding has taken it's toll on the locker rooms too. The men's room used to be pristine, and regularly cleaned. This is no longer the case. It's now a cess pool, and smells like a horrible burrito incident. Stay away. Pray to the good lord that you don't need to take a leak after you work out. \n\nParking at this gym? A joke. It's next to impossible if you go after work. I've spent several minutes of my life circling the lot, looking for a spot.\n\nNow, you are thinking....Dave, why are you being a dick right now? Why so negz? Well...if you want to know the positives of this gym, try the spin class at 6:45 on Thursdays. Fred is the instructor. You can't miss him. He has a mustache. He is awesome. His music is great!\n\nNot really sure what is the deal with the juice bar. I never saw it open, but a couple days back, I saw a sign that said \"Business Opportunity\". Guess it's for sale. Classy.\n\nIf you are still reading this, you are either bored at work, interested in what I have to say, or making a decision on a gym. Choose wisely. \n\nI cancelled my membership last night. I chose a smaller, local business. Afterall, I'm a Yelper. An Elite. Local business is where I prefer to spend my money.\n\nThis place is a chain, and you feel it when you walk in....and not in the good way.
