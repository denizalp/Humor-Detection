Pretty awful experience here. It's dirty, and by that I mean we saw several cockroaches skittering around. Plus even though it doesn't advertise ANYWHERE that it's a coin-less laundromat, it is. This means you have to pay $2 for a card and then take it over to these machines on the wall where you can then put money on the card. We still had $1.50 on the card when we were done and even though the cards are \"refundable\", they would not give us our $2 for the card AND the remaining balance on the card. She said we could keep the card for next time. My husband told her there wouldn't be a next time and she just shrugged and said sorry then! We would've just left to begin with but it was getting late and we really needed to do laundry. Ugh!
