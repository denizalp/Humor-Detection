Finally, we have found what we think is Phoenix's best traditional Italian Margherita Neapolitan pizza! The crust is cooked perfectly, the San Marzano tomato sauce AMAZING, the Bufala mozzerella and fresh basil - just spectacular! We add a touch of garlic to ours and its PERFECTO!\n\nThe prices are a bit high but for pizza this good, I am quite okay with paying it! We love to sit outside and enjoy a fresh slice of heaven and have great conversation! \n\nYou really cannot go wrong with anything you order here. It IS the best pizza so far that we have found in town. Now if you are a person that likes a hundred toppings or craving that typical fast food pizza chain taste, this is not your place, though I would highly recommend you try!\n\nI have read a review that Pino's makes a better Neapolitan pizza but its off the menu and you have to ask for it. We plan to try that and I may re-review if it is better than Pomo's but for now Pomo's is where it is at. \n\nJust a quick side note to the owner - we have been several times and plan to keep going. But one night in particular you were chatting with the table next to us and you were SO LOUD that we could not hear ourselves think or much less carry on a convo between the two of us. It was the one and only time of being there that I wanted to take our delicious pizza and leave, it was so bad. While I think it is great you love to mingle with your guests please keep in mind that the whole restaurant doesn't need to hear you. But regardless your pizza is too good not to come back over and over again!
