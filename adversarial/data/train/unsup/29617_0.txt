Hmm.  Just made my 6th visit to this place in the last couple months.  Needless to say, I am a fan.  The coffee and crepes are excellent - the savory turkey is a favorite.  The house made granola is killer.  They amped up the ambience recently by adding art work which makes for a nice, homey feel.  Prices are absolutely reasonable.  \n\nHowever, they appear to be suffering from some growing pains.  My husband and I visited last Saturday and waited 45 mins (!!) for our meal.  By the time our order came our coffee had grown cold.  When I asked for a refill I was told I'd need to get it myself (\"because if I go get it, they'll charge you\".)  I also ordered a bag of granola at the counter and had to remind the cashier twice before I finally received it.  The food was good, as usual, but overall the visit was frustrating.  Even the staff seemed confused.  \n\nMy suggestions to the owners are simple.  Figure out your service model.  If you're offering counter service, then develop a system that lets me know when my food is ready.  An even better idea would be to hire wait staff.  I'd rather drink hot coffee with my meal and eat my desert crepe after I've completed my entree.  I'd also suggest losing the t-shirt rack near the front door.  None of the shirts said Crepe Bar (?) so it was hard to figure out what the point was.  \n\nI'll definitely be back, hoping for the best.  Good luck to the owners as they continue to work the kinks out.\n\nUPDATE:  Last 3-4 visits were flawless so I'm upgrading to 5 stars.  Go Crepe Bar!
