What the hell?! They changed and shortened their menu and not for the better either. \n\nMy Royale (braised short ribs burger) and the Jose Andres burger are no longer on the menu. \n\nThey have a bigger alcoholic menu than their food menu!!! Argh..not pleased about that. There's seriously way better burger joints to go to than THIS place. Move on. Nothing to see here.
