The owner, Ana, an older Croatian woman, is unhinged. If you stand near the window, often she will come out and order you in. She arbitrarily names prices. Sometimes she makes paranoid or strange comments. She often kicks out anyone speaking in French, or will just kick out anyone for any reason whatsoever. She opens and closes the shop randomly, sometimes stays open at midnight...Yes, she is basically Montreal's Soup Nazi. Her behavior is erratic, at times rude and discriminatory. Other times quite pleasant; if you treat her with respect, she might have a conversation with you for 20 minutes or even offer you generous free samples (as she did my friend- incidentally, Asian- and I). She likely has some 'mental health issues' (maybe even schizophrenia). However, maybe we can look at this as a positive- as a kind of tourist attraction. Who knows what she'll do. Who knows whether you'll be able to buy any of the delicious pastries. \"No pastries for you!\" The expectation is a nonstop thrill-ride that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Incidentally, the pastries she makes herself (she makes a small batch on her own, and sources the rest from Cheskie's and other good bakeries) are out of this world, the most authentic and tastiest Eastern European pastries in Montreal. Poppy seed buns highly recommended. Gamble with fate to see if you can get any! - And when she prepares food, she does so mindfully, and portions are generous - Baked goods out front, and the rest of the space is devoted to imported products from the Balkan countries and hot sandwiches
