Hidden coffee gem in the underground at King station.  I read the previous reviews and thought I'd try a new coffee shop near work.  I went after lunch and there was still quite a line up.. When you get to the front of the line, they ask you to choose a cup size, apply a sticker that matches accordingly to what you would like to drink, then they ask for your name.  I decided to try their Mango Chai Latte, as this seemed to be a popular drink that many other Yelpers have tried.  I don't usually drink Chai but thought I'd give it a go. Definitely recommend trying it.  It has a subtle taste of mango thats not too overpowering and it's really smooth and delicious.  The second time I came by I was hooked on the Mango Chai Latte, and the third time I tried their Cappucino.  I have to say that the Cappucino tasted just as good as the Mango Chai Latte.  So I'd probably say this is my new favourite coffee shop at the moment.  If you go in the morning, expect a long line up, but for the most part they're pretty quick at serving everyone because they always have enough friendly staff working there.  The only thing I have to complain about is how many times they have spelt my name wrong and failed miserably!.. Hopefully the next time around they'll get it right.
