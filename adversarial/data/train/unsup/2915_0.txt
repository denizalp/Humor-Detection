If I could give 0 stars, I would. I made a reservation on Expedia.com to pick up a car. They specifically say that you do not need to confirm. I get off the flight with my wife and son and pick up a shuttle to get to the car rental pickup area. Unfortunately, there bootleg company is across the street. I walk past Sixt and notice this unattractive building with a few cars on the lot. \n\nI thought, at least I got a good price. I walk into the office to get my rental car. The front desk person asks if I have a reservation. Yes. She looks it up and states that it was given away to someone else! What? Why? It has been more than 2 hours since the time I was supposed to pick it up! Are you F***ing kidding me? I was livid! I will NEVER rent with Nu Rental Car and recommend Yu Du the same!
