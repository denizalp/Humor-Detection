Completely blown away.  I was dragging my feet about seeing a Cirque de Soleil show because I had seen them on Bravo and felt like I had the general idea and didn't need to drop a bunch of cash to see it in person.  I am sooo glad I went.  In fact I would like to go back and listen to the music again with the lyrics and then see it again to pick up on what I missed.  There was so much going on related to the lyrics that went right over my head because I didn't know all of them.  I think this would appeal to anyone - I really can't even imagine why it wouldn't.  If you're debating about going to see this show, don't - go.  You won't regret it.
