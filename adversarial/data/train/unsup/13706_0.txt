Stepping off the greyhound bus, my eyes scanned the street for my favourite sushi spot. I uttered a cry when I realized it had been replaced by Beijing dumpling something or other. But I absolutely had to eat right away. Red lobster caught my eyes.\n\nThe meal started strong. The infamous biscuits curbed my appetite. The mojito was surprisingly sweet and refreshing.\n\nThe coconut shrimp was a total miss (too dry, dipping sauce too sweet).\nI ordered the blue sirloin steak and was given the wrong order, but they quickly remedied the situation and threw in a skewer of garlic shrimp. Unfortunately they also threw in broccoli instead of my side salad.\n\n My friend had the crab linguini and it was pretty fab and a huge portion. Calorie galore but really tasty. And great for a doggie bag. \n\nI RECOMMEND- the mojito. It's really hard to find a good one in this city. \n\nEXTRA TIP- as far as chains go, this one is a bit steep. $60 for two main courses, one shared appy and one cocktail? Blimey.
