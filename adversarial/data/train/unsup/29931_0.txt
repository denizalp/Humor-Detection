Good Chinese bakery. I bought a honeydew flavoured Swiss roll here and totally enjoyed it. Other items looked tempting as well. And the store was clean - huge plus\n\nThis place was suggested by my hair stylist. She lives closer to other bakeries in Chinatown but recommends this one to me. I think it says something.
