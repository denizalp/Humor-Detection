Absolutely without a shadow of doubt the most incredible Thai food I have ever had. Hubby, bro and sis agreed. Appetizers we can vouch for: Pad Hed, Miang pou lettuce wraps and Nua nam tok. Felt bad for ordering Pad Thai because come on, you can get that everywhere and they have so many unique dishes, but I think I just found out what pad Thai is supposed to taste like. More savory, less sugary, little slice of lime. Oooo food coma comin on.
