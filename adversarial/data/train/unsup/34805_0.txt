I'm just going to get it out of the way upfront - this is located in a mall (Parkway) and in the food court.  Yup...tucked away in a corner is this gem.  After a long day of doing errands, I needed something in this mall and was debating if I should pick up some fast food or if I could  make it home without dying of hunger.  \n\nI decided I needed to get something to eat before leaving and decided to give this place a try based on yelp reviews.  Not disappointed in the least!  YUM\n\nI ordered the beef shawarma - you it with rice and 2 salads (i got the bean salad and just a green salad).  Then you add the sauces, (make sure to say yes to the hot sauce!).  It's moist and tender and the flavours just melt into your mouth.\n\nFor me the portion size was really good - had enough left over for lunch the next day - and it tasted even better!\n\nIt is a bit pricey for a mall food court, but so so worth it.
