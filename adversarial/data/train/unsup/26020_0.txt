I ordered a wonton noodle with added soysauce chicken. It was a \"robbery\" with 2 pieces of chicken, 5 wontons, 3 pieces of greens and the noodle was like  left over from stir fry chowmein and no more than 1\/2 a chinese bowl.  The cost was $11.50. I will never eat there again!  I've eatten better.  For that price, I could get 2 orders and with \"real\" chinese wonton noodles!
