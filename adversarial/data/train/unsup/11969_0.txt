I still love JJ's, but I need to remove a star due to their RIDICULOUS delivery area.\n\nI tried to order online, for delivery. I entered my address (same zip code, only about 2 miles away) and it told me they don't deliver there.\n\nThe last time I was in the shop, I asked where they deliver, because this seems crazy to me.  Apparently, they only deliver to Gibson\/215, East to Warm Springs (I think) and South to Greenway.  Greenway is 1 block from me.  So, you're telling me that the snot nosed teenager can't drive 1 more block to bring me a sandwich?  Mmmmkay then, makes total sense.\n\nWhen I was in college, our local JJ's drivers all rode bikes.  If that were the case here, I could understand.....\n\nOther than that, I still love their sandwiches.  The turkey tom, beach club and veggie are my faves.
