Let me start by stating that I am subtracting one star for the dismal, hard to access location\/bathrooms in desperate need of an update; otherwise, I'd give a solid 5 stars for the incredible selection of fine junk food offered in the convenience store. Overall, I would rate Green Valley Grocery a solid 4.5 for the selection and customer service.\n\nWhile the shop itself is quite small, it offers Boyd's organic coffee, a fancy customizable coca-cola machine (like the ones at Terrible's), a milkshake maker (basically ice cream and a special machine to mix it up--it looks pretty freakin' awesome), ICEE machine, a large selection of candy and snacks, etc. Oh, and it's really nicely air conditioned for those hideously hot Las Vegas summer days.\n\nI would also like to highly commend the staff here; every one of their employees is friendly and willing to accommodate special requests. I am working a construction project on I-15 and asked if they could carry the flavored Perrier waters since I prefer those over the unflavored. The next time I was in the shop, they had stocked two different flavors to accommodate my request. Honestly, I was shocked and totally impressed. Even high end stores typically don't fulfill special requests--and if they do--it takes a ridiculously long time. Also, today I went in for a Cherry Vanilla Coke Zero, and to my dismay, the machine was out of cherry flavor. Since this happens to me constantly at Terrible's I figured the employees would tell me I was SOL and that they couldn't fix it. I was thrilled when a man that appeared to be the manager said no problem, we can fix that and sent out an employee to correct the issue immediately. This whole process took about a minute and I was able to get what I came in for. Again, I was totally impressed.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this little spot if you're hungry or thirsty, and happen to be in the area.
