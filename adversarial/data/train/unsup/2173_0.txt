My typical experiences at a buffet. \n\n1. I get my moneys worth no matter what the price is, I repeat, no matter what the price is. \n2. I eat to the point of almost puking. \n3. Not 28 bucks w\/ gratuity. \n\nWhat on Earth went wrong at Cravings?! Please consider renaming to Loss of Appetite. Nothing I repeat, nothing looked tempting enough to reach my plate. \n\nI ate a couple slices of prime rib, guacamole and chips, some steak, fruits, done. \n\nEverything else tasted old.\n\nThe gf went irate because I was not eating. Am I sick?
