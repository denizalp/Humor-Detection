It'll do in a pinch.  But OMG, the kiosk salespeople are soooo annoying I usually stay away.  They will jump in your path.  They will scream, \"Excuse me, maam\/sir!\" loudly and rudely to get you to look.  Some of them have even tried to grab me.  Umm... excuse me, that is battery and I will press charges.\n\nI like parking in the middle parking structure just next to the entrance to Saks Fifth Avenue.  There always seems to be parking and you can easily get into the middle of the mall from there.  Plus the people in Saks are actually nice!\n\nGetting out is a bit of a pain in the ass, especially if you want to go east.\n\nThe Forever 21 is huge! Two stories AND it has a maternity section.  I'm too old to shop there, but it's interesting nonetheless.\n\nThey do little fashion shows on a popup runway every hour or so at the west end of the mall.  Lots of nice couches throughout.  It will get an extra star if they get the kiosk salespeople under control.
