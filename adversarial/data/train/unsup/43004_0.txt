I LOVE this bar... I typically like to come on Tuesdays because I know Jessica will be my bartender and I'm there to hang out with a lot of our mutual friends... which is usually a recipe for a great night. The staff is super friendly and I'd consider some of them close friends after all the years I have been coming here. This is definitely my \"cheers\" bar. \n\nI always get fantastic service, have a lot of fun with all of the games available inside as well as outside (when it's cooler out, obviously... lol!), and I have to say that I have never had any bad food from their kitchen.\n\nI'd highly recommend this place!
