The dude and I love the Hash Kitchen up in North Scottsdale, so we were stoked about one opening up a little closer! Extra bonus points to them for hiring a local artist to paint the dope murals that line the interior. Unfortunately, that's pretty much the only part of the ambience that we were feeling. It was like... clubby? There was a DJ and it was super loud, we could barely even hear each other from across the table. It seemed way more fitting for like an old town brunch place, whereas Hash Kitchen (the other location, anyways) is classy and modern and clean. \n\nWe got to there around 9:30 on a Sunday, and there was no wait for 2 people. We were surprised, but definitely not gonna fight our luck. Our server was awesome: really friendly, quick, and helpful. We started with a flight of mimosas, which were tasty. The champs level was a little weak for most of them, except for the orange. \n\nI had the herb chicken hash at the recommendation of our server, and the dude had the lump crab hash, which is probably his all time favorite breakfast dish at the OG HK. My dish was fine, every part of it was prepared well but it was lacking flavor. A little salt and pepper in fried chicken batter goes a long way, just saying. I'm glad I asked for sriracha because that was basically the only part of the dish that had any flavor. The dude felt pretty much the same way about his hash. He said there was barely any old bay in it, and everything was fine but not at all as mindblowing as the one at the other location. The biscuits that came with both of our hashes were very good. \n\nI don't really know if HK just needs some time to figure out their vibe, but we were pretty disappointed by our experience here. Extra disappointed definitely when comparing it to the other location.
