Just literally miles up the street from the I-215 and  Red Rock Casino off of Charleston, a lot of people don't even know this natural beauty is even here.\n\nFirst, let me get the basics out of the way.\n\nHours of Operation\n- Visitor Center: 8 am to 4:30 pm.\n-13 Mile Scenic Drive: November to February 6 am to 5 pm\n                                    March 6 am to 7 pm\n                                    April to September 6 am to        8 pm \n                                    October 6 am to 7 pm\n\nFees and Annual Passes\n- Daily Fee $7\n- Red Rock Annual Pass $30\n- America the Beautiful Annual Pass $80\n- America the Beautiful Senior Pass $10 one time fee (Lifetime pass for U.S. citizens 62 and older)\n-America the Beautiful Access Pass. Free lifetime pass for U.S. citizens with a permanent disability.\n- America the Beautiful Military Annual Pass. Free. Yearly pass available for active duty military and their dependents.\n\nNow for my thoughts and opinions.\n\nWhat is there not to like? Natural beauty, lots of hiking trails ranging from mild to extreme, and seeing wild animals in their natural habitat if you are lucky.\n\nHere's a typical trip for me and I recommend this to all the newbies to do this as well. Always make the visitor's center your first stop. Why? Because not only is there a gift and souvenir store there, there are various miscellaneous items on display that provide you random information in regards to the venture you are about to partake. Sometimes they have announcements in regards to new and upcoming events that are relevant to your visit.\n\nStep outside to the back of the center and you will encounter hands on exhibits on yes, you guessed it, anything desert and Red Rock related. \n\nThe Visitor's Center closes before the park does, so it doesn't make sense for you to do it after the 13 mile scenic roundtrip for you are basically backtracking because its only one way.\n\nAfter the Visitor's Center, you have your pick of whatever trails and scenic stops along your 13 mile drive. It's up to you how long you wanna stay.\n\nSome random useful info: Always have bottled water with you at all times. Wear the appropriate clothing in conjunction to the weather. For those that just cant take a couple steps without having to use their phone because of the big game or social networking, there are two spots that I know of that gives 2 to 3 bars of intermittent reception which is better than none at all. The first one is at Calico 1, which ironically is the very first trail you run into. The second one is High Point Overlook, which is the halfway point. Your reception is going to be pretty stable as long as you are in the parking lot portion of it.\n\nSo there you have it. Vegas is not always all about casinos, buffets, shows, and 24 hour everything. Even the person with the huge ego will feel humbled at the sight of nature's awesome creation. \n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #7
