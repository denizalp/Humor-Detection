It's been a couple years since I got my eyes checked, and Dr. Nagel was highly recommended by coworkers and conveniently located by the office. I went in on Halloween to a friendly fully-staffed office and everything was quick and easy. I especially like how personable Dr. Nagel herself was, and how the staff were informative about explaining each step of the exam. \n\nI opted for contacts, but like how the glasses selection here trends toward the name brand (Tiffany, Prada, Coach, Kate Spade). I was informed that they also have frame and lens specials under $200. I appreciate that the sales staff weren't pushy, and I'll probably look into a pair when I go in to pickup my lenses.
