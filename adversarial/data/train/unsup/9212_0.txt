Ambiance: Nice\/different. \nService: Really slow. Need to hire additional staff. \nQuality of food: Moderate.\nPrice: Expensive for the little amount you get. \nOrdered: Chicken tikka masala. Room temperature. Would prefer dish to be a little bit more in the hot side. \nTaste: More on the tomato side. Lack seasoning and flavor. \nMore of an Indian American restaurant. \nWould NOT come back. \nRestroom: Well lit and clean.
