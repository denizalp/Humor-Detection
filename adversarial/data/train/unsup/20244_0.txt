I think the options here are great if you eat meat, but if you have anyone in your party who doesn't, the options for them are limited.\n\nThe food itself was ok, though somewhat heavy (naturally because it's fried). The portion is large, but it included only a small amount of carb. If the ratio of meat to carb was different, maybe it will feel different. Rice is cheap...just add a little bit more!\n\nWe sat right next to the kitchen. It was a cold day, so it was nice that it was warm, but I can imagine if it's not cold, we probably would've asked to get moved.\n\nOverall, it's nice to see the area getting more restaurants like this. It adds variety to the other things already in the area.
