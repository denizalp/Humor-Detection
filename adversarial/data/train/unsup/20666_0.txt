What a waste of time this place is!\n\nToday, I moved all my stuff from my 2 bedroom apartment into a 5x10 storage unit. I ended up having alot of \"stuff\" I didn't need anymore that were in almost new condition ranging from toys, clothes, shoes, costumes and small house wares. I decided to go to Goodwill at this location because it was the only one I knew that had a drop off location. So i drove from the other side of town to this place to do a drop off. I figured, \"They have a drop off box and all I have to do is drop off\". Now, I have done drop offs plenty of times at numerous donation centers, but this particular place i have donated 2 times in the last 12 months. Today would've been the 3rd, but I get there, with my UHAUL, that's already late, that's eating up gas, at around 6pm, and this guy was sweeping outside the back doors. It was obvious he worked there because i had asked him if I can just drop off, he goes \"Can't you see the drop box has been turned around because it's not working\". So I asked him, \"OK, well since you're here, can't I just take it inside?\" , he replied,\" NO we closed at 530, you can drop it off at other locations though\". I was like, #1, WTF are you doing that you can't just say, YES! drop it off right here and I'll take care of it? #2, I could've taken the stuff inside myself with no problem if he was just being lazy and hate his job, #3, I'm DONATING to the less fortunate, which they get for FREE, and turn around and SELL. Why won't he accept it?\n\nBottomline, I left that place with such disgust, and NEVER will  I EVER again donate at goodwill.. I ended up driving and doing a drop off at Big Brothers and Big Sisters drop off location on Craig and Ann.  I will never ever donate at this place ever again. . Goodwill you're lucky YELP has 1 star and I can't get lower than this, but you definitely don't even deserve 1 star.. just sayin..!
