Aldi is such a great way to save money on groceries. Ever since they switched their produce to all organic, it has really improved. I always make a point to buy cheese, eggs, and milk here. Its cheaper than anywhere else. I pretty much like everything they sell. Don't forget to bring your own bags and a quarter for your cart!
