Ragstock tends to be hit or miss for me. I usually do a lot better here when I have no direction upon entering. If I have something in mind, I usually strike out here. Browsing the store is an absolute must. It is packed with new and vintage pieces. I love to mix and match, so the amount of variety here is perfect for me. There is a little bit of everything for everyone. Lots and lot of accessories up front. Funny, edgy t-shirts. Classics and retro designs co-mingling on racks. Make sure that you check out the basement here. You'll find a whole room full of clearance tshirts, sweatshirts, pants, tank tops, etc. They have a decent selection of mens clothes too. That is hard to find downtown. They have a large selection of unique items that you may need for a themed party, Halloween, a crazy night out with friends and for those that just love color and design. If you want to become a work of art, this is definitely your place. Don't feel nervous to transform yourself. This place can help.
