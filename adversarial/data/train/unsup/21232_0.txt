I would give zero stars if I could. Do not EVER drop off anything at this dry cleaner. I'm sorry I didn't read the past reviews before I took my clothes there. Not only did they ruin one of my favorite shirts, the customer service is horrible. Get OUT OF THE BUSINESS. You have no idea what you are doing. After talking with Russ the manager, he said he's been taking my shirt all around town trying to find out what went wrong?? It's been a month. Take care of your customer and then find out what went wrong. He now says he doesn't believe it really shrink. Um do you really think I need this head ache?!? Arguing with me and then hanging up on me. Really? Manager material. The owners were both very nice but apparently don't know how to run a business or they would have handled it after several calls. More trivial stuff like bent hooks on another shirt and dull whites also. On a side note I have never written a review about anyone on here or ever had a bad experience with a dry cleaner. Let my lesson be yours...DO NOT USE THEM. Sorry Tide!!!\n\nIt is no surprise that NO ONE FOLLOWED UP after they posted the standard comment trying to show they were concerned and would have someone call me. Perhaps they are just backed up with all of the other bad reviews??? Again, stay away!!!!
