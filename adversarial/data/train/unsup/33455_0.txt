Excellent facilities with friendly staff and vets.  Reasonable prices and very thorough.\n\nThe front office staff can make or break a first impression and the intake person was super friendly.  I witnessed her comforting a long-time client after finishing euthanizing her pet.  Very touching.  I wish I could say the same for the outtake person who was sporting a diamond nose booger (gross).  She was definitely phoning it in that day, so I'm willing to give her another chance (but I still won't like looking at ridiculously unprofessional facial piercings).\n\nThe person who took us to our room and gathered information was super nice, very attentive, and quite informative.  By the time Dr. Jen McGivern entered the room, I was already very impressed.  \n\nDr. McGivern was wonderful.  She really took the time to understand our concerns, thoroughly examined our dog, and provided an excellent explanation of treatment plan options.  \n\nAn aside note, the lobby is filled with interesting \"vet knick-knacks\" including bones from horses and big cats.  The photos of the vets with their pets is a huge plus because it shows how deeply they care about animals and it gave me chance to read a bit of their bio's.  \n\nI've read a few negative comments about this place and I noticed a common thread in that all of their pets died and it seemed this was their way of expressing their frustration with their loss more than their bad experience.  As I noted above, I had once minor bad experience and I still gave it 5 stars.  Vets aren't miracle workers and the financial limits of keeping sick, injured, and elderly pets has limited the amount of treatment options in relation to human health care.  And yes, mistakes do happen just as in the human medical field, which is why we pay extra to go to specialists.  You could go to a specialist vet too.  But, as general practice vets, these folks all care, are all knowledgeable, and all show up to do their best each day.  What else can we ask?
