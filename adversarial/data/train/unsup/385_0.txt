I noticed this place next to the Omelette House in Summerlin, so I decided to stop in and try their bagels.\n\nIt is a decent size store with a small seating area. There are only two small deli cases. They have a limited menu. They did not have any whole grain bagels. The only wheat option they had was a honey wheat bagel. They also do not have any fat-free cream cheese.\n\nWe ordered the French Toast and Everything Bagels toasted with lite cream cheese. They were good bagels. I have had better. Honesty, I like Einstein Bagels and Dunkin Donuts bagels more than this place. Plus, they have a better selection for what I want.\n\nI recommend that you stop in and try their bagels, as long as your not coming for whole grain bagels.
