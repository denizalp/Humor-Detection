Dr. Venter is a kind and compassionate physician.  He is very knowledgeable and an expert diagnostician, likely from his extensive time working in the ER.  He doesn't hesitate to refer you to a specialist if warranted, which was a tremendous help to me dealing with a chronic condition that had previous doctors just writing countless unhelpful prescriptions with no referral to determine the root cause.  The staff are efficient and pleasant as well, with minimal wait time for the appointment to keep your day on schedule.  All-in-all a great experience with Dr. Venter.  I am grateful to have him as my doctor.
