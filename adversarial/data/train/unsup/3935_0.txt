I hate to do this to you Harley's, especially considering how fond so many of my friends are of you, but give me a freakin' break!!\n\nCan you say overpriced? Can you say completely un-inventive menu? Yes I know that's a made up word, but it fits so deal with it. Can you say laughable wine list?? I can, HARLEY'S.\n\nI hate to be so harsh, but my Spaghetti Bolognese tasted like it came from Sbarro at the mall. The pasta was soggy, the sauce was flavorless, I was just completely unimpressed from start to finish. Listen, if you're going to make and serve low-grade knockoff Italian food, be my guest, but don't you dare charge higher-end prices! Don't even get my started on the $10 salad with dressing that so obviously came out of the bottle.\n\nIn the business of full disclosure, my pasta dish was 800 times better the next day, but more likely as a result of me adding my own sauce to it before re-heating rather than it magically improving on its own.\n\nThe only saving grace Harley's had for me was our server Justin. He was a doll. Attentive, courteous, and really f*cking hot. So, maybe I'm a little biased, whatever, sue me.\n\nI really wanted to like Harley's, I really really did, but sadly, I could not. Especially not with The Parlor opening just a couple of miles up the road.
