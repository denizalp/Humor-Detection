I washed and washed.... but the dirt wont come off! \n\nI was an avid skater years ago so when I read about a Yelp event at Skateland I couldn't possibly resist. Plus, it was a Monday- I'm sure it wouldn't be busy!\n\nWRONG.\n\nI waited in line for almost 30 minutes carrying my heavy skates and standing between two sick children that their [teenage] mothers should have never taken out of the house, let alone skating.\n\nOnce I paid my entry charge, I went right in since I had my own skates. It looked like the skate line was another hefty wait.\n\nThe layout of the building is a bit odd in comparison to other places I've skated- there are a lot of drop offs and stairs that can be tricky to navigate in skates. The rink doesn't have a wall for the most part, so there's no safety blanket for those just starting out. \n\nThere was little order or rule enforcement from employees leaving the floor jam packed with some less than desirable conditions going on. There were a few injuries while I was there, even one bad enough to clear the rink. \n\nAt the end of the night, a kid barfed in the middle of the seating area, and it was an act of congress to get anyone to clean it up.... the DJ had to announce it over the PA system to get anyone's attention. Gross.\n\nThat being said, I had a great time at the event, but it was likely because of the good company. I'll give this place another shot, maybe during the week... but I'll likely try the Chandler location first.
