Came on a monday evening. It's a small restaurant with 10 seats along with a few stools up at the counter. Lots of seating was available though as most people take it to-go.\n\nYou can build-your-own burger or pick one of their signatures. A few of their signature burgers come with spicy toppings. I enjoy spicy options, and haven't had spicy burgers before, so this was something new to me.\n\nThey were also advertising a limited time \"Cheesy Poblano Poutine\", so I got that as well.\n\nThe order was ready within 10 minutes, which seems a bit long but maybe there were other orders placed online.\n\nBurger was smaller than I thought, but I liked the flavor. Especially the sauce that comes in the \"Spicy Burger\". Patty was also juicy and full of meat.\n\nThe poutine was premium sized, so it came in a large box. Fries were nice and crispy, and the Pico de Gallo that they put on top was a good complement.
