I was happy to find a naturopathic doctor that takes insurance.   I'm surprised they recommend so much hormone replacement therapy and medications.   It seems like they recommend changes and then ask you to come back every 3 months for blood work to see if you improved.  I feel I wasted 1 year with them.
