Investors swamped back in when the Raiders announced the new stadium.  Back to the AIRBNB wars, short term rentals and other investment shenanigans.  Back to the Realtors doing fake background checks, parties, deadbeat renters trashing the place and abuse of the limo service.  Resident was assaulted by a \"friend\" of a food delivery guy, so now you see security escorting the food delivery up to the units.  You can still get your drugs and escorts up without a security escort, as the elevators are still all access.  Anyone can come and go.  Security is as imaginary as a Disney ride, and it's mainly there to police the residents who rent there.    If you're up to no good, the Pano is back in business.  If you're looking for the higher class experience by the strip, that's on the back burner for some time.  The HOA is a disaster.
