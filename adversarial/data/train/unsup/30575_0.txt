While the location proves to be more or less inconvenient for anyone outside The Cosmopolitan and the limited seating proves to be a challenge should you order the Slut, the food is pretty worth going a bit out of the way for.\n\nThe Bacon and Egg Sammie was awesome - if the chipotle ketchup wasn't enough to make the sammich excellent with its lingering heat, the massive pile of bacon on it certainly did.\n\nThe Slut - oh, where to start? Just order it. With the amazing potato pur√©e the texture was incredible and off-set by the baguette.
