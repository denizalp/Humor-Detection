Oh my goodness gracious! I have driven by this place a million times and have even seen it on Yelp but did not visit until this afternoon. I am so glad I did because I think I just found my favorite French macaron place! It is a small shop with a whiteboard listing all the flavors of their cookies and macarons. I chose six different ones: tiramisu, Bailey's, pumpkin pie, strawberries & cream, salted caramel, and some dark chocolate one. I was planning on sharing these with my boyfriend originally but I've definitely changed my mind... Plus, half of them are gone already. I ate them while I was running errands because I did not have the willpower to wait! I'll definitely be back and next time, I'll give the cookies a try. Thanks for satisfying my sweet tooth :)
