I've dined at this location over the past 10 years for the causal after work get together, birthday dinners, and other large family events. The service and food have been excellent on all our dine in visits.\n\nHowever, on 4\/13\/14, my to go order was less than satisfactory, as was the follow up with the owner on 4\/23\/14.\n\nI didn't check the order before leaving because I've never had cause to check it. After arriving home in El Mirage, I found half the order of the Sonoran Todo missing, and what was present, was severely overcooked and soggy. It looked liked Freddy Kruger had a stroke while packaging the order. The food was just smashed together. Because half the order was missing, we didn't have enough to feed everyone. \n\nI called the restaurant and spoke to the manager who was very professional and took ownership of the situation. He offered to make another order which I turned down because of the distance and time back to the restaurant and home again. He offered to take down my receipt number, items ordered, and dollar amount of the full order. He advised he would send this information to HR and they would call me in a day to discuss my experience and send me a gift check for the full order.\n\nThe total order was $19.17 for the sonoran todo and a side of rice and beans. This was not a huge amount, but I still wanted satisfaction for the money and time spent.\n\nThe next week a gift check arrived for $15.00, without a letter or explanation. I also never received a phone call.\n\nToday, I called HR and spoke to one of the owners, Janie. I briefly recounted my experience and why I was calling. Janie stated in a matter of fact tone she recalled my order and sent out $15.00. I told her I was told by the manager I would be given the full amount of the order and a phone call from HR, which is why Is calling today.\n\nJanie very strongly told me that managers are not authorized to give out amounts of a refund, that it has to come from the owners. She also repeated she had sent the check for $15.00, as if that should be the end of the discussion.\n\nI advised her that I had been coming to that location for 10 years, going out of my way now being located in El Mirage, and that I should be given what I had been told I would get. I also was very disappointed with the initial service when I got the order, and again when I didn't receive a phone call to follow up on my poor experience.\n\nShe  curtly asked me what it was that I wanted, to which I replied $19.17. She said fine, I'll send another check for $5, and hung up the phone.\n\nMy reason for posting this review is not to discourage people from eating at Valle Luna. It's a fine establishment, with great food and employees. You should eat there if you never have tried it. Accidents happen, and sometimes there are less than satisfactory experiences.\n\nMy reason for posting this review is for the poor response from the owner. I have worked in the customer service field for over 15 years, 10 at the same company. Perhaps I expect too much from others because of the standard set by my employer. I would never cut off a customer, talk over them, use a rude and condescending tone, and then hung up them with nary a goodbye.\n\nIf the roles had been reversed, I would have thanked the customer for calling, expressed regret over their experience, took ownership, apologized and empathized. If within my power, which as owner it is, I would have graciously offered an additional amount, expressed thanks for giving us another chance to do better, and wished a pleasant experience the next time.\n\nJanie is on my wall of shame for poor customer treatment.\n\nAs it's been said before, the check is in the mail. We'll see how the next time goes, and hope the next time Janie speaks with a customer, they'll receive better treatment.
