Tried the Mongolian beef and the juicy pork dumplings.. so so good. Great service. Quiet at 7pm on a Sunday night, perfect spot, just wish there was one in west phoenix. Easily best Chinese food I've had in AZ.. and I'm a food loving local. Will be back for more of those mouth watering pork dumplings!
