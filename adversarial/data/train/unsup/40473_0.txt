Great place with many options to choose from. We ordered the chicken souvlaki plate which came with potatoes, rice and salad. The rice was partially uncooked as we ate a few hard pieces. The rest was good however service was slow. Baklava looked pretty good but was too full to eat anymore. Want to come back and try it! Also hoping next time the rice is fully cooked!
