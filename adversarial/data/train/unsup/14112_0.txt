This is so much fun! Take a break from your partying and gambling to try this! I recommend going in the morning as it gets super hot and crowded during the day. \n\nIt's harder than it looks, so if you live in the area, you should go a bunch of times to get good at it and go crazy like the guys who work there. \n\nMake sure all your hair is tucked under the helmet before you go, otherwise you will have one massive knot that you will have to cut out (luckily it was only my bangs)!
