I literally love this place for a quick and healthy lunch! You can build-your-own bowl with rice or noodles, hot or cold, and add a ton of fresh veggies (marinated or steamed) on top! What could be better? I always go with chilled rice noodles, half marinated steak\/half grilled chicken, Chinese slaw, asian cucumbers (love!), bean sprouts, herb mix, pickled chiles, chopped scallions, limes, peanuts, and crispy wontons. For sauces, I mix the Holy Foobanero and the peanut sauce. It is about $10 when all said and done, and in my opinion, completely worth it! I wish that they had one closer to home (Arcadia area... hint hint!) because I would come a lot more often.
