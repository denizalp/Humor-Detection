I can't speak for the beer. It was lunch and I was hung over, so I had a soda. This is a microbrew pub in the casino area of old Downtown Las Vegas, and not the sort of place for which I'd typically write a Yelp review. \n\nHowever, I ordered the Western bacon cheeseburger, which turned out to probably be among the top 10 hamburger experiences of my life. It was dumbfoundingly and wholly unexpectedly incredible. The burger itself is thick and juicy, smothered in a tasty barbecue sauce, and garnished with roasted red peppers, onion rings, and Monterray Jack cheese. It was perfect. It's been several days since I ate it and I'm still thinking about it. A cheeseburger, that is. I'm still thinking about a goddamn cheeseburger. That just doesn't happen.
