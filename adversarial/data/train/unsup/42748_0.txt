Purchased the Original Double 'N Cheese burger combo for around $7. Was disappointed with nearly ice-cold pickles and tomatoes which made the rest of the burger cold upon eating (only a minute or two of wait time between eating and receiving my order). The patties had more crust to them than actual meat. The overall quality of the sandwich rivals a fast-food chain's value menu.
