Short and sweet - worth every single cent! Guest service is extremely helpful and friendly. I traveled with some friends and we booked our reservations separately and they were so nice at check in to try to get our rooms on the same floor or close to each other. \n\nHad lots of luck at the slot machines. Concierge will even add your name to the guest list for Tao so you can enter for free as a guest. Everything about this hotel rocks. From here on out, I will ONLY stay at the Venetian or Palazzo.
