After watching the 60 Minutes special on Costco and hearing several coworkers praise it, I decided to get a membership. I went for the first time a couple of weeks ago, to the store off of Tyvola and I found that it lives up to all the hype. You will be hard pressed to find an establishment with as many happy employees. Everyone I spoke to was extremely nice and very helpful. They genuinely enjoy being at work. The prices on non perishable items can't be beat. The selection they have in general is solid, especially if you're stocking up on alcohol for a party. I see myself making several trips in the future and the membership has already, almost paid for itself after just two trips.
