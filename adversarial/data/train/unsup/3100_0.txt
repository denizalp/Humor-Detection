Cute, small, ice cream place on Eastern and Silverado Ranch!\n\nThe few times I've been here were awesome! Great service and great ice cream! \n\nI love ube (taro) anything so when I saw they had ube ice cream I was thrilled! Their ube ice cream is to die for! I've also tried their macapuno (young coconut) and green tea ice cream. All so creamy, fresh, and the flavor itself is not shy! Also, their scoops are ginormous, generous and almost overwhelming! \n\nI've yet to try their cronuts, hopefully when they're freshly made.. And along with their other flavors of ice cream..\n\nDon't be shy to ask for a sample! And you'll get 10% upon your Yelp check-in!
