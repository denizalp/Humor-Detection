I would give zero stars if possible.\n\nAfter spending the morning in the pool before check in I went to the room for a quick nap. After I got in bed I noticed a funny smell, pulled back the sheets and there was FECAL MATTER in the bed. Needless to say I was in shock, crying and shaking. We called management (we took pics of the rest of the filth in the room - a green mucus loogie on the wall, somebody's necklace under the desk & PILLS on the floor in the closet). They took almost an hour to show up.\n\n The first \"manager\" we dealt with said \"well, how do you know it's fecal matter, it cold be something else?\" (AS IF that's OKAY?!) I told him to smell it and check if he'd like. He then offered to send 'maid service' up as a solution. This was around 3pm. \n\nBy 5pm we were dealing with (another \"manager\") who was not only rude but condescending. They gave us a new room because nowhere was available on the strip, it was Memorial Day. The NEW room key didn't work and he had the nerve to say \"you know what would have been smart for you? Going to the front desk and asking for a new key, would that have been hard?\" My bf said \"we did not want to stand in line another 45 minutes, there was sh*t in our last room and she needs a shower.\" He then threatened to have us escorted off the premises for swearing at him.\n\nMaintenance came up and low and behold the door was broken. So all of Anthony's rude, condescending comments (at one point he said \"well look at you, how do we know you didn't make the mess in the first place\" and I started crying) were his. \n\nBy then it was 6pm (we had tickets to the 7pm Zumanity - we ended up missing the show dealing with all this) He put us in a suite. The first thing we did was check the bed - hair on the pillow cases!! They changed the sheets, we missed our show, they comped the suite and gave us $50 towards room service. THAT WAS THEIR \"RESOLUTION.\" We still had to pay resort fees etc and we still haven't been able to get in touch with RICHIE the \"direct supervisor.\" \n\n\"manager 2\"  told me there is \"no corporate office to complain to it's privately owned\" and refused to give us his last name. So \"private owner\" I hope you see this review and re-evaluate who you employ at your facility. (yelp removed the original post because I used employee names- this re-post is without them.)\n\nI TRAVEL regularly for my job and this was the WORST EXPERIENCE I have ever had. \n\nThe only saving grace was Andrew, the security guard with a goatee, he was kind and helpful through the whole process and was the only person with any sympathy towards the disgusting situation.\n\nMy advice - stay in a motel 6, it's probably cleaner than this place.
