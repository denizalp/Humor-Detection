To be honest, this is the first and only obgyn I have gone to, as I started going here when I was 18 years old and have gone ever since, giving birth to three children along the way.  I'm 28 years old now and have never felt the need to make a change.  Dr. Carla Turner was my original doctor and delivered my sons, but by the time I got pregnant with my third child (I always saw a nurse for my yearly exams, not the doctor) she had left GVOBGYN and joined another practice here in town.  At first I wanted to follow her because I liked her so much, but the receptionist had already scheduled me with Dr. Tyre, so I figured it was only fair to give another doctor in the office a fair shot.  I loved her just as much.  She was so helpful and answered any and all of my questions and delivered my beautiful daughter with the greatest of ease.  Everyone in the office makes you feel very comfortable, and I would highly recommend this office.  On a personal note, I am biased towards the female docs in this office, as I just have an issue with the male obgyns, so I cannot recommend any of them...
