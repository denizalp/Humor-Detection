This is as good as it gets for classic rock lovers.  It's almost 2 hours (maybe a full two hours?) of professional, spot-on musicians performing whole songs and some medleys from the 60s through the 80s.  Some of the marquee musicians I knew already -- Doug Aldrich from his work currently in Whitesnake, but also from his work previously w\/ Hurricane, House of Lords... even the Transformers Soundtrack back in the 80s?  Really?  And Robin McAuley from two MSG albums, and Howard Leese from Heart.  And of course I have albums from Asia... I had high expectations.  \n\nShows you what kind of music I listened to back in the day.\n\nThe skits are few and far between songs, but they are amusing.  They do kind of feel cheesy, but to be honest, Smoke on the Water came out right after I was born.  Given that I was embryonic or non-existent for a lot of that time, I've no idea if those skits help folks re-connect with the time period.\n\nThere was no nudity.  I suppose I should take a star away for that.\n\nThe simple fact is the show is great, the band is terribly tight, and the singers are great.  We had at least one (maybe there were two?) female guest singer(s) who I hadn't recognized but were amazing.  There was no down-tuning that I could tell.\n\nParking at LVH is easy, which is always a bonus when you're used to crammed expensive places out of town.  Free self-parking in the north structure is within easy walking distance.\n\nIf you can nab the Groupon or Living Social deal, this show is a no brainer.  I grabbed a Groupon for 2, showed up maybe an hour before the show, and got stellar seats -- although the venue isn't huge so most seats probably have a good view.\n\nSo, if you like those songs and guitar-driven rock, hard to go wrong here.  After all, there's only so much Cirque du Soleil one guy can take, you know?
