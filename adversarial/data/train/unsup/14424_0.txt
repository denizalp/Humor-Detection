This was the site of a Yelp Elite event called Toys for Tater Tots.\n\nWe ended up with a sampling of various food items including Tacos made with Tater Tots as a base, sliders, frosted pretzels etc. At the same time, we ended up ordering some items straight off the menu as well to round out the evening.\n\nEverything that we had was excellent. Service is great and it'a high energy place with a lot of things going on.\n\nWill definitely be back after the holidays and thing settle down to check out the menu further.
