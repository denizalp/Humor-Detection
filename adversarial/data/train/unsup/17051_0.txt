I'd give 0 star if I have the option.  I haven't been here for two years and I now remembered why. Overpriced food with really poor food quality.\n\nI have ordered a variety of items on the menu like yakitori, grilled fish, grilled meat, tempura, fried sexy caramari legs, eggplant, shiitake butter and sushi.\n\nYakitori - dried and chewy, salty\nGrilled salmon - very dry\nGrilled PC tonge - overlooked and salty\nTempura - dry\nFried caramari - dry and chewy\nEggplant - taste ok, not outstanding\nShiitake butter - really salty\nSushi - same quality as other chain restaurant like ichiban. So not bad not surprising either. \n\nNeed I say more? The food is generally overly salty and dry which is all I can say.  This will be the last chance I'm giving them for sure. There are just too many better restaurants to choose from in downtown.
