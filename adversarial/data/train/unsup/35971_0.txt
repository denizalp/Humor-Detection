Definitely obsessed with this place! I always get their chocolate pastries and Mac and cheese, which I would say are the best things on the menu. \n\nI would recommend this to a friend anytime for a quick and easy breakfast, lunch, or dinner. \n\nIf there is ever anything you don't like they will give you your money back too.
