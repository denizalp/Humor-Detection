Large store full of low-end, mass-produced \"throw-away\" clothes and entry-level designer bags (which was surprising to me, given the location).  \n\nI saw very few lux brands or quality OOAK items.    Maybe 5.   I was FLOORED by the number of knock-off or \"designer-inspired\" bags for sale here.  I spotted a several, but the worst was the fake Gucci GG Marmont.  UGH!  WHYYYYYY?!!!!   \n\nCG??  Seriously??!  Am I supposed to believe CoverGirl makes handbags now?   HAVE YOU NO SHAME???!!!!\n\nIn addition to the faux-lux merch, they also sell the same lace bra sets and jewelry sets here that you see in beauty supply stores, overstock stores, Webb Road flea markets and on the streets of NYC.  \n\nNot sure the demographic they're attempting to market to here, but I can tell you that they will buy and resell just about anything Made in China. \n\nOverall, I was underwhelmed.
