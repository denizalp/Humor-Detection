I went to get lunch around 3PM after finishing a business call outside. The manager\/owner saw me waiting at the cash register and came up and told me that he's not taking orders -- he's on break. I asked if there was somebody else that could take my order and he said no. Another potential customer came in and he refused to serve him too. I told him that he should have locked up and posted a sign that he was closed for the time being. Instead of taking my feedback and apologizing for the lack of service, he pointed out that I was standing out front on the phone -- implying that it's my own fault that he was not willing to serve me. His employees in the past have been amazing, which goes to show that all it takes is one bad experience...
