(Lyrics - Cake - Short Skirt, Long Jacket)\n\nI want to Yelp with reviews like diamond\nI want to Yelp to inform what's best\nI want to Yelp with songs thats fresh\nAnd sings and rhymes like karaoke\n\nI want to Yelp to the right allocations\nWho's fast, and tasty, and sweet as a matter of fact\nIt's pasta with your Bolognese\nIt's pizza up to share\nIt's cooking up Italian\nand BYOB!\nI want a bite at the Basil and Gar--lic..... Bistro\n\n\n\nPretty solid traditional Italian eatery!\n\nI came with my family on a quiet night.  We started out with breadsticks, onion rings, and some calamari.  Pretty much your typical appetizers, but what really popped for me was the marinara sauce that came with it.  It was thick, sweet, and had a strong tomato base.  We all shared the Basil & Garlic Pizza with sausage.  The crust was warm and doughy while topped with  mozzarella, sundried tomatoes, parmesan cheese, and pesto sauce.  I'm not a fan of pesto sauce on my pizza, but overall it was a subtle bite and very cheesy for sure.  \n\nSince this is an Italian restaurant; I ordered an entree too!  I went for the Bolognese with linguine pasta.  I love the meaty sauce coming out piping hot as I can see the steam.  The sauce was sweet and robust.  I wish the pasta was handmade, but I understand not everyone has time for it.  \n\nIn the end, service was solid and on point.  The place is tiny and has a cute homey allure to it.  The place is kind of off the map from what I can gather, but if you need a quite home cooked bite; this is your spot! - Enjoy!
