The restaurant is located in the Linq and I was greeting right away by the hostess.  I chose to sit inside although the outside seating gives you good views of people passing by.  I ordered the mac and cheese burger that comes with Fries.  It's a mouthful to say the least.  The bacon was thick cut with a great smoked flavor and the mac and cheese was velvety and delicious.   The waitstaff was courtesy and prompt.  I enjoyed my dinner !!
