Finally found a place that the FIL, hubs and I can all agree upon: a Tohono O'oodham Native American family owned hole-in-the-wall serving up delicious, gigantic Indian Fry Bread! It is fluffy, addictive, and truly huge; we'll go back and I'll try the cinnamon, but this is a very rare treat for us. \n\nThe fellas like the Indian tacos: Ultimate, Red ChilI or Green Chili; I had the vegetarian loaded with Hatch Chiles, refried beans, cheese, lettuce, onions with sour cream on the side. Portions are tremendous: I cut mine in half, and had enough for a second meal later. They also serve stews with Fry Bread on the side to sop up the gravy, and quite an extensive menu. \n\nI'm sure we will be back, the Fry Bread is made to order, so it takes a few minutes, but is absolutely a wait rewarded. Such a treat to have this place available nearby, serving delicious family recipes lovingly handed down through generations. Previously I'd only had the chance to taste Fry Bread at Pow Wows, and FBH is lightyears better than any I've had before. Such a fan! \n\n* HUGE fluffy Fry Bread *\n\n** cooked to order **\n\n*** sweet & savory options ***\n\n**** worth the artery clogging ***
