Service was good, but none of the prices were made clear until I was checking out and had to pay a whopping $125. For my vehicle, $70 for synthetic is excessive! I also searched for my car's cabin air filter online and was charged $55 for something I could've gotten for $15. Not a trustworthy place! Will not be returning here at all for future maintenance.
