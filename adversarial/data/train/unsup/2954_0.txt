So its like 25 degrees and windy tonight in Cleveland and a piping hot bowl of Ramen really hits the spot! We got a vegan and a seafood ramen. The portions are generous and the soup delicious.  They also make their own red pepper sauce if you want to spice it up a little. The staff is friendly and Otani is open late; so you cannot go wrong enjoying some hot Ramen on a chilly Cleveland night. Highly recommend.
