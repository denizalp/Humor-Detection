I recently went to revernt tattoo shop and had my tattoo done there,this was my first time being tattooed at reverent tattoo shop but not my first time being tattooed by Pelon i have had other work done by Pelon my daughter and boyfriend also go to Pelon. Before finding Pelon we shopped around at other tattoo shops only to be disapointed by rude or unenthusiactic tattoo artists, since finding Pelon I wouldnt go to anyone else he does excellent work always professional and ive never been disappointed revernt tattoo shop is also a great place to get tattooed at. its clean, professional ,and everyone there was very nice and made me feel comfortable all around great place to go. I'm very happy with my experience there and Pelon is always awsome.
