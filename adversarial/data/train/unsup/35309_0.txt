Very disappointed! I went there for the 1st time to check it out a week or so ago. The front desk office staff acted as though I was inconveniencing them to take the time to explain to me what the deal was with open gym, group classes, etc. You would think they would be eager to get new business, members, etc. \n\nEven with that not so warm welcome, I went today with my 23-month old son to try out \"open gym\" with a friend of mine & her son who is a member. Same HORRIBLE treatment. The staff was devoid of personality. My son cried while he was there as it was a new place that was unfamiliar to him. The front desk people looked SO RELIEVED when we left early. \n\nVery cool looking, fun looking place, but the staff really ruins the experience.
