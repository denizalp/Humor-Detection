We have been coming here for years and have always had good experiences despite having to be there at all. \n\nLast night my son was seen for double ear infections to which the dr was going to prescribe antibiotics and decongestant. Well it was never called in and the pharmacy closed without my son getting his meds. I went down to the pharmacy this morning hoping that it had just been called in later, and no. \"Nothing has been called in for him.\" \n\nMy son is suffering and I'm being sent all over the place on the phone because the urgent care staff doesn't arrive until 5!!! The whole point of going to urgent care was to get his meds quick so he could feel better!!! \n\nSomething needs to be done to change how their day time and night time things are done. Even if that means one person is there during the day to take calls!!\n\nUpdate*\nI was contacted after this review by pch to help make sure he got his medicine, but I had already contacted my sons primary doctor to handle it. So while I commend them for taking the time to take care of it, I'm leaving my review in hopes that someone else doesn't get the run around after seeing the urgent care team.
