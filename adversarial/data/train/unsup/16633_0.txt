Echoing off of Bruce's review- Zablong is listed as one of the best pizzas in all of Charlotte - and although I wouldn't say it's the BEST pizza I've ever had, I have to admit that this is some pretty bomb pizza. \n\nAfter admiring the long pizza boxes that nearly every Uptown worker carries daily I thought I would finally give Zablong a try. I mean I've worked in Uptown for 2 years now...\n\nI tried it one Friday and popped in around 1:30. There wasn't a line, but if you come around 12\/12:30 there is usually a line out the door. I ordered the Tripping Goat (from the menu), but added turkey meatballs and chicken to it. The Tripping Goat consistent of mushroom truffle oil, roasted mushrooms, goat cheese, fig marsala, crushed red pepper and salt\/pepper. It was dynamite! The flavors were blended awesomely and they topped this bad boy up!\n\nUnlike Blaze Pizza (ps I love Blaze), the crust was a little thicker and held your pizza together better. They have much fancier toppings than your usual pizza joint (think asiago cheese, pork belly, broccolini, prosciutto) and they aren't shy about loading up on toppings. My co-worker asked for a quote\/un-quote \"Shi* ton of prosciutto\" on his pizza once and I think they gave him over a pound of it. No lie! It was ridiculous! \nAnd for $10 a pizza you can't go wrong.
