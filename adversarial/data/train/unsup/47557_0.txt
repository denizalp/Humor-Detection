Such a bad experience. My first driver was Anwar Khan. He gave me one class a week, sometimes 2 weeks and always gave preference to his own private students. I got him changed to another one. My new driver Jim was very arrogant and always yelled at me. Gave me no confidence and now after finishing all the 10 in-car classes I have no confidence of going for the test. I am looking for a new driver now. \n\nZain doesn't work with them anymore. This is the worst driving school ever. STAY AWAY. I wrote a review on google and I think they took it out. It doesn't show anymore. Worst company worst people.
