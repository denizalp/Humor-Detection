Ordered the short ribs and it was absolutely delicious. Very impressed with the quality, taste and the price is amazing. The owner is very friendly and helped us decide on what to order too. He cares about the quality of food. Even the customers inside were raving about how good it is. Great customer service by the family! I love family owned shops like this.
