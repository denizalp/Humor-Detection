The food was pretty good, but the service was spectacular. \n\nI just got done with the salt river and a large group of ours went to refill and drink lots of water. Our server was absolutely amazing, never ran out of water or chips and was the perfect amount of friendly without being bothersome. \n\nIf you find yourself craving Mexican food before or after the river, or just because, go here.
