The meat purchased was misrepresented and was consistently almost inedible for each separate packaged piece.  Each separate piece was full of additional water so there were only 2 to 3 bites per package.  I cannot recall eating meat so filled with fat and gristle.  Literally it cannot be cut with a steak knife and our dogs had difficulty with what we could not eat.   The owner stated that he had a \"deal\" on some meat because a forklift went through the freezer.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS UNETHICAL SELLER.
