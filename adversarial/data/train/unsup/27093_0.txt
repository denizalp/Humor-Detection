I hired Sparkly as a referral from a friend. I worked with Crystal to set everything up and appreciated her personal touch. I've had a pretty gross bathroom for a while and definitely needed the help. I really liked the overall process in addition to finally having a clean bathroom. If I have the budget for it, I'm considering having them come back next month.
