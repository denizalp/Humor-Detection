The Terrible's is right by my house. It's a convenient store for a good reason. I don't think a day goes by I don't stop in for drink, snacks, gas, cigars. I like that Krispy Kreme is brought in daily for that donut fix. They have an icee machine that my granson loves but also a slushee machine with great flavors and bigger ice chips. They have \"designer\" coffee choices. Convenience sometimes means more expensive, this place is no exception. They sell liquor, beer & wine. Random electronics and a small selection of toiletries. This location does not have a car wash and is Definately smaller than most Terrible's on a corner. There are only 4 gas pumps.
