Not impressed.\nI had the Greenie the other day and it was just blah. Like super blah. \n\nI don't think they are organic and it seemed like this green selection was filled with mostly celery, yea the cheap stuff, as filler. \n\nI came home and my sister who was visiting said \"dang! smells like celery juice!\". She knows her juice, she owns a $2K juicer, can't remember the brand name, beautiful like a car.\nFor $8-9 for a 24oz plus a dollar tip I threw away the last 1\/3 of the juice.\n\nI will stick with Whole Foods, they really get juices right. Or of course Pressed etc. \n\nThe customer service was not really anything, just asked me what I wanted (I didn't know so I checked out the menu) and verified what I wanted. Called out my juice when it was done, that's it. Believe me I don't need a song and dance but the place was empty and super quiet. Like eerily quiet. It was about 3pm so that's not a high traffic time but at least turn up some music or something. \n\nMaybe I'll try them again if I'm in the area. Meh.
