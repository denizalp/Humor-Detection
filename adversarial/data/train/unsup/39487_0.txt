Maybe because I came here during national holiday, it appears that the restaurant overbooked and there is a long line up of people near the restaurant entrance. Even though you reserve a table at a certain time, it doesn't necessarily guarantee a spot\n\nThe restaurant is well known for its AYCE. Service-wise, they are pretty good. Food comes quite fast but im sure they have all been pre-made. For example: the sashimi wasn't that fresh.\n\nThe sushi isn't hot as evident by the temperature of the rice.  The cooked fish is a lot better for example the meat with mushroom. \n\nMy conclusion is that the food isn't the best, but the service isn't bad at all. The biggest value proposition is that the service is fast!
