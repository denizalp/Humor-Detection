I've always wanted to see a show whenever I've visited Las Vegas.  I've been here many times, but this last time was the first time I was able to see a show!\n\nThanks to Tix4Tonight, my friends and I were able to get same day tickets for the Blue Man Show for $90.  We had center seats row M at the Venetian Hotel.\n\nHowever having been there now, I would say that there isn't really a bad seat in the theatre.  It's pretty small so you can pretty much see the performers on stage even from the back.\n\nThe show started a few minutes late, but it was fun watching the \"quick tips\" they would scroll on the screen.  Once the show got started everyone in the group seemed to enjoy the show.\n\nI had a few favorite parts, but I don't want to ruin the surprise so I'll just keep it at that.  I liked the show, but I did find myself falling asleep a few times during the long musical numbers.  It could have been because we were in the 10pm showing.   \n\nI would recommend the Blue Man Group.
