This is not my favorite pizza spot, but if you're vegan, you can make it work. You stand in line and give your order before sitting down. I ordered the rosmary potato pizza veganized. It was basically bread with a couple potato chips arranged in a pattern. Not a great option for vegans but if you're there for a family gathering like I was, you can make it work. There were also other pizzas, you can make most of them vegan by just asking for no cheese and the pizza crust I got was vegan. They were very nice about accommodating and helping me figure out what dairy and egg free. Great service and nice staff, just not a lot of great plant based options from what I saw.
