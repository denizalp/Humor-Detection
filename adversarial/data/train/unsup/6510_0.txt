McCormick Scottsdale\n\nThis is not a \"resort\" in any sense of the word as I understand. It is an old hotel nicely refurbished with a very optimistic marketing staff. There is nice pool, a couple of tennis courts and a fitness center which would feel at home in a Day's Inn.  There is not even a hot tub by the pool. No spa. There is a lake (no swimming) and I spotted two kayaks.\n\nThat said, the hotel is very clean and well maintained. Like any old hotel it has it's quirks. I booked a suite (252). The toilet, shower,only closet and lav are situated so that you must walk all the way from the separate bedroom across the living area to the head. The lav is one sink tiny with no hooks or shelves for your stuff. Not even a towel rod. It is a decorators dream and wholly unsuitable for human use.   See photo. \n\nThe living area is nicely furnished, clean and well maintained with a small balcony overlooking the lake and golf course. It has a small 'fridge but no microwave. The bedroom, again, is nicely done but has nowhere to put you suitcase or clothes...hike to the only closet by the head. The bed and linens are great.\n\nThe heat and air are of the last century. Through the wall units sound like a 747 spooling up. The unit in the bed room is right by the bed and blows high velocity air right on you. I had to completely turn it off. This was fine in April but watch out in the summer.\n\nYou will be surprised by a $19 per day\"resort fee\" which was not revealed until checkout. This whole practice of resort fees is, in my opinion, consumer fraud.\nThis is an expert opinion. I am a retired prosecuting attorney.
