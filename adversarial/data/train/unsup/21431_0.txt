Came by for a dinner the other night was it was a complete disaster! Managed to be seated upon arrival in the upscale but extremely loud restaurant.\n\nStarted off with the butter lettuce salad which was the highlight of the meal! Light, refreshing, and tasty!\n\nThe main course took a good hour after the salad came out. My lamb chops were extremely disappointing at 70%+ fat... It was cooked a perfect medium rare, more on the rare side, which was a plus.\n\nThe side of foie gras was quite tasty. Perfectly grilled and quite fatty!\n\nThe sides of spinach and asparagus looked burnt and tasted quite salty...\n\nFor $100\/head after tax and gratuity, seemed like someone was asleep in the kitchen...
