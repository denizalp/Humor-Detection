This is southern dining at it's finest!\n\nI dine here as often as I can. From it's rustic appearance (complete with live horses) to it's friendly staff, Jake's asks you to come on in and sit for a spell. Then the keep you coming back with incredible food, including the best po' boy I've ever eaten and venison quesadillas that are completely out of this world.\n\nI'm so glad they finally got the license to sell beer. It completes the experience.\n\nBe prepared to wait on weekends, but otherwise you can walk right in. \n\nJake's ranks tops in Carolina eatin'!
