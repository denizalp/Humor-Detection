Four things constituted this poor review of Living Spaces. \n\n1 - On the LS website we asked a question via their online form and never received a reply. \n\n 2 - Their website showed which stores had the item we were interested in on display. Went to the store and it was not the correct color. (Drove 60miles to store) \n\n3 - Their salesman tried to explain the color difference from the store display and website picture was due to the lighting. (Website explained fabric as \"Dark Grey\" store display was a variegated Taupe. Not remotely close)\n\n4 - Via the LS website, asked a question on the item page about the item and actual colors and receive an email the next day saying \"our question had been rejected\". \n\nGlad we did our due diligence on researching the product and store so we never made the mistake of purchasing from this poorly rated business. \n\nFound the same exact product with the correct Dark Grey fabric at Copenhagen for only $5 more, way better product warranty and half the delivery fee costs. \n\nShop around
