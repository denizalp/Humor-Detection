I have been wanting to update my review and finally had a chance to do so! I contacted the owner, as they responded to my review and they were very helpful. I can tell that customer satisfaction is top priority for this company. They exchanged the mattress cover at no extra charge for me. This new cover doesn't smell as strong as the first one, it seems to be losing that \"wool\" smell faster anyway, and it's not as pungent. Anyway, I am very pleased with the way I was treated, and so far I've been loving the mattress itself!
