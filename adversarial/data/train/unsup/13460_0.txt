First off - if you can get a table outside, PLEASE do.\n\nWe had Paul as a server and he was the absolute best.  We ended up having a late reservation here since we wanted a table outside to see the Bellagio Fountain show.  When we got seated, we were at a table that could see the show but we were more towards the back. We got a bottle of wine and ordered the beef carpaccio to start with.   This is quite a hefty appetizer and PERFECT if it's a warm night outside since it's cold. By far some of the best I've had ever.\n\nWe decided to skip the main course since we had an appetizer while waiting for our table to open up and went for the banana tiramisu. HIGHLY recommend. It was a wonderful mix of banana, cream, chocolate, dark chocolate and it was perfect. \n\nBefore we ordered dessert, a table had opened up in the front row of the patio absolutely PERFECT to see the show and Paul moved us closer without even hesitating.  His great service and thoughtfulness made our night along with the ambiance and good food.\n\nOverall- Olives was a good choice for us.  It's a little pricey but hey, that's Vegas :)
