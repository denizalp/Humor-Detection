I'll start by saying that I'm SOO beyond happy that I found this hidden gem! I've been coming  here since they first opened and I'm still a huge fan!!!\n\nThe atmosphere is awesome! Even when it's dead there's a great vibe going on here. The outside patio is wonderful for larger groups and perfect for a nice Sunday funday gathering. Rose-all-day baby!! The accent painted wall is a nice touch and ties in perfectly with the twisted classy feel of the inside bar. \n\nNow to the service. The service has been absolutely outstanding every time I'm here! All the bartenders are super personable, have amazing attitudes not to mention make some incredible cocktails. I would say that the majority of them are extremely knowledgeable on all ends of the spectrum. The servers are also super friendly and know their stuff! Like I said before I have yet to have bad service here and I doubt I will! I must give a double high five to the friendly manager who is clearly doing a good job of training his staff and running this posh little place!! \n\nOn to the food. All I can say is BRAVO!! All the main entr√©es are spectacular! The southern fried chicken is mouthwatering. The Chinese char siu ribs with smoked peanuts and cilantro pesto are to die for and I could easily live off of the lemon chimichurri cauliflower and mason jar chopped salad for the rest of my life.\n\n*** Also a little secret.... You can bring your dog along if you choose to sit on the front patio!! \n\nWay to go guys! Keep up the amazing work!
