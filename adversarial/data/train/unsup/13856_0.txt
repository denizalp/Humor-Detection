3 1\/2, but I'm bumping it to 4.  It was a pleasant surprise to learn that a veggie restaurant had opened up in North Phoenix, which is also a good location for North Scottsdale veggie lovers.\n\nWith a handful of tables and booths inside (capacity @ 34 people) and another handful of tables on their outside patio, it's a cozy little cafe-like spot. \n\nI am not an expert when it comes to Indian food, but it does seem like their menu is limited.  There's no dahl\/daal, Gobi Manchurian, Aloo Gobi, Aloo Saag, or Masala dishes.  Instead, there is an abundance of puri\/roti and Aloo Curry dishes. I also noticed that naan was missing from their menu. Maybe they have it upon request? I'll be sure to ask upon my next visit and will report back accordingly.\n\nI ordered the Samosas and the Vada Pav.  The Samosa dish comes with 2 whole potato-filled samosas, which were fried to a perfectly flaky golden crisp.  I opted for tamarind sauce instead of the mint sauce. \n\nThe Vada Pav came with 2 spicy potato patties on buns (think sliders), garnished with a garlic red chili sauce.  They were delicious, although the buns were very cold and wet\/mushy on the bottom. I didn't understand the cause for this, unless the buns were initially frozen... I'm not sure, but aside from that the dish was very good and I would order it again. \n\nThey are a vegetarian restaurant but over 1\/2 of the menu is vegan or can be made vegan. Vegan options are marked with a 'V' on the board menu and the printed menu. They do not serve eggs; the non-vegan dishes contain dairy (yogurt or cottage cheese). They do have few gluten-free options marked on the menu as well.  \n\nThey have a case with pre-packaged deserts, some of which are vegan, but not labeled as such, so be sure to ask. The prices seem decent, to me, at least for what I ordered. \n\nI spoke with the owner and inquired about the selection of dishes.  She indicated that since they were so new, she wanted to see how the current dishes sell.  They could possibly expand or modify their selection at a later time.\n\nThey are barely a month old, so I know that they have kinks to work out.  I received friendly service and good food; as a vegan, I will definitely continue to patronize them in hopes that they will improve over time.\n\nLocated inside the strip mall on the SW corner of Bell and Tatum, between the Big Lots and Walmart.\n\n(Side note, their fountain machine has crushed ice!)
