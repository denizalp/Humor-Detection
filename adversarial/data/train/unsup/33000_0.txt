We were a little hesitant to come here with the mixed reviews, but it was fantastic!  We came for breakfast, and made sure to get there just a little before 9:00 as we wanted to beat the churchies. \n\nIt was pretty empty when we got there, and kinda busy by the time we left. Service was friendly and attentive. \n\nI had the chorizo breakfast burrito with a similarly themed Bloody Mary. Both were very tasty and just spicy enough. My wife had the Brew City Benedict with a biermosa. \n\nWe can't wait until the weather gets warmer to try the outdoor seating and try more beers. We'll be back for sure!
