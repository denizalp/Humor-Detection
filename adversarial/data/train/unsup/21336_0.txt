This place is the best if you're just looking to gamble your entire weekend away.  It's a really small casino but it's not busy at all (at least during the afternoons when we were here) and some of the machines are fairly new.  It's also nice and clean.\n\nAtmosphere aside, the other con's were that food options were minimal, cocktails aren't as free-flowing  and the hotel rooms seem disproportionately expensive.  \n\nYou would think that not being as busy you would seek the cocktail waitress come around a little more often but that wasn't really the case. Once, when we were there on a Sunday, they sent the one cocktail waitress off somewhere and had the bartender run around to the populated areas of the casino to ask if anyone wanted a drink.\n1 - That sort of showed you how small the casino is.\n2 - That sort of showed you how deserted the casino was, that they could just send one bartender out to get any drink orders.\n\nOn our way out of the casino one time, I did notice they provided complimentary appetizers at the table games.  \n\nWe only ended up coming here several times in one weekend because mom fell in love with a machine (which ended up screwing her big time).  Otherwise, I don't think I would have a reason to come here.
