Very surprised at how clean this place was. \n\nInteresting to know its a lady and gentlemen club. But have no fear men, the women's section is hidden in \"The Showroom\" --err at least I think that is what it's called. But dont worry before you see any men dancing there are plenty of black curtains, a short dark hallway, and double doors.\n\nMen's show was interesting. If you're celebrating anything you can pay $45 to get the girl up on stage. We got free drink tickets so I dont know how much drinks were. Also has a bathroom in the girl's section, so no need to walk out and see all the men getting their lap dances and such. \n\nThis place keeps it all seperated pretty nicely.
