I live in the neighborhood so I was super excited that a boba shop that boasts authentic Taiwanese tea moved into the hood!\n\nFirst thoughts: \n- decent amount of seating. But the place is small so it will probably be noisy if it's a packed out. There's about 6 tables and 2 \"bar\" style seating near the entrance.  \n- free WiFi\n-plenty of drink options(over30)\n- FOOD!! yassss\n\nI ordered a milk tea with pudding. Light ice, 80% sweetened. I probably could have went with 50%, but 80% wasn't too sweet. It was just right. Pudding is one thing that I miss from Taiwan and it tastes okay here. I wish it was a little sweeter, but it does the job. If you like pudding, you have to try it! Overall, the milk tea was just average to me. I give it a 3\/5\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the passion fruit green tea. AMAZING. I give it a 5\/5. It reminds me of a drink that I used to buy in Taiwan almost every day, minus the actual passion fruit. Nonetheless, still tasty. I love the boba and jelly. It's pretty much a snack in a cup. He ordered 80% sweetened and again, 50% would probably be great if you're sensitive to sugar but 80% is perfect. \n\n\nWe didn't try the food because we were full, but I'm sure we will be back soon since it's just down the street. \n\nIf it is your first time coming, I would definitely try a fruit tea since theirs was so good.\n\n\nCame back for another passion fruit green tea. Still delicious!\n\nAlso tried out the calamari. The calamari is so good, and for $7.50 you get a big enough serving to share with 3 people. I love the seasoning on it. It reminds me of taiwan
