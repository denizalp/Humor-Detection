I loved the overall ambience and intimacy of this place, inside it has a rustic industrial feel  to it. Today the front part was open which was nice to soak in downtown.\n\nI opted for Italian wedding soup with a wedge salad but no meatball I figured there would be some in my soup but it was a chicken only base.\n\nMy wedge salad was very fulfilling with the heat bacon and out of this world randy dressing. Definitely try the ranch.\n\nToday I dined on the first floor but the rooftop beer garden is stunning especially at night time the city view is breathtaking.
