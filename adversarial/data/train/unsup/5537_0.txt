Got the Dagwood. Pretty safe bet if a restaurant is named after something, its their signature dish. Defiantly not a fancy place, but if you serve good food, you don't have to be. My sandwich was really big and meaty, but sadly they forgot the bacon on there, which is admittedly my favorite part of anything. The bread on the Dagwood seemed like it wasn't quite cut out for the job. It was like a smart car hauling a boat, but the bread was indeed quite good, just could be a little bigger.
