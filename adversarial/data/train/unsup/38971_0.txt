Avoid this place like the plague. Never have I ever walked a more consistently inconsistent Brueggers than this one. \n\nToday when I came in, it was the cashier who initially took my order, then handed it off to one of the workers on the line. This is where my order may have gotten lost. Since everything gets rung up at the end, there is no real system keeping track of what was ordered (including any modifications and allergies), making it easy to mess things up. The toasted asiago bagel with onion and chive cream cheese I ordered then became an untoasted cinnamon bagel with onion and chive. Ultimately I had to toss my entire bagel since I was already at my destination and could not get it remade.\n\nThe real issue here is the lack of a proper ordering system and a reliance on verbal communication between workers. If I had any real allergies (like a nut or dairy allergy) I would not trust this place to handle it. \n\nIf you like weird bagel combinations and living life on the edge, this location is for you. For me, I'll be sticking to better places nearby.
