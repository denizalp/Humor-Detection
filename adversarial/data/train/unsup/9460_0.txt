I am not sure if I should give it 5 stars for being a fun trail with great views or 1 star for making me puke at 5: a.m.  In June '11 I was looking for a running trail and saw this on Alltrails.  I got up early to beat the sun and went to tear this trail up.  Parking lot was almost full and the trail was pretty crowded.  I hit play on my ipod and started running.  It did not take long for me to see this is a Hiking trail and not so much a Running trail.  My pace went from 8 mm to 10 mm to 12 mm.  Not far from the top I hit the wall.  I sat and enjoyed the view as I revisited that morning's protein shake.  After a half hour on my back I headed back to my car with my tail between my legs. You got me this time Piestewa, but I will be back
