Oh, Thomas Keller!  You make me so very happy.  Let's get married and have little foodie babies.  OK, I don't want to have anyone's babies.  But we could practice making babies then you could cook for me after.  \n\nThis is my wish....don't make fun, people.\n\nI've wanted to have brunch at this spot since I've been coming to Vegas.  Finally!  My last trip included a delightful brunch with my friends.  \n\nEverything was truly wonderful.  I swear that the eggs had some sort of special ingredient that makes me crave them like a crackhead joneses for the pipe.  Who knows what I'd do for another taste of those eggs.  I'll let your mind wander on that one.......
