I was in the vicinity and I decided to check it out. I had a double with Rose Pistachio and Spiced Date. Rose Pistachio is good given that it is non-dairy. I am not a Vegan. I will probably have their single serving next time or their popsicle, if I am in the neighbourhood. It was a tad expensive for what I got. \n\nThe place is a little hard to find. Just go all the way around the building.
