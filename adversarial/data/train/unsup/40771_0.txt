This place is gross. The mattress are just springs. They are super dirty. The staff is horrible and they don't actually have breakfast at all. When I asked staff to be moved they suggested I get out and get my money back Monday, even though the tv, the beds and everything was filthy. Literal blood stains on the sheets it was beyond gross.
