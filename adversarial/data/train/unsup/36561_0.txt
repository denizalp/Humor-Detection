My spouse and I came here for some hibachi.  I had the chicken while my spouse had the beef and shrimp.  \n\nMy spouse loved her meal.  It came hot and the shrimp was perfectly cooked.  \n\nFor my meal I found my spring roll was cold and the chicken was swimming in sauce.  I may consider getting a beef dish rather than chicken. \n\nThe server was very friendly and very attentive.  The place offers a reasonable meal and a good price.
