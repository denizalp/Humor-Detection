This thrift store is an absolute hidden gem on Cleveland's near east side.  I'm a fan of the thrift and I'm a fan of the bargain,  this thrift store provides both! \n\nUpon entering the store, you have two choices, you can go right and check out the furniture (their selection is slim) or you can go left and enter the thrift store section.  I generally pick the door on the left.  \n\nI was surprised when I first went in there that it wasn't overcrowded with hipsters and the like, it seems to fall off their radar.  Maybe it being just east of  CSU or close to E. 55th make it a no man's land for the hipsters that so take over other areas of town.  \n\nI've always been able to find amazing finds here, you may have to really dig, but it's totally worth it.  Some of my most recent scores have been a vintage Gucci bag that I picked up for $5, a vintage Yves Saint Laurent blouse for $3, which looks absolutely fabulous with a high waist pencil skirt, and an awesomely cuddly drape cardigan for  $7.  \n\nI've never walked out of there with what I thought was a bad purchase! The prices are fair, their merchandise is fairly well sorted and the store is kept relatively clean.  All of the sales people I've encountered are extremely nice and very helpful.  \n\nOverall, I absolutely love this thrift store and make it a point to stop in there at least every couple weeks or so as they routinely swap out their merchandise!
