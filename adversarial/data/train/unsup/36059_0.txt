We`ve been here a few times over the years.  The food is average.  Service is slow and they don`t really go out of their way for you.  My friend can`t eat gluten, but they said they were unable to modify any of the dishes to accommodate him (even something as simple as leaving out some cheese was too much to ask).  Probably won`t bother coming here again.  There are plenty of great restaurants in Montreal, but this isn`t one of them.
