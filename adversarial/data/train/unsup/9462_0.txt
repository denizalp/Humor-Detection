Just had PK towing come to my condo to remove my flat tire (didn't have the tools to remove the lugnuts - were stuck on pretty good).  Called at around 10:00pm, arrived at my condo half an hour later. The person who performed the tire change, Ali, was amazing.  Great customer service, and extremely helpful - very pleasant demeanor.\n\nThis is the first time I've ever needed a towing company - great experience and happy with my choice.
