I did not buy my dress from Beautiful Brides, but I still wanted to write a review. I had the most amazing experience here and I'm so upset I can't remember my associates name(I think it was Chloe)! The dress shop is small but I prefer it that way. They have a great selection of dresses and the associates are really nice. \n\nI do wish they would've provided a corset\/waist cincher but other than that, it was great.
