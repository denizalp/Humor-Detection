Since the early days of TCBY to today's self serve shops, I am a huge frozen yogurt fan.  I'll be honest, the yogurt itself doesn't stand out at any particular yogurt place, but there are a few differences that I think make Yogurt Builderz my top choice. \n\n1. Flavor Availability - YB offers 10 flavors at all times and typically keeps all the really popular ones (Oreo & Oatmeal Cookie) in the rotation consistently.  \n\n2. Freeze factor - yes, I said it.  At some shops, the yogurt is too melted, others it's too frozen.  YB's consistency is usually great!\n\n3. Neighborhood hangout - YB has created more than a yogurt shop,  people want to be there to hang out with their family and friends.  I think that's because the owners treat people like they  want to be treated.  Free Wi-fi and ample seating are great perks too!\n\n4. Giving back  - YB does community nights to support locals schools and organizations.  \n\n5. The crew - Many are students who are friendly, polite and regularly talk to customers.  They keep the store nice and clean and have speedy, helpful service.  \n\nI love Yogurt Builderz so much I go there up to 4 times a week.  I think it's a great store and I wish it much success.  If I was signing their yearbook I'd write \"Don't ever change\"!
