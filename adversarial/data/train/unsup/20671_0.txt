When I found out Andreoli was made famous by Guy Fieri, I had to check it out.  I find pure joy in verifying his claims.  Not every joint he claims to fame is a home run.  But in this case, I can confidently say it was a buzzard beater winner, chicken dinner.  \n\nInstead of trying to remember every single dish we had I will just say, everything was fantastico!  Upon ordering, the gentleman behind the counter kindly recommended to us to get something with seafood and sure enough it was spot on good.  The squid, clams, shrimp, and scallops were cooked perfectly.  Not rubbery at all.  Each came in some kind of pasta--risotto or spaghetti.  All prepared in classic al dente in fused with light, hearty flavor that reminds you of grandma's cooking.\n\nI saved the best for last which is their carpaccio cold salad.  The presentation provoked salivation which then led us to beefgasm to the Nth degree.  The thinly sliced almost raw beef just melted in your mouth accompanied by the fresh salad and thin, transparent cheese.  \n\nI partially lied about confirming on Guy Fieri's claim since none of these were what he actually ate but I am basically trusting his word as first impression on the mentioned foods were memorable and outstanding.  The reason why we couldn't try the foods he had was because one of them was out of season while the other was recommended as a lunch item.\n\nNot much else to say except to come check them out.  The wallet might take a big hit, but you will gain a much deeper respect for Italian cuisine.
