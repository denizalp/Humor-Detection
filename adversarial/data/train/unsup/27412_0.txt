As far as convenience goes, I should be buying gas and last minute essentials here on a weekly basis. I live right there and it would be the simplest stop to make. But I find myself driving out of my way to avoid this place at all costs. The people who work here seriously hate their job and hate me for pulling them away from their cigarette break to dare purchase anything. Try asking them a question and they mighty as well tell you to eff off. Give them a gift card and holy Jesus! Watch your back when you leave. It's the same two people I've dealt with almost every time. I don't understand how they are still employed here let alone anywhere else. Not to be mean but The owner obviously doesn't do drug tests. It's just a sad disgusting place.
