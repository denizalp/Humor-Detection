Glad I waited to give my 5 star review...I am a regular for their Tuesday\/Thursday morning class with Trish and i just found out that she has been taken off the schedule and replaced by someone else. She just recently started the Sunday 8:30 am class and she is no longer the instructor for that too!!! I am extremely disappointed and frustrated that they changed the times and instructors for these classes. I have faithfully continued my membership and paid good money to keep coming back. I wake up at 4:30 on these days excited to attend her class. She was my first experience with spin as a spin class instructor and she is the only reason I continue to come back. She has been a breath of fresh air when it comes to experiencing an instructor that really has high energy to keep people motivated through the whole class and now she is only available to me once per week due to my work schedule. I will be writing the owner about this, hopefully something can change as I really like this studio. \n\nAs far as the facility it it super clean and very well keep. The studio style spin with a variety of music hits is a great experience to rock a good ride.
