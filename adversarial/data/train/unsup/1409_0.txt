The line is long and moves painfully slow. There are two registers but only one is used. Two espresso station and again only one is used. Prices are high, not unusual for a franchise store. The problem is the higher prices includes an inferior beverage. The latte was made from inadequately prepared espresso making it taste like hot milk with a hint of coffee. Added deduction for forgetting the vanilla syrup I was charged for. Additionally the customer service was substandard to other stores. The staff were not at all pleasant and seemed to loath even being there. It's worth the walk to the nearest \"real\" Starbucks to get a proper beverage at a fair price and maybe staff that is a little engaged in their customer service.
