Opted for the $20\/3 day plan. I should have tried the $10\/day to try them out. Horrible response time and my connection dropped multiple tried. I made the mistake of \"living\" with the problem for 3 hours as I had to get some work done. I should have cancelled the service right away. Called twice to their customer service folks (who were nice at least) to rectify the situation.\n\nNow I will have to escalate with my credit card company to dispute the charges. I would recommend staying away from this service provider.
