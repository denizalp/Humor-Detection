Lost our reservation but still honor a table for us. It's an high end veg Chinese restaurant price range from $12.50 and up. The dishes are small portion and took them almost 2 hrs to bring up all 7 dishes we ordered. They tasted alright but I see mushroom on all dishes. They should try to widen up their variety of veg ingredients if you ask me. It ended up cost me total $114 and I gave $16 tips but the waitress still stare at me like we did not give any???\nHire more chefs and the price is too high. \nThat's why you don't see any lineup even on weekends. I don't know how long they gonna last.......
