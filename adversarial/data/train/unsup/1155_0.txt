This review is for the Drag Strip Only.\nThe Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway is a top notch drag racing facility. All the seats are nice, and the Top Eliminator club with the upper seats is fantastic. I always pony up the money for the better seats, that come with lunch and breakfast.  The upper seats are shaded as well. The lower seats do get shade as the day progresses to mid afternoon.\nThe NHRA racing is top shelf. I always say everybody should see it once. You will then know if you want to come back. It is an impressive display of power and fury.\nThroughout the day the air traffic from Nelis Air Force Base is another part ot the show for me. Seeing the fighters and bombers up close in flight is cool. Once there was a B-1 that came by!\nYou must know that I have been a drag race fan since the late 60's so I may be a bit more excited about the races than others. Come on up and see one of the big events and it might be an experience of a lifetime
