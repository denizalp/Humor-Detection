I'm staying at the Linq during my visit in Las Vegas and I'm a huge food network fan...so I had to visit Guy's restaurant inside the Linq! For appetizers we had pepperoni breadsticks with cheese fondue. It was sooooo good. We kept the fondue and had it with our mac and cheese burger. Oozy cheese pasta on top of a beef patty cooked perfected with crispy edges but juicy inside. The fries were a combination of waffles, shoestring, crinkles, and wedges. There was a seasoning on the fries that wasn't overwhelming but perfect. Honestly my favorite burger I've ever had. It was pretty big so my friend and I shared it! Will come back when in Vegas!
