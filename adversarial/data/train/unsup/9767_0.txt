Zero stars.  Canadian socialism at its WORST.  If you like being treated like less than a number this is the place for you.  If governments insist on drive testing over 80s, must they make it torturous and impossibly difficult to navigate? Online website broken for bookings. Telephone queue is 1 hour +.  Drag 82 yo dad here to book in person. Greeted by frowns and indifference,  and you guessed it, HUGE line ups.  Abysmal in every way.
