The service here is not so exceptional. Although I am a bulldog nutrition athlete, I find myself time to time at Popeyes because they carry a few brands that bulldog doesn't. Which is kudos for them. Everything is very organized and they've got tons of supps for every diet, every athlete. \n\nThey also have good deals every now and then! Up to 50% off of items. \n\nI don't think a lot of the associates here are genuinely nice, especially the females. It's a very fake kind of retail store nice, and the overall attitude was not great. After I rejected making an account there, she turned very unfriendly and cold. Also did not give me my Popeye's dollars which I qualified for because I spent enough $, and when I asked, she said you can't get them unless you're a Popeye's member. Which is not true because I've collected many Popeye's dollars from different stores. Definitely lied because she didn't want to deal with me anymore, so ew I definitely left very unpleasantly. \n\nEvery fucking Durham chick working in a supps store thinks she's almighty because she's a fucking bikini competitor and tbh I'm not going back to this location anymore because I'm salty af because they're sour af. \n\nPs. Send me my damn Popeye's dollars to my address.
