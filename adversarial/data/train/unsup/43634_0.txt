The store recently got upgraded which is nice.  They have good selection, nothing to exotic but more then their local competitor.  At first I was against self checkout but now I like it.  Regular lines are usually slow, I don't like to chit chat and no one sees what I'm buying and I can be in and out in no time.  They also have a chase bank in their which I've used on a few instances.  All in all not bad.  I wish they would carry more organic stuff.
