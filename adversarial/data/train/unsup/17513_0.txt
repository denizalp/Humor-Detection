There was a hair in my shawarma wrap.  Black and about an inch (I have long blond hair).   I showed the owner (man in his late 50s or early 60s with glasses) and he took it over the counter and pulled it off and wiped it on his apron and put the sandwich back and denied there was a hair.  I said he wiped it off and he started yelling saying eat your sandwich and you're not getting your money back.  Only after me waiting for 2 min as I had only ate two bites he basically threw it in my hands and yelled at me to get out.  What a horrible person.  I do NOT recommend this place.  It was cheap but the two bites I had weren't very good and the owner is horrible.
