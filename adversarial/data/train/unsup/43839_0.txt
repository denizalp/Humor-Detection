Call me crazy but I'm obsessed with their spicy ying nan noodles (sp?). Every time I visit Las Vegas I have to eat there. I rave about it all the time. I stumbled upon this restaurant back in 2011 when me and my friends stayed at Palazzo. I was hungry and wanted to eat so I went on my own wandering off to look for food #fatkidstatus because all of my friends were tired or drunk lol \nthe noodles just hit the spot and its been hitting the spot ever since.
