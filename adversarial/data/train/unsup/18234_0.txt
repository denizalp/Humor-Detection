Why go: Indian Buffet \n\nAs a current college student, I do see myself coming back here. One thing this place did lack was having Chicken Tikka Masala. I did come back for three rounds of curry though, but that's because I love curry.  I came here with five of my classmates and service was great.\n\nWhat I had: \nTandoori Chicken. Rating: 3.5\/5\nLamb Vindaloo. Rating: 3\/5\nSpinach Side: Rating 3\/5\nOrange Sweet Drink. Rating: 2.5\/5\n\n\nCon: Buffet did not have Chicken Tikka Malsa
