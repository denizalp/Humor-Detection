I came here because I had a living social deal. It was okay, but I don't think I would go again if I had to pay full price. \nSteam treatment was nice. The micodermabrasion made my face feel soft, but there's still some dry spots. she said I'd have to have a few more treatments. I think I'd try a different place tho
