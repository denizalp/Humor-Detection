Meat+Bread+Tzatziki Sauce= Mouth Magic. \n\nMulti styles of hummus, meat n' spinach pockets, and the insane customer service tactics. Hungry yet? \n\nThis place popped up on the, \"new businesses\" page on Yelp and I realized this was right down the street from mi casa... shawarma time! When you walk-in you feel the friendly vibes pumping out of here as the staff welcomes you and ask how they can help with your order. This place offers, shawarma sandwiches, multiple salads, and  kabob plates. They make almost everything in house from the sauces, to the tabouli, and even roasting the meat on a traditional vertical roaster. \n\nI ordered the the shawarma wrap with lamb and all the fixins. Along with a greek salad, and stuffed grape leaves. The sandwich was amazing; fresh veggies, warm tender lamb, all brought together with a fresh made tzatziki sauce. The TZ sauce was so good that I want a IV hook-up, just so I can have it pumped directly into my veins every half hour. The bread was the perfect match for this feast. Thin and not too doughy, but strong enough to hold the amazingness that was inside. \n\nThe stuffed grapes leaves were, just ok. To be honest, I've never really had a amazing grape leaves experience. I think it's a texture thing. Anyways, The salad was for my GF and she gave it a definite thumbs up. \n\nWould I go back for seconds? Yes. Which is why you should go for firsts or thirds.
