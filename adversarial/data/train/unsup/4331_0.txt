I set up the Mac section of this particular Fry's store for Apple about 6 years ago, and was impressed by the look and feel of this store compared to some of the (older) Bay Area stores.  I stopped by while I was in Vegas for pleasure about a week ago and they've kept it up nicely.  I was helped within a few minutes of getting to the Mac section, and they have a wide variety of Apple products and accessories and good signage.  A clean, well-lighted place for Macs!  Once you step under the archway sporting the Apple logo, you feel like you're in good hands.  Congrats!
