Do the people who run Lunasea realize that when spoken aloud, the name of their salon seems to be \"lunacy\"? To me this is an almost insurmountable gaffe, and yet I chose to have my hair cut here, against my better judgment, for a number of reasons.\n\nOf the three salons located equidistant from my house, Lunasea has the best curb appeal. It's small and independently owned, ensuring a more personal experience. The space is pleasant and well-maintained, without the unbearably pretentious atmosphere that I've experienced at so many \"high end\" salons. Even the cheesy abstract mural on the side of the building is charming in its way. \n\nUnfortunately, the service at Lunasea is simply not up to par. That statement must be taken with a grain of salt since I've only dealt with one stylist, Leanne, who I was scheduled with on my first visit, and have been assigned to for all subsequent appointments. Reading some of the other reviews of Lunasea, it seems that other stylists may be more friendly and attentive. However, in a pleasant and unpretentious place, Leanne seems to have adopted the \"high end\" salon attitude. Although I've had appointments with her three times, she never appears to remember me, and cannot be bothered to call me by name or carry on a conversation. I always go in with a positive attitude, thinking that perhaps I just caught her on a bad day, but despite my best efforts I have yet to have a truly positive experience.\n\nAs far as the haircuts themselves, Leanne's work is fine but not fantastic. The only time she makes the effort to speak is to chastize me for my dry split ends, something entirely out of my control and the reason that I'm in the salon to begin with. If I wanted my haircut with a lecture I'd have my mother trim the ends like she did when I was five. The bottom line is that Lunasea is cute and convenient, but if I do return I'll be requesting a new stylist. Otherwise, Philip Pelusi, here I come.
