It is what it is, certainly not some fancy restaurant but still very good and very well priced. Great spot to grab a quick and easy bite. I will say the manager Brad is amazing he went out of his way to get us a menu item that had been removed, a few weeks back. Great job Brad!!! Highly recommend their breakfast items so good!!!
