Been here a few times now and really enjoy the workouts! Lots of variety and Michelle (the instructor) was very encouraging and pushes you without being a drill sergeant which is awesome in my books! The other people attending seem friendly and non-judgmental as well. Makes it easier to get motivated to go when you know you'll be in a such great environment with great people.
