My first time here with my sister, and I was kinda disappointed. First of all, our servers were just ok to us. We sat at the bar, and had a Hispanic lady as a sushi chef. My sister & I love salmon and we had ordered salmon nigiri. Each order is 2 pcs per order and we would put in 4 orders of salmon nigiri and LITERALLY get 4 pcs of salmon nigiri  we even asked the lady if it was 2 pcs per order and she said yes and still made the mistake again after we ordered again 3 times! I felt like she didn't know the menu too well either, because she would look at me confused when I would ask her for more stuff\/rolls and I would be confused? As if she was asking me like I worked there lol. I also felt that my salmon nigiri's were super thin and small like they were being stingy with the fish. 2 stars only because service was alright.
