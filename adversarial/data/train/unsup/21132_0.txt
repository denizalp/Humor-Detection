A serious let down from a place that's supposedly one of the best Thai restaurants in the city. I visited Golden Thai on a Saturday afternoon a few weeks ago. It was completely empty - usually a bad sign - but I forged ahead because I've heard only good things about the place. I should have listened to my gut. The food wasn't awful, but it wasn't that great either and it is overpriced.\n\nWe were doing the vegetarian thing that day and we went for: Vegetarian Platter for Two ($18.95 or $9.94 for one person), Thai Vegetable Soup ($6.45), and Golden Thai Tofu ($7.95) with Steamed Rice ($2). To be honest, the food was so boring and lacklustre I can't even remember anything intelligent to say about it. I will say that I was really disappointed by the lack of wonderful flavour and fragrance that I usually expect in Thai food. Overall, my experience was on par with Spring Rolls - not a good sign.\n\nMaybe I ordered the wrong things, maybe their meat options are better than the veggy ones, but I certainly won't be back to check. With the superb Mengrai Thai (http:\/\/www.yelp.ca\/biz\/mengrai-gourmet-thai-toronto) only a short walk away I don't know why anyone would eat at Golden Thai.
