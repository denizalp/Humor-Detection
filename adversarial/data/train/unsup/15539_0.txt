You know those weeks where you just want to sink into a comfortable chair and relax when its all done? I had that experience on Friday night at Sassi, and it was perfect. It was great to be so attentively waited on, and the atmosphere with friends was enjoyable after the long week.\n\nThe Sassi GM, Stephen, was kind enough to welcome NVFN (North Valley Friday Nights) to Sassi last Friday. He had an area at the bar set aside for us and provided an assortment of \"pickies\" :D  lovely little things for us to snack on like toasted nuts, olives and flatbread. He also extended the happy hour menu for us. The wine was flowing and the food was great as always- we had the margarita pizza, the eggplant involtini, the skewered beef and the stuff squah blossoms. Everything was perfect.\n\nSassi is definitely one of my faves, thanks so much for having us, we'll be back very soon
