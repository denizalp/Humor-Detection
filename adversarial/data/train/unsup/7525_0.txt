And my raving for the KURO RAMEN ($8.95) begins. It is hands down a genius creation! Think rich and thick tonkotsu broth with an added black garlic oil that is immaculately fragrant and savory. You know it's been simmering for hours the moment that soup touches your lips and coats your mouth like silk. I tell you, it's delicious beyond words. Give in to the urge of adding that flavored egg for an extra $1.50 and some corn for $.50 more. The option to add butter is there if you think this bowl could use more fat than it already contains. Go ahead, I won't judge. The noodles are chewy with a good bounce to it however, the next time I'm here, I'm asking if they can substitute the thin noodles to the thick wavy ones they use for the miso ramen. It's just something I prefer and definitely not a deal breaker.\n\nI've heard good things about the PORK BELLY BOWL (sm $3.95) and I concur. It's slices of tender pork with a sweet and salty marinade over white rice, and then topped with ginger and green onions. Only, after having the KIMCHI FRIED RICE ($6.95), there was no looking back at that pork bowl. The latter won my heart and palate as soon as a heaping spoonful made it to my mouth. Oh how I wanted to come back that same weekend for more. \n\nWhat's impressive too is the efficiency of the servers and kitchen. We sat, ordered, had our drinks, and before I could even say a word, our food trickled in just like that...boom, boom, boom! The long list of names on the clipboard can be a turn-off but don't be deceived, the turnover is quick as an energizer bunny.
