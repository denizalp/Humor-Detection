If you're looking for great, flavorful food, this is the place!  Aside from the great chips, salsa, bean dip... They serve grilled peppers and onions with it, awesome!  And a really good cup of fideo soup.  The fajitas are the best I've ever eaten and the way they are served is so unique.  I would love one of those pots they use.  I can't wait to take my family, they are having a 3day Cinco d Mayo celebration that promises to be lots of fun!  The staff is great, service the best, this is one place that really wants to provide a great experience.
