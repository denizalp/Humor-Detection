The New York New York was my favorite of the few hotels we explored during our weekend in Vegas. This kiosk of a bar had an awesome view of the casino floor and so we stopped for a drink. The bartender was very friendly and made our drinks to order with ease. Someone from our group grabbed a pretzel from another kiosk nearby and we enjoyed our little break from running around and spending too much money.
