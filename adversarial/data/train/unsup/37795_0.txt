Marvin was an excellent guy who treated us very nice and got everything done in a timely manner. \n\nFax, notarize, mail stuff, watch repair, you name it.\n\nHe was very personable and respectful.\n\nThe store is a little messy but he's an old dude. Don't judge him.\n\nI think he knows President Trump personally...?
