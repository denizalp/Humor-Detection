I can't tell you how impressed i was with this nail salon. They definitely brought Beverly Hills to Las Vegas. \n\nEverything... and when i say everything is beautiful in here, I'm not lying. I love how they really put a lot of effort into designing this place. From the floors to the celling to even the details of putting their logo on the towels. \n\nI came in for a mani & pedicure, found this place on Groupon. \n\nFirst i got my pedicure and i was impressed. The chairs are really girly but hey pedicure are normally for girls (I'm just a guy that takes care of my feet lol) i did like how all the tools needed for my pedicure was in a sealed bag. It felt safe! \n\nNext was my mani cure and it was done right at my seat. I didn't have to move to somewhere else, it was right we're i was sitting at. \n\nThe lady i believe her name was Nina did amazing!
