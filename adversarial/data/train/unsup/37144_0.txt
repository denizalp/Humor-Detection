First time in here... They weren't too busy. The cashier was super personable and advised me Tuesday is $10 for any large pizza. This was great (since it was a better deal than the coupons I had!). They made my pizza quickly and it smells amazing :) I haven't been to a Papa Murphy's in years and I was impressed by the cleanliness of the store, friendliness of the staff and also how quickly my pizza was made. This is a great alternative to regular 'take out' pizza since you get to take ownership on actually 'cooking' a semi home-cooked meal.\n\nI loved the vegetarian gourmet I ordered! Definitely hit the spot! :)
