The buffet was the best I have been to ever.  They have a large variety of food and drinks.  Wine and beer are included in the price of the buffet.  I would have eaten there everyday if I had known about this place prior to my last day.\nThe place is very clean and well maintained.  Line was a little long but not unreasonable.  \nAmerican, Asian, Italian food, salad bar, carving table and more\nThey have a discount through the local tix vendors.  Big plus, they have a 50% military discount at the counter.  Just show your ID.  I found that out when I showed up.
