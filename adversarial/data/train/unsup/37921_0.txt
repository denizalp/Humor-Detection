It's not a good day when u get in a car accident. It's a tough situation you find yourself in. One of the biggest questions is  where to take your car to get fixed. Well if you decided to take it here, I'm sure you will be satisfied!!! \n\nThe costumer service here if awesome! They are in constant communication with you to let you know the status of your vehicle. My car looked phenomenal! It was only four months old when I got hit. And it really looked like I was rolling off the dealers lot yet again. \n\nThe place is leaps and bounds ahead of other body shops we have been to!!  This is the most satisfied I have ever been.  My husband who is extremely picky when it comes to his cars is satisfied as well. He was impressed on how clean the car was and how smooth and well buffed out it was. I loved the paint job that was done on it!! \nI will defiantly recommend this body shop to friends and family and if I am ever in need again I will be going back as well.  Thank you New Look for making my baby look and feel new again!
