This place was not obvious at all, and even after finding it I probably would not have ventured up here if we weren't tired and hungry. But it's a great example of how you shouldn't judge based on looks. While the narrow entrance and staircase didn't look (or smell) all that inviting, we were relieved to see several tables with patrons for a somewhat late dinner. With the regular menu as well as a number of different whiteboards with specials along the wall, it took a while to decide what to order. The waitstaff were friendly and helpful and I settled on a lamb dish on rice, which was shown on the wall. We appreciated that everyone had a choice of soup to go with the meal, especially the fact that they had several options available. My chicken and cream soup was tasty, as was the entree itself, which was ready after a reasonable amount of time. A huge portion of lamb, all very tender, along with sweet onions as well as ginger and scallion. I might have preferred less sauce on top, but the taste was on point.
