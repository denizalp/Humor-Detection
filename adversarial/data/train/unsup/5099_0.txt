My experience was ok, but not great. The work was decent. \n\nThe prices were a bit high & kept me from having him do al the work I  was planning on. Someone else who had used him in the past mentioned that the prices have kept going up.\n\nAt one point I was trying to coordinate Duane with a worker from my HOA & my tile guys as well to prioritize which jobs should happen first. Then in the middle of all of this, my water heater broke. Duane was not helpful when I was trying to figure out what had to get done first, which shocked me. He actually snapped at me, which was not a good thing to do to an already stressed out homeowner. Anyone who has ever had their house torn up & multiple people working there will know what I am talking about. That was sad because he was really nice at first. \n\nI think small fix it jobs are fine, and maybe I just had him doing too much. Overall the work itself turned out OK, but I would not use him again.
