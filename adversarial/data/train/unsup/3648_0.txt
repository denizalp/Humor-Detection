Good stuff but horrible employees. This is my 2nd time shopping and I don't like the customer service which is none, zero. I asked if they could wrap the plates we bought and cashier said, you hav to wrap your own stuff, yikes. Then when I was done paying, I heard a lady talking about a loyalty program which I'm not even aware. I asked the cashier why he didn't even offer and he said well it's there it's up to I if you want to sign up. Damn, how the heck customer knows if you don't mention it esp new shoppers? Oh my gosh  bad customer service, lazy employees grrrrr  I spent $500 and no customer service
