We were looking for a last minute dinner over Pitt family weekend.  First 3-4 options were booked and Sonoma could get us in almost right away(concerning at first). My daughter had the French Onion soup and said it was very good.  I asked if they would make the Ahi Tuna into a small appetizer.  They agreed and I received a couple chunks of \"OK\" tuna w a creamy wasabi dipping sauce.  Very middle of the road.  Our girls had the filet kabobs over fettuccine w tomato sauce.  Interesting combo but they liked it.  My oldest was craving some good mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately they told us they were out of mashed potatoes...really, one of the most basic sides...they were out.  My wife had the filet.  Nice cut, cut per request but nothing special.  I had the bacon wrapped veal medallions.  They were very good although very small.  Would have been even better over the truffle whipped potatoes, just didn't go as well with \"roasted\" fingerlings.  They were not roasted quite enough.  Good wine from st. Supery, Elu.\nOverall not bad, just not great, but thought it had potential.
