The Liberty Bell Arch hike is one of my favorites.  It's not a tough hike, but it does have its challenges.  There is absolutely no shade. The sun will kick your buttocks if choose to do this hike after 12 PM.  In fact, this hike is closed during the summer due to the extreme temperatures.  The trail is visible on 95% of this hike.  Some spots are not as clearly defined.  My suggestion is to review the map located near the parking lot, go off memory if you've done the hike before, or have Norm K. as your guide. The hike is 2 miles from the parking lot to the Liberty Bell Arch and another .60 miles to the Colorado River overlook.  Overall, this is another great hike not too far from Sin City.  \n\n\nTIP #1: Location - Take the first left after the Hoover Dam is you're heading west on the freeway\n\nTIP #2: Follow the trail into the wash. A little less than a mile from the parking lot is where you turn right towards Liberty Bell Arch.  There's also a sign and can easily be overlooked if you're not paying attention.\n\nTIP #3: Once over the first hill and towards the right is an old ore car that was left behind.  Pretty cool.  The mine is also located close by. \n\nTIP #4: I don't recommend climbing the Liberty Bell Arch. Don't do it.  \n\nTIP #5:  The views of the Colorado River is worth the hike.  Just be careful. The drop down is over 1,000 feet.\n\nTIP #6:  Bring enough hydration and snacks for energy. Peanut butter is my snack of choice.  Leave no trace.
