I wish I could say it has gotten better...alas it has not.  This is the second time I come to find someone (staff) in my apartment without my knowledge\/notice.  (According to the OWNER'S RIGHT OF INSPECTION AND ENTRY owners need to give 24 hr notice for \"during reasonable hours for any reasonable business purposes.\")\n\nManagement has no respect for its current residents and main priority is to recruit new victims. \n\nDon't be fooled it as far from \"student living\" as it could be. In fact it is a hop skip and a jump away from becoming section 8 status.\n\nInside of the building there only few trash cans so trash is scattered everywhere. Right now the trash area is open and adds to the ghetto charm. The \"courtyard\" is filled with glass, which is great if you want your pet to die. \n\nI wonder what there criteria is for the qualifying standards. My last roommate was a stripper. Not even kidding. If you have a credit card and pulse your qualified.
