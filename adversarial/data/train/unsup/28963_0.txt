The beer was fantastic and my wife ordered the snapper. Also fantastic. We also ordered the bacon wrapped dates...again, fantastic.  I ordered steak.  It was...NOT fantastic. While it had excellent flavor it was chewy and stringy. With a $36 price tag I expected more.  We'll definitely visit again but will like confine our ordering to beer and small plates.
