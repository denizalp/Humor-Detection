Attorney Emily McFarling fought hard for me and my divorce and custody case.  Her experience and professionalism was evident in the courtroom and made me feel she had my best interests at heart.  She was compassionate and empathetic out of court and never once made me doubt we would be successful in my case.  I can't thank Emily and her team enough for all they have done for me and would recommend them to anyone going through a divorce or custody situation.
