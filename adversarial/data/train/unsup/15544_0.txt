Can we just sit down for a minute and talk about Cookie Butter?  Are you seated?  Ok.  If you have yet to try this delicious invention, please direct yourselves to the nearest Trader Joes and buy yourself a bottle.  It will not break the bank, for less than $10 you can get a bottle of this delicious concoction (like a spreadable gingerbread \/ cinnamon butter), a box of graham crackers and some apples.  \n\nDon't do this type of thing all the time, 'cause diabetes, but next time you have a party and need a suggestion for what to bring, this is for sure a party pleaser.  On top of this, TJ always has great stuff to eat and drink.  A decent selection of beer (although every time I go I wish it was a tad more diverse) and wine, and fresh produce (most of it with organic options).\n\nThe staff is almost annoyingly friendly (not quite to Oregano's standards, but you get the picture)... and their stores are always clean and tidy.  Even if all you do is walk in and buy a bottle of Cookie Butter (stay away from the cocoa swirl, it's too much cocoa and not enough cookie butter) you won't regret it.
