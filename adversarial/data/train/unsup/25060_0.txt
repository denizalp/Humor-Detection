WORST customer service EVER! My husband and I just returned from a round-trip flight with Allegiant. Thanks to the vague wording of the carry on bag requirements, we paid for both carry on luggage AND checked luggage for each leg of our trip. When I noted at the airlines counter that we should not have paid for carry on, I was told that they could not issue a refund at the desk, but that a customer service agent by phone could issue such a refund. THEN, on the phone, I was told they since they could not PROVE we didn't have carry on luggage for both legs of the trip, they would only refund the return. So, she is branding me a liar. I responded that we would NEVER fly Allegiant again. This was our first - and LAST - experience, and you pay for EVERY LITTLE THING YOU WANT. The seats don't recline, there is no space, if you want to board, you have to PAY for a class of boarding. It's all pretty ridiculous, but this last insult was the straw that broke my back. GOODBYE!
