After receiving a very genuine response from Olive and Ivy, I clearly feel it's necessary to update my review I wrote when I was 'hangry' (hungry and angry). \n\nApparently I just need to request a certain amount of focaccia, though I truly don't need more than one piece (maybe they were just trying to prevent me from binge eating? If so, you guys are very thoughtful). I do know that in the past they were much more generous with their servings, so I was kind of hoping they would assume if I'm ordering it, that I definitely would love as much as possible ;-) \n\nI realize I sound like a lunatic ranting about this, but just think of this bread and pesto as a drug (because it's truly addictive) and I clearly need my fix...haha\n\nMoral of the story: their bread and pesto is so good that some people will actually freak out if they aren't given more than one serving :-) (or maybe that's just me...)
