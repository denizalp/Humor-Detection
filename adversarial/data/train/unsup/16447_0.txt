How did I not even know this store existed?  I was killing time before an appointment, saw the signage, wandered in & suddenly appeared in heaven.  Granted, I  spent $1.06 on a cookie cutter today ONLY because I left my cards at home for some much needed rest but will definitely be back for gifts... and more importantly, myself.  Lovely staff, lovely store, could have spent hours lovingly looking over the fabulous cook book selections if I didn't have to run.
