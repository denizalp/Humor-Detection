Came here on a Friday night with three people. It's a very small restaurant but we waited in line and ordered our noodles so that they'd be ready by the time we were seated. I had the thin noodles with beef and even the mild was slightly spicy with the chili oil on top. Overall, it tasted great! Was pretty neat you get to watch the guy hand pulling all the dough at the door too. I'd come back but wouldn't recommend for more than four guests due to limited and cramped seating.
