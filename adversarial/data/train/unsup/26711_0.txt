I am on a quest to find new restaurants and services in Bloor west since moving here last winter. I tried beauty wax room based on the reviews & price, and I am happy I did.  Service was fast, friendly and professional. In fact service was so fast, that there was very little time for awkwardness or for any pain to register. The only thing I felt was odd, was the hand sanitizer I was asked to use after my Brazilian. I would have preferred to wash my hands with soap and water. Waxing isn't fun, but the benefits outweigh the discomfort. If you're going to get waxed, you better go to someone who is quick and knows what they are doing. Clearly the Beauty Wax Room knows what they are doing.
