I would give this place a negative -10 if Yelp would let me. This place is managed by the worse person in Vegas. (Picture attached) . They sell defective tires and say they didn't sell that defective tire to you. I actually recorded the manager telling me that even with a receipt he wouldn't do anything about it. I told him I had pictures of them putting the tire on the car. He said that he would not do anything about it no matter what I had. I told him I didn't want a refund or a deal on another tire. I just wanted them to own what he did to me. This fool told me that he only sold me the tire to last me until payday when I could afford a new tire. I told him the money wasn't the issue, so he responded with \"so why didn't you buy a new tire\". I then explained that I had to order tires and my car didn't have a spare. He then said that he wasn't going to do anything about it and it doesn't matter that he sold me the tire. He said \"you bought a bad tire, that is your fault\" \n\nI am so happy I recorded the whole thing. Small claims court here I come
