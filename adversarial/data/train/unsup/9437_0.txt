I read all the reviews on how horrible the service is here, but I didn't have that experience on my stop here.  I was here with a group of 6 waiting for a flight, and our food orders seriously came out in less than 5 minutes. \n\nAlthough that gets you a plus for service, it makes sense that the food was pre-prepped in large quantities.  I had their pork carnitas burrito, and it did what it needed to do, no more, no less.  Average food at airport prices (about $11 for a burrito).\n\nSo - So.
