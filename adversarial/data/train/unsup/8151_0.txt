This place was great! I really loved the atmosphere, food, customer service, everything!\n\nI came here for lunch with some friends of mine. The first thing that I loved about it was their outdoor patio. You get to sit right next to a little water fountain, plus it was perfect weather. We came for lunch so we ordered the hummus, wasabi cut fries, and a Sonoran burger. Now I'm not a big fan of wasabi so to hear that they had wasabi fries I didn't really know what to expect. Plus I'm a total wuss when it comes to spicy food. But this was really good and it had a kick to it! My burger was perfect and I loved the sauce that it came with.\n\nFor drinks, I ordered the Strawberry Basil Crush and my friend ordered a Cosmo. My drink was very refreshing, I loved it! Beware of the Cosmo! It was strong as hell! You definitely get your money's worth with that drink. lol. \n\nEverything was just spectacular here. I can't wait to come back to try the other items and to try out their happy hour as well. =)
