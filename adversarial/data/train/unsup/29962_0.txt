This was my 1st time here and I'm giving 3 stars due to the fact that the pizza was good (although it was slightly undercooked on the bottom). As soon as we walked in you could see the chaos that was going on with the staff. There was nobody to greet us and it took a good few minutes before someone finally came and told us it'll be a few. It took some time to be seated although there was only 2 of us and there was a table for 2 wide open. The manager had no control of anything she actually looked way overwhelmed. Our server was nice but I noticed a lot of standing around with all the staff. Overall the food was good but they seem way understaffed and the management may as well have not been there. I will give this place another shot hopefully it goes better next time.
