I'm not sure why it took me years to try Vintner Grill but I'm glad I finally did. \nI've been back a couple times since for dinners, and drinks and appetizers, and each time was a unique and a great experience. \n\nDuring warmer days and evenings, I highly suggest sitting outside because they have a beautiful patio. Some of the sitting areas are close to the fire pit, while others are more secluded and would provide some privacy if that's what you are looking for. \n\nThe inside of the restaurant is also really elegant and nice. It reminds me of an upscale restaurant in Miami because of the predominately white furnishings. \n\nFood here is fresh and made with care. The standouts I can recall are: \n-The bread and butter for the table is amazing. \n-Cheese and cured meat platter - You choose from a list of meats and cheeses, including their in-house homemade cheeses (if available), and they serve it with dried fruits and jams. \n-Lamb ribs appetizer is delicious quite a large portion for an appetizer.\n-Octopus - Perfectly grilled and seasoned as a salad. \n-Pork Belly - who doesn't like thick cut bacon?\n-Beets with Lavender Goat Cheese - Love floral in food! \n\nI would certainly come back anytime for a glass of wine and appetizers with good friends.
