I've flown in and out of this airport (thanks to connections) a number of times.  Each time I come, it gets more and more crowded and it's apparent that no expansions or improvements are being made.\n\nWhile it's really not a bad airport per se, it is sort of confusing.  As I stated in a previous review, there is not a whole lot of signage showing departing or arriving flights - no matter what section of the airport you're in.  Seating is inadequate at gates.  Gates are not numbered sequentially (confusing!).  \n\nAnd it's VERY, VERY crowded.  Not only is it crowded inside the terminal, but it's crowded out on the tarmac - meaning that there is a longggg queue for you to take off.  This isn't a hop-on- the-plane, taxi-and-you're-in-the-air sort of airport.  This IS a make-sure-you've-gone-to-the-restroom airport, because once you board, you'll be circling around waiting to take off for quite a while.\n\nPerhaps if this is going to be a \"hub\" for some airlines, they'd think about investing in expansion to accommodate the increased traffic.  Or are we sardines inside and outside of the plane?
