This is a very nice hotel, complete with a huge outdoor hot tub, indoor pool, and a reasonably sized workout facility with updated equipment.  We didn't try the restaurant - it was fully booked on a Saturday night, so we went to Le Rio (which I also highly recommend).  The real wood fireplace in the lobby with lots of big leather chairs and sofas is inviting and well used by people lounging about.  The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable.  Wi-Fi is free - another bonus.
