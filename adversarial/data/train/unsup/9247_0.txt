I really have no idea how to review this place properly since I've been drunk every time I've eaten here.\n\nAlthough, maybe being drunk is the ONLY way to truly appreciate the PSC. \n\nYou can guarantee that around 2-3am when the bars close, there will be a long, drunken, sloppy line out the door. God bless the people working here at that time. I can only imagine the patience that is required to tolerate all of us idiots screaming and singing and puking and being generally awesome. \n\nYou haven't lived if youve never had a sandwich and Mac n cheese bites at 2:30 in the morning after a night out at the bars. \n\nAnd oh my god, they have a DJ at that time too! So the party doesn't have to stop when you're dripping cheez whiz down the front of your button down shirt\/club dress\/sweatshirt.
