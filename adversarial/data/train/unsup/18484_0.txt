The other sandwich place next to work.\n\nThis place gets really amazingly busy at lunch time.  You would almost think they were giving away prozac on wheat with phone numbers for bored housewives written in condiments on the bread.\n\nSadly, this is not the case.\n\nDecent sandwiches though if not nutritious.
