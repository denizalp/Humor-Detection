This location of Anytime Fitness is a bit larger than the Sherman Rd. location with a few more treadmills and ellipticals. It's also on the busy side around prime time (5pm) but usually you can get onto a machine within a few minutes.  I do believe this location is going to start offering small group exercise classes.  \n\nMy only issue with this location is the parking lot. It's always a game of \"I'm a shark circling my prey\" trying to find a spot in the lot, it doesn't matter if it's 2pm on a Saturday or 6pm on a Tuesday.  That lot is a zoo!  Fine, fine, tell me I'm lazy and I could just park on Midvale or in the neighborhood on the other side and walk 50 feet.  I'm going to the gym to walk on the treadmill for goodness sake!  All true. Sigh.
