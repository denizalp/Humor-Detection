I went here searching for work shirts and left with kitchen organizing accessories, a soft fleece blanket, and puppy pads instead. Sometimes I find hidden gems (winter coats, gifts, etc), while other times nothing at all.\n\nThe store is VERY disorganized in all of the clothing sections. I was looking at the clearance items by the shoes and it was really messy and gross. Someone put some type of make-up in one of the purses and it was smeared everywhere. It made me wonder how often the employees scan the store to try and remove damaged items and reorganize the shelves. Though for how large of a store it is I imagine there is not enough staff to keep up with all the items.\n\nBottom line: I do enjoy shopping here because at times I find amazing items. Lately however I feel that the store is lacking even more so in organization. The cashiers are hit or miss with bring friendly. Sometimes nice, other times blah. I will shop here a few more times before trying another location if they don't clean it up!
