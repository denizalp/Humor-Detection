There are not many vegan options in this area, so when I heard that this place was vegan-friendly, I decided to try them for lunch. \n\nThere aren't a lot of options here and the lady taking my order didn't even know what vegan meant.  I played it safe and went with the Japanese Pan Noodles, which are made with udon noodles (which I know to be vegan). I omitted the mushrooms and chose tofu as my protein. \n\nThe dish was good, but nothing stood out as being superb or outstanding.  They could've put more broccoli in this dish; I only saw a few minuscule pieces of broccoli stems.  Nonetheless, the portion was good and I was full before I even finished the bowl. \n\nI wouldn't voluntarily seek out this place again, but if there was absolutely nothing else around, I'd go back.
