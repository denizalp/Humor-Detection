Restaurant itself just seems dirty and not very well put together. You can see into the kitchen while you're waiting on your food and it was filthy. Just makes you wonder. But I have heard raving reviews about this place so I had to try it. The food was fantastic and so different from anything else. The staff were knowledgable and friendly so that made up for the restaurant being disgusting.
