Like Lolita's before it, I fear that Coconut's soon too will fail... A fate that they have brought on themselves.\n\nWalking into coconuts reminds me a of a tackier and cheesier version of Rainforest Cafe (and yes I said more tackier) The restaurant itself looks like a tropical run down beach shack. With fake palm trees, random flip flops on the wall, and a beach theme which Hollister Co. pulls infinitely better, Coconuts definitely deserves it's own page in book of 'How Not To Design A Restaurant.'\n\nThe food was average but priced decently for Town Square. My 3 tacos with a side of beans and rice came out to be around $9. It could have been worse. The food itself was not bad, but wasn't impressive either. \n\nThe service on the other hand was great, which is probably why this place isn't a one star. The manager (possibly owner) brought out the food and was incredibly helpful. Though I do find it odd that pretty much everyone who works here is required to wear short-shorts and flip flops.\n\nFrom my understanding the place turns into a College\/Frat party area with cheap drinks, loud EDM and latin music on certain nights. I guess the nightlife aspect could be appealing but I would definitely pass on another Coconut's dining experience.
