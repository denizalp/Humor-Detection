Read numerous Yelp reviews singing praises for Lawry's lunch special and their salad bar. \n\nFirst impression: the place was a ghost town. Totally empty. Not a good sign.\n\nThe \"salad bar\" was, no joke, 2' x 3'. If you're making a movie and you need a miniature version of a real salad bar, come here. I told my wife I thought I was being punk'd. \n\nThe \"lunch special\" was a BBQ sandwich for $10. It was God horrible. Couldn't eat it. The meat was very dry and rubbery and black on the outside. The BBQ sauce helped lube it up but didn't change the fact that it was inedible.\n\nI returned that for the Prime Rib Sandwich for $16. MUCH better. The meat was perfectly cooked, tender and tasty. The au jus was also excellent. But - $16? For a sandwich? Off a lunch menu? \n\nSo, three sandwiches, a salad (which my wife enjoyed), and some iced teas - including tip = $72! \n\nYep. Punk'd.
