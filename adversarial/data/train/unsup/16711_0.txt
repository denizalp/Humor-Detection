Back in 2008, when the recession hit Nevada, construction halted in Vegas and the casinos in Reno lost any lobbying power they had, tearing down old buildings with flashy lights. Reno truly tried to become a little Vegas, but now that downtown has been revamped with tons of new, local stuff, people are flocking away from the gambling machines and into micro-roast coffee shops or river activities.\n\nVegas, in the wake of the recession, never stopped being a town of casinos. People don't come here for the local stuff because it's so spread out - easier to be on the Strip, right?\n\nExcept...man I am so fucking sick of casinos. Give me a nice drink, give me someone who cares about their ingredients. Give me a small business owner with tons of knowledge, who can talk your ear off about liquors and housemade mixes. Give me a bar that will make you a Blood & Sand, and light the orange peel on fire to give it a little more oomph, something that sets it apart from the others.\n\nVelveteen Rabbit is most certainly that bar. On the Strip, I'd venture to say you're paying $15 for a drink that was unceremoniously thrown together, with mass produced, from concentrate juices, something with high fructose corn syrup, cheap ingredients.\n\nHere, you'll pay about $10, $11, for a drink that is entirely handmade. I realize, as I'm writing this, that this is pretty much any popular bar in San Francisco (Rickhouse, Bourbon & Branch, etc) - with the exception that there is no air of pretentious here. Just two sisters, owning a bar off the Strip, and doing a goddamn good job of it.\n\nSupport your local business, this one is well deserving.
