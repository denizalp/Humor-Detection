I really like this place. I purchased a Groupon\/Team Buy coupon for Kirei and I always assume I would get sub-par service for using a deal, but they proved me wrong.\n\nWe received complimentary fried fish pieces and small servings of noodles before our actual meal. We ordered 3 rolls and chicken katsu dinner. The Kirei roll was amazing- big, crispy goodness. But we were so surprised with the chicken cutlet dinner plate since we got 3 cutlets! The dinner also came with a bowl of rice, miso soup and salad. Not bad for $13.00. \n\nKirei really delivered and were smart in using Groupon to promote their place because we're definetly making this place our go-to Japanese spot.
