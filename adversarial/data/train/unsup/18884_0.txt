This place was disappointing.  It looks enticing from the outside.  But it tasted no better than if I had went to a Ruby Tuesday's.   Dirty glasses, dirty dishes, bartender was not much better....yeah, she was dirty too.   I'm sure in every sense of the word. ;)\n\nI wouldn't go back there at all.  It's located in the new \"LINQ\" area of Vegas next to Harrah's and the old casino where they used to have the impersonator singers.  Now they revamped it to try to be more classy and it's just as horrible.  I think they just painted over the smoke and filth.   The only good thing about this place was a.) I didn't pay for it, the company did  b.) when I was leaving it was cold outside and for a second I walked under the outside heat lamp....ahhh warmth.
