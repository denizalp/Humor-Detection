I came across Inglot Cosmetics randomly while walking through the Forum Shops.  I have heard about this brand through beauty bloggers as a less expensive alternative to MAC Cosmetics.  Unfortunately, there aren't too many retail stores that sell Inglot Cosmetics, so I definitely had to check out this store.\n\nThe products itself gets four stars, but I was so turned off by the customer service that I had to rate this establishment only two stars.\n\nThe store is fairly small, about half the size of a typical MAC store and had too many employees on the floor - 3 to be exact.  None of employees were really friendly and preferred talking among themselves.  As my first visit to Inglot Cosmetics, I was eager to play around with the products.  I was building a Freedom Palette that allows you to mix and match products to create a customized product.  I had questions regarding the products and finding products that would match my skin tone.  The person that \"tried\" to help me wasn't helpful at all.  He would just swipe an eyeshadow or blush on his hand to show me how it would look like. Hello, I could do that! The store did include makeup stations for makeup applications and was disappointed that he didn't even offer applying any of the makeup products on me.\n\nHere's a note to Inglot newbies, do your own research online and come to the store with knowing exactly what you want!
