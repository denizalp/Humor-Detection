Word of warning: This \"kiosk\" only sells really sweet blended-type drinks.  If you like beer or are a rum'n'coke guy, don't go here.  But if you are still in your 20s and want to get wasted like you did back in college, this place is for you. \n\nI just got back from a tour of Vegas, and Fat Tuesday is the cheapest place to get hammered. For $11 you can get a yard of something that probably has 4-5 shots of 151 in it, and get an extra shot for $1 more. If you weigh less than 200 lbs, one of these will hit you like a freight train. \n\nFlavors include tropical punch, pina colada, classic margarita, strawberry, and some others I can't remember.  lol. \n\nI got the Hurricane Yard Dog, my girl got a hurricane as well, and my three buds got pina colada and something else. In about 45 minutes were we telling random strangers that we loved them, stumbling all over the casino floor and in general making asses of ourselves.   A great time was had by all, including the waitress at the Mad Onion, who must have been thoroughly entertained by the 5 fools (us) who just ate cheesecake and sang happy birthday to the other patrons.
