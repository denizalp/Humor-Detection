You never ate sausage a thing! Don't expect your typical BBQ and don't expect grilling, instead expect to get smoked and to eat sausage. Every meat on the menu is smoked with a specially-paired wood from apple to nectarine to pecan, and all of their sausages are made from scratch (grinding meat and all) in house without any nasty added chemicals. \n\nThey offer meat and side combos, and for lunch I have sampled the sliced pork and New Mexican sausage. The sausages really shine. The New Mexican is a turkey\/chicken sausage with a nice kick. As for sides, I am a sucker for the braised red cabbage and Bavarian potato salad. \n\nThe ribs are St Louis, which means they are meaty. They have a deep smoke ring, and every one I have nibbled has been perfectly tender. They aren't a saucey rib, but you can get more of their specialty sauces on the side if you like.\n\nIt is meat heavy, but they do have something for vegetarians, even vegans in a pinch. For example, their bean dish doesn't include any animal products, and they have some great homemade salad dressings.   \n\nWhat really earns the spot 5-stars is the passion of the owner. If you stop in, be sure to chat with Phil. He can tell you about his love for food and how he obsesses about matching meat with the perfect wood and crafting everything on the menu from scratch. \n\nGo for the sausage, and don't muss it up by putting it on a sandwich. A bun is a disservice to these finely crafted tubular meats.
