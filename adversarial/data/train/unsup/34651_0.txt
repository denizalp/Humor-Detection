Had a chance to order the bone-in ribeye. It was cooked to order at medium and it had great texture, however, I was anticipating the flavor Rub to pierce through but the charred flavors of the grill was very strong. It was almost too over powering. Other than that the burgers were great my family enjoyed the meal.
