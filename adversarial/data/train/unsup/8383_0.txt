A new BBQ joint opened up nearby so I had to try it.  \n\nWe stopped in for lunch to feed our appetite.  It's located off of Eastern at Sunridge Heights.  Very easy to find.  The dining area is open and clean.  We were greeted immediately as we were browsing the menu.  \n\nI decided to try their chopped brisket sandwich, cheese grits and caesar slaw.  I liked how they cut the Texas toast into a pita like envelope.  The meat is then stuffed into the bread.  Clever! It was good but not memorable.  I had a taste of my husband pulled pork sandwich and had the same thought.  I wish the meat had more of a smokey flavor like other BBQ places.  The cheese grits, however, were so delicious! I loved every bite and could just eat the grits as my meal.   The caesar slaw was also just ok in my book.  I probably wouldn't order those again.  \n\nFrom all of the Yelp pictures we had to try the caramelized banana pudding.  It's served in a cute little mason jar.  The balance of cake to pudding to topping was a bit off but it was still tasty.  \n\nI wouldn't say Bell's is my favorite but I might try them again.
