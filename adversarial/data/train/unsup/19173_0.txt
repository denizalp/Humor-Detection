Well, what do they say, \"All good things must come to an end\"? In this case, that's true. I am completely dissatisfied with the customer service that I was given. Here's what happened:\n\n1) Installer arrives at 0800 and is alone. Proceeds to tell me that he will not be able to finish today because he has no help. I tell him I will not be able to take additional time off of work. \n2) I spend 2 hours calling the store, the manager of the installers, etc. because I can't trust anyone to resolve this.\n3) The wrong base materials (for hardwood flooring) were delivered. Therefore, the one and only isntaller had to leave to go buy the correct subflooring and tools. \n4) The wrong flooring transitions were ordered. Therefore, this means that there is no way for the floor to be completed today and will have to give up a Saturday for them to come back.\n5) It's noon and the helper I was promised has yet to arrive.\n6) I specifically requested a specific installation team and was promised they would do the installation. Molyneaux did not send this team and my reqeust was ignored. \n7) No one from customer service ever contacted me and no one has been apologetic.\n8) I was offered a measley $200 rebate. \n\nMolyneau, piss off.
