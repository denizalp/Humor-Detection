I give this place five stars. Best shop I have ever been to.  the customer service was great! I highly recommend this place to everybody. not only that but they make their own juice and it is the best juice by far that I have ever tried.  I am hooked on banana nut bread. Another really cool thing is that the shop has a very nice look to it nice furniture and pictures on the walls. Great place to just come and hang out.. They also have a great website with tons of flavors, amazing prices and fast shipping if your not local.. If you haven't checked them out yet, your missing out!
