Came here mid October. It's probably off season for tourists right now so we're lucky to have no wait in line.  Decided to try the Portuguese chicken from here since it had good reviews. We ordered 1\/4 chicken combo. The chicken is juicy. The skin was the best. They give a lot of fries (nice & crispy). The food is good but it isn't the best we've had compared to New York food..\n\nDon't expect something fancy. This place is more like a fast food place. The meal comes in a takeout box.
