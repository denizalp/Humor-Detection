PhXpress is a particularly convenient store located inside the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. I stopped on the way to my flight to pick up gum and a water. Got in and out in two minutes without complete financial rape. If you are needing soft drinks, use the vending machine and save yourself some coin. \n\nPhXpress. \n\nCAN\n\nYOU \n\nDIG \n\nIT.
