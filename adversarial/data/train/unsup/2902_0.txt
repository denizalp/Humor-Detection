Outstanding views, top notch front desk  service and high tech suites. This is a no smoking hotel. Big plus! \n\nTwo days prior to checking in, I received an email for an early check in option. Upon arrival, I checked in the mobile check in line. It was still fairly slow, but certainly a lot faster than the regular check in line. The front desk was real nice, gave Buster two doggy biscuits that looked too good to eat. In fact, I would've eaten it, if I hadn't known it was a dog treat. \n\nThe Vdog suite we were in had breathtaking views of the Aria. The room had wall controls to control the shades and curtain. In service dining was ordered through an iPad. The do not disturb sign was controlled by wall controls. The suite had a kitchenette that had two electric stove tops. The fridge in this suite was a normal hotel size fridge, but I think the higher levels have full size. \n\nThe bathroom had a separate tub was taller than me. Nice closet space and plenty of cabinetry for long stays. \n\nVdara looks like a keeper. The hallways are clean, the room is quiet with good sound proof walls. It's peaceful for long weekend getaways. Valet is $25 a day.
