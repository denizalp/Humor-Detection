YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(176\/365) \"80s Flashback\"\n\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt at Bingo upstairs, we hurried down to the showroom for Teri W's birthday bash at the Spazmatics. 80s fans, this is where you can spaz out with a bunch of friends and relive this crazy era!\n\n$10 gets you VIP admission inside as well as two drink tickets. Not a bad deal at all!\nThe Spazmatics have done a pretty good job at covering 80s hits for the past six years, from Depeche Mode, Devo, Kenny Loggins, Billy Idol, Salt N Pepa, and many many more! You can even look the part and dress up in your 80s best! It's great to see people just having a great time dancing the night away to one of the best decades ever, and even the music during intermission was awesome! We even got to the dance floor for a few songs and had a complete blast!\n\nWe left before the Prom King and Queen were crowned, but we heard later that Ty and Lore whooped some A$$ and didn't have to flash some cougar hooha to win...TME(too much exposure) fer' sure dude, like TOTALLY!  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\u  4.25
