Excellent store. This is by far the best Goodwill store in the area. There is lots of inventory and it is nicely organized. Lots of great deals. \n\nKaren signed us up for the VIP program, which allows us to find out about sales early, allows us in the store before normal hours, and gave us a $5 coupon.\n\nWe will definitely be back to this location.
