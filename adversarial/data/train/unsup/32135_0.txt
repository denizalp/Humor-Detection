I have had nothing but great service every time I've visited.  Best deal in town for oil changes, too: pay $40 for first oil change, and get the next two for free (keep in mind, that's what I paid,  However, prices can increase per inflation and costs of doing business).  I haven't seen anything in town that beats that deal! \n\nThe guys at Performance Automotive did some extensive work on the power steering unit in my 2002 Jeep Liberty; among some other small repairs and new tires.  Having a loaner-car over the weekend was a plus, and when I got my Jeep back, it drove like it was brand new!  Whatever they did was outstanding, and I'm more than happy to be a regular customer. \n\nThey are a great bunch of guys, super clean shop and a great waiting room with free drinks and snacks.  If you're looking for trustworthy auto mechanics, then look no further than Performance Automotive & Tire.
