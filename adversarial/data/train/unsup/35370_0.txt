This restaurant has a good reputation but, I am not impressed by this location. Their \"Pink Lemonade\" is anything but lemonade as there are no lemons in this mixture. The taste was watery and had no lemony flavor whatsoever. I don't know what brand of Blue Cheese Dressing this restaurant buys but, they would do better if they purchased Marie's or Farmhouse brands as they both have much better flavor than what I was served. My steak was cooked correctly but, again, had little taste in my opinion. Don't plan to return anytime soon.
