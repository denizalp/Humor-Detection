We only stayed one night but our stay was just average at best. I was surprised and disappointed that the hotel did not seem to be at the same standard at most SPG hotels that we have stayed. \nEXTERIOR - The pool was cloudy, had leaves in it and seemed like it had not been cleaned in a while. The pool chairs were old and worn and I thought they were ready to tear when we sat down. There was also a rope that was holding the Tennis Court light up and it was tied to the Water Slide??!! I was just surprised that it seemed so dated. I think that they are in need of an upgrade soon.\nINTERIOR - The room's bathroom was not very clean and had calcium deposits all around the shower door and the floors were sticky that my shoes were sticking to the floor so needless to say, I didn't take them off in there. There were also few plugs and no USB ports for charging our devices and the Free WIFI was not good at all (lost signal every couple of minutes). \nSTAFF - The front desk was very nice and professional and the bartender was nice as well when we had a drink before leaving for a night out but when we were at the pool during the day, and asked for food, it seemed like an inconvenience for the staff to bring to us. The food did arrive promptly and was average but they never checked on us again. We would have ordered more drinks and we also tip well but I guess that was not enough for the server to come back. The server was not super friendly like you would expect from a person in the service industry either. Again, it was a very average stay for us.
