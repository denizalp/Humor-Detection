Take South Street Burger, mix in the attitude of Jack Astor's and add the variety of a Chinese menu and you get The Works.  Really, you get the works!  I never thought I would give a burger joint 5 stars, but this is 3 steps above.\n\nEvery burger has an edgy theme with names like Babewatch, Beverly Hills Lawsuit, Crappy Tire, The Full Mountie, unless you make up your own custom concoction.  There are 5 specially named burgers for Newmarket, designed by their namesakes.  Tons of options, tons of sides, tons of toppings and tons of variety.  I ordered the Porkasm, a bacon burger with chipotle ketchup, caramelized onions and havarti cheese, with my addition of mushrooms and avocado, on a whole wheat bun.  As a side, I had the spicy die-cut fries, \n\nThis is the only time I have not winced at paying $15 for a burger.\n\nFor a drink I had the pumpkin pie milkshake, served in a measuring cup.  Then I found that they have hand scooped milkshakes in 16 different flavours.  Of course, you can add rum or vodka to any milkshake, except perhaps the ones served to kids.  Of course.\n\nI can't say it any clearer--this is a different burger joint from the menu to the rocking' decor to the T shirts that say \"Screw the App-there's a burger for that\".  During my lunch no less than 4 different staffers checked up on me.  I fired up my iPad and THEY offered ME the guest wifi password-without my asking. \n\nHere is how I scale it:  Five Guys is a solid 3 stars.  South Street gets 4 stars for the custom, somewhat exotic toppings and the New York Fries, so The Works can only be worth 5 stars. I hope I never find anything better, or Yelp will need to create a 6 star scale!
