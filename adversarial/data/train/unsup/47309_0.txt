I walked {first time here} and they have local art on the wall AND a REAL COFFEE GRINDER in the seating area. It smells like warm coffee like a smooth warm blanket of ecstatic joy. This is my now go to place for liquid comfort food. Music is great old school rock ( led zeplin and the like \" clasic\" category) and the couch. \n\nWill highly recommend this place to all who live around here.
