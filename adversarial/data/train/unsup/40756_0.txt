Stopped by for Sunday brunch on a nice day so it was pretty packed. We had a group of 7 so a 45 minute wait was probably reasonable. They make the wait as painless as possible with corn hole and free coffee samples outside.\n\nHad a $5 mimosa which was tasty but I wish they used pulp free oj. Everyone was happy with their meals. The bacon cheeseburger got a thumbs up from a friend and two of us has the pb and banana stuffed french toast. It was definitely yummy just wish there was less pb and more banana. Felt like a dog with peanut butter stuck to the roof of my mouth!\n\nEveryone was happy with the hash browns n coffee. The service was great, too, as whomever was near asked if they could get us anything.\n\nPrices were fair. Restaurant was cute. Food was good. I'd come back!
