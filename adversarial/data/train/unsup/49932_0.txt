BRUNCH REVIEW - September 2013\n\nWe went for brunch on a Saturday morning around 9am. I ordered a latte and was told that Maizie's does not have an espresso machine. I ordered coffee instead and asked for skim milk. No skim milk.\n\nThe brunch menu is limited. They have omelettes and mexican breakfast burritos, and a $15 bagel & lox. It must be an amazing lox bagel to be $15.\n\nI ordered an omelette with cheese, mushrooms, and artichoke hearts with multigrain toast. The food was fine but certainly nothing to write home about. It was relatively expensive for what it was.\n\nOur waitress was nice and the coffee refills kept arriving; however, the service was not prompt even though the cafe wasn't busy.\n\nI might return to Maizie's for brunch at some point, but I'm still looking for a favorite brunch spot.
