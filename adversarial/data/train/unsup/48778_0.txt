Today my best friend and I went to eggstacy for my birthday, and David MADE OUR DAY!! So thankful to him for the amazing service, and for accommodating our clumsiness and for making me feel so special. The whole staff was friendly and the food was spectacular. Best breakfast\/brunch spot in Scottsdale area for sure. Thanks again David!
