Wet Republic is one of Vegas' newest and coolest daytime pool parties, becoming increasingly popular. We were on our way to check out the MGM pool when we were given passes to check out the party. We were so glad we stumbled upon this cuz it was the most fun we had during our trip. And how convenient, it was located right inside our hotel. Great DJ, spacious bar, clean and inviting pool area and good-looking people. Reserving a bed or cabana is a must! \n\nNote: The cost for a bed is $300, with a $150 food & beverage minimum. Totally worth it. Oh and the cocktails were refreshing too. Especially their strawberry mojitos!\n\nFYI: If you like Rehab, then you will probably like Wet Republic because it's way cleaner and less hectic. You can actually relax in the water here without getting trampled on or getting water mixed with pee and who knows what splashed in your face!
