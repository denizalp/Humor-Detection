I wish I could give a zero star like many people on here. Having said that more than likely I'm going to have someone's job tomorrow. I go into the drive thru and look at the prices it's nine dollars for a meal, at that point I'm not surprised as I looked at the reviews. I get a chicken tender and fries. It says on that board 4.99 and I'm expecting to 5.39 nope the attendant says 6.89 and I pull up and ask if it's a mistake, and she tells me that her register says 5.99. I then informed her that her sign has the wrong number, and she spoke again saying that the price ragardless of the sign. I asked for her manager, she used the classic line I am the manager. It was the most pretntious, and disrespectful tone I ever heard. We will be talking to her manager in the morning, if you want to be treated like a bum begging for food your going to pay for go there, as for me... I'll be visiting jack in the box.
