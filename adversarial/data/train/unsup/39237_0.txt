It is a family owned and operated restaurant and they couldn't be a nicer bunch of people. The decor is very charming and welcoming. My husband said the grilled salmon was the best he's ever had. The zucchini planks are amazing. Everything was done perfectly. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.
