My review is based on a Saturday night at the bar. This is a decent sized coffee and bar shop located in a mini shopping center in Ballantyne. It's a decent size where half is a coffee shop and the other half is a bar with stage area. On Saturday nights they have a live band. It was clean and the staff were friendly. The bartender is what made this place 4 stars. He was attentive nice and noted he is there most days. He did a great job on our drinks and made suggestions. The drinks were tasty and strong. I would recommend the evening bar scene and can't wait to see what the day time coffee shop is like. Hope you enjoy!
