DO NOT STAY HERE!\n\nIf you go on Priceline.com and this hotel comes up, do NOT stay here.  Yes, they renovated it, slapped on a new sign and rebranded, however, NONE OF THE ROOMS ARE RENOVATED.  They smell funky, there are scratches on everything and the carpet has black stains.  After getting this hotel on Priceline for $80 bucks last Saturday, I ended up having to pay another $22 dollars for the resort fee and tax.  $102 bucks for a total dump.\n\nNot to mention I had my boyfriend and my 9 month old baby with us.  The plan was to have his parents babysit our daughter while we spent the evening with our British friends who were in town from the UK.  Of course, as soon as I walked into the room (even before that when we were in the elevator that smelled like urine), I walked right out, handed my baby to the grandparents to go wait at the car, then walked back through the smokey lobby to the front desk to get my money back and check out.  Everything in the room was still from the 80s.  Even a non-smoking room smelled like smoke.  The patio door was broken and wouldn't open.  The sheets were not clean.  Ugh.  Ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh... bleurgh... puke... vomit.\n\nWent back on Priceline.com and typed in \"Convention Center\" and got the Renaissance just behind the Strip for $60 bucks, which was smoke free, super clean and really nice.  Perfect place for my little girl to crawl around and play with the grandparents.
