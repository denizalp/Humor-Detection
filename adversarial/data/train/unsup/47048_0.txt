Great place to fill up those comfort food cravings. I ordered the mac and cheese (so yummy) which is a huge serving, I wasn't able to finish it all. \nMy friends ordered \"fish\" and chips, a burger, and a \"chicken wrap.\" None of them were able to finish either since portions are a bit large. \nThe ambiance is alright. Service is great and friendly.
