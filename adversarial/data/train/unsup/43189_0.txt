Fancy artisan ice cream shop. Their ice cream is made with liquid nitrogen, very smooth and creamy. Flavors\/flavor combinations are interesting, I would say most are very tasty, except don't try the mint unless you want a very strong herbal type of mint flavor. Get the free fudge\/caramel drizzle. The shop is pretty hipster, cute. There are plenty of board games to play, good place to chill with friends.
