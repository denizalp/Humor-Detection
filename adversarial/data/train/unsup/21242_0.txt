Guys.\n\nGUYS.\n\nShush, shush, just listen. We came here just for butter tarts, nothing else. Word on the street was that they're the best in town.\n\nAnd oh my God, did Andrea's ever deliver.\n\nI've tried a lot of butter tarts in my time (and my grandfather thinks himself a connoisseur), but these are the best I've ever had by miles. The crust was flakey, slightly soft, and perfectly proportional to the amount of filling. Unlike many other places I've seen, at Andrea's they know that it's not just what's inside that matters. Regardless, the filling was absolutely and incomparably phenomenal. Buttery but not overpoweringly so, sweet but not too sweet, rich but not too rich, viscous but not liquid-y. I initially thought that they might be too big, but trust me - once you bite in, you will not want to stop. I didn't even mind that they were raison-less.\n\nAnyways, I'll try to keep this one short and sweet. Just trust me and go.\n\nLike, right now.
