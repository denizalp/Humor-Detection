I came here for winterlicious about a week ago with my family. Getting to the restaurant was fairly easy and we were promptly seated. The only complaint I could have about the restaurant was that the washrooms were freezing for some reason, but I'm here to talk about the food. \n\nFamous Baked Lobster and Crab Soup: the souffle was a little thick and doughy, somebody's came deflated. The soup itself was good, though some could debate it was a little spicy. I actually liked the soup, but could have done without the doughy cover. \n\nSlow Roasted Black Angus Prime Rib of Beef Au Jus, Vegetables &Â Mashed Potatoes: I was surprised when the server mentioned the dish being 8-10oz as that's a fairly large portion for a winterlicious dish. I ordered it medium rare, which it came out as so. The prime rib was good, very soft and the jus was very flavourful. The mashed potatoes were seasoned well, didn't come out bland compared to my other experiences. Overall, it satisfied my carnivorous cravings for that day. \n\nDaily Fresh Fruit Ice: the flavours were mango and chocolate. The mango was absolutely delicious. It was a nice light ending to what could be described as a heavy meal. The chocolate was light, though I wasn't fond of the texture with the flavour. This dish was executed nicely (and it was probably just me being unfamiliar with chocolate as a sorbet).
