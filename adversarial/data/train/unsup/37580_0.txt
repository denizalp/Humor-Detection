Just had to try this place when I was passing through the neighborhood recently. After all the hype, which can often mean a place has expanded too much for its own good, I was pleasantly surprised (and super full) from my experience here. I like that the menu wasn't extensive. Your options (other than couple salads) are sandwich's and that's it. But the variety of options (and limitless create your own options) still affords variety. \n\nI got the BBQ chicken with fried onion straws, chocolate stout sauce, cheddar and I don't even know what else because it was so large and smothery. \n\nDespite the number of people there on a Thursday evening, we were sat promptly, and service was quick, attentive and friendly. Worth the price, too. Obviously this is more than enough for one person to consume in one sitting, so whether you take the rest home for lunch the next day, or just split with your dining companion, this is honestly cheaper than even fast food. \n\nGotta say, though, the fried twinkies were lame. I guess thats what we get for ordering something so ridiculous.
