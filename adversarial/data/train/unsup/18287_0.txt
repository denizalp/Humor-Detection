I just got 4 areas of lipo done at Myshape and I couldn't be happier! I just went I'm yesterday, but everything went so well, I had to write my review now. (I will also post father along in my results.) From the moment I found them everything was easy. Over the phone the girl I had spoken with was super informative and definitely answered all of my questions and more. The office consultation was quick and informative as well. They got me in 1 week after I my consultation, which was awesome.\n\nThe day of the procedure everything went smoothly. They explained everything that was going to be going on, took before pictures, and talked me about what the best way to deal with my problems areas would be. Trevor was doing the actual liposuction itself. He was funny and made me relaxed. The worst part was just the numbing, which is expected. After that there was no pain or discomfort whatsoever. Trevor does a great job and really works hard and takes his time so that he can get you the best results.\n\nThis was a great experience all around. I would highly recommend Myshape for any liposuction procedure you want!
