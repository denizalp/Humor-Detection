HANDS DOWN WORST PLACE TO WORK.  Had to write a review so maybe one person might read and think twice. One unplanned sick day in two months, had to leave 10 min early with an okay from co-workers BUT was dismissed. I worked extremely hard when I was there, I am very genuine and customers appreciated that. I have had a few successful job experiences and never one close to this awful. The assistant manger Nimra was very kind, communicated well and was the one bright side in coming into work! However,  Manager in VIA C, TOPSHOP Chantelle was TERRIBLE!  Unless you dress perfect and look perfect, like a clicky high school girl she wont give you the time of day. Crazy how someone can sit around and hope you mess up so they can fire you. Never been around something so toxic, horrible for mental health and self image. SO many examples of what a terrible manger she was. \nIm very aware that other department managers are much different. Inclusive, kind, and helpful so my experience may have been tainted.\nThey read these reviews religiously, so I realize many future employees will read this! :)   Supposed to be a place you can feel comfortable shopping or working no matter your style, age or vibe. Instead, I am left with a horrible distain for a place i grew up loving to shop.
