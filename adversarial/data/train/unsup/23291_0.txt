This place is in an odd area I'll be honest. It's almost random of where this restaurant is located. But besides that, this is a \" create your own\" style of place. So there's no set styles of soups you can order. I chose the beef broth with beef slices, some vegetables and a few extra add ins like tofu.\n\n**** There is a minimum amount of what you can have in your soup, otherwise you'll be charged a fee.\n\nFor example, if you only have $10 worth of your soup, you either add more and reach the minimum amount, if not you'll be charged a fee******\n\nI recommend this place for the experienced palettes of more unique flavors. While you have a lot of different proteins you can add.
