I shop at this location because it's close and have not really minded the \"interesting\" clientele or parking-lot denizens.  The prices are good and the staff is improving all the time.\n\nHere's where I draw the line, though:\n\nFrozen foods that have melted should be thrown out, NOT refrozen and marked down.\n\nThis has happened twice in the last few weeks, once with popsicles and most recently with frozen yogurt.  I'm pretty much convinced this is a business practice and not a one-off occurrence.  It's incredibly disappointing...and lacks in integrity.  Both times, the purchases were inedible and had to be thown out.
