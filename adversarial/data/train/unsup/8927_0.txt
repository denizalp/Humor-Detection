HAWAII BEADERS!! And beaders all over the US and the world...you must come here!\n\nI almost skipped over this place when I visited a few weeks ago for EDC week. I made all kinds of rationalizations why I should skip a special trip to Discount Beads but I am so, so glad I didn't!! I had visited Michael's Crafts prior to coming here and had stocked up on some really pricey stuff there, so I thought I had all I needed, but after coming here I had decided I was sorely mistaken, plus I was a bit lazy but my persistence paid off.\n\n- ample free parking\n- a beader could literally spend ALL day in a place like this! HUGE store!\n- very reasonable prices!\n- a gigantic selection of everything under the sun: glass, organic material, Japanese hex\/seed beads, stringing materials, findings, all-you-can-stuff beads, mineral specimens, semi-precious beads.\n- super friendly family-run business - I believe the patriarch came to talk to me and shared a few stories about Hawaii and how he looks forward to Macadamia Nuts yearly from his Hawaiian visitor. \n- everyone was super friendly. It literally felt like family, shopping here.\n\nPlease support this amazing bead store if you are a beader, a crafter, or a mineral\/rock collector. They have been in business 12 years when all other bead stores and businesses have failed and gone under and collapsed. It's hard to run a business targeted to a small demographic but if we can get the word out to support mom-and-pops stores with great bargains, amazing selections and super attentive service, I'm hoping this store will be around for another few decades or more. I'm in love! :-)
