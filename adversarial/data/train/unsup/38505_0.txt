Stopped here with my fiance and another couple on the way from Chicago to the dells for dinner. Place was pretty quiet for a Saturday evening which was surprising. Food was your typical UNO's experience, if you have never been to an Uno's try the deep dish pizza it is pretty good, Though like most Uno's the menu is huge but i always get the pizza, service was good,fast and friendly.
