DO NOT RENT FROM HERE. They apparently changed their name to Verve Car rental as well. \n\nFirst of all--they aren't even located at the airport as they attempt to advertise on Expedia--so you have to take TWO SHUTTLES to get to their super shady place of business. \n\nNone of their cars are plated yet -- that's not to say it's illegal-- but when I get pulled over 2x because the officers see a car without a plate they are going to pull you over. Get a temporary plate. Tell us it could happen. \n\nThe manager there is total white trash ghetto -- talks to you like you're stupid, offered no discount for the inconvenience, and just generally has a very low-class way of dealing with customers. No understanding of her role in attempting to positively manage the business. \n\nHidden fees. Poor record keeping. The other reviews are spot on.
