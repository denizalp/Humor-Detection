I had an excellent experience at the shop and would highly recommend to others. I've been a Brazilian customer for 8 years and put this place above all others in Las Vegas. \n\nShaina, the owner, personally answered the phone when I called and was the esthetician that did the wax! I got a Brazilian, and she did a wonderful job. Very attention to detail oriented. Takes pride in her job and business. I called for a last minute appointment and luckily a cancellation had just happened and I rushed over. \n\nPrice is very reasonable. New shop is adorable! Clean! Very professional. And I was in and out in less than 30 min. Love that she is capable of doing a job well done and respects your time. I live downtown but do not mind driving to the SW area for good service. I'm very happy to have found a really good waxing salon. Finally!!!
