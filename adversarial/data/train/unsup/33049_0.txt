A group of us tried this place out because of the good reviews, but 3 out of 4 of us were extremely disappointed by the service and food. We told our server we had a show and he still moved slow as molasas. The only good thing we had were the fire roasted olives. We expected more out of this place based on reviews and especially the price. Brucshetta was medeocre and the pasta was not good at all.
