Went for lunch here with my boyfriend. We had the egg rolls, shrimp lo mein and the mushroom chicken lunch special. The portions were large, and everything tastes wonderful! The shrimp in the lo mein were large, quality shrimp. The chicken in the mushroom chicken was very tender and the said was awesome! We will definitely be back!
