For some no-frills, tasty bbq look no further. Their menu is simple and they stick to the basics. Meats are available by the half pound, and include 4 slices of bread for a 1\/2 pound order. Sides include coleslaw, potato salad, creamed corn, green chile stew, new potatoes, and corn on the cob (Just to name a few!). \n\nI liked that they had different options for your brisket. Usually at bbq places I go to it is typically the \"lean\" brisket you get, but here at Rudy's you can decide between \"moist\" (AKA fatty) brisket, lean brisket, and \"Chef's choice\" brisket (I'd imagine this to be the leftover bits of what is carved, since it's cheaper than the other options). \n\nAs this was our first time here, the cashier gave us a sample of the lean brisket and the turkey. Both were very flavorful and moist. I'd definitely get either meat in the future. As for my actual meal, I opted for the moist brisket with a side of green chile stew. The order was made quickly.\n\nAfter you pay, there is a station for condiments that include various peppers, onions, pickles, and packets of sauces (Ketchup, mustard, horseradish). There are also straws and napkins here. The soda fountain is stocked with Coke products, and they also offer sweet and unsweetened tea.\n\nSeating is self serve, and we found a cozy little wooden table stocked with various hot sauces, a \"sissy\" sauce, and a regular bbq sauce. The regular bbq sauce had a nice vinegary tang, with a slight kick of spice. The \"sissy\" sauce to me tasted very similar, except not as hot spice-wise. \n\nThe moist brisket was indeed very moist, with unctuous veins of fat running through the meat. I could taste a deep smoky flavor too. The green chile stew was excellent. It was served piping hot, with a superb savory, spicy flavor. \n\nOverall, a nice place to go for some good bbq. I'll definitely be coming here again to try more of their bbq meats!
