Only in Vegas! The fiancée and I were in Vegas and went for a stroll to see the lights in the evening, a much cooler time to wander around outdoors\n\nAs we were staying at MGM, we crossed over to see New York New York. After crossing over 'Brooklyn Bridge', we spotted this place. Even at 9pm, it was still pretty warm. So, we popped in for ice cream\n\nI like trying new things and flavours. Watermelon jalapeño caught my eye immediately and I found the taster not too hot and with the right level of background heat. So, I had the heat of jalapeño in the cold of ice cream to counteract the outdoor heat of Vegas
