Nice bar and lounge area, drinks are expensive but on point for Vegas, and the servers were very friendly. My friends and I ordered the verbena which is not on the menu. It is a margarita served with a verbena flower. They recommend you eat the head of the flower as it heightens your taste and will elevate the drink. I thought I was having an allergic reaction as my tongue and mouth began to tingle. My girlfriends and I stared at each other trying to figure out what we had just done. After a while the sensation disipates and eventually goes back to normal. I would recommend if your looking for something different, however beware that the flower does not taste good and your body will react quite drastically
