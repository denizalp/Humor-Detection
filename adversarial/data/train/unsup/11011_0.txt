I tried wooftown's grooming service because my regular groomer, whom I love, was fully booked up for the week (see my review of Dogfather and co.) The groomers here is either brand new to dog grooming or is just a completely incompetent. I specifically told them to keep him long and not to cut the top of the head or the eyelashes and when I picked up my little guy it looked like they just shaved him down. It's a disaster. It'll take at least a year for it to grow back. When I said that this is not what I wanted the women at the cash said laughing \"well we can't add hair or do dog hair extensions; it'll grow back\" In shock I just paid and left. AVOID this place at all costs. They have no idea what they're doing when it comes to grooming.
