Verdict: Terrible! Skip this altogether and go to Circus Circus or any other budget hotel on the strip! \n\nThe good: \n\nWifi all over hotel. \nThe windows actually open! \nRoom had the perfect thermostat. It didn't need to be adjusted and I slept well. \nBed was okay. \nCheck-in was quick, easy and friendly. \n\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe room was so tiny!\nThe shower temperature was either scalding hot or ice cold. No place to put anything other than that tiny bar of soap! \nI could barely turn around in the shower it was so small. First it was cute because I know the hotel is old but it got annoying after a while. \nThe beds aren't really queen size, they may be a little bigger than full. \nThere's only one nightstand and one light. Not too many plugs around the room. \nEverything was old and cracked. The sink was cracking and so were the bathroom tiles. \n\n\nWhat really got me was the small room. Yes it was cheap but the resort fee was absolutely ridiculous. I couldn't believe I paid for a room that was smaller than my bedroom. The tiny shower and overall feel of the room was really bad. The shower is very important to me and it just didn't cut it at all. The temperatures were too extreme and there was no room in there. To top it all off the walls were painted a really ugly color. It was just bad! I'm not a snob either, I don't mind staying in a dive because I just get dressed and leave. But this was too much of a dive. \n\nI will definitely not be back!
