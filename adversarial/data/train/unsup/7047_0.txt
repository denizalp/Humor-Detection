I don't like to write bad reviews but this place managed to get from really good to just average to now being pretty bad.   I am giving them one star as the curry chicken is still passable, its a lot more bland and watery now. else It will be 0 star.\n\nMy friend ordered and picked up our orders.  She had the terriyaki chicken and she said its watery now and it seems the taste is off.  I tasted a few pieces and the sauce is indeed very different.  Its watery and sweet and seems like something you buy in a bottle at lee lee.  FAIL, they used to claim they make the best teriyaki chicken back when the old man was here, but now I guess U can make the best teriyaki chicken at home, since it's a generic tasting sauce :)\n\nI ran into the old man that used to work here last week and his wife at lee lee's, they confirmed that they no longer work there and, whoever is writing about them being there is probably posting it in the hopes that, those who really loved his service would go back and give it a shot in the hopes of running into him.  Don't waste your time if u are hoping to do that as I think the old man and his wife frequent the fry's across the street or lee lee's more often.  If I see him again I will tell him everyone misses him and if possible get a number from him.  He is doing very well and enjoying his time off after being let go off by the new owners.   He is not interested in finding a new job for the moment as he is headed to Malaysia for a holiday in February. He is healthy and happy and glad we all remember him.  I did not have a chance to chat long with him as another former customer saw them and came over to give him a hug and chat with them.\n\nanyway, back to this place, I guess its time for me to move on to trying the food at red dragon or simply going north to aloha kitchen.  too bad this place used to be cheap and good but now I guess its just cheap.
