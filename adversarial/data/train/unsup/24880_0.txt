Good: We had dinner here on one of the Harvest nights, so they were temporarily licensed! The wine list was good, but the beer selection was an excellent - especially important as the menu that night was small. We enjoyed some Beau's Lug Tread ale with our meal, and it worked perfectly. \n\nBetter: The service is really friendly and efficient. Dinner in this community centre space makes for a different experience than most restaurants as it's not dimly lit... but I found it refreshing to see the other patrons, especially people meeting at the communal table. \n\nBEST: Chef Wood is an adventurous cook, and puts his dishes together with a lot of thought. We started with the \"duelling tongues\" appetizer - cod and beef tongue served with a sauce for dipping. The tea-infused capon wings were decent. The ribs were cooked very well, but the apple fritter really stole the show. The halibut en papillote with vegetables was pleasant; well done for a very healthy dish. \n\nI would give this particular dinner 3.5 stars. While all of the food was very good, only the ribs and apple fritter really blew me away. However, I'm intrigued to return, as having food of this calibre at lunchtime could definitely push it into 5-star territory. \n\nDollars: $100 for two appetizers, two mains, two big bottles of Beau's, tax and tip.
