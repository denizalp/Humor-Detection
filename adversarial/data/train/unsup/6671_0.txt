There are two types of people in this world; sheep and not-sheep. If you would classify yourself as the premier, then by all means 5801 should become your new hangout!\n\nThe drinks are poured precisely to the shot (aiding a perfectly proportioned mediocre night at best) The clientelle is typical gay pittsburgh, hardly anyone is interesting enough to have a decent conversation with for more then 2 minutes. (and they all kind of look like they were rejected from Los Angeles)\n\nThe music is the worst,  typical gay pop remixes blare from this place. When will gay bars realize that we aren't in the late 90's anymore?\n\nThe interior is decorate and reminiscent of a Radisson hotel lobby. (Which isn't good) The bartenders are neither pretty nor polite. I don't recommend this place at all.
