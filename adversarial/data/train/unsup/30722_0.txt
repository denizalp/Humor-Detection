Deer Garden is very well-known in Vancouver and they decided to expand to Toronto a year ago.  I already came to this place a few times and they are always busy during lunch and dinning hours!  Unless you are willing to wait, I would recommend going somewhere else or come during non-peak hours as the waiting area is kind of small.\n\nI must warn everything that this place has close to ZERO customer service which is not that surprising from a Chinese owned restaurant!  If you are a BIG fan of customer service, then please step out of the door now.\n\nTheir #1 selling item on the menu is the fish soup noodle.  Indicating it contains no MSG really makes a lot of people happy nowadays.  As a beginner with fish soup, I would recommend just playing it safe by either selecting Original Fish Soup or GIngko and pepper fish soup as your soup base, which both have strong fish soup flavour with the latter for the spicy lover.  For noodles, I would recommend the Rice Noodle (Thick) or Flat rice noodle.  For toppings, since you are only allow to choose two without additional cost, my recommendation is to choose two toppings between fish filet, fish puffs, fish tofu and cuttlefish slice.  Drinks can be whatever preference you want and if you also want side orders, feel free.  Just a note, you can ask for no cabbage or other standard toppings that comes with the soup.\n\nFor a noodle soup with 2 toppings and a hot drink for $8.95+tax is a little expensive for noodle soup.  If you want a less MSG meal and want to try some fish soup noodle soup in Markham\/Richmond Hill area, I would recommend giving this place a try!
