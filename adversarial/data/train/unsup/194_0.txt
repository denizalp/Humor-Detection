I ordered lemon poppy seed muffins, and they were delicious! The staff is friendly and the prices are great. It doesn't get much better than that. I will definitely be back. \n\nI ordered a yellow cake with chocolate frosting for my girlfriend's birthday, and it was perfect! My girlfriend was really impressed, and everyone who had a piece loved it.  Also, ordering and picking up the cake was easy and hassle-free. I can't say enough about how much I like this place.
