I miss my old clinic on Bannantyne\nI come here now n it takes more time\nThe service here is overall fine \nBut SudOuest was better though, not to whine\n\nI had no doc for almost 15 years \nWhen I finally got one it was here\nAnd she's nice to boot so I have to cheer\nAnd be grateful that it is still quite near\n\nMy new Doctor's name is Justine Vu\nAnd although it's clear she is still quite new\nAlready feel I can trust her, and do\nAnd it's easy to get a rendezvous\n\nThis is also a walk-in clinic\nCall the night before to book a visit\nIt's very clean and quite hygienic \nAnd has a J.C. and XRays within it\n\nI'm happy to have a family doc\nIt's not a bad clinic it's really not\nBut it's not quite as good as my old spot  \nIt was fast and sweet...and i miss it a lot\n\n---------------- Installment 12 poetry reviews\n\nDecided to write this while it's fresh in my mind (still have 7 others pending, blasted poetry!). I really do love my new family Doc Justine Vu she's fantastic 5 stars for her...but I wish she worked at the Clinique Sud-Ouest on Bannantyne in Verdun instead cuz this place is kinda tiny n cramped and not quite as friendly. \n\nAlso to clarify: in this building there is a tiny Jean Coutu and in the basement there's Radiologie Lasalle (xrays and they're pretty quick just show up with your referral). It's a pretty huge building so i'm assuming there's more above. And there's usually easy parking behind the building or on the street.
