This is definitely my guilty pleasure burger spot, as it is not healthy in any way. They do have the best vegan BOCA burger in Vegas. A few other spots have the BOCA patty but all the other elements that make their burgers come no where close to taste and portions like Fat Burger does. They also offer a GARDEN patty but something about the hearty taste of the BOCA wins. They use a 5oz patty instead of the 3oz like the other places use, it's meatier and filling. A giant plus. \n\nTheir combination of mustard, lettuce, tomato, pickles, relish & onion are simple and delicious. I order mine with extra pickles and both raw and grilled onions with no mayo, so satisfying. Order with fat fries and you won't regret it.\n\nOne complaint, get a gluten free bun that doesn't have egg in it!!!
