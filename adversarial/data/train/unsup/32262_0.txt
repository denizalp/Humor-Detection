So, with the news of an outlet mall opening in Charlotte I was thrilled.  Living in Los Angeles and visiting Orlando's amazing outlet malls I was looking forward to checking it out.  I decided to take the drive, which isn't too far from me, early on Sunday morning.  The outlet mall opens at 10 on Sundays so a good time to go, before the afternoon crowd.  I arrived a little after 10 and the parking lot was beginning to fill up. However, I did not a lot of \"C\", compact, spots that too be honest are quite small.  And, the parking lot layout was a little off.  Needless to say I parked and ventured toward the mall.  I had a few places I wanted to check out, but also wanted to get an idea of how things were laid out. Unfortunately I found the layout very confusing.  And, as for the stores I was excited to check out, the sales did not seem as impressive as I would have thought for an outlet mall.  However, there is a great variety of stores, for items from shoes, kitchens, clothes, accessories, etc.  Unfortunately by noon I was a little hungry and the \"Market\", food court, is non-existent. There are only two places as of this past week, a Chinese and a Hibachi..yes, the same type of food right next to one another.  Not interested so I decided to grab a drink and head out shortly after.  The crowds started coming around 12:30ish...\nI definitely will give them time to get things finalized and head back.  Overall, nothing to write home about at this time.
