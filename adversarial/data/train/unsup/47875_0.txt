Cantina 1511 used to be one of my very favorite Mexican spots when we visited the Dilworth location, but this one was just mediocre for us.  The staff was awesome, helpful and cheerful.  Where they fell short was the quality of the food.\n\nWe started with cheese dip, and it had an odd flavor I couldn't identify.  They bring it out with a tealight underneath, but that did nothing for keeping ours from getting cold and clumpy.  Plus, there were onion slices in the queso, making it even more chunky.  \n\nThe shrimp taco my daughter got was delicious, and she wished she had only gotten those.  The steak tacos were good to me, but she didn't care for them.  I got a chimichanga, and it was covered with that cheese dip and some mysterious black drizzle (probably black bean puree).  The chimi was loaded with rice and beans...and very little chicken.  It was ok, but certainly not special.\n\nMy favorite things we had were the chips and salsa and the Quatro Leches cake.  Even the cake changed, though.  I think the cake used to be topped with meringue which was light and toasty, and is now topped with gloppy marshmallow cream which was cloyingly sweet.  I scraped it off and just ate the cake and it was moist and delicious.\n\nI doubt we'll be back, as it is really expensive and you can get better quality food for far less money elsewhere.
