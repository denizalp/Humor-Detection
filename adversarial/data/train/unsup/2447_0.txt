After eating here I was surprised to see such high ratings for this place. I wouldn't say the pizza blew me away and I wouldn't say it was not that great either. It was in between. Sometimes \"in between\" places bug me. Either be horrible or exceptionally good. The in between is just 'meh.' I got a Coke and a margherita pizza here. The sauce on the pizza tasted canned and I wasn't a huge fan of the crust. Something tasted off about the cheese and didn't feel or taste like a true fresh mozarrella. I won't be coming back.
