This Cups location used to be my to go place for Korean Shaved Ice until they opens up in First Markham Place.\n\nWith minimum seating, you could see patrons doing musical chairs and shifting all the tables around trying to fit everyone in. Don't ever come with a big group especially on weekend! \n\nBingsu!! Injeolmi always my favourite but I am open to share any flavours! \n\nSince it takes awhile in prepping your beautifully layered and picture perfect bingsu, I said the average wait time would be at least 15 minute even when this place is not too busy.\n\nSo light! So fluffy! \n\nIt is well worth the wait!
