Friendly 45 minute indoor cycling with uplifting instructors and solid instructions to help achieve your goals.  A typical class is broken into sections (based on 1 song or a few), and you use the instructor and the bike's computers to guide your workout (example: attempting to maintain a certain pace while increasing resistance, hills, alternating sprints).  Many instructors also teach at Dragonfly Yoga, so the yoga ethos definitely permeates the instructors' attitudes, as the instructors definitely try to make you feel uplifted and good about yourself throughout the class.  Flyght also features a variety of special events and promotions if you are looking to check out something different.\n\nThe studio facilities are clean and well maintained, you can ask the front desk for a full size towel for the shower and I've never had to wait to use the shower (though to be fair, I've never gone in the morning when I imagine the demand is highest).  The staff will save your bike's size settings under your account so you can always remember them, a novel feature I have not seen at other studios. First class is free, if you like doing workout classes, why not give it a try?
