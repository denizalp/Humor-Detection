Stumbled upon a sidewalk sale after leaving one of what's left of the Toys R Us franchise. I've never known of this store but glad I came across it. Outside was real nice zipper hoodies, sweats & pj pants. I found some real cute summer pj pants for ladies for only $3.99 cha ching. Shopping for my daughter I went inside the store and found a huge discount on boys clothes, purses, shoes etc. They have a plus size section for women I found my daughter some really nice jeans and blouse. I am a real thrifty type shopper but yet quality is important. I found that here. Check em out.
