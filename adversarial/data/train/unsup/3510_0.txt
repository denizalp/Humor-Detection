Creatures of Habit, rejoice for there is Costco!\n\nDo you need a constant supply of chicken nuggets, giant fish sticks, vitamin water, muffins, B12, or enough vanilla extract to last you the next decade? Well you can get all of it down at the Matthews Costco. Not only that, but you can sample 5 or 10 other things that you might want to buy on any given visit.\n\nNow that describes any Costco, but the pluses of this particular one include, very fresh tasting fish (try the stuffed salmon), sufficient staffing so you aren't spending all day in the checkout line, a super helpful tire department and consistently available\/restocked selection. It may seem silly but I am also a fan of how thye are diligent about rotating their endcaps to be seasonably applicable. Two weeks before Christmas that 16oz bottle of vanilla was not burried halfway down the aisle, it was staring me in the face.\n\nThe parking lot is a bit of a disaster but I think that is more a result of the shopping plaza as a whole as opposed to the store.
