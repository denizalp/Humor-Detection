This is the best of the IHOP restaurants in the area. This location is always clean and has the most friendly staff. On my recent trip here last weekend the restaurant was relatively packed, but I was very impressed with the excellent service I received from my server even though I know he was very busy.  I got the breakfast sampler and strawberry pancakes - everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. \n\nI also ordered a crispy chicken salad to take home for later. They changed the lettuce from iceburg to mixed greens making it an even better salad :) I know where I am headed the next time I have a craving for a good breakfast!
