I came in an hour early to fill out paperwork only to be told that my son's appointment was not today, but rather Thursday of the following week. We made the best of it and instead took the time to fill out paperwork and browse frames.\n\nA little faux paus, I thought. It's okay.\n\nWhen we returned the following week, the intake process was simple and they really seemed on top of the ball today! Redemption! ...or maybe nah. We waited about 50 minutes after our appointment time before we were seen. \n\n...There's one girl that works there that is so boisterous and gregarious that I knew everything about every patient she spoke with and then some! So much for confidentiality.\n\nI honestly don't even know if Dr. Berger was the optometrist that did my son's exam. He did not introduce himself. He takes a seat and turns his back to me to write and dives right into questions. Let me tell you, it's quite awkward to have a conversation with the back of someone's head. \n\nAs a concerned parent, I asked about the dilation procedure. Instead of enlightening me, he dismissed my concerns altogether and then took a very condescending tone and was a jerk for the rest of the visit!\n\nEyes dilated, they take my son back to the exam room. \"Dr. Berger\" (?) called me back and explained that his eyes appeared healthy and normal and just to add a little saltiness, he scoffed, \"Seeeeee, he survived the dilation!!\" as if he speaking to a tone-deaf four year old child. Thanks for that.\n\nWhen I tried to explain that I was only looking for more information on the procedure, he cut me off and said, \"It's just like those anti-vax people!! Always coming up with these bizarre, off the wall ideas!!\" He turned the corner, went into his office and shut the door.
