One star to get you to read this! You've been warned. This is a motel. The only way to justify calling this a resort is to add \"last\" in front of it. I asked for a quiet room and booked well in advance. I got a downstairs room next to the stairs. In their defense, there aren't any quiet rooms, so what the hell difference does it make.\n As I type, I'm up in the middle of the night. I just tried to get a glass of water, and the temperature is scalding at every point of the dial. It's Phoenix, so who would want water in the night? So dial lobby, no answer. So pants on, walk over there, and guess what? I'm told the manager\/owner KNOWS about it, and they get a couple of random rooms each night with this problem! He even knows how to fix it, just too cheap.\n What else- there was a booger under the bed pillow- picture attached. Thankfully there were two beds, but then do you trust cleanliness after that?\n In the morning I'll ask for my money back, and make a huge scene at the desk, for the principle alone, since my company is paying.\n Never, ever coming back.
