Good place to pick up an extra sweet gift for a friend. Want some candy? They have oodles of it. Need an old school candy ? Bet they got it.   The Good News ? They have huge versions of Hershey Bars , Reeses Peanut Butter Cups , Gummy Bears and more.  Would be great gag gift, silly gift or just a gift.  Bad news is the prices are on the high end. \nBetter prices at local candy store --SMEEKs in  Phoenix.  But if you are walking the marketplace this might be your place for a treat. They also have some great old style vintage \nAnn Taintor refridge magnets and other cool retro fun gifts . But once again I have seen the same things for less elsewhere in town. The store is  cute as can be bright colors and very inviting. Personally I like candy stores that look vintagy again  like SMEEKs...Hey maybe i should just go to SMEEKs?
