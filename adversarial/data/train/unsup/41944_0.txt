If you want a quick delicious bite you must visit this spot. My wife and I have to visit Greenberg's every time we are in Vegas. \n\nWe always get the Sam n Emmas and every time it's delicious. The meat is stacked so high you can barely open your mouth large enough to take a bite. When you do manage to bite into it, it just melts in your mouth. \n\nI would recommend sharing one at first as they are quite large. Writing this review makes me wish I had one right now.
