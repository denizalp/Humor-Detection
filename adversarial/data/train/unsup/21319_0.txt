I freaking LOVE this store ok, I always come here when I come to Vegas, I have to, I'm in love with crazy socks! They have such a wide selection you will absolutely leave with something if you walk in, I've spent hundreds of dollars in here lol shame shame, I know it's just socks but oh well. They have ankle socks to thigh high socks, fun inappropriate socks, superhero and cartoon, sports teams, pop culture, kids, men and women, see-through socks, stockings, tights, and leg warmers. Pretty much everything. It's located in the Mandalay Bay shops in between Mandalay Bay and the Luxor. Have fun!
