This place has the worst pho noodle soup ever.  The soup broth tastes like a boiled salt water, not like authentic Vietnamese pho.   Only the true master of pho noodle soup should cook pho noodle soup.  Making pho is not for amateurs.  The customer service was very poor too.  On top of that, the place was dirty and gross.
