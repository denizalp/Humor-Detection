Cherry Bar... \n\nDon't be swayed by the name... Its a man's bar....  no, no stripper pole!  I wasn't sure what to expect, when I walked in, but when I was greeted by the familiar face of Tom, the bartender ( His abilities are legendary from Padlock and Friends) I knew I was gonna be quite happy! \n\nPrior to being baptized \"Cherry Bar\" ... the place was most recently named \"Friends\"... it had a great staff and location, but lacked an identity. I understand that changes are underway, and a lot can be expected in the future from the new owners, including a completed outdoor patio area and interior remodel. Personally, I'm happy to see their Men's bathroom is modern, clean and well lit. ( unlike another nameless bar on 7th Street just North of Missouri ..YUK !!!) \n\nThey also have some awesome drink specials going on.. I was there on a Thursday night... and it was 2-4-1... other specials are Mojito Mondays $4.00 until 11...with karaoke starting at 9! and $5.00 well Martinis on Wednesday! And Every night is 2-4-1 from 11PM until close! \n\nSo... I'll be here often...... it has a lot of potential... and besides... If you ask... Tom will shake the hell out of your martini the way it should be... frosty cold!
