4 stars? 5 stars? Whaaaaaa ?!\n\nCame here on a Friday night with a few peeps from Yelp for a UYE (thanks to Karl for organizing it).\n\nSituated in the basement of the Scotia Plaza in the PATH, it was relatively easy to find. They have another location on street level right across the street so don't get confused. The service was okay; it would have been nice if they were a tad bit more attentive. I liked the banana tempura with ice cream, but all the maki sushi were mediocre imo. My $32 meal was probably to pay for the location more than anything else.\n\nEek, me thinks not, indeed.
