Had a recent meal at CPK and was a little bit disappointed. They're usually a good choice if you don't have any better plans. Started with tomato bisque which was hot and yummy. The disappointment came from their signature BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza could have used another 2-3 minutes in the oven as the dough was a bit undercooked and chewy. Not to the point that i couldn't eat it, but it wasn't as good as it could have been. Service was fine. The restaurant was fairly quiet on a weeknight.
