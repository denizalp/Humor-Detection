Cheeseburger cheeseburger coronary coronary. I chose the Nick's Patty Melt which was a fab slab of meat on rye toast with grilled onions and a side of great shoestring fries. Not the healthiest choice (people come here for salads??) but it was massively delicious and filling.\n\nDecent beer specials and a few local choices on their menu.\n\nParking at lunch time is a major challenge. All I can say is \"Good luck.\"
