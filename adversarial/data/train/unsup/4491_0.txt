This is one of the few great AYCE sushi joints in Vegas that are actually open for lunch! Both of my favorite spots are dinner and late night only! After checking out of our hotel, we had sushi withdrawl symptoms and needed raw fish asap!\n\nIt was already packed right at opening. Luckily for us, there were 2 spots open right at the bar. Cha ching!\n\nThe quality and selection here were excellent. Right up there with the best Vegas AYCE spots. AYCE items include appetizers and desserts also. It was about $21 for lunch which was great. \n\nSushi itself was fresh, rice was made perfectly.\n\nHowever I give them only 4 stars because my favorite 2 spots in Vegas still reign on my list. I felt service was a bit rushed because of how crowded they were. Hikari and Sushi House Goyemon still are my tops.
