Lots of potential, some rough edges\n\nWent here for the first time with a group after a movie at the nearby theater and felt it had a lot of potential but was still rough around the edges.\n\nThe good:\n\nNice beer selection. Pleasant atmosphere and \"vibe.\" Waffle fries were great! Very fun low key deserts.\n\nThe bad:\n\nI was very excited by their idea of a Nacho Bar, where you can custom order nachos to suit your tastes\/whims. Sadly, this was biggest letdown of the night. I ordered the classic original version (at least according to wikipedia) of melted cheese and jalapeños. What I got was a cold plate of cold corn chips covered in synthetic canned cheese sauce and raw jalapeño slices (see photo.) A minute in the oven or under a salamander would have helped and if done with real cheese would have been fantastic. The idea of the nacho bar is a great one, just needs some tweaking to make it great, IMHO.\n\nMusic was turned up too loud to talk at your own table let alone hear anything from the numerous TVs tuned to sporting events.
