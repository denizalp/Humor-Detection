I've been to Lush a handful of times. This is probably the only store that I will be able to justify the price tag. Lush is a very ethical company that supports the environment and animal rights. The staff are always friendly and willing to help. The store can be very intimidating but the staff will help you understand and do so in a kind way. They often have expos of the bath bombs. You can sample any of the locations and soaps. If you have sensitive skin, are looking for an all natural soap or want a relaxing bath bomb this is a good store to shop.
