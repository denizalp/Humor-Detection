Pastel is a small dessert restaurant and I've been here multiple times with friends and\/or family who've all enjoyed it.  The menu's pretty large for a dessert place and there's a choice of crepe or waffles for each menu item - most people I'm with prefer the crepes.  Drinks don't seem to be terribly popular with pretty much anyone I've been with but I haven't ever gotten anything aside water for myself so I can't attest to this.\n\nThe atmosphere's nice, though a little crowded when they try and move people \/ tables around due to space restrictions.  Definitely don't go early evening as they get really busy.  You do have the option to sit outside too.  Staff are very friendly and food comes out at a quick pace so that's a plus too.\n\nParking's mostly on the road and paid, but there's apparently a place around the corner you can park that's free if you tell them you're going to Pastel - it's written on the bottom of their menu.  Prices run a little high on some of their drinks and smaller stuff but most other items are fine.  Good recommendation if you're near Yonge & Finch and want a dessert.  Just remember they're pretty small and get busy between 7-9pm, especially on weekends.
