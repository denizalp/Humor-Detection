Who likes getting paid for their opinion?! \n\nFocus Pointe Global is a market research company that works with different major companies to conduct focus groups for specific products, media and all kinds of other fun stuff. \n\nFollow their facebook and make a profile so you can get up to date studies they are conducting. You aren't allowed to talk about the study particularly but I will tell you that I got to do some fun stuff and got paid with a Visa gift card. They only pick you if you qualify, so don't get disheartened if you don't. On average I get picked to do one at this one at least once a year if not twice. Great way to make some extra cash and tell these companies exactly how you feel about their products.
