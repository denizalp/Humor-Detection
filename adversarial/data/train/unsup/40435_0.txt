A true hidden gem in Pittsburgh. I've had my fair share of Latino food but this place really takes the cake. I highly recommend the pulled pork (SO TENDER) and definitely coat it with the green sauce they provide. Their yuca fries are awesome, as are their quesadillas and ...well pretty much everything. If you eat the yuca fries, ask for mayo and mix it with the green sauce~best dipping sauce evaaa\n\nThat being said...does anyone know what is in the green sauce?
