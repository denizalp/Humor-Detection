We decided to try Yoli's after seeing them on Check Please Arizona. We pulled up to the back on Oregon and almost missed it.  If I didn't know it was there we never would have found it. The outside looks unassuming as it is in an old house. We walked in through the patio and were immediately greeted by the staff. It was warm inside so I think they were having AC issues that day.  They have a lovely patio outside so we'll have to sit there when it cools off outside. \n\nI ordered two eggs with hash browns & toast. The eggs come with three items but I wasn't super hungry so I said I didn't want the third item. The waitress said \"are you sure you don't want French toast?\" and my boyfriend said he'd have some so I also ordered French toast. \n\nEverything came out fairly quickly. The French toast was easily the best thing I ate that morning. Everything we ordered was very good but I think they use some special bread because the French toast was semi-sweet and super moist. It had the perfect golden color and I didn't need any syrup - butter was enough. I ended up eating the French toast and leaving the regular toast and some hash browns because I was stuffed. The eggs were perfect and the hash browns were crispy on the outside and soft in the inside - just wonderful. \n\nI think next time I'll just go straight for the French toast.  We can't wait to go back!
