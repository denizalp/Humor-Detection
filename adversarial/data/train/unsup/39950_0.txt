Server was super sweet but you could tell she was overwhelmed with her tables and new to the restaurant business.\nMy kids loved the French toast, eggs, and pancake breakfast! They ate the whole thing (extremely rare since they are both so picky)! The decor reminds you of an old diner which I absolutely love! The newspapers are nice to have to keep busy while waiting for your food. My only complaint would be to have servers who are veterans to the business on the weekends instead of the gals who are new to serving and haven't figured out their rhythm yet. Or, have a veteran train them on how to better delegate their time. We had to walk up front and ask for new silverware since my youngest dropped his and our server only came back to drop the check.... No prebussing, and nobody to ask how our food came out. Little frustrating but, not a huge deal. Luckily, our orders were correct and nobody needed a refill. However, I'd like to think that if an employee is struggling to keep up, other servers or management would easily notice and help pull her outta the weeds. #TeamWork
