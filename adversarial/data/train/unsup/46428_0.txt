This company is great. My dog got into some bad food and   peed and pooped in the house.  I called the company and they came out the same day and gave me a great deal.  Their prices are competitive, they are friendly and prompt! I asked them to clean the bedroom while they were at it.  Both Michel and Joe were great, and my carpets look and smell 100x better!
