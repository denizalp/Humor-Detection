If I was just reviewing the latte, 5 stars for sure. This is a much higher quality latte than I have had in a while, and I savored it.\n\nHowever, the price was a bit steep ($4) and it took a while, so I am being harsh and only giving them 4 stars.\n\nIf this coffee shop was closer to my house, I would be very happy because that is top notch brewing! However, it would put a dent in my pocket that Ideal does not. \n\nThe service was slow, and it gets pretty crowded. The staff was super friendly so we didn't mind waiting.\n\nThe decor is cool with vintage posters and furniture, it had a really cool vibe.\n\nWe were there at noon on a Saturday and there was a very small selection of pastries. They didn't look bad or good really, just muh. Go for the coffee and stay for the environment and the nice people.
