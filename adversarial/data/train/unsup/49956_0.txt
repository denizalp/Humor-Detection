I purchased $50 works this morning at 8:12am at Summerlin  location.  Everyone there greeted with smiles and are very friendly.\nHOWEVER, I have waited 2 hours for my service.  I understand it is a busy location but 2 hours is VERY excessive \n\nI noticed right away my car was left unattended for a long period o time where I've seen workers with sprayers with twirling towels just moving around doing a whole lot of nothing but moving about the place.\nEvery once in a while, someone will open my door and wipe it down and wipe my passenger window....\nThen, another 10mi will pass and someone might vacuum a little and leave my car unattended again.....\n\nI had enough of it and finally asked one of them to check the status of my car since it's been almost 2 hours.  He never came back but GM came to me and said\n\"sorry we didn't realize you've been waiting for 2 hours\"  \nUmmmm, my receipt you made me put on my dashboard clearly states the time.\nHow do you not notice a car sitting in your garage for 2 hours when you only have 4 slots????\nFinally two attendants scrambling to finish up my car.\n15min later they bring my car around and says\n\"we try to vacuum the best that we can\"\nOf course!  You didn't actually spend a lot of time working on my car but just let it sit there.....\nMy car hood still had caked on yellow pollen he was trying to scratch off with his finger nails as he was saying this to me.\n\nI did receive a fee VIP wash card for next time but I don't think I will be using it.
