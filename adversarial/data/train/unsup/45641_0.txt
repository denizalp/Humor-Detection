I usually see a NP at the Mountain Vista location, but for biopsies or procedures I get sent to this location. \nMy first visit with Dr Freeman was just supposed to be a biopsy prior to endometrial ablation. The procedure was excruciatingly painful as I was told my uterus was tilted\/folded and could not complete the biopsy. A 5-10 min procedure took 30 minutes. I was in tears and Dr Freeman was irritated with me. She kept asking if I just wanted her to stop and come back to try again on another day. I was like no, just so what you have to do right now. Why would I possibly want to endure this again. \nI had to follow up a week later and Dr Freeman came in, introduced herself and said it was nice to meet me. She had not even looked at my chart. She had no recollection of treating me a week prior and was looking at my chart trying to figure out why I was seeing her. I had to explain why I was there based on the information I was given the week before. She told me the EA was not an option and insisted that I should just get an RX instead. I asked if there were other options as I experienced horrible side effects of the same RX when given the injection form. She was irritated with me asking questions and basically said take it or leave and ended the appt after 6 minutes. I left in tears again. I would NOT recommend her.\nThe following day, I went back to my regular location and my NP explained what the problem was and gave me numerous options for treatment. My NP at Mountain Vista location is awesome.
