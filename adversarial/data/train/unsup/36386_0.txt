A must visit in Las Vegas. Where else can you play pinball ranging from 1940s woodrails to modern day stern pinballs. Games are set from ..25 to .75 a game. Cheapest entertainment in Las Vegas. Plenty of variety and also a handful of classic 1980s classic arcades as well. As a bonus all profits go to the Salvation Army. A much better way to blow $20 instead of feeding the one arm bandits on the strip. Find your inner Tommy!
