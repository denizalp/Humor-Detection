Visited here on Thursday 9-22-16 at 5:15 PM.  This restaurant is located inside Palace Station Casino.  Plan on spending $100 per person if you want to have a good dinner here.  \n\nThe ambiance is kinda dark and swanky but not too stuffy.  It would be really good for a special occasion or a business dinner.  \n\nI just loved our waiter! Gary was so attentive but not over-bearing but at the same time laid back and friendly.  I wish every waiter could be like Gary honestly.\n\n$8 classic caesar salad- Fresh, cold romaine dressed with a house-made caesar dressing and garnished with a nice french bread crouton.  The dressing was nicely fishy so I'm betting they use real anchovies.  It was a tad over-dressed but still really good.  I really liked the shaved grana padano cheese on top. \n\n$12 jumbo shrimp cocktail- Came with 4 huge shrimp in a lovely metal container with delicious horseradish cocktail sauce.  They were very fresh and delicious and I highly recommend this appetizer. \n\n$11 Fried calamari- Had  really good mix of tentacles and rings and was fried perfectly.  Batter did not fall off the calamari, even when dipped into the tasty tomato sauce.  I loved the addition of the cherry peppers on top.  If you like calamari, you'll be pleased with this appetizer.  \n\n$28 petite filet- Very good and tender cut of meat.  Perfectly cooked to medium and seasoned very well.  At least 2 inches thick and I enjoyed every bite.  I took half home with me and it was even good warmed up in the microwave.  \n\n$32 Lobster tail- Probably one of the biggest lobster tails I've ever eaten.  It was so moist and juicy and had a lovely grilled flavor.  It was served with a nice wedge of lemon and drawn butter.  Probably one of the best lobster tails I've ever eaten.  \n\nThe sides and desserts were all amazing as well...I won't bore you with all that tho.  I had the loaded baked potato, asparagus, and creme brulee for dessert.  All were nothing short of spectacular.    Don't hesitate to come here if you get the chance.
