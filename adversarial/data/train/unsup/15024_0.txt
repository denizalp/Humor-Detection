They have good flavours of ice cream like salted caramel, maple pecan and toasted caramel as well as an assortment of chocolates, but I give this place a one star because at the bottom of my ice cream was one dark short hair, I can only surmise where it came from and I was not a happy camper having eaten ice cream contaminated by this hair. Furthermore, the store closed one hour early, it was supposed to close at 8 but it closed at 7. Saw lots of disgruntled potential customers while eating my contaminated ice cream.  I really wanted to like this place but I can't, I can't even, when I think back to the contaminated ice cream.
