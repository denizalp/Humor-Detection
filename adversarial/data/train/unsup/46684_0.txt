I used to be a Jiffy Lube loyalist, but that changed today. I happened to see this Grease Monkey out of the corner of my eye, on my way to Jiffy Lube. I noticed there was no line, so I turned around and pulled in. In the first 3 minutes, I knew I made the right call. The staff were all very personable and friendly, and the manager was very engaging and you could tell he enjoys his craft. I would recommend Grease Monkey to anyone. The same price or better, and a much better customer experience than Jiffy Lube.
