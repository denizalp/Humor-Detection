Wedge is one of my favorite places to eat in Champaign. I'm a sucker for all kinds of Mexican food, and the selection at Wedge does not disappoint. It's the kind of place you can eat at frequently, but still always have something new to try. I've sampled many of their tacos, but my favorites are the ceviche and the chorizo & egg. I love that they switch up their drink and food menus seasonally to accommodate for what's in season. I'd recommend Wedge to anyone looking for delicious Mexican food that's a step up from your typical fast casual dining.
