2.5 stars.\n\nIs it me, or do prices at CVS usually run lower than Walgreen's?  I suppose the two are just like every other competing company out there, raising the prices on certain items while lowering prices on others to make it look like they're offering a sale that day...\n\nLast time I visited a CVS location (not this one), I couldn't find what I was searching for.  (Funny enough, I found the items at a Walgreen's closer to home.)  At THIS particular location, I fell for an advertising gimmick that, on quick glance (I only had a couple of minutes to spare), looked like I was saving on a travel-sized toothpaste, but it turned out that the \"savings\" would apply on my NEXT trip, providing I visit before the coupon's expiration date, on the same product.  I keep hearing that signing up for a CVS loyalty card pays, but I've yet to believe it!
