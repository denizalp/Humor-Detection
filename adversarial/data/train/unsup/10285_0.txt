There is some authentic shiz going on here! \n\nI've walked by many times, and even tried walk-in - learned my lesson and made reservations instead. The staff is friendly, but their English is not the best. No problem, just point to the items in the menu! \n\nI came here with my bf, and two friends. Here's what we got:\n\nSapporo pitcher - only $15, and filled 4 tall glasses. Definitely a steal. \nHhotpot - 2 orders for $30. This came in big bowl bubbling over with broth, veggies, intestines (nom) and we added udon too.\nBeef tataki - beautifully presented, and perfectly fine. Served with ponzu sauce\nScallop carpaccio -  was delicately sweet, very good!\nBeef tongue...it was just ok. Kinda rough.\nRaw octopus in wasabi sauce -  per bf's request - this was AMAZING! Perfect texture, not chewy but had a bounce to the bite! We ordered nori (seaweed) to go with it too.\nDeep fried chicken - very crispy, very tender inside. Fried chicken is fried chicken, but this was GOOD fried chicken.\nGrilled black cod - so so so delicious! I recommend. The fish is firm and sweet.\nGreen tea cheesecake - heavy on the matcha flavour, nice treat for  the end. They charged us for the ice cream, though\nApple and custard tortilla - 10 minute wait for this, plus they burned the first one they made. It was....ok. Just ok. It's literally apple slices baked on top of a tortilla with sweet custard. The flavours don't meld together.\n\nOverall, great experience. I think I prefer this over Guu - the food is similar, but ambience is great and sitting is more comfortable. Will be back for more Sapporo pitchers in the summer, when their patio opens up!
