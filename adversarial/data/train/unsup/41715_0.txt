My sister found this place to have an early dinner after  my niece's graduation from Duquesne and we loved it!  Outdoor patio was beautiful and the staff was awesome and attentive!  The food was all around amazing.. Our party of 11 tried everything from the burgers,brussel sprouts, strip steaks and pierogies and we loved everything!  Would love to come again! Pineapple  Mule was delicious and lots of good beers on tap or in the bottle.
