I've been to Sweet Tomatoes a few times and I have to say, I like the new changes they're making.\n\nThe whole look on the inside is different - and in a good way. I like the new decor right when you walk in. It's a nice change, and makes everything look more modern and fresh.\n\nAs far as the food goes, I also like the new additions. I had the rotisserie chicken and the creamed corn and both were pretty darn good.\n\nOverall - it's nice to see them evolving and changing things up.
