Cat lovers of the world unite. This is an incredible place, cats walking around, kids looking at the cats with big eyes, young people on dates trying to show their nicer sides, older people relaxing with a cat on their lap...Incredible.\n\nThis is also a Veterinarian-Vegan place and as such I love it even more. The coffee is good and the banana-chocolate pudding is out of this world. It is a little expensive but if you consider the fact you are paying also for the experience (\"Cat-therapy\")  it makes you feel a little better.
