Love this place.  A little busy from the tourist crowd but a good diner built for speed and quality.  I had breakfast here twice: chorizo and eggs and a bacon and egg offering.  Both were served up quickly and at a high level of quality.  Super attentive staff and great banter with the wait staff at the bar.  Good personnel working here and management should be applauded for brining in and keeping these folks.  I'll bring my friends back to explore more of the menu next time I'm in Vegas.
