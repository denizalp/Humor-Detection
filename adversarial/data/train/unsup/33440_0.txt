After walking around Scottsdale for hours shopping, we googled seafood in the area and this is the location that was recommended.  So we tried it, I have to say that the wine list was exceptional and that my friends is where the story turned.  I ordered the stuff lobster and though the inside crab stuffing was good, the lobster was chewy and rubber.  My partner ordered a steak and it was a bit cold.  The broccoli thing that came with our dinner was a little weird, it was just a whole Broccoli with some cheese over it, not much chef imagination there.  I was very disappointed, come on we spend $130 for dinner and left with a bad taste in our mouth about this place.  On the ride home I kept thinking to myself, man I could have bought a week's worth of groceries and made better dinners then what we got there..  So So disappointed.
