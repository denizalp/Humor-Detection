Easy, quick and relatively pain-free. I had only gotten my eyebrows threaded once before, several years ago on the west coast. The experience was one of the most painful things I have ever done, and it dragged on for almost 15 minutes. Since then, it has taken planning a wedding for me to suck it up and go get my eyebrows threaded again.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when I popped into this little place and was finished in about 5 minutes without tears in my eyes and without the urge to ask the threader to stop. I now realize I must have gone to a very inexperienced person back in the day, but I had no basis of comparison. \n\n$8 + tip and it was super fast. Sure, they don't spend 5 minutes talking with you about what you're looking for and how you usually do your eyebrows, but the results were much better than I have even gotten with waxing\/plucking. I have naturally thick eyebrows and she cleaned them up nicely without leaving my face looking ridiculous. I will take assembly-line style threading any day for the convenience this place offers.
