This place is ok, not as pleasant as the one we used to go to in Phoenix. There's one girl who is really short and we know so much about her because she is always talking about herself to her co-workers and will not focus on her job. She's messed up on orders a few times and it even looks like her co-workers want her to shut up. The ones who make up for the service are the older ones who usually do not mess up on orders.
