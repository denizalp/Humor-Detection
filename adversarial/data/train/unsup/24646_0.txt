Wish I could give two different star ratings.\nWould give 5 stars to the food and the bartender who greeted us and romantically described the specials. The scallop nachos were innovative;the phyllo-wrapped lamb was divine.\nUnfortunately our service turned frightening when the sweet bartender was shunned to the dishroom and a wicked witch took over the service. She was just plain mean when she delivered the works of culinary art to our tiny space at the bar, tossed dessert menus at us and rudely swiped the check out from under my arm. Granted it was 830 on a Thursday night in Champaign, but in the reality of niche restaurant management you can't treat guests this way and survive! \nSorry Chef...you front of the house staff ruined a fabulous meal!
