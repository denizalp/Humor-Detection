Came here on a Tuesday afternoon and found the place pretty packed. There were no long lines but almost all the seats were full. I ordered a Matcha Latte float and sis ordered a Hojicha float. \n\nPros: loved the matcha soft serve on top of the drink, very smooth and full bodied matcha flavor. Perfect level of sweetness as well. My sister loved her Hojicha float as well. Order came out in a timely manner, and customer service was friendly.\n\nCons: Only thing I would change is the amount of ice in my drink. Almost $6 for the smaller cup size and most of the bottom half was just ice cubes.\n(Whatever Matcha tea there was, was delicious though)\n\nThey also have a cute little photo booth area set up, with props.\n\nOverall, would probably come here again once in a while if in the area, due to the quality of the Matcha flavor. But would've came more often if either the drink to ice ratio was improved, or either the prices lowered.
