I love art museums! I've been to this particular one a couple of times! And the cool thing I like about museums is that all their art exhibits are seasonal! So they aren't always the same. I went here for a small date with my boyfriend. It's a very nice and quiet place to look at art and think. I feel very relaxed and amazed coming here while looking at everything. They have engaging displays while being able to quiet contemplate. This is such a cute place for date night. My favorite exhibit for this season is the butterfly wall and the hanging disco balls. The admission tickets are $15 for student and $20 for adults. However if you are a Maricopa student just show your ID and get in for free! Also, every First Friday they have the museum open late and people can go in for free as well!
