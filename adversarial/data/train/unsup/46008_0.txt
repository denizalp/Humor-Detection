I went to Bellagio Buffet on Saturday at 3pm with short lines.  I heard good reviews about this place so I decided to give it a try.  The weekend brunch is average.  They offer fruit-juicy watermelon, delicious desserts, chinese food, breakfast (runny scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, pototates), ham was moist, turkey, sushi, shrimp, soups.  The food was plentiful.  I waited at 4pm to eat their dinner and it's better than the brunch.  The dinner offer ribs, beef wellington, wings, crab legs(lines were long at 4pm then the lines died down), shrimp, fruit, salad, etc.   The servers were great and refill our sodas very often.   Overall dinner buffet starts at 4pm is better and cost $29.99 than weekend brunch $24.99 w\/out champagne.
