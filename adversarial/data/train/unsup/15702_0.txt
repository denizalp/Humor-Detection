I can finally say I've been to Lisa G's.  I'm not sure what took so long, but I'd been wanting to try it for a while.  I went for a business lunch meeting on a Monday.  The place is cute, service welcoming and attentive but not pushy, and food was impressive as well.  I went with the veggie sandwich on toasted wheat bread.  The combination of fresh roasted veggies plus farmer's cheese and tomato jam is simply perfect! \n\nI liked it so much that I planned on going back that same week on Friday to get the same thing.  Unfortunately, when I walked in the door just past 2pm, we were turned away... they close mid-day at 2pm.  Bummer!\n\nAll in all, I'll optimistically give Lisa G 4 stars, but I will have to return to try more from the menu and check out their wine list next visit and update then.  If you plan on going, make sure they are open so you're not let down the way Thomas and I were when we went.\n\nPS - I am adding this to my \"It's all about the Eggplant\" list since their veggie sandwich has yummy eggplant as one of the yummy ingredients!
