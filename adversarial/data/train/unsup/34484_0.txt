Ohh so sad and angry at myself, I came here for a first time when they just opened abut a year ago the food was on point the sweet and sour chicken was incredible and the scallops were to die for I had dreams about it they were like butter and melted in your mouth I actually ordered twice that time they were seared to perfection and glazed with a beautiful amber sauce . So I decided to come back for my bday and what a disappointment the s&s chicken was dry and not crispy enough and the scallops were breaded !!!  What??? Doughy chewy and uncooked omg why did I have to erase such a beautiful memory fortunately the manager removed from the bill not coming back !! Forgettable
