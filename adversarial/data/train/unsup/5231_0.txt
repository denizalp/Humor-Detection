Ok, I'm an advanced home cook and baker. So of course Bouchon is my first culinary stop in Vegas.  I thought it may be overhyped and it seemed overpriced.  I also assumed the macarons would steal the show over the flashy less sophisticated sandwich cookies.  \n\nSo wrong.  Days later and back in the Midwest I am gorging on the goodies and dreaming of Bouchon.  Such classy and excellent staff, so helpful and friendly.  Late hours at a bakery?  Phenomenal!   And that damn good cup of coffee. \n\nNow. Macarons.  Some are small and crisp me skimpily slithered with succulent jam.  Others wear a brittle meringue hat and one may find the head within that hat a bit chewy and dense.  These varieties may be daubed generously with supple sensuous buttercream--never overly-sweet.  \n\nBouchon has the latter sort.  I tried Black Forest, coffee, salted caramel, chocolate covered pistachio, and pumpkin.   All amazing, some more or less so.   I also destroy---er, I mean I ate a better nutter and a tko (aka Thomas Keller Oreo).  The two sandwich cookies were deliriously delicious.  Like a transcendental experience.   Full body bliss.  No joke.  Not too sweet.  Flavors were coaxed through due to the lack of molar cracking saccharinity).  Soft silky moist filled with shots of sensuously sweet butter cream. \n\nSo good I'm gonna spring for the cookbook and attempt to tame Mr Keller in my own kitchen.
