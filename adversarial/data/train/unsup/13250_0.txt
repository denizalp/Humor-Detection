Wish I Could Give them negative or 0 stars but I couldn't. \n\n    Our family stayed at their piazza suite from 04\/02~04\/03, I was told on phone that I could do early check in after 10am without any problem, so when I showed up at the front counter around 11:40am, I was told that the rooms were not ready yet, but I could pay $100 to get a different suite which was ready, I rejected and I told the counter lady that I just called earlier to verify it's ready to check in and I would wait for the piazza suite when it's ready, next min,magically she told me that our room was ready, WOW, that's so amazing?? That's not the worst part.\n\n      When my family went to the suite, not only it's so OUTDATED, the room had dirty carpets and dirty sofas and rusted light fixture, I quickly called the front desk and she said that this was how it is, the best she could do is switching us to other same suite, she could have someone sent us the card keys right away, then that right away took almost 40 mins, we finally went to another suite, it's same outdated, rusted light fixture, loose and scratched up noisy wood stairs with stained table and stained sofa, everything in the suites are very very OLD, the sofa and tables really should have been changed, those are probably older than 25 years old, dirty and outdated, also same ages of those OLD carpets, since we had plans in Vegas, so we had to stay, this suite DOES NOT HAVE high speed internet or high quality good TV(cheap unclear small tv), the wifi was almost unusable during night time and morning time, we had to use our celler phone's datas and TV was terrible, small, unclear and not user friendly.\n\n     I thought that this is a 5 stars hotel and everything should have been great, I am very upset about your hotel's services,\n\n1. Trying to trick us into paying $100 extra to upgrade when my suite was REALLY ALREADY available for FREE early check in.\n2. Slow services and unfriendly staffs when calling, I didn't even hear a \"sorry\" for the trouble of switching room.\n3. For $300 + per night, not only that they didn't offer any free waters or fruits like other hotels, the suites are so outdated and not clean at all, they should really consider spend some money to keep the higher end rooms up to date, most MGM hotels' suites are more updated and cleaner than this piazza suite. I attached some of the photos to show you how bad those were.\n4. They charged over $50 for the resort fees on top of the already expansive suites but I didn't get any benefits like fast WIFI internet and good cable TV like the reservation says and you charge almost everything to watch including some old kid's cartoon.\n\n    I compliant all those issues to their senior mange team, they responded that they could offer us a coupon for the next room stay, wow, for that kind of discounts I can get it from yelp's front page or any other online booking websites without needing their coupon, so I said no thanks and they didn't even apologize or offer something else to make it right, I have the photos as proves how old and dirty the suites are, this is NOT a cheap motel, for a high end suites, something like this is NOT acceptable.\n\n   The ONLY good thing that I can think of is that they have FREE PARKING and beautiful views, you can park your car FREE and enjoy their hotel's beautiful views and maybe Gondola cruises, then spend your hotel money some where else. That's the smartest way.
