Got dragged in here by John R. because he had a coupon from work for \"Medical Workers Appreciation\". It stated 20% off entire bill and also free craft beer OR appetizer. \n\nUpon entering, we seated ourselves right away. Learned my lesson last time, no one will seat you.. You just gotta seat yourselves. We got here at 12am thinking it was happy hour. Unfortunately HH is Mon-Fri 12am. And it was technically 12am Saturday. Which was a bummer! Because all speciality cocktails were $5 during HH. \n\nThis place is so cold. Like freezing! So bring a light sweater. Our server (totally spaced on the name) took about 15 minutes to acknowledge us. We told her about the coupon. She said we can't use it. We were pretty shocked. The only reason we decided to give this place another chance was because of the coupon and happy hour. So that's 2 strikes already. \n\nWe were already here so we decided to order food. Food took FOREVER to come. Just like last time. The beau ordered steak and eggs. The server didn't even ask him how he liked his steak or eggs cooked! Food was ok, the beau really liked how the steak was cooked. It had a good flavor to it. \n\nProbably will never come back.
