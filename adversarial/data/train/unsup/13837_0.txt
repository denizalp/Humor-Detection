*UPDATE*\n\nI went in to grab a red velvet cupcake, same as before, DRY, think about biting into a brand new dry sponge, that's exactly the way the cake felt in my mouth and not only that but I looked in the mirror and my mouth and teeth were all red....eeeewwww......No I did not eat the flower on top, this was from the dye added to the cake...somebody doesn't know how to make TRUE Red Velvet.\n\nI'll never go back here!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nI Just noticed this tiny place peeking out of the strip mall today.\n\nIt's a really cute little Cake Cafe, my first clue was the name.\nUpon entering it smelled sweet, inviting comfy chairs, a few bistro tables a wall of gift items and A smiling host.\n\nI asked about the cupcakes in the display case, there were so many to choose from. Every fruit flavor and chocolate combo you can think of, only butter-cream frosting here though, No Whip Cream which is my Favorite. \n\nI decided on a Red Velvet and a Carrot Cake both with the cream cheese frosting. (see pics)\n\nThey were good. Nothing spectacular or out of this world, more ordinary and bit dry. I definitely blow her carrot cake outta the water, outta the desert for that matter. \nBut for $2 each it was a nice end to my earlier lunch.\n\nI don't know that I'll be rushing back, but if I'm desperate for dessert and am low on cash I can stop here and get my needs met.
