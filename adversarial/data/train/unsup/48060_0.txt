This new location of Five Guys Burgers and Fries in the new Downtown Summerlin shopping complex gets 4 stars from me. This place is so new it's not even correctly located on Google Maps yet. Their burgers are almost as tasty as In-N-Out and they have more free add-ons you can put onto them, like mushrooms, mayo, pickles, etc. Plus, they got those new high tech soda dispensers that serve a wide variety of flavors and types, including diet ginger ale. Service is nice and friendly too. They also give free peanuts.
