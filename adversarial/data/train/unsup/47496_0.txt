Beautiful hotel! The best in Vegas (from what I have stayed in). The rooms make you feel like royalty. And the location is perfect. The venetian has all the best restaurants, bars, shops, EVERYTHING. I could probably just come to Vegas and spend a whole weekend just at the Venetian. The rooms are a bit expensive, but trust me, they won't disappoint. The pool is also very nice.
