Jimmy Jacks has been in business since the 60's, don't know the exact year, but my older brother use to eat there as a kid and he is now 53 years old. This place looks like a dump and  is located in high crime area, try and look past the crack whores and drug deals and you will find good hot wings and burgers. The fried chicken is pretty good too. Prices are really cheap, you can eat breakfast for like $3 bucks.
