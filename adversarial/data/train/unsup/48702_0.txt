Let your nose be your guide if you dare. This is a very well stocked bakery. Their pastries are fantastic. Cannolies, cakes, pastries, and all sorts of great treats. I was treated to their cannolies on a job site. I could not stop thinking about it. My co-worker brought me there for myself. Now I can not pass Grand Ave on the loop 101 without being tempted to go there. I have been back several times since. If having a special dinner, these are the people to arrange the sweets with.
