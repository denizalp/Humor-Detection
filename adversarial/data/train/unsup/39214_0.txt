You gotta get the chicken when you're here, what else are you gonna get a salad? Not that there's anything wrong with salads, but when you're going to be eating at Yardbird Southern Table and Bar you won't be disappointed with the chicken. We came in for lunch at 11:30 and was seated at a booth right away, there weren't many people in the restaurant so it was pretty calm. So to start with our meal, we got the deviled eggs for the table. I have a strong dislike for dill, so I didn't enjoy the deviled eggs at all. However, my mom loved them and so did my boyfriend. I got the Chicken and Waffles plate to share with my mom and my boyfriend got the Swine Burger. The chicken was seasoned perfectly with the best crunch!! Definitely one of the best fried chicken I've ever had. The Swine Burger was really good, the only issue with that was just the tiny slice of pork belly they advertise in the menu description to be a big part of the burger but wasn't. Overall, it was a good time.
