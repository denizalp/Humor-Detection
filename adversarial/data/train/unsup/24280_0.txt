Downhill it is!\n\nTried Local Bistro again tonight - drunk bread, risotto, arugula salad, prosciutto pizza.\n\nThe drunk bread was delicious, however, $10 for a big slice of bread - it wasn't that delicious.  \n\nRisotto was good but not exceptional.  \n\nArugula salad was a little wilted and the dressing was gross, too sweet and gross.  \n\nProsciutto pizza was not good...the prosciutto had very tough fat running through it, flavor was too sweet (FYI, it is not heated as part of the pizza) and the pizza base itself was completely bland.  \"Wood fired\" may be true, I'm sure there is a wood that burns that gives off no flavor whatsoever - if it had said \"toaster oven fired\" it would have better set my expectations.\n\nExtra bread on the side - stale.\n\nOne last thing I'll mention, everything was stone cold except for the salad, that was slightly warm.\n\nLocal Bistro - I want you to be great.  I like your menu and you are close to my house.  Can't someone stage an intervention with the kitchen staff??
