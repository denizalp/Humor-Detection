Tonight, my grandparents treated me to dinner at the Courtyard Cafe. It was my first time there.\n\nWe sat on the patio and at first glance, it appeared spacious and clean. However, after about 5 minutes, I realized that I was going to spend the majority of my evening swatting bugs out of my face and my food.\n_______\nI attempted to order pizza but was shot down by the waitress, who told me that it would take approximately 40 minutes to prepare it.  While selecting a less labor-intensive entree from the menu, I found myself distracted by the loud, jazz music blasting in the background. I couldn't think straight--which is shocking, given that I am in my twenty's and have a pretty high tolerance for noise. \n\nI ended up ordering pasta with garlic and olive oil because it seemed like a safe option. But, when the food arrived, I found several small bugs in my pasta. I, then, brought it to the attention of the waitress, who promptly removed my dish from the table. She did not return to see if I wanted anything else nor did she offer to remake it for me. \n\nInstead, a sloppy-looking manager showed up at our table to tell me that I was wrong about there being bugs in my pasta. He said that \"bugs\" were actually cooked garlic. Unless garlic moves, I am 200% sure that the \"bugs\" were, in fact, bugs.  \n\nAfter that, he walked away. At NO point did he apologize, offer to remake the dish or ask if I wanted to see the menu\/try something else. Isn't the customer always right, especially when they are right?\n\nThroughout dinner, I nibbled on the garlic bread-which was average. It looked and tasted like microwaved french bread with shredded cheese.\n\nBased on this experience, I have NO interest in returning to Courtyard Cafe.\n\nBelow average food. Terrible service. Disgusting bug problem. Loud music. Confused wait staff.\n\nI am truly shocked this place has received such good reviews on Yelp.
