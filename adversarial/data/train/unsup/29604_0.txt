I was not expecting much from this Chinese restaurant seeing as how there were some negative reviews on here mainly about delivery it seems but I was pleasantly surprised with their food. The house special fried rice + broccoli chicken were actually great choices even compared to some of the other Chinese restaurants in the area. I believe their closing hours are actually until 10 PM on most weekdays despite the 9:30 PM closing time that's mentioned on here.\n\nNever ordered delivery from here so I'm not sure what that's like but the pickup\/takeout was very convenient for me. The prices are very reasonable and portions were generous. I would order from here again if I'm in the mood for some Chinese food.
