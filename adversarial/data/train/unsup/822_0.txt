I am recently recovered from a cold. It started in my head and has moved to my chest. While the cough has held on, I credit Scott's Generations (and Nyquil) for the bulk of my speedy recovery!\n\nThere's nothing like a flavorful broth and your choice of noodle, rice, matzo ball, or (my choice) kreplach for a miracle cure. A full quart'll set you back around $8. \n\nEven better: you don't have to be sick to enjoy this place. \n\nI also like Scott's for breakfast. Excellent corned beef hash. Plus, the whole diner feel and a good, chewy bagel has the potential to transport you to parts East.
