I am a Marine 66 years old , the VA was going to wait 2 months to clear my ear. I went to ENT. Asked the price paid it in full. A month later I receive another bill, I tried to find out why, no real answer. My advise is to stay clear from this place, or rip up money. They lie and having it done correct in July by VA.
