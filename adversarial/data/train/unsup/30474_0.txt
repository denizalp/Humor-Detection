I would say the sushi here is average. It's nothing too special. I've come here a couple of times and I would say the service is not consistent. Sometimes I will get someone really nice and then sometimes I will get someone who doesn't seem to care. It's also really hard to find parking because it's a shared plaza and there is literally only 15 spots it seems!\n\nOverall, the sushi is okay but I'm sure there are better places.
