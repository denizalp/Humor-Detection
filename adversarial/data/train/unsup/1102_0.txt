We usually come for lunch but made it out there for breakfast. This place is as good if not better than some of the other spots in BC. My husband had an omelette and I had a breakfast wrap. Their potatoes are delicious and homemade. You can really taste the freshness in their produce. Gravy   was tasty and the coffee was fresh! Looking forward to seeing the owner (who always comes out to greet the customers and to ensure they are having a good experience ) and our favorite server Ginny again soon :)
