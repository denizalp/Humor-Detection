I came here for an early dinner on a weekday with my friend after work. There were many tables empty as it was pretty early. This was our first time here so we were shown the menu, given a brief explanation, and even a few suggestions of popular items. \n\nThe interior of this restaurant is very casual and has a great ambiance. It's good for groups and a nice place to enjoy food and catch up with friends. \n\nThe service was okay overall. Nothing amazing but not bad either.\n\nThey have some vegan options, which is why I came in. I had the Guadeloupe burger, which is a black bean burger with a sprout bun and delicious sounding toppings such as guacamole. I wanted to switch a topping (which was stated that they could change and customize the burgers as we were given the menu) for something in that same category (same price) but they said I would have to pay extra. That was extremely disappointing. I ordered it as is with the pickled onions on the side, mostly because I didn't know what they would taste like and I hate raw onions as it is. When the burger arrived, the onions on the side looked just like regular onions and tasted like regular onions. There was nothing different about them to call them \"pickled\" so I was glad I ordered them on the side. The bun was pretty good. It tasted fresh. The burger patty was very mushy and tasteless. I have had many black beans burgers and this one was probably the worst. It needs flavour. It also fell apart very easily. I don't particularly like salt and often find things too salty but this patty was in serious need of salt. Coming from me, that just shows how much flavour it lacked. I ended up drowning the entire burger in hot sauce to be able to eat it. \n\nThis place might be better for regular burgers with meat but if you offer vegan options, at least make them half decent. I wouldn't come here again or recommend it to anyone who is vegan, or vegetarian with dietary restrictions.
