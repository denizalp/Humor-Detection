I think when I'm 60 is when I'll finally be able to afford to actually stay here.\n\nAside from it being the biggest pain in the ass to get to, having to take the monorail then WALK in the insane heat to a shuttle stop and WAIT to be picked up (Walking in 110 degree heat and waiting don't make me happy), this place really blew me away.\n\nThe whole atmosphere is just classy. Classier then the overrated Bellagio. Big whoopies, you have a crazy ceiling and a good club, you mean nothing to me Bellagio!  \n\nDefinitely a whole other class of people stay here. Which was a nice change to see instead of Grandma and Grampa monopolizing the nickel slots in their green poker visors and matching fanny packs at the Tropicana. Nothing against the Tropicana though, I did enjoy myself there. Just an observation.\n\nWhere to eat lunch????\nUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.\nOur reaction exactly. \n\nI think my friend and I spent more time deciding where to eat then actually eating. After speaking with a friendly staff member he helped us choose a french place that overlooked a beautiful waterfall. Which was the exact spot that we both decided we will definitely have be around 60 by the time we can afford to stay here and enjoy gambling.  \n\nOne day soon Wynn, one day soon....\n\nSky*
