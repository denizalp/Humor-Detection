if i was a rave-boy 20 yr old again...this would still be only a 3 star experience.\n\ngreat staff, beautiful location, only 15 dollar cover.\n\nnow the bad...\nlike in high school, all the girls dance on one side, guys on the other.  i don't believe this is a gay club, cause most of the couples that were slutting it up were hetero.\n\ndrinks were triple price and 50% less in pour than any other bar, club or pub i went to that night (good sample cause i went to 5 in 6 hrs)\n\ni did like the marketing with other sponsors and models cruising around  http:\/\/static.px.yelp.com\/bphoto\/h6GpeYazwoIsNTh8XNVUtw\/l\ncos it helped to offset the otherwise sliminess and grime i felt when attempting to get my groove on.\n\nthis is a weird mix between beauty bar and prana back in SF.  yuck
