I guess the 4th time is the charm!!  My brother was nice enough to get us a gift certificate here so even though we didn't really want to come back here again we decided to order things we wouldn't normally get at a steakhouse.  Stuff like chateaubriand which was fn awesome and way better than anything else I had there the last 3 times.
