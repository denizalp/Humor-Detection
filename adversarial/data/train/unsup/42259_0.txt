A perfect place to stay if you want to be away from the crowd of the strip and yet accessible enough to the nightlife. The hotel is located across West gate and the convention center. Aside from a cab or uber, it can be reached by taking the monorail which stops at West gate or riding the Metrobus SDX which stops at Convention and Paradise rd.  It is reasonablly priced compared to other hotels- has free WiFi, breakfast buffet (and make your own waffles), a heated pool on the top floor, and a free shuttle service going to the fashion mall across Wynn Hotel. Only downside is it does not have nearby restaurants . you would have to walk at least 5 minutes to go to one. You can eat at their Palettes Restaurant which does their room service too so expect a long time before your food comes out. Service was okay. Will surely consider this a go to place when I am in Vegas.
