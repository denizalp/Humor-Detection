I have been to a lot of restaurants in Las Vegas. I have been to a lot of Italian restaurants all over the world. I have to say that this was one of the most pleasant experiences I've encountered in a long time. The service from start to finish is impeccable, and the complementary dishes, bread, cheese that they continue to bring to your table while you make your decisions was incredible.  I had the veal marsala which melted in my mouth, my friends had different pasta dishes which they both enjoyed as well. We shared a trio of dessert which was enough for three of us to split and be very satisfied. They also have an extensive wine list which will please leave in the most discerning wine drinker. I will be back here often, and recommend to colleagues and friends without a doubt.
