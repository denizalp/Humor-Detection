Thirsty & Miserable is one of my favourite dive bars.\n\nIf you are into local craft beers on drafts, you will be happy. Or if you are into Belgium or import beers in bottles, you also will be delighted!\n\nCome here for beers and nothing else... Or maybe for the laid back and easily going vibe?\n\nI kind of like the darkness here..as I think I look better in this dim lighting after a few beers...\n\nCheers!\n\nPS You can find their beer lists updated frequently on Facebook!
