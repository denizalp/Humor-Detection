Another Chinese restaurants in Scarborough.\n\nSimilar menus, Similar set up,  Similar taste.\n\nI had been here for dim sum and dinner. Both times has an A OK experience.\n\nNot too busy on weekdays for dim sum early bird but I like the fact that it opens at 8 am.\n\nThe more modern decor is quite nice. Service was fast and friendly.
