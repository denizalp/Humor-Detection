I went here on a really cold day so it was perfect. Although I was unaware I walked into get rekt. Beef noodle soup has a close place to my heart and it's one of the best I've had to be honest. My family and all ordered the beef noodle soup with all various spice levels from baby spice, to liu kang bicycle kicking you in the throat. They also serve a mung bean \"soup\" to accompany the delicious fire water that we were about to eat. Sichuan peppercorns really numb you up. They probably lowkey use it when you're at the dentist probably. While that sensation is going on, the noodles were good, and so was he broth. I highly recommend the sweet savory dumplings. Whatever sauce they had I would get lost in the sauce real quick.  Overall I was dying and I felt like I could breathe fire.\n\n\ngg no re
