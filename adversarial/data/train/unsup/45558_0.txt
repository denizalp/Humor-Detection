I had lunch here with my lab which is located on campus. Takes about 10 min to walk here. When we got in around 12:30 on a weekday it was packed. Luckily there was a table for us. I got the tonkatsu ramen with pork. The soup was salty but tasty and pork was tender and sweet. Someone ordered hot soba noodle with tempura and the waitress kindly pointed out that there was a lunch special that serves the same thing for the same price but includes avacado rolls. It took a bit of time for all the orders to arrive but everyone quickly devoured their meal. A nice and cozy place for lunch~
