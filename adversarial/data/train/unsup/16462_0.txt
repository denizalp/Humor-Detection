I was really excited for the tour, and in defense of the company I was told it was non-refundable. The night before the tour I lost my cell phone and slept in past the shuttle pick up at 8:45 AM. They waited for me for 15 minutes and tried to get in touch with me. I called them 20 minutes past the shuttle pick-up at 9:05, and confessed about losing my phone and tried pleading with them since I had paid $300.00 for myself and a friend. \n\nI asked three options to work with them; Can I take a cab to the launching point? Can I  reschedule the tour for tomorrow? and lastly of course, can I get a refund?  This surprising response I got was one containing profanities, and it was insulting and degrading. I was completely shocked by their unwillingness to work with me and their unprofessionalism. \n\nIt is in your best interest to find another kayaking company in the area.
