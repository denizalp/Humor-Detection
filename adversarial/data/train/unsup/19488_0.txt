Have to admit when I gots the craving for a cheap BUT good burger I head to in and out! Fast, Fresh and oh so satisfying. What I love about them is the menu and the prices stay consistent not like all the fast food joints! They also don't jump on the bandwagon to try and get all fancy Nancy with their ish! \n\nOn the menu for our meal tonite: 5\/5 \n2 Double Double Animal Style\n1 Double Double Add Pickles\n1 Plain Cheeseburger \n3 Fries\nRootbeer, Coke and Lemonade\n\nService: 5\/5\nFast and with a Smile\n\n...can't get any better!
