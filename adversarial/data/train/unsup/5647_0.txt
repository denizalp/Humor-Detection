OMG. When I die and go to heaven, I pray and hope that there's a Porchetta & Co up there because I don't think I could live without ever being able to eat Porchetta's again.\n\nI cannot even begin to describe how good this place is. And I don't even eat pork. The portions seemed a little small but that could be because it was so damn good, that I wanted another one... and another one... and another one. Oh, just put me in a coma already.\n\nThe restaurant itself is tiny and only has about 4 seats so it be best that you get your order to go but it's so good while it's still warm and crispy and oozing with juices. So if there's a spot for you to sit down, own that seat and don't leave until you're seeing stars and have to waddle out of there. Otherwise, as soon as you step foot outside, find an alley and devour your sandwich like an wild animal.\n\nThis will be my to-go spot for me in Toronto, which includes Burger's Priest and Guu. Good lord there's a lot of places to eat in Toronto.\n\nParking: Limited paid street parking\nPrice: $10 CASH ONLY\nWait: 5-10 mins after ordering
