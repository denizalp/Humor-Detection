As far as the bar itself: Locals who don't seem too keen on any strangers. You get the feeling that this is just another VFW or something with better decor and food (debatable...read on). \n\nThe food: Salty. You know how when you get a little toasty and you're hungry, you seem to LOOOOVE salt? I think they have whomever happens to be the drunkest at the bar when the first orders come in be the honorary line cook for the rest of the day. everything COULD be good but it turns out to be almost ok. If you're drinking, you probably won't care. If you're getting take-out and planning on being totally sober, you will be disappointed.
