I drive from the Far East side to come here and get my nails done by Kelley. My usual is an acrylic fill with gel polish, which is around $35 after tax. Prices are reasonable considering it's only an extra $10 for gel polish added to any service. Customer service is cool and I really only trust Kelley and Christy to do my nails. Both are super nice and talented. They do get busy thurs-sat, so try to go earlier In the week if you can.
