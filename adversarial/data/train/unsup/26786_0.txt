Upon moving into our new home we sought out potential landscape companies to put in our backyard. We found Living Waters on Houzz and scheduled a consultation. Mark and Christine came to our home and were very helpful in coming up with a design for our yard. The initial bid was more than we had expected but with additional conversations we were able to come to an agreement on our budget. They were great at suggesting ways to improve the design and as the project moved along we added several things. \n\nThe crew at Living Waters is top notch and making us happy was their main concern. They never had a problem with moving or adding plants when asked to give us the yard of our dreams. Each day the crew moved all of their tools to an area of the yard that would not cause us any trouble. \n\nThe finished product was absolutely off the charts better than the original design. They gave us more that what we expected. It was a pleasure to have them work  on our project. \n\nAlready have them scheduled for an additional project in our front yard!!!\n\nA definite MUST HIRE!!!
