mmmm. Pan Roast - seafood for me. Rice on the side! :) I get it as a \"5\" right in the middle of the spice level. \n\nTry the oyster shooter w\/ bloody mary mix. I dare you. mmm. so yummy. And wash it down with some beer. C'mon it's a 21 + place anyways. Enjoy the food.\n\nThe thing is everyone does things differently here. If you watch the chefs - some are taking his sweet a$$ed time (however, I heard his food tastes the best) and some would just burn yours (like mine, but still was delish!)\n\nI'm not sure if it's because they don't have enough room and stuff - or what. We were about 10 ppl behind, but yet still took us about 2.5 hours before getting seated. Doesn't matter what time you show up, because there is always someone in line and  waiting and have been waiting. We got there around 12:30 am, didn't sit down and order until 4am. However, as usual, the food was way worth it.
