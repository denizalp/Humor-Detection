What i liked about this hotel is firstly the staff and the management. I found the management very professional as well as the staff.\nThe room its self was recently updated which is a plus. \nOn top of that the price point  for the hotel was  Great!\n\nThe Cons of this property is the location. It is not in a really good neighborhood sadly. But it is something that the hotel can not change.
