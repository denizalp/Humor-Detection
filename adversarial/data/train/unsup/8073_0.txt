Came here to make some photocopies. They don't even do that. So why are they called Kinko's? False advertising.\n\nOne of the most popular sushi places in Eastern Cleveland. Definitely Americanized to a large degree, but not as shockingly overpriced as a lot of sushi places. I've had it as take out as part of a large group at a little get together a little while back, and it was good. We went here to have a sit down lunch a couple of months ago - since she is obsessed with sushi and I'm, well, tolerant of it at best - and there were no tables to sit at! The line was literally out the door, not just for sushi, but for the bubble tea at KFT (which Kenko shares the building with) that I wanted to get for us to share. She'd never tried KFT before.\n\nWith lines this long, the sushi must be even better than I remember. We didn't stay, and instead I took her for her first Hot Sauce Williams experience... five stars! Nevertheless, this is a very solid sushi spot, and try the Lemon Black Tea with Tapioca.\n\nThis review was not as Kenky as my reviews usually are.
