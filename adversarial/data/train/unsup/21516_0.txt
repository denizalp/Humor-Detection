I loved every part of my Lazy Dog experience! The atmosphere is great, the service is on point and the food is fast and tasty! What more can one ask for?\n\nTaylor and I came for our typical brunch date out of convenience before an Apple appointment but we will definitely be making a point to come back soon! \n\nI was impressed with the variety of the menu, the symbiosis and attentiveness from the service staff, and most importantly- every bit of food or drink was delicious.
