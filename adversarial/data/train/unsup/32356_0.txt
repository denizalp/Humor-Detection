Staff was friendly, location is excellent for the price we were able to get, went up for the women's world cup.\n\nParking is located below the hotel which is nice, a little expensive but not too bad.\n\nRooms were decent, very modern, nice LG tv's.\n\nThe bathrooms were a bit small where the toilet\/shower\/sink were extremely close together.\n\nCeiling was peeling a bit and a few touch ups in the room would have made the place much nicer.
