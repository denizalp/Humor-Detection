First time being back to El Chorro since the remodel a few years back and it has really opened up the outdoor seating areas and added some great views to the place.  The sticky buns are still spectacular. Our group had the cheese platter appetizer and it was delicious.  Salads were fine but nothing special.  Main dishes were generally OK but on the plain side.  The roast chicken was very bland.  The Beef Stroganoff was good but underwhelming.  The steaks were the best things ordered.  I general, just nothing special was had that made the meal memorable.  Had Blueberry Pie for desert and the theme of adequacy continued.  For the money and from past memories I was expecting more...maybe my expectations were too high.
