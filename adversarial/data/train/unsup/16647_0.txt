found this new buffet to be average at best.\n\nsure it's pretty clean....NOW, but it's new; just give it a few years and i'm sure it'll fall right into line with it's peers.\n\nthe food had way too many items designed to please the picky american 4 year old.  there was a high greasiness factor to many dishes, and despite what seemed at first glance to be a large selection, all of it was just  blah.\n\nThere are so many of these boofays popping up, that instead of seeing them as all the same, the differences - both subtle and glaring - will be all the more evident.\n\n101 is nowhere near the top of the list of chinese buffet choices in the valley, or even in the immediate area (unless maybe you are within walking distance, then maybe it's the best in the IMMEDIATE area!)
