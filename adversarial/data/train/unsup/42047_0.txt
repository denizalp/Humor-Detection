It was really disappointing! We thought there's finally a good Tapas restaurant on our side of town. Everything was either tasteless or distasteful including the sangria. I must say that the one redeeming entry on the menu was the chocolate covered ice cream for dessert and that was it. Nothing spectacular. Nothing even close to real Spanish food taste. Plus running out of a lot of commonly asked for entrees like salmon is not acceptable. Maybe if it is really something rare and exotic but salmon?
