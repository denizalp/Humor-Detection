Great place to get your drink on!  We were here for a private event but had a blast on the dance floor.  The appetizers and drinks were great.  Kudos to the bartenders for making the drinks fast.  I really love the lounge feel and the music was bumpin' the night we went.  Great place to hang if you're looking for something more intimate than XS or Tao.
