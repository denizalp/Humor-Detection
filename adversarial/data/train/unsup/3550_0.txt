I've had this spot bookmarked for years. I've always been intrigued on visiting this place. A wine bar with brushetta's? Haven't seen this type of concept back home before. We ordered a few pitchers of beer in this nice comfortable setting. They have indoor and outdoor seating. You order different types of brushetta's. We tried 4 different ones for $15. the priscuitto with the figs and marscapone. That was so good. The bacon with fresh mozzerealla was pretty on point too. The crispy of the bacon was perfect. I'd totally eat those again. \n\nRecommendation: Brushetta flights. Get the priscuitto with figs and mozzarella!
