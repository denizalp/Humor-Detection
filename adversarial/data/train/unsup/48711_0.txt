I saw Jennifer Houston for a Dermaplaning treatment. I was impressed with the salon, the atmosphere and Jennifer's knowledge and expertise. The service was performed perfectly and I wouldn't hesitate to refer her! It's obvious that she is a very skilled aesthetician, but it's her warm and friendly personality that really puts you at ease immediately.
