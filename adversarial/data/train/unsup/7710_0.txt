Awful.  I came here with an appointment to test drive a car.  The secratary asks me who my appointment is with.  I say, I'm not sure the guy's name, but it's through the Costco program, and I show her the paper I printed off.  She says, \"I can't figure that out.  Sorry, I need the name.\"  Well fine then, you just lost a sale.  Bye Bye!  Maybe Larry Miller should hire young energetic people to work for him, not fat old bags who are too lazy to look up appointments.
