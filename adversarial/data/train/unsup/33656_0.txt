10$ for a cashier's check. This is why I'm closing my account and going to a local credit union. My account qualified for free money orders and cashier's checks, but because it is the wrong type of checking account they wanted me to wait 20 minutes and talk to a banker. They should have just waived the fee, or changed my checking account to the one that has free cashier's checks without all the hassle of waiting inline to see a banker. I told them I wasn't happy they are charging me, especially if the other checking account they need to \"switch\" me over to is also a free account.
