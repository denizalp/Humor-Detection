We moved to Henderson in April and were shopping carpet weeks ahead of time. We got several quotes with one guy promising that \"no one could beat his pricing!\" well Travis did! Affordable Flooring came in $5000 under that quote with the most beautiful carpet they carried and they were even able to make our quick turn-around times. Travis and his wife were kind, gracious and such a pleasure to work with. I wish we had another home to carpet just so we could work with them again! I cannot say enough great things about this company. Use them, you will not regret it!
