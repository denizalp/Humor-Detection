Not ready for prime time yet. One night they were out of food, another they ran out of multiple types of beer, no visible heat lamps outside, massive fireplace that is not finished, corner booth taken up by employees and looked like a mini office, etc. The drinks were great and the food was so so. This place needs to tighten it up quick. It's an amazing location with an amazing concept, but the experience is underwhelming.
