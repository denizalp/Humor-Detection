Wow!! All i can say is this, \"WOW.\" I gotta say, I came here for the mandarin China food but stayed for the PIZZA.  I have been to a lot of great places for za' (not to brag) but I have been to Dominos, CiCi's, the Pizza Hut lunch buffet (only had the breadsticks) and Buffalo, New York.  I gotta say that this is some of the best spinnin' wheel you can get on this side of the Great Lakes.  Now don't expect to get all the fancy flavours you can find at Papa Johns because the Mandarin  only makes the CLASSICS (\"pepperoni and cheese is all i need\"- my deceased neighbour).  \n\nI was a little scared to the return to this location as it was only 7 years ago when Jenny McNicol stood me up for our date there.  The fear of being ridiculed again by AGNES THE WAITRESS was real but thankfully she's on maternity leave (her husband left her, i would have too because she's mean and takes pleasure in laughing at a 14 year old boy who is sitting alone and scarfing down dumplings while on the verge of tears).  \n\nI haven't spoken to Jenny since she started dating my arch-nemesis, LEATHER JACKET BRAD and now she thinks she's cooler than everybody.  Well thats okay, Jenny, I brought a new girl to the Mandarin.  Her name is Kasandra, sound familiar? Well if you're on Tinder maybe you've come across her, she's blonde and is my little dumpling (pet names already, so what?). \n\nI need to emphasis that this is a GREAT place for a first date.  Not only is the food awesome but you can break up the awkward tension by repeatedly going up to fill your plate at the buffet.  I really hope Kasandra wants to see me again, who knows maybe the Mandarin will become \"our place.\"  My only wish is that you could order the za' for takeout, thats probably the best way to get the bitter taste of Jenny McNicol out of your mouth.
