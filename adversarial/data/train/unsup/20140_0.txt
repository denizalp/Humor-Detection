I typically don't go to theatres to watch a lot of movies due to the fact that my back hurts after sitting in those chairs for a while. It's either I need to use someone as a pillow or I curl my legs on my seat. I'm a fairly short gal so when I sit in theatre chairs, my lower back doesn't go all the way to the back of the seat and my feet don't touch the ground ... so I endure a lot of uncomfortable moments during the 2-3 hour long movies. \n\nBut Galaxy solves all of my personal problems.\n\nFinally got to come Galaxy with a friend to watch Guardians of the Galaxy and it must have been the most comfortable experience I've had in a movie theatre. You get your own recliner seat and adjust it to your liking. It also props up your feet\/legs so mine don't have to dangle! No pain in my knees!\n\nYou can buy the tickets online and it's assigned seating. The costs of the tickets costs as much as any other theatre on regular days. You just have to pay a service fee when you order it online, which is no biggie when it's guaranteed, right?! And not some first come first serve thingymabobers. \n\nThey also have the powder seasoning for your popcorn! I haven't seen those available for free in a theatre since RAVE in Town Square. We didn't get any popcorn when we went though. Was too full from dinner :D but will definitely get some next time just so I can sprinkle some nacho cheese powder all over my popcorn like the good ol days! \n\n\n\nOverall, awesome experience. Definitely worth.
