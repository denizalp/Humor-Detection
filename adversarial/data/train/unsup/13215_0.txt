We made reservations for NYE and we ordered the set menu of 8 courses set by Chef John Chien Lee.\n\nFirst course-Scallop & Caviar Modern Sashimi: Hokkaido Scallp, Petrossian Caviar, Yuzu Foam.\nExcellent! Light, citrus, elegant. It was so good to start off. Wish the serving was bigger by just one more scallop, it was that good.\n\nSecond course-Salmon Tartare: Scottish Salmon, Ginger Miso, Taro Chip\nIncredible! Our favorite of the night, the sauce put it over the top. Probably our favorite of the night.\n\nThird course- Oyster Trio: Kumamoto Oyster, Yama Imo Dashi, Soho Salsa, Ponzu Gelee\nVery good, could taste the different flavors across 3 fresh oysters in a half shell. The house oyster was very tasty.\n\nFourth Course-Ginger Sweetbreads: Crispy Veal Sweetbreads, Sweet Ginger Scallion Sauce, Fuji Apples, Baby Radish\nOne of my favorites, well seasoned. The sauce put it over the top as a winner. The sweetbreads nicely fried, the sauce was so good!\n\nFifth Course-Citrus & Fennel Toothfish: Chilean Seabass, Blood Orange Vinaigrette, Pear Tomato, Mizuna.\nVery good! The fish melts in your mouth, the sauce delicious and the fennel adds a dash of freshness.\n\nSixth Course-Angus 300 Petite Tenderloin: Angus 300 Tenderloin, Fole Fried Rice, Bacon Wrapped Enoki Mushroom, Soho Steak Sauce\nAlmost perfect! Great piece of beef, excellent sauce, flavorful rice but too much rice, about half the size of the rice would have been perfect. I can see how this might be OK as an entree but for a tasting there was too much rice.\n\nSeventh Course-Cher's Nigiri Sushi: Tai, Kanapachi, Maguro, Aji, Ebi\nGood sushi, the rice was too much after the previous dish. Would have been perfect just as a small serving of sashimi. Still good!\n\nEighth course-Banana cake, Peanut Buter Mousse, Valrhona Chocolate Pearls, Banana Ice Cream, Bacon Chips.\nZING! Such a delicious and well balanced dessert! Moist cake, smooth peanut butter mouses, excellent banana ice cream and perfectly crispy bacon bits. Great way to finish off the tasting menu.\n\nOverall, I'm a big fan, we had a great culinary experience. We'll definitely return here again for some of the chef's special dishes. Nice atmosphere, I think the dance music could have been replaced with something else to create a more elegant atmosphere but there were lots of people just getting rolls and drinks that night on NYE so I guess it fit. The staff is excellent and very helpful.
