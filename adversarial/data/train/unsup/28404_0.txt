It's been over 10 years since either my hubby or I have stepped foot inside a Red Lobster. On this day, I was craving their cheesy bread and the hubby wanted Maine Lobster. We bellied up at the bar and our waitress Sherry was AMAZING!!\nShe gave us her recommendations for dinner and I am so happy we took it. The Maine Lobster was cooked perfectly and my hubby was good. I had the ceasar salad and the Bar Harbor Bake. The food was great and we where very surprised on why we haven't come to Red Lobster a long time ago. We will definitely come back, but definitely request Sherry to be our server. She goes above and beyond to give you an amazing dining experience with a smile.\n\nThank you Red Lobster and a big thank you to Sherry.
