Had the Mac and cheese burger and the pulled pork sandwich. Both were great!  Also tried the cajun sandwich. Don't remember what it was called. It was a little too spicy for my taste, but that's what it was supposed to be, so I can't knock it.  Everything was what I expected it to be, but it was just a little heavy on the grease. You could see the paper underneath the sandwiches soaked through with it.  Had an hour long wait to get inside. It was packed and loud but that added to the fun atmosphere. Waitress was great and very attentive.
