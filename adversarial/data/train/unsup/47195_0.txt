I really have nothing bad to say about this theater.  I've been here a few times and it's fine.  The seats were a little uncomfortable for someone as short as I am, but everyone over 5'5 shouldn't have an issue with their feet not touching the ground.\n\nAgain, food is standard.  Popcorn, Candy, Soda, etc.  All the usual stuff.\n\nDecor is typical movie theater.  They keep this place fairly clean, including the bathrooms.  Can't say that about all theaters I've been to!\n\nMore importantly, the sound and picture quality is good.  When you're paying over $10 per ticket, you want to at least have a good visual experience!  Saw Star Wars here the other day and it was awesome.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with a regular movie theater like the Regal Phillips Place.  I've been a few times and I'll be back.  It's clean, the picture quality is good and they have snacks.  That pretty much checks all the boxes for me.
