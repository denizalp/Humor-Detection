We came here with a groupon, not really knowing what to expect with the food.  We were not expecting much, but were very impressed by the dishes.  We started with an order of wings.  Very unique way of serving these, as the wing had both the drumette and the wingette left attached as one piece.  They were crisp and just the right level of spice.  We then had a burger and a buffalo chicken sandwich.  Both were great options.  We had the deviled egg salad and the brussel sprout slaw.  Unique and tasty sides.  We will definitely come back to watch a game sometime, as the food is much better than the typical bar.
