The McKenna team has been managing my property for nearly three years. It's been a very positive experience. Before renting my place out, Jenni was very patient in answering all the questions my wife and I had. Don't worry, there are no dumb questions. So make a list of all your concerns and Jenni & team will assist.\n\nSince managing my place, the Mckenna team has been able to find great tenants. Rent is sent timely via direct deposit. In addition, Jenni's team is available (via phone or email) to assist with issues that may arise.\n\nPlease consider the McKenna team if you need property management in the Las Vegas Valley.
