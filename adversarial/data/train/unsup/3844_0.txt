Well, all the reviews here sum it up pretty nicely. I really wanted to do my tenth review on a special place, :D. So, Mystic Muffin it is! ;-) \n\nCrispy-on-the-outside-but-soft-inside-just-baked Apple Cake: Check.\nHealthy, non-greasy, totally yummy and sturdy (didn't fall apart) Falafel: Check.\nElias' and Wonita's gracious hospitality (warm smiles and easy conversation): Check. Check! Check!!\n\nWonita even gave my friend a student discount on her chick pea salad ($7 to $6). It was fantastic. \n\nThank you, Community of Yelp!\n\np.s. I'm totally gonna get thur T-Shirt when I'm going somewhere!
