I really like this place! Great happy hour specials from 11am-6pm EVERY DAY, and open later than most places in Ahwatukee. Also a little classier than some of the other nearby options. Very cute decor and relaxing atmosphere. Great for a date night or girls' night out, but I've seen families with young children there, too. \nI've not yet tried any of the entrees, but I liked the appetizers and salads that I've tried quite a bit. The kale salad and diver scallops are to die for. The bruschettas are ok - the apple pecan and brie is a little bland but the fig jam is very good. The green chile hummus is also delicious.\nThe service was prompt and friendly. We've never had to wait to be seated.\nI really hope this place sticks around for a long time!
