(1.75 stars) Continental uses Terminal 2 of PHX, which is smaller, older and a bit more worn than Terminals 3 or 4.  The dining spots are fewer, but TSA Security was a breeze on late afternoon Thursday; they were waiting for me.  Security here claims to not have all of the newest equipment, and as a result, they screen very carefully.  It has been at least two years since I've been asked to have the quart-sized ziplock bag of liquids removed from my carry-on bag.  Waiting areas are large and not well-lit.  Travel between terminals requires a shuttle bus, and they're somewhat slow.  This is one of the worst places to have connecting flights with mismatched airlines as the newer terminals are huge, and the older ones are poorly connected.  Car rental requires a shuttle bus to a central facility; allow at least 15 minutes.  All told, PHX is neither bad nor impressive.
