I come to the UNLV bookstore every semester to buy books. I don't want to buy books, yet there I am... I can't fault the bookstore, though, for gouging my with prices when they're only slightly more expensive than Rebel Books across the street. \n\nI sometimes come here when I have free time to buy UNLV stuff. Sweaters, shirts, coffee mugs, pens... all that. Plus, I sometimes come here when I realize that I've left my calculator at home and need one for a test that's coming up in eight minutes. Sure, I'll pay $13 for something that's $6 at Target, but I have a test in eight minutes!\n\nAll in all, this place is cool. They also sell other books in their Barnes-subsidized section, so that's cool. So you can get a copy of Pride and Prejudice for $9 to go along with your $150 statistics book.
