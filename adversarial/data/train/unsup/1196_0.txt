The food here is really only 3 stars.  It's okay but not nearly as good as I expected from such a hyped place.  I swear NoPho people act like this is the greatest addition since Arrowhead.  I was expecting a Matt's-like meal and I got some of the lamest \"texas french toast\" I've ever seen.  It wasn't bad tasting by any means but I've had better french toast sticks from Burger King.\n\nWhat makes it a 4-star experience is the service.  Not only do they run through tables at a breakneck pace but they also have attentive and helpful servers who can carry 12 plates on each arm.  These octopus servers at least gave me something to watch after I finished my child-sized french toast.  \n\nI might go back and try something more greasy-spoon but for now, I'd rather just go to the Black Bear Diner down the road.
