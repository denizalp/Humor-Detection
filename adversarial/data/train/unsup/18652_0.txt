In Madison I took up running.  Mainly because if I didn't, I would weigh at least double my current weight.  I ate too much cheese (fried cheese curds I miss you, and fresh cheese curds too), too many butter burgers (I love you Culvers), brats, and of course TOO MUCH FROZEN CUSTARD.  For those of you who have somehow missed the amazing delight that is frozen custard, I feel so sorry for you.  Your life is not complete.    \n\nOn my way home from work, I passed Michael's each day, and always looked with affection.  Most days I checked the website to see what the flavors were, so I knew if I would be pulling in or driving past.  Flavors of the day ranged from Doubleberry, Elephant Trax, Bavarian Thin Mint, Death by Chocolate, Peppermint, Pumpkin, Chocolate & Peanut Butter...the list goes on and on.  Regular flavors are great too.  Frozen Custard is just plain better than any ice cream I have ever had.  It's creamier, thicker, smoother.  \n\nAt first I thought Michael's was really only about the custard, but then I tried a burger.  It was greasy, juicy, yummy, just how I like them.  And of course, you MUST get the Cherry Soda.  It's SO good.  Go here.  It's so worth a long run or many hours at the gym.
