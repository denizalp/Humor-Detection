This is one of my favorite dining experiences ever.... \n\n1. The food is amazing: Caesar Salad is made at your table from scratch, Steak is perfectly done, the twice baked potato is a must\n2. Love love love the atmosphere\n3. Stiff drinks and good wine list\n\nI can't understand why people poo poo this anything below 4 stars... and the reviews that complain about the servers... nonsense... old school gentlemen in tuxes who are no-nonsense.  I think others who don't dig it are used to the steak houses in the hotels that are more modern decor and such... pussies
