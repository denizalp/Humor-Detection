Terrible experience, the girl who was recommended by the receptionist asked me to tell her what I want.  It's only been 3-4 weeks since my last cut so I said just a trim.  She wanted to know if my sides were faded or blended I told her I didn't know the difference and she basically rolled her eyes.  Then she decided to completely ignore everything we talked about and cut my how she wanted basically shaving the sides of my head.  This place is a joke.  I don't mind paying $60 for a haircut but this was a $9 cut from cost cutters.  Beyond pissed off.
