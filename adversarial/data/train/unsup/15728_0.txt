The guy charged me $30 only to tell me afterward that my car didn't pass because the check engine light was on. Thanks jerk, you could have told me that before you charged me the $30! Then I might have come back to you guys in the future, instead I'll go elsewhere and tell all my friends and family to go elsewhere too! A little kindness could have gone a long way in my book.
