We went on a Friday night  and it's just the vibe that's there too many hipsters just not my scene anymore the music was some hipster crap but it's cool I was just in a bad mood cause I remember you guys being so fun and all the games were on fire but now everyone just standing around talking about politics and what not , music should be poppin this place is so big no reason to only have one big area with only one sound going on,
