First and last time here. Where do I begin?\nOnly ordered 3 items and they keep making mistakes. It wasn't even busy, just another table with 2 people and us (also 2 people).\n\n1. Took them 3 tries to get my pho right. Specifically asked for no onions and she brought it out twice with onions. \n2. Charged me $2 for having my rare beef (tai) separate\n3. Completely forgot about my spring rolls\n\nSo total for 2 bowls of regular pho that should have been $8.50 each totaled $23 something. \nWho charge for having rare beef on separate plate???\n\nThe pho wasn't even that good. It was okay only.\nI do NOT recommend this place. How they get 4 stars is beyond me. Must be their friends and family putting on these good reviews.
