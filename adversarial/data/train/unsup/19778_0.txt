Beers [Imports & Local non-commercial Craft] seem to be limited.\nFor Saturday afternoon, Vintage shelves seem to be understocked.\nPossibly less selection, possibly in-middle of re-stock. Possibly.\n\nI wonder if they notice the Louis XIII missing from their display...\nThe casing looks nice but \"something\" seems to be missing.\nThe Wine aisles seem compact. Limited Asian products. 2.5'd\n\nPlentiful of Moretti Birra & Peroni Nastro Azzuro in stock. \nMiddle of the Pack LCBO. Mediocre. Ciao.
