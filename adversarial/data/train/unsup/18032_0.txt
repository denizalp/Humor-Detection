When I saw Julien F's review for St Edouard I bookmarked it and knew I'd be there within the week. It gives me glee to see new good places opening up around the neighborhood, up here on the wrong side of the tracks, and the good vibes in this cozy dim new bar didn't disappoint my hopeful heart at all. \n\nI walked in after 10:30pm on a Monday and there were several small goodlookin groups of young, friendly French men around the bar which stretches square in the middle of the room. The big brown booths and more romantic little corner tables were mostly empty and my date hadn't arrived yet so I hesitated for a second in the door frame, long enough for a friendly Frenchman named Francis to make me welcome with his group, crack me up and get me seated at the bar in perfect franglais. When my charming companion did arrive the lovely waitress made us laugh in franglais too. The joyful double embrace of language is one of my favourite things about this town these days, and always, and especially when you're out late drinking pints on a school night. \n\nThe pints were $7.50 - this is kinda over priced for the neighborhood I think. But the good conversation, plus the Polaroids and vintage cameras and lamps and framed intimate body parts on the way to the bathroom all made me smile and not mind it. \n\nWill be back gladly and soon!
