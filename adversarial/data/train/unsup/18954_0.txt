This review is for the outdoor bar only.\n\nHeading out of the New York New York Hotel feeling thirsty, my husband decided to stop and buy a drink. There was only one couple ahead of us, but the wait to order was kind of long for what seemed like an off-peak hour. (it was about 3:15 p.m. with no crowd). When it finally came time to order, the bartender ignored us to go and help his partner on the other side of the bar, which also wasn't busy. After he cleared her side, only then did he proceed to serve us. \n\nEverything was fine even with the longer than expected wait time until he handed the receipt. My husband had paid for his beer with his card because he didn't have cash on him and I had gotten distracted and ventured off nearby. As my husband signed his signature, the bartender very rudely and rather loudly said in his most obnoxiously sarcastic voice, \"thanks a lot; I appreciate it!\" \n\nThe bartender had leaned over to sneak a peek at the tip and saw that my husband had put $0.00 What he didn't know was that we prefer tips to be paid out in cash and I was holding it at the time. My husband was planning on asking me for the money, but needless to say, I refused to give a tip for such horrible service, especially after that bartender's shameful display of entitlement!
