There is a reason there aren't too many new reviews on this place. I don't know what this place was like in the past but as of April 2017 this is one of the worst bars I have ever been to.  \n\nI get inside, smells, only about 12 people so not crowded by any means. I sit down and make eye contact with the bartender, she glosses over me and strikes conversation with the regulars, 6 minutes later, she barks at me, \"THIS ISN'T A HANGOUT, ARE YOU DRINKING SOMETHING?\" What a heck of a greeting finally..............way to set the tone. I got a beer reluctantly and I will never be back, Neither should you. There is just too many GOOD bars to go to. You know, ones where the staff actually wants your patronage. \n\nFinal Score: 2 Toothless Call girls. Yelper Beware.
