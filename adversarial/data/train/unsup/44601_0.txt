Very small cinema located in the Church & Wellesley neighborhood Toronto. Airing the latest arthouse\/independent films and sometimes mainstream Hollywood (and Bollywood) films, the small size of the theater adds to its overall charm as it is not a hustle & bustle place like bigger cinema chains such as AMC. Conviently located close to the College Subway Station, the cinema is popular with many Ryerson and University of Toronto students, as well as people residing in the neighboring Village.
