After one big night of drinking, burgers sounded kinda good. So I when grind at \"I Love Burgers.\" Brah, the burgers broke the mouth. Kinda pricey but not bad. I woulda rated this place a 4 or maybe 3.5 on the burgers alone. Faka was mean! But extra points was cuz, my server Jenny was on point. She can tell we were hungry already and was right there when we was ready to order. Plus, kinda nice to be greeted with a friendly smile once you stay in your seats. So... To make a long story short, I went for burgers, would go back for service by Jenny. And, once again, FAKA MEAN!
