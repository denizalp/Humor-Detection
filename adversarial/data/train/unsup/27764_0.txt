Very good walk in.  I've been coming here for the last 4yrs or so.  It is a busy walk in, but they are pretty quick getting patients in to get looked at.  They have 2-3 doctors inside usually. They can do ECG\/EKG onsite, can swab for strep throat, and alot more. X-rays can be done upstairs and results sent straight to their monitors.  Blood work can be done across the hall.\n\nStaff is friendly, and efficient.\nLots of seating. Lots of parking in front of building.\n\nAs i said, sometimes it gets really busy at times. So the wait is longer.\n\nGood hours, they are open on days you don't expect them to be.. like New years day (i think, it was one of the holidays)\n\nTip - don't go there at closing time, they cut off walk ins about an hour before closing.
