Agreed with the average rating - Sweet Jesus is all about the Instagram photo. Incredibly expensive for soft serve with a few toppings. Very sweet. The soft serve ice cream alone was good but I have a hard time justifying spending nearly $10 for an ice cream. \n\nGot a large ice cream and shared with 3 people, and we couldn't finish it - was just too rich. Customer service was okay - felt as though the person serving us was getting a bit impatient as my friends and I were deciding what to order.
