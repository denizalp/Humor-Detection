I was really impressed by Fred's.  We checked out their happy hour on Friday night and it was great!  The decor is very Frank Lloyd Wright, so loved it!  The service was good and the food\/drink was great as well.  We shared the meatball sliders, risotto balls, pommes frites and a prosciutto pizza - yum!
