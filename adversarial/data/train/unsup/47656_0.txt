they didnt accept my dental insurance but they still charged me for x-rays\ni cant use!! shady practices & people!!\n\nwent here because they were highly rated. they took x-rays did the 360 degree x-ray also. but in the end of the consultation they said there was still a problem with my insurance.\n\nand that a new appointment will be available as soon as the insurance go in,got a email saying from the receptionist a week later that \"sadly we cant accept my insurance \nand emailed the x-rays that no one accepts because its not from them and i will need to pay again from a different dentist. \n$250 outta pocket that the insurance could have covered! \nkarma on these people.\n****update \nhad the owner of the business make contact. she explained that they needed to charge me, but gave\nme absolutely no resolve as far as to paying me back or anything for compensation over my awful service experience. \nwould not recommend this business to anyone!
