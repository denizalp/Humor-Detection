I'm a huge uni fan so when I saw pictures of the special dishes with uni here, I HAD to find my way here! To give you an idea of how badly my friend and I wanted to come here during our stay in Vegas, we did a 1-day car rental just to drive here to eat. (We are very serious about our food adventures!)\n\nOur waitress, Lolo, is an absolute sweetheart. She totally understands the importance of our camera eating first ;). When she brought out the scallop with uni dish, the uni slid off the scallop while she was putting the plate down. Without us even asking her to, she immediately brought it back to the kitchen so the chef can put the uni back on top of the scallop so we can take our picture.\n\nWe came on a Wednesday night around 9:30pm, so we can do the late happy hour in addition to the special dishes. We ordered:\n\nUni Bites\nTruffle Bone Marrow\nUni Scallop\nShigoku Oysters\nUni Chawanmushi\nTuna Lotus Chip (HH)\nSalmon Tacos (HH)\n\nMy favorite was the uni chawanmushi. The seafood broth with steamed egg custard was such a perfect, delicate balance. I think I would've liked the scallop with uni better if it was a raw scallop. I personally don't like cooked or seared scallops.\n\nEverything we tried was delicious and Japaneiro definitely met and went beyond our expectations. Just when we thought things couldn't get any better, the chef brought out an extra dish for us on the house!! He found out we came all the way from NY and rented a car just to eat here. He gave us black cod with foie gras in a lettuce wrap! And oh my god, it was so good. He also added caviar onto the oysters for us. (Thank you!!! ^__^)\n\nThis meal was definitely on the pricier side, considering we came here for more of a \"snack.\" We already had dinner around 6pm and came here just to try the special dishes. Between four people, we each paid around $40 after tip\/tax.
