As you walk up and down Aria you will get stopped by promoters everywhere to give you those little passes to get in for free.\n\nI actually got stopped by one girl to get my name on the guest list (up to 4 people) but the drop off was the opposite end of where I needed to be so I ended up not putting my name on the list.\n\nHowever, I did end up going to Haze in order to try to get in and see Far*East Movement.\n\nI got there at around 11 and I believe we got in at 12 or 12:30.\n\nThe set up of Haze is really nice. Spacious, the bar is clear away from the dance floor and it wasn't too crowded when I was there. I ended up getting a spot right in front of the dance floor. \n\nHaving gone for the sole purpose of seeing FM perform, it was a great experience. I even got to go in the back and kick it with the guys for a while.
