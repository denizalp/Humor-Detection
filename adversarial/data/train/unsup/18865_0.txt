One star for the price. Cheap pizza that has no flavor and no pizza sauce. If you want a good, cheap pizza, go to Little Caesars and pay the extra $1 plus tax. Only reason I have gone back 4 times was to see if this place was consistently bad before I wrote a review. It is bad. I've even tried a different store. I will never go back again and I would never recommend unless a person is starving and can't afford the extra dollar at another pizza place or go to McDonald's and order off the dollar menu.
