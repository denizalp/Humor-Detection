We came in on Memorial Day and took advantage of the happy hour taco menu - the skirt steak and braised pork with pineapple tacos were super tasty and a decent size.  We started with the street corn queso and ate it all up...it was really good!  The patio is great and pretty large, the service was friendly and the food was good.  We had a few issues with our order, but they rebounded and made it right.
