We recently adopted a husky from THS and they have been nothing but wonderful the entire time. I would recomend to anyone that they adopt a animal from here.\n\nWe live in the area so had been in a couple times to look at the animals, it's typically pretty busy, which is a good thing. Originally when we enquired about adopting the husky they said it probably wasnt a good idea for us as we were first time owners, and she would need a little extra attention and care. They want to set their animals up for wins, and dont want unpleasant experiences for the new owners or the animals. We spoke to them a little more and with some training and additional information they were happy to have us adopt the little husky.\n\nWe take her for training lessons at the THS once a week, a portion of the cost goes back to THS as a donation too. The staff are all very pleasant and kind people. Adopting from THS has been a very rewarding experience for us and the new wolf. #wolfpack.\n\nWhen you adopt from them they get you all set up for the next little while and they are always there to help should you have any questions. Very comforting especially for new wolf parents.
