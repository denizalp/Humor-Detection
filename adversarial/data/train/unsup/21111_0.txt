Having hit up three other auto parts stores yesterday to compare them to each other, Pep Boys is leaps and bounds ahead of the others. Bigger selection with more variety plus the repair shop. All the lubricants and cleaning chemicals you can need. Rims, accessories, oil and filters, batteries, lamps, windshield wipers, tools, paints and more.\n\nService was great. I'll stick to Pep Boys going forward.
