If you are snotty, you would like Zinc\nIf you like high prices, you would like Zinc\nIf you like lousy onion soup, you would like Zinc\nIf you like snotty service, you would like Zinc\nIf you like waiters with an attitude, you would like zinc\n\nDrive a little further south, and go to \"Metro Brasserie\" - it will be well worth the extra time - and you won't regret it - or even better yet, go to France - they are even that rude there.\n\nThis negative review is a result of visiting Zinc on several occasions, over an extended period of time - only to find out that the service was still as bad or even worsened. Sorry, but until the restaurant improves quality across the board, and attitude drops - I am unable to recommend this restaurant at this time.
