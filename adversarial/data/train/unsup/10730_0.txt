I was going to try this restaurant when it was the Tverskaya on West Flamingo.  Then that place closed and I lost them for a while.  This has been a bookmark for quite sometime.  After a play at UNLV, I went here for an early dinner to try their Russian fare.\n\nThere were two customers when I arrived and when they left, I was the sole diner.  I had looked over the menu at home so I had some idea of what I'd order.\n\nI got a small bowl of borsch to start and the katleti with chicken for the main course.  I finished the meal with a piece of Napoleon cake.\n\nThe server, Ludmila, brought my iced tea as I looked at the menu.  When she brought the borsch, she asked if I wanted bread and I answered just one piece.  She brought me a single roll which was just perfect.  The borsch is made with beet root and there were cubes of potato and small carrots in the soup.  It was quite hot and it tasted very good.  Katleti comes either in beef or chicken.  I got chicken.  It's ground chicken formed into a cutlet shape and fried.  The chicken was seasoned nicely and the meat was very juicy.  With the dish, there were two small scoops of lukewarm mashed potatoes and some sliced cucumber and tomato.\n\nI was disappointed when I ordered dessert because some reviews say the honey cake is a must get.  They didn't have that.  I don't know if it's gone although it's still on the menu.\n\nI'd like to go back and try something different.  It was a nice change from my regular fare.
