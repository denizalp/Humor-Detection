I purchased my bed at this location just over 1 year ago. The sales guy seemed nice, we tried a bunch of beds, he wasn't pushing me in any expensive direction, and he guaranteed delivery the same day. I paid $800 for a double bed and box spring. \n\nOne year later and I'm ordering a new bed from someplace else. This is the worst mattress I've ever slept on. I'm not a particularly picky sleeper - even my college dorm mattress was fine. I am sensitive to drooping mattresses and this one felt sunken almost one month out of the gate and after one year I can't take it anymore.  Take a look at any mattress warranty and you'll see that up to 2 INCHES of drooping is considered normal and does not warrant replacement or compensation. Rad. \n\nMattress purchasing is so insanely subjective that I wouldn't dissuade you from shopping at Bedmart; I'm sure someone else could find a bed they love and use for years there.  My own experience is that I wasted $800 with no recourse.
