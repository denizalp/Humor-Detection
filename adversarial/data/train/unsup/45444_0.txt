I was very surprised at how helpful these guys were.  First, they were open on Sunday morning and helped me do basic troubleshooting on my AC unit.  When I returned with my bad motor Eddie helped me get the fan off the shaft and showed me everything that I needed to know to replace the motor with a new cap.  The project was a complete success and I have cold air again.  Thank you very much and keep up the great job.
