I've gone here for a while, but the dentist just keeps getting more creepy. The last one was my last straw and have not gone back. He is very socially awkward and needs to think before he tries to make small talk. He once asked me if I killed my parents, because they were both deceased and then on my last visit was singing to me a song that he was making up where he was joking about the fact that I had to have surgery for a broken bone and be on intravenous antibiotics for two months. Perhaps they have another dentist besides Dr. Cook. The dental assistant Bart is very friendly and wish he was the dentist. The only way I'd recommend this place is if you are deaf.
