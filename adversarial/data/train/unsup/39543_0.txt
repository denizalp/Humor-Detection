I like this place. It's a great space, with huge mirrors! It's in a cool location. Granted, I live around the corner, but if I ever move, I'm driving here to get my hair cut. \n\nYoki does an excellent job. She's cut my hair four times now, and it continues to grow out perfectly. I've never had a haircut that I've liked better... and it continues to improve over time. A very rare skill set!
