Jazz was pretty good. Scene was definitely interesting. Food was not amazing but not terribly overpriced either. The $5 cover was added to our bill which we found convenient. Atmosphere is really chill at this spot. Had a good time but not sure that i would go back. Heard this place was a much livelier spot when it was the old Biddles. Perhaps it's becoming a bit dated?
