We came here for happy hour and had hoped to get a tasty per dinner snack and a drink or two. We got the bacon wrapped figs, tri tip sliders, a glass of wine and two beers for about $30. Not bad price wise. \n\nThe food however left a lot to be desired, mainly I wish it had been less ridiculously salty. I ended up feeling a bit sick afterwards until I had about a liter of water. \n\nThe kicker though was that 3 times throughout our short meal someone opened the kitchen door and there was an overwhelming smell of dirty bong water. It was not a smell I want to associate with a meal. \n\nMediocre food, good service, bad smells.
