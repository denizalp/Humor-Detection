Echoing the sentiments of my fellow Yelpers, Echo & Rig deserves all the praise its been getting lately, and no, none of these reviews are rigged!(At least I don't think they are!)\n\nArriving a bit early, I perused the butcher shop and deli sections while sipping on some Ballast Point Pale Ale that a representative was passing out to guests. When everyone was present, we were directed upstairs to the main dining room and brought to our table.\n\n I liked the atmosphere almost instantly-from the beautiful chandelier to the hustle and bustle of the open kitchen, the nice patio dining area, and every service staff member that we came in contact with was not only pleasant and welcoming, but everyone had smiles on their faces! A simple smile does wonders to add to your overall dining experience, and it most certainly did for our party of four throughout the evening.\n\nOur server Nicholas did a fantastic job from beginning to end, answering any questions regarding any selection on the menu, highlighting popular menu items, and even suggesting his personal favorites. We followed Nicholas' lead and shared a couple of appetizers family style, and selected our own entrees and a couple of side dishes (which we shared as well because we're family like that...;)\n\nWe started with the Bone Marrow Carne Asada, Portobello Fries with Basil Aioli, and the Grilled Octopus with Green Olives and Gigante Beans. Each dish had its own distinct flavor and was gone in no time! I'm no Carniwhore(more of a Sushitarian...:p) but when I'm in the mood for bovine, my preferred piece of meat is the very underrated Hanger(not Hangar!) Steak, medium rare of course. I do agree with Norm however that I don't like my meat cut for me...I'll do it myself thank you! For those of you who need more meat in your life, ask your server to bring over the bone-in  butchers cut tray.( I believe the Tomahawk steaks were going for $2.45\/ounce) My Hanger Steak was perfectly pink in each bite. Our table also shared the Kale and Mashed Potatoes. Wifey's Lamb Chops and Regina's Trenne Pasta were also just as delicious!\n\nFor dessert, our table shared both the Turtle Sundae and the Berry Shortcake Sundae. Both sundaes were good, but our table preferred the Turtle one a bit better! Overall, a great first visit and most certainly not the last! I can't wait to return for brunch!  Oh, No corkage fee too! BONUS!!!!  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  5\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(14\/365) \" A Great Reason to Come to Tivoli Village\"
