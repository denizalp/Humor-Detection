I am writing this review from the restaurant. Why, may you ask am I writing this from the restaurant and not ... Oh... Let's say eating or perhaps drinking? Well we have been sitting here for one hour (not an exaggeration - it's a Thursday. We got here at 7:45. It is now 8:48). Our appetizer has now arrived as well as my daughter's Mac and cheese, my husband's grilled cheese and a random pizza \"on the house\". It's been an hour. \n\nThe appetizer we ordered is the Mac and cheese bites which are not bad. The cheese and bacon sauce is pretty good and really delish if you dip your sandwich.\n\n(Btw, 8:56 and the manager just came over. He apologized profusely and said he was embarrassed and offered to comp our meal. 3 of us still don't have a meal. The manager just came back to ask what we ordered)\n\nMy daughter really loves her Mac and cheese which looks pretty delicious.\n\nI ordered the traditional iced tea which is really good and has a strong tea flavor. I like it a lot. I've also had a lot of it. :)\n\nIt's 9:03.\n\nMy husband is now taking my daughter home to put her to bed. She's 3.\n\n9:08! My food is here! My friend's food is here! My mother-in-law's food is not.\n\nOk. Now we have our food. MIL has pizza Bianca. She likes it and says that you can really taste the different cheeses. There's arugula on it which gives the pizza bite and adds some delicious flavor. \n\nBoth my friend and I ordered cheeseburgers . They were flavorful, but the kitchen put the whole burger under the broiler and that burned the top of bun and made the bun strangely greasy. I also thought that the patty was a bit thin which made it somewhat dry. Flavorful, but a bit dry.\n\nNow, we also ordered a bread pudding to go when we ordered almost 2 hours ago, but I think we're going to just let it go. \n\nFood is a 2\nExperience is a 0 but it's a cute place so it's a 1\nAnd so it's a 1 and a half, but the manager asked us to come back and try it again and I will give it the benefit of the doubt, so it's a 2.
