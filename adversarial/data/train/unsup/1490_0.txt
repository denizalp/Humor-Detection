I'm gonna keep this short:\n\nThe service at Red 8 is amazing - 5 stars for all of the friendly people who work there! Other than that, though, Red 8 is basically like a fancier P.F. Chang's...which, in turn, is a fancier Panda Express. \n \nThis place is worth checking out only if all of the following apply:\n1) You're staying at the Wynn.\n2) You're reeeeally craving Asian food. Like, really.\n3) You don't mind paying well over $10 for noodles.
