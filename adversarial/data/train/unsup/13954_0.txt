I long ago retired from writing Yelp reviews because I figured, \"Why should I just DONATE my amazing writing\/reviewing talents to Yelp, helping them make millions of dollars off my endorsements?\"\n\nI still feel the same way, but every once in a while I come across an experience that calls me back into the Yelp game. This was one.\n\nHad Rolling Smoke last night for the first time.\nIt was the best.\nNo seriously, I think it was the best I've ever had.\n(I'm writing this at 5am so you know it's real)\n\nI had the 4 meat combo: chopped brisket, burnt ends brisket (OMG), chicken, and beef ribs. I paid extra to have the burnt ends and beef ribs and it might be the best decision of my adult life.\n\nDavid at the front is super engaging and welcoming. I assumed he was the owner, he made us that comfortable.\n\nATTENTION ROLLIN SMOKE OWNER\/OWNERS\/OWNERSHIP GROUP\nMake this dude an owner or something. Sign him up to a long-term contract or just give him lots of money and make him promise not to leave.\n\nThat's about all. It is 5 in the morning and I have a fridge full of leftover bbq and it's not going to eat itself.\n\nThank God.
