After traveling from Memphis to Vegas we decided to grab a bite to eat. The manager on duty told us the cook was struggling and was not able to serve the 12 of us in a timely manner. There was two other customers in the restaurant. It was 3AM!! Needless to say we left and went to Denny's the next exit down. I've never known a restaurant to turn down business. I wish I could give them ZERO stars.
