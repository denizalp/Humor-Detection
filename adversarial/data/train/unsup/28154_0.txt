Cravings.....good old cravings. \n\nMy darling and I hopped on Yelp to find some Indian food and we stumbled across Marigold Maison in Paradise Valley. Jumped in our car and headed their way.\n\nRestaurant is very clean, first thing my husband and I noticed. We were seated right away, not a lot of people were in the restaurant when we got there but by the time our meal was sent to our table every single table was occupied. It got BUSY and I know why, their food is AMAZING!\n\nI ordered the chicken Tikka Marsala and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Chicken was so tender, basmati rice was cooked to perfection. We also ordered 2 orders of garlic naan, be-careful, they are ADDICTING!\n\nMy husband ordered the lamb chops and it was soooo tender an cooked perfectly. Like butter in your mouth, it just melted.\n\nWe will be back! Customer service was amazing, food was UNREAL and it was a perfect dinner out.\n\n**Management** The only thing I noticed, despite a clean restaurant which is a plus in my book - have whoever cleans the tables check the chairs, there were crumbs left on both my husband and I's chair. No one wants to have to wipe down a chair before they eat at any restaurant. Also, one of your chairs is off balance, so I had to change seats. The table also was wobbly but our server took care of that for us right away.
