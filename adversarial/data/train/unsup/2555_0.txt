Me and my wife are vegetarian and were looking for a nice restaurant in Pittsburg and as usual went on Yelp and searched and found that this restaurant has awesome reviews and is Italian so should have some options for vegetarian but it wasn't true. This is a meatball joint and mainly has all meat related options and very little for vegetarian. We don't eat mushroom so all we had was fries and pasta with marina sauce. Since we ordered so less, the server's behavior wasn't good too thinking that how did we even come here being vegetarian!
