Two days ago, when it was snowing non-stop, I wanted comfort food.  I walked past this place one night a few weeks ago and was curious what they served.  After finally tracking them down on Yelp, I figured it was the perfect time to test out the Build Your Own Grilled Cheese ($5).\n\nI walked in, and the place was fairly quiet at lunch time.  However, the roads and sidewalks were also treacherous so who knows if that is normal.  Anyway, you can get whatever you want packed in the grilled cheese for only $5, and it's $1 more if you want meat.  I decided to go with Pepper Jack, Mozzarella, Tomato, and Basil on Italian bread.  The grilled cheese is served panini style.  While it was good, it was a bit too bland.  I would love some spicy options for on the grilled cheese.  Hot sauce, buffalo chicken, etc., just something with a bit more of a kick.\n\nThe cookies ($1.75) looked really good.\n\nThere are some great health-conscious options on the menu, as well as vegan options.  That is pretty awesome.  The employees were friendly, and they take credit cards!  Overall, a cool place for lunch downtown!
