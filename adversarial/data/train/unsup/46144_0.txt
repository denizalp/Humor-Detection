Don't go here ! \n\nI went to get my hair done and they ruined it. They did awful mismatched highlights. They didn't even start at the root. Rather halfway up my hair. They didn't bother toning it to a shade that would suite my skin tone \n\nThankfully I got it fixed by an amazing stylist just a few doors down at another hair salon
