Really great salon with friendly staff and customers. It's a small salon but they have everything they need. It's in a great location in a little strip center with a Starbucks next door and restaurants and other shops as well. They were really quick in taking me as a walk in. The girl did a fabulous job on my gel nails and on my pedicure. I will definitely be back here!
