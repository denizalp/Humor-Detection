Awful service.  We counted up to 8 minutes between checks from waiter Tony. Even then it was a quick stop. Prime Rib was cold. Didn't want to wait another 8 minutes to get the waiter to return and replace.  We even put glasses at the end of the table as a hint we needed a refill. No visible manager which was disappointing as well. We dine out a lot and usually a manager stops to check on the tables. For a very pricey meal we were very disappointed. A lot of training is needed. He said they are the only restaurant that serves bone-in filets which is incorrect. I usually scout out restaurants for bone-in because they are much tastier.  And yes there are other steakhouses that have dry aged vs prime.  Not sure it was worth the additional $20 for the prime. We ordered both to try out.  Shrimp cocktail is only 3 large shrimps.  Side dishes serve 3. Appreciate the other reviewers which helped us to make our choices.
