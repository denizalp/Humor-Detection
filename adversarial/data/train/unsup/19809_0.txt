First time dining at Toast and I must say  that I enjoyed it. I'd describe it as a smaller intimate space with different levels and sections to sit at, so this combined with a group of five during the Gordon Square Rose Wine Off between Toast and Banter, well, things got pretty crowded. We started with standing at the bar but then moved to a table, luckily though management allowed us to continue with happy hour pricing even though it's usually only offered at the bar. Service was normal, no issues with that. Food is fresh and the menu changes regularly. \n\n*Chicken Wings - These have fish oil on them. I tried a bite of my friend's order and I did not like it. Weird and salty tasting to me.  \n*Buffalo Cauliflower with Blue Cheese Dip $6 - Oh man this was really tasty! And a big enough portion to share. I would definitely get this again!\n*Trio of Toasts $7- Three grilled up half slices of bread topped with things like beet hummus, coleslaw and short rib, and cheese with jam and nuts. Simple but good. \n\nI would say this place is a classy spot with higher pricing (not ridiculous though), but happy hour has some great deals and I will definitely be coming back! I think it's a great place to meet friends or lovers for drinks and shareable plates.
