I love both the food and staff here. The Jalapeno Cream soup FN rocks! The margaritas are Awesome! I dig on the Bulldog. It comes with a Coronita, so it is two drinks in one. Good for exposing the out of towner to the Southwest.\n\nMy acquaintance Brian owns the joint. He rocks and so does his staff. The bar skirts inside and outside. You get the best of both worlds. I highly recommend a pit stop here. The Penske Racing museum is around the corner. It is free and awesome too. #vino2ultimate #vinosquared
