Despite being a Caesars Diamond member, I had a terrible experience.  The manager was abrupt and rude. He made no attempt to accommodate us, nor did he care that we were inconvenienced.  It was such a bad experience, we walked out before our food arrived.\n\nI would not ever recommend this restaurant to anyone.
