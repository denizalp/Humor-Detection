Updated review, since I drive by this place daily, on my drive home after work in a rental car, I noticed my car on the lot. The shop was closed and front windows were down with all doors unlocked!!!!!!!! I am extremely upset!!!!! My car phone charger and other items open to being stolen!!!!! This is my first time as a consumer of their services and I'm extremely upset... I havent gotten any feedback on their progress but if they leave their customers cars wide open for easy accessability to the public I'm not feeling very confident about this one......
