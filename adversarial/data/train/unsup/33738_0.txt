Had my big husky puppy groomed here before! Staff was very friendly and attentive. My dog does not like to be caged and the staff handled it well without my assistance. The prices seem a little steep but it is to be expected in a boutique grooming shop! Pup came out gorgeous and clean, but was still shedding a lot.
