So bring a 1rst time patient I arrived to see Dr Tanarya at 2:30! Everything seemed fine! They asked for my license and insurance and said have a seat and I'll get them back to you. So if you minutes later we could call back, we go back we're back there about 45 minutes I really enjoyed my nurse practitioner or provider what she likes to be called. She gave me two prescriptions one for back pain and another for muscle relaxer! I had my mother with me which by the way is in a wheelchair and suffers from Parkinson's and by the time we got home it was probably around 5 o'clock. I didn't realize that the girls at the front desk never return my drivers license nor my insurance card now mind you it's just me and my mother who can't walk in is in a wheelchair I'm supposed to meet friends that are in town visiting at 8 o'clock. No one's answering the phone. I had to leave my mother homebuyer self race down to the doctors office which by the way it supposed to be open till 7 o'clock and as of quarter after six they were closing up!  Miss placed my drivers license and insurance card. Then I go to pick up my prescriptions which was actually earlier before all this only to find out that my insurance did not cover one of them so they had to resubmit it to the doctors office for her to prescribe an alternative! That was Tuesday it is now 4 PM PST on Friday and they still have not called anything in. So do you know the old saying a first impression is the last thing impression? Well my first impression is my last impression of that place. Oh and I forgot to mention the dirty floors that look like they had not been mopped in about a month!! LoL also reported to AMA
