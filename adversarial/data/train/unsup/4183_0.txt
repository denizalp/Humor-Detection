They don't have enough good trainers for their classes. Half the time I go to the 6am class, the instructor is late or doesn't show. At first I blamed the instructor, but then I looked at the schedule and when you expect one person to do all the classes, you can't expect happy customers or employees. I know they are fighters and they like it, but you're asking them to work 6am to 9pm?\nKyra is an amazing teacher and motivates everyone with her enthusiasm and hard work. Javon has tough, well structured classes and helps you with making sure form and such is correct.\nI've been going to this gym for six years now, and I think it's time for a change. I pay too much to come to a class with no instructor or the class has way to many people. Other than the classes, it's not the greatest most cleanliness of a gym. There are a ton in Las Vegas to choose from, so I'm going to go find somewhere else. I tried to love this place for too long.
