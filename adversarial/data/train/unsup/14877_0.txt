WARNING: LONG but THOROUGH review!  :-)\n\nI've visited Briggs Family Dentistry twice now; originally chose them based on prior reviews and the fact they've been received multiple \"Top Dentists\" awards (\"Top Docs\" edition of Phoenix magazine is where I first learned of them).\n\nRates are on the pricey end, but are competitive for the Scottsdale area and are accompanied by an amazing (dare I say \"unbeatable\") experience. If you need extensive or pricey work done like me (two crowns), they also do what they can to aid in the financial department (payment plans, cash discount) which is great for those of us who don't have dental insurance. \n\nI love that they do NOT have high pressure sales but simply - honestly - state what kind of work you'll need or can expect in the future. They also do NOT recommend unnecessary treatments, as I've experienced with every other dentist (i.e. \"you should get whitening, this 'might' be a cavity so let's fill it,\" etc).\n\nMy front teeth are sensitive to cold. Additionally, I've always dreaded the flossing part which proves painful. BUT BOTH visits to Briggs resulted in 100% pain-free cleanings! They also offer laughing gas if anxiety is an issue.\n\nI've seen both of the Briggs (Dr. Roger and Dr. Bradley) and was pleased with each - the apple doesn't fall far from the tree! From the front desk to the tech to the doctors to the billing\/checkout, EVERY staff member was incredibly *sincerely* kind, patient, and extraordinary. Both my husband and I have never experienced anything like it... and being that my hubby is Jamaican (black), this says something, especially in North Scottsdale where (sadly) there is racism. \n\nBriggs Family Dentistry is reminiscent of businesses in a time past - something that is so rare, so unseen now days.  As long as this persists, I can guarantee my hubby and I will be life-long patients!  In fact, today I scheduled for a crown I need, and cavity filings for the hubby.\n\nA final note: the true mark of a great businessman is his involvement in the community and willingness to give back (pro bono work); the doctors Briggs are regularly involved in both, locally and worldly.  :-)
