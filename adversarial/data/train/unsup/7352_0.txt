Who puts fried chicken fingers in their Chicken and Waffles? I mean, it was delicious chicken fingers. Flavorful, all white meat, and crispy shell, but a head-scratcher nonetheless. Not sure if they are trying to be hipsters or is this gross cultural appropriation?\n\nIt's too bad because the space itself is beautiful and unlike any other restaurant I've dined in and around Madison. We sat near the sidewalk from Macy's facing the entire wall of glass, that in the summertime can be opened like a garage door.\n\nThe waffle is a masterpiece though; gritty like it was made from cornmeal, it contained pieces of red peppers and golden corn.\n\nService was sporadic. I admire our waitress for her ability to recall our order without a pen and a pad, but she lacked in follow-through with filing water glasses as needed or bring the right amount of boxes for leftovers (eyeballing four half eaten plates, she brought us one large box).\n\nTheir gift card system is a little silly. The hostess gives you a blank card and envelope, but you have to take it to the bar to complete the transaction by loading it with the amount you want on there. Seems like a 1st world problem, unless it's a packed around dinner time and the single bartender can't keep with with the patrons around the bar.
