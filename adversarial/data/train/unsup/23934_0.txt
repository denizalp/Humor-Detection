Has been my favorite place to go for a few years now - always wondered when the shoe would drop....   guess you can't have good food AND good service!!!!\n\n\nWill admit I usually come at dinner - tried lunch today - maybe it is like a strip club - where the better crew works at night!!!!\n\nVery sad - hard to find good Japanese steakhouse.....
