Well Jake is now 2 for 2 on cleaning my carpet. Once again he has saved me so much money from cleaning my carpets vs replacing it. It amazes me the stains he can get out of my carpet (3 kids in my house). He will always be my carpet cleaning team. Also on a scale of 1-10 I would give him a 20 for his customer service and his professionalism \n\nHighly recommend you call Jake and set a appt. \n(480) 694-3971\n\nThanks again Jake will be calling you in 6 months
