I'm a rocker by nature but have an affinity for country music and the honky tonk scene.  Checked this place out with a couple friends just out of curiosity.  The place is huge!  Interesting mix of people, not just country lovers which was cool.  They really pack in the people though which after getting bumped into several times can get annoying depending on who's doing the bumping if you know what i mean.  Next time I wouldn't mind renting a cabana just to have a little personal space to retreat to if needed.  I had a decent burger with fries.  Food was middle of the road.  Nothing special.  Had more fun people watching then anything.
