This is the closest bank branch to my house, but unfortunately I always dread coming here.  No one is overly friendly here and they have these new glass panels in front of the teller windows inside that makes speaking with a teller cumbersome and less personal.  If you need to do anything above and beyond the basics the teller can handle you have to wait to speak with one of the bank managers in their office.  This is normal for any bank but it seems like this branch is never in any hurry to help.  I always end up sitting in the waiting area for quite a while before any of the office people even realize I'm there.  When they do finally get around to me I always expect a \"sorry for the wait\" or something to that effect, but instead they always act annoyed that they have to help me.  \n\nLast time we were here we were going to close our accounts since BOA recently started charging monthly fees for a basic checking account.  We ended up switching to a new type of online checking account that doesn't charge fees, but the catch is you can't use a teller.  If you use a teller you get charged $8.95 for the month.  I don't like the idea of this account either but it's hard to close all our BOA accounts with a branch so convenient to home.  At least I shouldn't have to worry about interacting with anyone in this branch from now on since I don't believe their services are worth $8.95 per month.
