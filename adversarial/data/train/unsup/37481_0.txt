Overall: I would definitely recommend eating at this restaurant!  The food here is yummy, but a little pricy.!  \n\nSo far, this is the best place that I have found to eat taiwanese style noodles and xiao long baos!  It is more expensive than in other cities, which have an abundance of these type of restaurants, but it's worth it.\n\nI'd recommend ordering:\n\n*Beef Noodle Soup\n*Xiao Long Bao's\n*Beef Rolls (my favvvvvvvv choice at these types of restaurants, although again, the portion is pretty small at Everyday Noodle)\n*Zha Jiang mian\n\nUsually I like thick noodles, but I think I prefer the thin noodles at Everyday Noodle.\n\nI haven't tried the dumplings or bubble tea yet, but I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu.
