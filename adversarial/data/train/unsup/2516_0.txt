The Chicken Shawarma - so good! \n\nAtmosphere: not there? But the tables were actually set up in a way in which I felt cozy eating there with my friend. The restaurant\/store isn't dressed up in any way, and it felt comfortable.\n\nService: friendly. The workers joke around with you. \n\nPrice: reasonable! I paid $~9 for my meal.
