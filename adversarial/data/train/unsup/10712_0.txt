Soho Sushi Burrito is located in the same plaza as Maui Rose Hawaiian BBQ, Subway and McDonald's. Soho Sushi Burrito is located specifically next door to Red Wing with plenty of parking spots available.\n\nMy husband and I came by here last Saturday around 1:15 pm for lunch. After browsing the menu board, we ended up getting:\n\nBuild Your Own Poke Bowl With Ahi Tuna, $7.95 prior to tax- The way the build your own bowls work is that you pay for the bowl based on the price of whatever protein you choose. If you want to get a 2nd protein, you pay for the most expensive and then an additional $1.50 for the 2nd protein. I opted for my bowl to be made with half brown rice, half salad. I got all of the free add ins that are not spicy (I don't do spicy). I thought my bowl was hearty and filling. I liked the creamy sesame dressing (I requested for a light amount in my bowl). The ahi tuna was fresh tasting.\n\nNorth Shore Poke Bowl, $7.50 prior to tax- My husband opted for one of the premade bowls. I should have asked the employee behind the counter to add salad to his bowl to be a bit more filling and round it out with some more fiber. I got this bowl for my husband to be made with brow rice (you have the option to have this made with white rice or salad or do a mix like my made your own bowl). My husband liked the fresh flavors of the fish in his bowl. \n\nTaro Milk Tea, $3 prior to tax- This restaurant now offers milk tea, with an option to add boba for an additional $0.50. Unfortunately because these drinks are premade, sweetness level is not able to be adjusted. Only added ice can be added to help dilute the sweetness. My husband got this drink but it was a little on the sweet side. \n\nLychee Green Tea, $3 prior to tax- I opted for this tea drink. I also thought it was on the sweet side and so I just added water to my drink to lower the sweetness level. I felt this drink was refreshing and a great price. \n-----------------------\n(Total= $23.22 after tax)\n\nService was friendly. WiFi was available and was fast for those surfing the net. The restroom in the back was clean and adequately stocked with the essentials. \n\nOverall, we had a great lunch experience and would come back here again if I lived in the area.
