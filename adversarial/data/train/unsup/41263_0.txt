In town for a visit and what a great discovery!! The beer selection could be the best I've ever seen and blows away any place in NYC i can think of including the Ginergerman, DBA , blind tiger. \nDifferent atmosphere than any of the NYC places and is more of a local sports bar , but man what a selection of fresh tap beers, bottle beers served by an extremely knowledgeable bartenders. Great wings, good pizza . Thankfully I don't live near this place or I'd be divorced.
