I am so happy I went to see Dr. K, Dr. B and the staff at Agape Health.  I received the best care and got so much knowledge about the skeletal and muscle systems and what led to injury.  This is definitely not a \"Crack your back and leave\" type of environment.  As a result of my time with Agape Health I have completely changed my approach to strength training and exercise and my neck, back, shoulders and hips feel better now than they have in a long time.  I am very grateful to have found such amazing doctors and staff.
