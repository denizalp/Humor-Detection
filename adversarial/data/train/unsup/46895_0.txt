This place has the best specials. On Wednesdays they have a $5.99 steak special with salad fries and steak. It's a great deal the steak is really good salads a little skimpy fries are awesome. I've had other Things off the menu but to tell you the truth this one is my favorite. The waitresses are amazing there and work there but off to make you happy.
