They open 11am.  You don't want to wait until 1pm like we did on a Saturday.  No ribs or pulled pork left, so we settled for brisket , sausage and pecan pie.  I've had the ribs before.  Everything is excellent.  Always eat outside under the tarp on long picnic tables.   Down, dirty, always yummy.  Get there early.  They close every day at 4pm or when the food is all gone.
