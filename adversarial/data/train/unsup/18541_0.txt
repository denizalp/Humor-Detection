Let me preface this first by saying that I don't normally do sweets or desserts in general. BUT THIS PLACE IS MAKING A LIAR OUT OF ME!\n\nThree words: MAPLE. BACON. BAR.\n\nOf course they have others but every time I go here, its all about the above mentioned. Service is spectacular especially if you call in advance to put in an order and they are open 24 hours on the weekend! \n\nThis maybe my shortest review ever but I cant make it anymore simpler than this!
