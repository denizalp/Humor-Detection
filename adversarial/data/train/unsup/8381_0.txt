I've been going to Hot Sauce Williams for the past 15 years and this place is going down hill big time!  The service continues to get worse and the attitude of the workers is piss poor.  They ignore you and can be very rude as well.  Also, the place is very dirty and I would love to see the health inspection report.  \n\nI will admit there Sauce is some of the best I have ever had.  The wings are just not as good as they used too, but the Polish Boy is still very good.  The Mac n Cheese is very overrated and DO NOT ORDER THE RIBS.  They are like chowing down on a gristled piece of fat and that has the texture of rubber.  My friend tossed them away they were so bad.  \n\nVery sad to see an Cleveland Institution goes down the tubes like this and hope they can improve but that's the last they have seen of my business.  \n\nP.S-Don't even bother going through the drive thru unless you have 20 mins to spare, no joke.
