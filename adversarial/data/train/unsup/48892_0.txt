We had the roasted duck and it did not disappoint! For $9 a plate at the venetian, I thought it was quite a steal! The duck was very well cooked and had none of the raw, red taste (which I dislike). I would come back here just for the duck again! \n\nWe had the dan dan noodles - peanut sauce and minced pork. The sauce was great but the noodles was a tad bit overcooked. Nonetheless, a decently priced meal for the location. \n\nEfficient service, considering the restaurant was packed. I think they cannot afford not to be as volume is key to their survival. If you don't want fast-food and want to spare your pockets a pinch... this would be a perfect choice for a fussy-free meal.
