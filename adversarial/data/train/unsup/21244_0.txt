This was my direct consumer experience.\n\nI received a highly inappropriate, and very ill written, immature letter from Zach. \nHe lost all sight of professionalism when he did a family member a favor in writing this preposterous cease and desist letter when I had a relationship with what I believed to be, his family members estranged husband. Hurt feelings and dramatic letters ensued.\nHe ended his subpar letter with the statement,\n\"If you want to know how serious things could get for you, look me up.\"\nI did, and I have to say, you come up lacking. Severely.\nI would highly suggest hiring a different lawyer, one that is not so preoccupied with his own families drama and antics.
