I had purchased some items out of town (NYC boutique) and when they shipped the pieces it was missing a gift box I needed. \n\nI came into my local store trying to simply get a gift box for the item. They wouldn't give me one and said it was $6.50 if I want it... unbelievable! The store manager was extremely rude as well. If you love Kate Spade just go buy it at Nordstrom's. Avoid shopping here!
