So disappointed ..  This could be such an amazing shopping experience.  Make this more like Uptown Phoenix.  Urban with wood, greenery and modern retail shops. \nPut in restaurants like Le Grande Orange, Butters, Luci's, Southern Rail etc.....\nBring in new locations like Boudin Sourdough, etc...\nPut a gym on top with a running track on top floor encased in solar windows.\nThink creative and unique!\nThis is a great location.  For us that live here in summer it is great to have an indoor mall.\nGood luck Macerich only want this mall to succeed
