My beautiful girlfriend, who introduced me to this wonderful restaurant, warned me not to waste the few opportunities I have to be audible at Guu. It was a joking retroactive reference to what I believe was a stupid joke or a lame story, but either way it is solid advice to be heeded. Don't come here expecting to have a conversation. DO come here to eat crazy delicious plates.\n\nI have nothing to add that hasn't already been said, save for a few tips:\n\n1. Be early, or late, unless you're okay with waiting. Seriously, just plan for a meal at 530 or 830. Or be a twosome (or solo) and sit at the bar.\n\n2. Every dish is delicious, but I personally love the Natto Yukke (salmon sashimi mixed with 'seven friends' and served with seaweed for you to wrap it in) the Takoyaki (deep fried octopus balls) and the Ikapari (calamari in spicy ketchup sauce). \n\n3. The mixed drinks are always awesome. I tend to gravitate to the Ramune cocktails because I find punching the ball into the bottle oddly satisfying.\n\n4. You can't go wrong with Tataki.
