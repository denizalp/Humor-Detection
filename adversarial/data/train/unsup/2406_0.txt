I've taken my car into Top Line twice now. I first considered them because they are walking distance from my house. I continue to use them because I trust them. I'm a single self employed woman who is budget aware. I always check with a friend who loves cars to see if what a mechanic is telling me rings true. I've done this for the past 20 years, some mechanics are uncomfortable with this. The guys at Top Line Auto have helped explain the problem over the phone. So far they have replaced my transmission, this was a big job so I shopped around - they were the best deal I could find. \n\nThis time I needed my rack and pinion replaced, I've put it off for about a year.  I've had three quotes ranging from 600-795 dollars. My plan was to purchase the parts myself and take them to Top Line Auto to install. Long story short they gave me such a good price I didn't have to source my own parts. Anyway I love these guys,more importantly I trust them and I'm glad they are a part of my community.\n\nThey shop seems to always be busy yet when I'm talking to one of them I don't get the feeling of being rushed. \nThe waiting area is big and comfy, big screen television, comfortable couches, air conditioning...  I will give them 5 stars once they get a popcorn machine (just kidding). \n\nBottom line - I will keep going back!
