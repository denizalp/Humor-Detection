This is a gorgeous spot and maybe my experience isn't normal but it definitely leaves a lot to be desired.  This coffee spot has taken over a historical building and the bones of the place is just stunning.  Much care has been given to restore and take advantage of the bricks and features.\n\nThere is no issues whatsoever on the atmosphere... clean, pristine, beautiful, lots of light, and lots of tables.  You cannot ask for a nicer cafe in Toronto.  The problem would be the actual coffees... you know, the things you come here for.\n\nService is nice but I dont think they trained up their staff well enough to let them man the entire place themselves but that's what happened.  Only one nice person behind the counter who couldnt answer most questions about their food offering and doesnt know how to do a flat white or matcha latte.  It should have been my warning sign that they couldnt tell me anything about the food but I was hopeful.\n\nMatcha Latte - the colour of this was a pale yellow green... so pale that it didnt even look green with altering the image in edits.  Unfortunately in addition to be super watery and diluted, the chunks of undissolved matcha powder at the botton was a side sight.  2\/5\n\nFlat white - Another casualty unfortunately.  This one was watery as well and not full flavoured as it should be.  Closer to a diluted latte.  2\/5\n\nCappuccino (another day) - Much better but there was something off with the flavour.  It was definitely more acidic than it should be.  Not watery but not the best.  3\/5\n\nI want to give a higher rating cause it's such a pretty place this is a coffee spot and with that in mind, I dont think this place is putting it's focus on the drinks as much as the instagram aesthetics.
