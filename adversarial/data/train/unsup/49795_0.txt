A friend of mine, who knows authentic Middle Eastern food very well, recommended the restaurant to me.  I had the Iraqi Chicken Kebab and a mint lemonade and both were excellent.  The service was good and the atmosphere was nice.  The new ownership is taking this place in a great direction.\n\nI will be returning to Dijlah to enjoy their food, again, very soon.
