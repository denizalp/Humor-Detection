I couldn't imagine this place being that bad based off the reviews, but after my recent visit, I get why Spin Cafe isn't liked so much.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about the decor. When you walk inside, you notice right away that the interior just seems very cluttered! There's just way too much going on when it comes to photos and paintings on the wall, lights hanging from the ceiling and too much seating! Less really should be more in this case. \n\nWhen it comes to our order. I tried their Chocolate Monkey milkshake and momma tried their Cleopatra crepe. Let me sum up how we felt about what we ordered....\n\nFor 16.97, the crepe was not worth it at all. It was supposed to be a strawberry and French Vanilla ice cream crepe, but honestly all it was was this crepe with a big (too big in this case) scoop of ice cream stuffed inside that just melted quickly and made a pool of ice cream on the plate. There wasn't enough strawberries also, and I think it was just missing another component to the dessert, like whipped cream!\n\nThe Chocolate Monkey milkshake was just ok. Had your typical chocolatey taste with some whipped cream and chocolate syrup drizzled on top. Nothing whatsoever stood out to me. I've had waaaaay better elsewhere so it did no justice in helping minimize the disappointment from the crepe.\n\nYup, you guessed it. I will not be coming back!
