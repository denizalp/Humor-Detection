Why would I rather spend an afternoon here than the JW Marriott Desert Ridge Resort and Spa?  Because they have FREE wifi here!  The baked goods aren't bad either.\n\nYes, as I previously mentioned, the resort wanted me to PAY for WIRED internet.  Instead, I drove across the street and bought an iced coffee here (roughly 4 bucks) and enjoyed free wifi.  Even though I didn't have anything really important to do (in fact, I think I wrote a review while I was there...) it was nice feeling connected.  So that's what an addiction to the internet feels like.\n\nI got some sort of frozen mint chip coffee.  Nothing spectacular, but nothing terrible.\n\nThe bakery is in the middle of the outdoors mall there.  Across the way is a Starbucks.  Odd that they can cohabitate, but both seem to be doing good business.  I did not try any of the sandwiches or salads, but I'm sure they would have tasted fine.  This chain reminds me of Panera bread in San Jose; they basically sell the same things.\n\nThere are some bar tables near the register and booths in the rest of the dining area.  Just be forewarned: if you are bringing a laptop, be sure to have your battery charged.  There is ONE outlet near the outer door next to the bathroom that you could reach from a table, but not the booths.  \n\nMy friend who came with me had his laptop die.  Me, being the GRACIOUS friend, allowed him to use my laptop to finish his homework assignment.  That's just the kind of buddy I am =)
