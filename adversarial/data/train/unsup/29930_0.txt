This place was by far the worst \"cheap hotel experience\" we've ever had.  We had to switch rooms 2 times...once because the bathroom was dirty, and in the 2nd room the sheets were stained!  When we requested a different room the manager was incredibly rude.  We asked him to come see what we were unhappy about and he refused and rolled his eyes! The following day we requested a late courtesy check out and he replied \"we normally allow it but in your case Im sorry we won't be able to accommodate you\"  He was actually holding a grudge with us for wanting a clean room!!! To top it all off they double charged us for the room!  When we called later to be refunded they told us they had no way of refunding us!  We had to have our bank reject it.  The front desk staff and management was just simply rude and unsympathetic.   We will use other Quality Inns but NEVER THIS ONE AGAIN!
