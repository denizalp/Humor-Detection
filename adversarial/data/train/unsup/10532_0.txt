2013 Spring Restaurant Week Review:\n\nWhile walking through Hard Rock I saw a sign stating \"Patio Open.\"  So, I put on my leg brakes and walked straight on in.\n\nThe restaurant is huge and looks like Restoration Hardware threw up all over it.  The servers all look like they were bussed in from Williamsburg.  But, my only focus was the outdoor seating.\n\nIt's glorious, by the way. Comfy banquettes, outdoor bar, poolside, and firepits. Fire!\n\nOh, anyways, the food. \n\nI chose the carrot-ginger soup, fried chicken, and chocolate tart options from the RW menu.   My table also went for the pretzel and cheese fondue appetizer.  \n\nThe pretzel fondue was really great.  The pretzels were soft and chewy and the cheese was delicious, although a little clumpy.  I do wish they served the cheese a little hotter.  Overall, a great appetizer.\n\nMy first course, the carrot-ginger soup, was really flavorful.  I couldn't eat it all so I asked for a box.  Instead of boxing my leftovers, they gave me a whole new soup!  \n\nThe second course, the fried chicken, was pretty good.  There were three huge pieces and each was moist on the inside, crunchy on the outside.  Unfortunately, the chicken was bit too salty for me, but the batter definitely had a great flavor.   The dish also came with a tasty honey biscuit, coleslaw, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  I really enjoyed the coleslaw because it wasn't caked in dressing. \n\nMy favorite part of the meal was probably the toffee chocolate tart.  I've been on a tart kick lately and this one was the best of the batch.  The chocolate was dark and rich but not too sweet.  A great way to end the meal.\n\nOur server, Thanon (sp? Sorry!), was the nicest server I've had in a long time.  He went out of his way to make our meal amazing. He even offered to box up my leftover Sazerac! Who does that?!?! I would go back just for the service, it was that good.\n\nThe food, overall, is probably a 3 star experience, but the service and ambiance deserve extra stars.  I'll go back for sure!
