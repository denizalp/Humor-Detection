I went with my wife and son today. I thought the food was so so. While we were there they had a movie on that was not appropriate for young children because of the violent content.\nWe went for the lunch buffet. There was a large selection of food choices. I think there should have been more vegetable choices. I believe I am more picky than most people since I am very health conscience. The servers were helpful.
