The lady working the drive thru was friendly, however there was only one car in front of me, and it didn't look like they ordered $200 worth of food, but it took over 10 minutes when they pulled up to the window!! Of course my 3 soft tacos were ready and I was able to pay and leave, but the service is SO SLOW!!! And it seems like they close earlier than the times posted on the window some nights.  If you're craving Taco Bell, do yourself a favor and go to the one on Alma School & Warner!! The drive thru window is a little awkwardly set back, but they are quick and the food is always good and correct!!
