So curious to finally visit the internationally acclaimed line of restaurants by the chef with the most Michelin stars ever and instead of being disappointed by the hype like I often am, I thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nCost to worth it rating: 3 (quite expensive, but if you do the tasting menu it's on par with other fine dining\/Michelin-starred places) \nEve award: best amuse ever (shot glass of foie gras parfait with parmesan foam) \n\nHighlights: \n- Setup: relaxed counter seating like at a diner but fancified version with fine dining food--love the concept since I love high quality food but could do without the stuffy formal atmosphere that often comes with \n- Redefines a dinner show: you're looking right into kitchen which is amazing live entertainment for a Top Chef watching foodie like me. Loved watching the precision in the process of one of the best kitchens. It's crazy they aren't allowed to talk to each other which so not like you see on TV (or read about in Anthony Bourdain) with those yelling chefs \n- Different levels of menus: from a small set all on one plate to a 4 course and a 10 course \n- Don't all have to do the same menu: awesome option for the hub and I as most places insist on the whole party being in synch and complain about timing discrepancies, etc. \n- Unique presentations: amuse was served on a lava rock, pumpkin soup in a martini glass in a circular vase with fall accents \n- Scallop with chives: never had this tender preparation before--more delicate fish-like texture than traditional seared style \n- Onion tart: sounded so simple but was almost like a small pastry disc of a sauceless pizza with bacon and hearty mushrooms and shavings of amazing cheese \n- Sole with baby leeks: light yet substantial and purely delightful \n- Hanger steak: melt in your mouth with fried shallots delicately placed on top \n- Dessert: quartet of tarts (including snickers and passion fruit) were scrumptious, but the real star was the peach confit infused with moscato d'asti in an apricot milkshake--unexpected and refreshing sweet dish \n- Service: excellent and professional, easier for them to be around more with the smaller space to work. All of the staff was happy to chat as well as simply present the food and disappear for a more pleasant well-rounded experience. \n- Wine: when I inquired about a wine plan, the waiter served few glasses to work well with multiple courses \n- Teppanyaki: when I've been in fine dining kitchens I don't remember seeing one of these long flat cooking areas so I found that interesting \n\nLowlights: \n- Overwhelming when you see a la carte menu prices for appetizer size items around $40--go for one of the tasting menus instead \n- They don't advertise wine pairings so I had to ask about it and they did have one to offer \n\nLOVED this meal--best I've had in a while with every course being fantastic. I'd be more than happy to return--soon. :-)
