Think I just had holy smoke for the last time .\nOne sandwich and the tray was a puddle of grease by the time I was done , also the bun was soaked with grease as well. It's too bad I love smoked meat but at 12 bucks for just a sandwich is pretty pricy but the grease just kills the deal.\nThey would be so much better off if they would drain some of juice.
