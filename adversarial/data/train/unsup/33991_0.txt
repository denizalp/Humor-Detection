The customer service at this location is downright appalling. My wife and I spent nearly $5K on appliances a year and a half ago. The refrigerator has been a complete lemon. In just a year and a half, the unit has undergone three major repairs and we have thrown out approximately $400 worth of food. While the product quality was not the fault of anyone at this store, their response to it has been horrific. During the most recent incident, my wife called the Goodyear store numerous times and Roger (the manager) never bothered to return our call or help us get the situation addressed. We had to go over Roger's head to the district manager, who was able to get a replacement code approved. He informed us that Roger would be in touch with us and would work with us on getting a replacement unit ordered. We called Roger today (day #8 without a fridge) and he informed us that he received the authorization code yesterday but did not bother to call us to let us know. Our replacement unit was delayed at least a day by Roger's inaction. Roger went on to tell my wife that she was \"verbally abusive\" implying that his inaction was some sort of passive aggressive response to her frustration. At this point, my wife hung up on Roger because the lack of customer service was so completely inexcusable.I would love to see how pleasant these people would be in our shoes! In the end, we called the manager at another store and he went above and beyond in helping us get the replacement unit ordered, a process that took all of 20 minutes by the way. Do not patronize the Goodyear store if you value customer service and being treated well in the event that something goes wrong. They will gladly take your money but good luck in getting help after that (especially after 30 days where they think their obligations to their customers end, apparently).
