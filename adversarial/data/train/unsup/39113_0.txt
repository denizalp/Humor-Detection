Went there for breakfast - get there early, because it was packed. It had a real mom and pop diner feel, with local advertisements all over the top of the table. I got their (apparently) well known Jumbot - a dish with everything thrown in - eggs, potatoes, peppers, onions. I got the Guy version, which had hot peppers and hot sauce. Honestly, if not for the peppers, I really don't think that I would have cared for it too much - it would have been quite bland, and I still used a lot of ketchup on it. Having said that, it was still filling and tasted pretty good. My friend had their french toast - filled with raspberries. We both liked that very much - light, not too sweet, and tasty.
