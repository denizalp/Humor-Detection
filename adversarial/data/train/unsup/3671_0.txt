When I was living in Tremont, this was the new pizza joint that was stepping into Edison's territory. I was taken back at first because they approached it differently. The pizza and crust was a little more doughy, they used fresh ingredients, everything was prepared and made in the morning, and they closed so damn early. Everything that was not Edison's !! I felt bad... like I was cheating on someone. But, I found out that Crust makes delicious, hot sandwiches and I forgot all about it. I love Crust ! All their specialty pizzas are good, which is anything with prosciutto on it. Just order prosciutto on the side or add it as an extra topping. It's a total G move.\n\nOne my favorite menu items has to be the meatball sub. I think it's really good. And, the Italian is good too. You should definitely try one !
