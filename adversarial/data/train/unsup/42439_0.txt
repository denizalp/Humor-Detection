Wow! What an amazing find! Sadly, i have to give my best friend and Scottsdale resident full credit, but still...wow! I will now make a point to visit this place at least once when I visit. I ordered the Il Purista sandwich...yum.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the staff was not very friendly...to the point it would have been nicer to order take-out. Oh well, their patio was lovely.
