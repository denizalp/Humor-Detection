We stumbled upon this spot by accident and it was the greatest thing that could've happened. The service was excellent & it was fun to have servers who spoke English, French, & Spanish. \n\nThe food was exquisite - from the croquetas, to patatas, charcuterie, & the churros & chocolate for dessert. It is an excellent spot for dinner for two or a small group (4-5 ppl). If you find yourself in Montreal definitely check it out!
