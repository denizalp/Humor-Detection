I can understand the attraction to this place. Loud music, bright colors, well decorated but the food is awful. I've been here three times and every time the food is just miserable. You have to order chips and salsa which is a pet peeve I have about these modern Mexican restaurants. The chips are soggy. The quac is turning brown and has mango in it, I don't know why you have to put fruit in quac? The tacos barely have meat in them especially their chicken tacos. The house margarita was sour and the waitress forgot salt on the rim. Something is wrong with their draft system. The beer taste bitter and stale. I must be missing something. People seem to love coming here. Maybe they are better during lunch hours but overall I have not been very impressed each time I've come here.
