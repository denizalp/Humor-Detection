One word: DELICIOUS \nI'm literally here about once a week. Love getting the Pad See Iw and also the fried rice. Their Thai Toast as an appetizer is very good. Let's not forget their sticky rice and custard or sticky rice with mango. Very nice owners, cute little restaurant. Really do recommend to check it out.
