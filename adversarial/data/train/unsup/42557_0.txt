Meh...Food was OK.  Chipotle or Zabas is better.  Environment is great and the patio was delightful.  But, I really do not like the \"station\" set-up.  I was so confused, and, didn't find it easy to navigate, at least for their quality of food.  If the food was to die for I would expend the energy necessary to figure out which line to stand in, get my food and then go stand in a second line to pay the cashier.  I really don't like that there isn't waitstaff, especially for drinks!  To go up to the cashier each time is a waste of a good buzz.\n\nMaybe great for some, but, not for me...
