WOW!! Very nice!! 17 million dollar newly renovated buffet and it's VERY nice. The decor is quite unique, earthly woods & glassware chandeliers, metal designs, lively music.  The food was very good and I really liked the fact that you can have things made just for you. \n9 show kitchens: Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, American, Seafood, Pizza, Deli, Dessert
