Came here with fellow Yelpers on a Friday night. The restaurant was really busy and we had to wait for 30 mins to get seated. They do not take reservations on Friday night. \n\nAfter we got seated they were very prompt in giving us the menus and getting our drinks. We ordered our food and we surely didn't notice how long it took even though there were 6 of us. We ordered the Antipasto to begin. They had a lot of grilled vegetables in the antipasto. There were tomato slices topped with mozzarella, salami and sliced soppressata. Everything tasted good and the antipasto was big enough to be shared by 4 people.\n\nFor the mains I had the fantasia pizza which was made with foccaccia topped with proscuitto crudo in a bed of arugula and parmesan shavings. The pizza was light since all the toppings were very fresh but still flavourful. The spicy oil gave a nice kick to the dish. I also tasted a slice of the firenze pizza which had potato slices, rosemary and black olives. The olives were a bit too salty but otherwise the pizza was delicious. \n\nThe service was quite good and they topped up our water quite often. Pizza does make me quite thirsty. Overall I really liked the food, ambience and service and I will likely be back soon to try their huge rice balls.
