We stopped in here on a Friday night about 30 minutes before close. The staff seemed very nice, to each other. No eye contact with us as customers. I was a bit put off, but the coffee is decent. \n\nThey do offer a wide variety of items to add to your drink so that you can adapt it to your personal taste. \n\nWe sat outside on the patio (my friend is a smoker) and the traffic wasn't overly loud. Not a bad spot to stop.
