I was not impressed. Though, let me first say that the owner and staff are super friendly and nice. I just didn't care for the food.\n\nThis little spot is located in a strip mall. It's small and sparse, but has a nice homey feel. When I was here, there was no one else in the place.\n\nI placed my order and opted for taking it to go. And everything was made fresh. The prices were ok. It can definitely add up, but it's nothing out of line with other area prices.\n\nWhen I got home, I realized they gave me just regular fries, not the cheese fries I had ordered. And I'm not sure I got the right sandwich order. It sure didn't seem like there was any whiz in there. \n\nAnd the sandwich just didn't taste that good to me. I had high hopes. When I lived on the East Coast, I would literally drive to Philly just to have a steak sandwich. But this sandwich left me longing and failed to satisfy my craving. It wasn't inedible or anything. But I also picked it apart and ate little of it.\n\nSo all in all, this was a disappointing meal. However, I didn't try what they were featured on TV for. So perhaps I'll stop in again and try a different menu item.
