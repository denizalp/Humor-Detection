Very cute cafe! I could sit here all day with a latte and a good book. The space is small but there are a few tables and counter seating. They push the envelope a little with their drink menu which I love. I had to try the ancho chili mocha which is a twist on Mexican hot chocolate. It's got a very thick texture and powerful chocolate taste with a hint of chili to give it a nice kick. I can't handle anything remotely spicy so if it's safe for me, it's safe for anyone. They also have a great selection of donuts and pastries to satisfy your sweet tooth. \n\nThe staff are also amazing! My barista went through the menu with recommendations to help me find what I would enjoy the most. I will absolutely be back.
