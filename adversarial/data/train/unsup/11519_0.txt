I really like Pho Annie. Been here twice in a matter of a month....and so far, so good. Clean tables and booths. Utensils, plates and bowls are cleaned too. Free from any remains of food or gunk stuck like how other Asian\/pho places in Chinatown.\n\nBoyfriend and I always order the spring rolls to start off with. I order the Pho Tai (rare beef steak) and he orders the Well Done Flank. Each bowl was about $7.95. Pretty good sized portion too. Our orders always come super quick....like within 3 minutes!!! Even quicker during early dinner time. Wow! I'm loving that!\n The one thing that stands out with Pho Annie versus other pho places I've tried is their broth contains no MSG. It's not as salty. Broth is still fantastic and drenching it in Sirracha sauce is even better!!!!! Yumm!!! This is PERFECT on a cold, winters day!!\n\nWe met the owner too, Annie. Such a sweet lady. Very friendly and personable. Even though it was super busy that day, she still stopped by and had a chat with us.
