The bar tender tonight was rude.  Two customers were ar the bar and i asked for 2 drinks and a water.  He was mad that i asked for a drink?  Well, the staff waiting on customers in the gambling areas asked us what we wanted, but never came back with our orders, two plus hours waiting.  2 drinks had no alcohol.  Cranberry vodka.  Bartender used his gun?  30 dollars for two drinks with no alcohol.  Rude rude rude rude.
