WhAt DiD YoU CaLL ThAt?\n\nRoaming around... looking for a good place to sit down and enjoy a nice breakfast... my friends, husband and I stopped in here. Walking in seems like an ordinary dine-in restaurant (in a hotel), yet in VEGAS everything is most of the time known to be: outrageous, CrAzY expensive and extremely packed with decor. Well... not here, just waiting in line you notice a lot of different verities of cakes in a Look-See Glass from both ways.\n\nSo, as we were seated (waiting around 5-10 minutes at max) GREAT TIMING... I was browsing the menu, which I came upon a unique omelet Ive never seen else were. CHILI CHEESE OMELET for BREAKFAST?!? Yup, as crazy as I may seem (EARLY IN THE MORNING) I choose that as a start off of a GREAT DAY AHEAD OF ME. Honestly, I could have counted to 200 and been notified that my food was ready.\n\nEating my CHILI CHEESE OMELET... it was FANTASTIC! It was made of egg (your normal egg omelet) which had green peppers inside and full of chili. DELICIOUS!\n\nI highly recommend everyone to stop by and ask for the Chili Cheese Omelet early in the morning.\n\nB+\n4 STARS
