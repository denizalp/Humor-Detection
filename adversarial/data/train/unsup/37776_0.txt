My husband and I have always thought it would be neat to live above the shops here in Birkdale Village and moved into the apartments three months ago...it has NOT disappointed!!  We are having a blast!  Our apartment is spacious and sunny, and was recently updated.  There is a decent little fitness center and the pool area looks amazing!  We CANNOT wait for the warm weather to stay so we can partake of the hammocks, firepit, and cool pool!!  ALL of our interactions with Alyssa in the leasing office have been top notch...she is highly efficient, personable, and professional.  We had some timing issues with the sale of our home and moving into the apartments, and Alyssa looked out for us and got us an even better apartment than our original choice...can't say enough good things about her and our new lifestyle!!  We plan on living here happily for many years to come!!!
