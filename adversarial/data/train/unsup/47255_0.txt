Prices are pretty high but it's Haagen Dazs and it's located on the strip. If your kid wants ice cream and you want to reward them with delicious cream and high quality of Haagen Dazs, then you came to the right place.\n\n The quality of the ice cream and shake is really good! Service was fast and the lady who helped me was very friendly. Even recommended some shows to watch around in Vegas!
