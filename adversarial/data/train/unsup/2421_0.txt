This is the Del Taco located on Sunset Road,directly across the street from the Galaxy Luxury Theater. \n\nOn the way to go see Avengers: Age of Ultron last night (fun, fun movie , btw), we stopped by here to grab some burritos to sneak into the theater. (*Shhhhhhhh, don't tell anyone*)\n\nWe pull up, ordered 2 Del Beef Burritos and were told to pull forward. Cool. Just as we were pulling forward, the girl who took our order says, \"It's gonna be a while\"\n\nWait. what?\n\nWe pulled forward with one vehicle in front of us. We wait.....and wait...and wait. After 12 minutes I notice that it  appears that the vehicle in front of us is not pulled up to the window. In fact, it is about 5 feet BEHIND the window. There were four twenty something males in the car. So I approached the vehicle and said, \"Hey...what's going on here?\" \n\nThey explained that they were told to back up from the window from the girl inside and that they were as annoyed as I was because they had waited almost 15 minutes for 3 cheeseburgers. They offered to pull up if they didnt get their burgers in the next few minutes so we could get out of there. \n\nAt the 16 minute mark of my wait, the guys in front of me get their order and pull off. I pulled up and paid for the burritos expecting to just grab the bag and go. After all, previews have now started for our movie.\n\nThe girl collects the money and closes the window and walks off. I looked at my friend and literally said, \"Are you F*cking kidding me??\" This is about 18 minutes in. \n\nI had had enough. I told the girl to give me my money back. This was BEYOND rediculous. By the time I pulled away it was 23 minutes. 23 MINUTES! Nothing fast about this food at all!\n\nWhen I first pulled up to order, she should have said they were having issues and that there would be a long wait. I would have backed out and been on my merry little way. Slipping in a \"It'll be a while\" as you pull forward does not cut the mustard. \n\nTHESE are the people that want $15 an hour??? Are you out of your flippin', ever loving minds??\n\nNever again. That $28 soda and popcorn is much more appealing than going through this again. Hell, a root canal sounds more enticing..\n\n1 star.
