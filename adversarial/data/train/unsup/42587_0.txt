My 16 year old son had a stroke 3 months ago and has been in intensive daily therapy until mid-December. I called 2 weeks before he was to graduate from his daily therapy program to make sure we had long term outpatient therapy set up so there would be no lapse in therapy. I gave my insurance information to them and was told insurance verification would take about 2 weeks. Perfect. 3 weeks later, I still had not heard back from them so I called them. They said they were still pending insurance verification. Really? Why does this process take so long? So, I waited another week or so and I called them again. ( I have never received one call from this place to let me know where we were at in the process.) They told me that they did have the insurance information and were going to schedule an evaluation. (When was somebody going to call me and let me know this?)  Oh, wait. There is no available appointment time. Ok. They got my times of availability, which was everyday of the week except Thursday. I never heard back from them again, so I called them AGAIN. They again said there was no appointment time available and said that I had told them I was only available on Saturdays. Ugh. I should've just stopped the whole process right here but thinking this was the only place for pediatric therapy near my home, did not. I finally called them again today and was told that they would have to re-authorize my insurance because it is the new year and still don't know about an available appointment. \n This is where I am done.\n I will find a place that can manage it's business office. I'm aware that this is a company ran by a mother and therapist that cares about children but honestly if you don't have your business practices and office staff working properly, you cannot help children. Your office practices have caused a serious delay in my son's care.
