Stopped in here for dinner but never got to dinner.  The menu seemed reasonable but if you want a glass of wine you won't have money to eat. A glass of Malbec wine was $20? A spotted cow beer was $4.  The discrepancy in pricing will turn people off. No sense.\nThe  bar tenders were very knowledgeable on drinks but very arrogant, didn't feel like a welcoming place. Won't be back to this one.  The plus is the atmosphere.
