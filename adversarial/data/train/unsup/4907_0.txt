GUYS, TRY THIS PLACE OUT! \n\nOk, seriously, they're delicious! One of my favorite spots to go to. I live close by, thankfully, and come here quite often if I don't want to go too far. Everything is always fresh! \n\nYou order your stuff at the register, pay, and sit. They bring everything to you! Made to order. \n\nThey have a very good amount of things on their menu. I usually go for the tacos or the carne asada fries. Lemme tell you about them fries though! The guacamole was perfect, and the fries were fresh and crispy not burnt! The carne was definitely savory.\n\nThis place does not disappoint and I keep coming back for more. I've recommended this place to a lot of people already and everyone fell in love. \n\nTheir desserts are always bomb too. Give the fried ice cream a chance. I don't think its on the menu because it isn't available all the time, but do ask. It was definitely worth it.
