I bought a very good groupon deal again.  However, the reception located my name and phone number on their system and would not let me use my groupon deal because it was only for new customers.  Sigh, really?  Ended up, it does mention on the fine print.  Finally, I paid for the difference between the regular and groupon face value.  Glad that I got my groupon deal with extra discount.\n\nI was, of course, a little disappointed.  However, the massage therapists there were constantly good.  I let the reception assign a massage therapist for me and she was very experienced with good technique.  She had some communication with me but did not talk too much.  \n\nI did not have problem making a last minute reservation.  So far, I am still satisfied with this place.
