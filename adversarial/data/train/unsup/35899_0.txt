We went to the location in Gilbert. Super fun atmosphere- great place to go with friends! Fun, affordable night out. Thought the prices were great. Service was just okay- we ordered a drink that took about 30 minutes. Received our food and everything was eaten by the time it finally came. Think it may have been a result of a busy night, but nonetheless not overly impressed with how the  server handled the situation. But we will go back just because it was a fun activity and we enjoyed ourselves!!
