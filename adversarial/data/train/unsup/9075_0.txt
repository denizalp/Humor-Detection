People say that living in New York changes you, hardens you somehow, makes you cynical. I've never really found this to be true... until my return to Bravo!.\n\nGrowing up in the South Hills, Bravo! was one of my favorite chains. It was fancy, it had table clothes, it was better than the Olive Garden. I recall being mildly obsessed with the chopped salad, so upon my recent return I ordered a half-sandwich and the salad for a light lunch.\n\nI was disappointed that the salad was full of soggy ice-berg lettuce and a few off-season tomatoes. The turkey-bacon-avocado sandwich was disappointing as well, with just a few chunks of cubed avocado overwhelmed by a flavored aioli.\n\nI guess I've been spoiled by having a huge variety of A+ Italian Bistros at my disposal,  but there is waaaay better Italian to be had in the 'burgh. Skip the big box chains and head to your local red-sauce joint. Its likely to be cheaper, more delicious, and lacking giant faux-Roman columns with doubtful structural integrity.
