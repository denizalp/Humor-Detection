A surprisingly good option if you're dining in the MGM Grand. I've never had a bad meal here. Their pizza is consistently good, as are most of the entrees, including the perfectly cooked chicken. They do a great calamari, with a uniquely delicious sauce. It's usually easy to get a seat. The cocktails are well made. The wait staff is attentive. You can't ask for much more.
