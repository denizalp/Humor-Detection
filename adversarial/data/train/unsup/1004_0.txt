I'm never going back there again. \nIf i could give it zero stars I would. \n\nthat said, if you are only going to play games for 1-2 hours, I think it's great. this place has less people than most other board game cafes and it's quite spacious. \n\nHowever, the wait staff is extremely rude the moment we walked in, we were a large group and we ended up staying for a long time to play a never ending game and the bill came up to be $175. (since it was an hourly rate of $2.5, it really adds up quick if you are in a large group) I honestly could have bought 6 games with that money and started my own board game cafe, at least then i know the food would be edible. \n\nOH THE FOOD! that's right - the hot pressed sandwich had COLD 'grilled veg' and the ($1 extra) 'bacon' was bacon bits, NOT REAL BACON, YOU GUYS! (don't get fool like us) \nThe Caeser was reportedly good, but the mac and cheese looked very disappointing and we saw it coming from the microwave. \n\nHonestly, from one game enthusiast \/ foodie to another: stay away.
