What can I say? I love this place. It's simple, easy, and relatively inexpensive for what you get. I've had every type of bruschetta but my favorites are the smoked salmon with capers, arugula\/burrata\/bacon, mascarpone\/fig\/prosciutto, and the apple\/fig\/Brie. I also love the Autostrada sandwich with focaccia bread. If you're feeling healthy, the Hannah's Field salad I could eat every day. It comes with kale, quinoa, Fuji apple, apricot, almonds and a few other things that escape me and a delicious apple cider mustard vinaigrette.  Who can forget their incredible five until five happy hour they have every day? Pictchers of beer and all glasses of wine only five bucks! It can be pretty dangerous! I've always had good service here, and at the other locations so I'm not sure what other reviewers are talking about but overall this is a chill, good place to relax, have a drink, and eat some good food.
