Yasu Sushi is porn for your taste buds. \n\nI've wracked my brains for a fitting analogy and that's the closest I can come. (Pun intended.) \n\nToday I had lunch here with a friend. Between the two of us, we had two rolls of tuna and salmon nigiri, a large bowl of miso soup, a salad, the most beautifully prepared grilled black cod glazed with some special exotic sauce I've ever tasted in my life, and a beef stir fry to top it all off. We basically stuffed our fat faces full of mind-blowing, top notch Japanese cooking, and what did the total bill come to? 39 stinking bucks, before tip. \n\nThat, folks, is obscene. It's a gross violation of any community's decency standards. It's so good you'll need to keep looking around to make sure no one's watching as you indulge. When the bill came (pun intended), I was reminded of when a buddy and I were little kids and discovered a secret stash of Playboy magazines in the park behind my house. As we devoured the delightful visions we'd never seen before with our rapacious, prepubescent eyes, we knew we had to get the hell out of there soon because surely this was too good to be true and some freak was going to pounce on us any minute. And so it is with Yasu, where I intend to come, and come, and come again as long as I can.
