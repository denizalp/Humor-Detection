Nice, small hotel in Downtown Toronto. Good location. Minimal lobby, etc but you can get snacks.\n\nWhat I DID get during my stay was back to back theatrics by the couple next door. I'm not much into being a voyeur...but it was so loud that it felt like they were sitting right next to me. Luckily, while each episode was loud they were both relatively brief...although I did learn that someone seemed to like getting slapped quite a bit.\n\nIt's not a bad hotel and its in a good spot...just make sure you bring headphones.
