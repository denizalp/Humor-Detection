It was just okay.  The Filafel was pretty okay.  I do not like their yogurt sauce.  Did not even taste like yogurt.  The pita was soft & chewy at the same time, and was really good.\n\nTheir Schwarma was lame.  I don't even think they used a spick for it.  It just tasted\/felt like pan fried steak.  Very little flavor.\n\nI would not go back there again.   \n\nThe workers are very nice, but the food was just too bland for me.  \n\nI want to warn that I may be a bit biased: I've been to Israel and I've had awesome Filafel & Schwarma in Europe & Turkey, and this does not even come close to the stuff you buy in the streets over there.\n\nOddly enough, the best Filafel I ever had was in Paris.  So don't let me ruin your experience there.  However, all I can recommend is their Filafel; and it's not a 'glowing' recommendation, but it was okay.
