This maybe a cool spot for younger or able-bodied citizens that live in the downtown area.  However,  for those that are disabled this place is a disaster.  The handicapped parking is on the far end of the parking lot. Free parking is 2 blocks away, most importantly,  there is a huge step to enter the property. Once inside, during the day it took awhile to adjust to the darkness.  The large space, pool tables, comfortable pod setting, well-organized music venue, throwback skeeball games and outside atrium is a perfect hipster retreat. I didn't try the food, the distance from the front door was too far, after struggling to get inside with my cane and service animal.
