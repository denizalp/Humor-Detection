Rooms are decent, friendly staff. I was first out in room 1603, right next to elevator. Very loud from the elevator shaft so I asked to be moved. They immediately accommodated me. The building just may not be well insulated, as you can hear a lot of noise in the hall ways and from the streets too. Beds are comfortable and room was very clean. One small pet peeve, no outlets on nightstands for electronics.
