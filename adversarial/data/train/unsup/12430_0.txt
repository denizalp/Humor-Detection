I still had $12 on my gift gard so I stopped by and grabbed a BURGER on the way home since this week I had already tried all the BBQ.\n\nIt was a tough choice but I went for the Devil's Spit Bacon Burger!\n\nNo Suprise! It was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. \n\nCooked to perfection medium well with a nice layer of bbq sauce cooked into it \n\nTopped with a toasted bun & cheese,crispy bacon,lettuce,tomato and crunchy Hell-Fire pickles.\n\nI don't think I took 1 breath until this thing was GONE!\n\nI can't wait to go back for another! Maybe they need a drive-thru? \n\nWhat is the BEST Chain Restaurant Burger you've ever had?\n\nRed Robin vs TGI Fridays vs Famous Dave's\n\nI'm gonna check more thoroughly.
