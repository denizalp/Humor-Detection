I really wanted to like this place, I really did. It looked so cool and had a neat menu. I didn't mind the 30 minute wait for my table, but...\nFirst of all the place was absolutely chaotic! Servers, food runners and bussers running into each other. I watched a table get wiped down 3 times by 3 different people with a dirty cloth that smelled like a school cafeteria. There seemed to be no communication with each other bc everyone seemed confused. I ordered a juice which took longer than it should bc they have one juice area and it was crowded with servers. \nNow for what I really minded...\nMy food took about 35 minutes to come out and when it did, it was all wrong and tasted terrible. Hash browns are made in house but even after ordering them crispy, they came out wet and undercooked in the center. The only thing crispy was the outside. My eggs were ordered over medium but came out so undercooked. Just white slime on top. The sausage links are butterflied and you get 2 links instead of 3 like every other breakfast place. They obviously slice them so it looks like more. I didnt really mind that bc I can never finish 3, but I didn't like the taste. My English muffin was thick and doughy, not toasted. DISASTER! I just sent it back and asked for a pancake after they offered me something else. It never came...\nIt was a complete waste of an hour and a half that I could have had for holiday shopping!  The 2 stars are for the really nice hostesses up front
