My company tried Kale for daily lunch delivery service and loved it! After a one week trial run, we have decided to continue getting lunch delivered Monday thru Friday. Not everyone at our office eats healthy, all the time. So, we figured it would be nice if our employees ate at least one healthy meal a day. And, a healthy lunch makes for a more productive team! We save a lot of time too, as we no longer have to answer the inevitable daily question in our office \"What do you want for lunch today?\" Now, we know we'll be all eating a lunch made with high quality ingredients that not only tastes great, but is healthy too, everyday! Chef Kristen is very creative and gets even the most unhealthy of eaters to enjoy real food. Highly recommended for small or large companies wishing to save time and increase productivity.
