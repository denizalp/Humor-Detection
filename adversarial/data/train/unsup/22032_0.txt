I am totally not surprised about Tiger W's review.  I would NOT step foot in this shop after watching how an employee hit and yelled - 'What's wrong with you?' - at a little boy (maybe her son) who looked like he was 2yrs old.  How can I expect the animals to be treated well if she is mistreating her own son?????
