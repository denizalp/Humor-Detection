I just recently heard about Ranch House.  For the longest time, I still thought it was Cadillac Ranch.  On the Saturday before Halloween, I discovered that it changed to the Ranch House Kitchen.  A couple of friends and I, attended a Cross fit party and wanted to try a few appetizers during our visit.\n\nFor the appetizers, we got the 8 piece buffalo fingers (medium) for $11.95 and the Ultimate Quesadilla for $7.95.  The chicken fingers were nothing special.  Just your typical fingers, didn't really stand out for me.  I didn't like the buffalo sauce.  I thought it was too tangy and borderline sour.  For the quesadilla, we got the pulled chicken.  The quesadilla is filled with shredded cheddar, jalapenos (charred), caramelized onions and pico de gallo.  My thoughts?  Super inauthentic.  Very generic and not impressed at all.  \n\nWhen I started Yelping, I knew that I would have to be comfortable with giving not-so-stellar reviews.  I didn't give a lower rating because I appreciate the country theme.  I'm a big fan of country restaurants and bars because of the wooden accents and the character and vibe it offers.  You should definitely check it out for yourself.  The location is prime and in the middle of Town Square.  I, on the other hand, probably wouldn't suggest this place in the future, but on the other hand, wouldn't be opposed to revisiting if ever put in that opportunity.
