Woody's may be a good neighbourhood pub, with establishments across the city, but that doesn't mean I like going here.\n\nMy beef with Woody's comes from the dirty old men that frequent the place.  As a younger girl out with a couple of other younger girlfriends, it is not uncommon to be hit on, gawked at, or even touched by some old pervert who has had one too many to drink.  I find that Woody's has more of these people than any other pub in the city, which makes it a no go for me.\n\nI suppose the prices are alright and the food is fine, but that's not enough to make me want to go here anymore.  Even if I was with a giant, heavy-weight champion dude I still wouldn't want to go.  It's dirty and dingy and full of nasty older men.\n\nSo sorry, Woody's, you need a new clientele to make me want to visit your establishment.
