LOVED it.  Great food.  Great wine.  Great service.\n\nWe'll be back.  No question.\n\nSalad was great.  Appropriately sized.  Not a salad mountain like many places.  (What is up with those kind of spots?  They serve you enough roughage to feed a rugby team.)\n\nMeatballs were soooo good...and so was the pizza.  We ordered one with ricotta and mushrooms.  You could tell that they sauteed the mushrooms before even putting them on the pizza.  As it should be!  And it rocked.\n\nGo.
