Scarborough Nissan provided the worst service I have ever experienced. In fact it was so bad that I walked out before they even started.  I made an appointment for 10:30am and had been told when booking the appointment that it would take 2-3 hours and it would be no problem to shuttle me to a location within the shuttle boundaries.  I arrived on time for my appointment and was told that 10:30 was just an appointment to \"check in\", not to have the car serviced at that time.  Apparently all an appointment means is that you get priority over walk-ins.  They said it could be hours more.  I was also told it could be an hour or more before they could shuttle me anywhere as the shuttle had recently left and they had no idea how long it would be.  This dealership shows zero respect for customers' time. Like most people, I could not just leave the car with no idea how long I may be waiting there - perhaps all day, so I had no choice but to leave. I did not even receive an apology from the employee I was dealing with - I was spoken too as if I was an idiot for not understanding that appointments do not mean that the car will be dealt with in a timely manner.  Horrible experience. I will never return to this dealership.
