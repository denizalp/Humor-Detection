I have been procrastinating on getting new tires for my SUV, but after realizing the tread was dangerously low my quest for tires began! \n\nMy other half and I pulled out all stops to get the right tire for the right price. I ended up at Discount Tire, they made it happen and I got a better tire at a lower price. \n\nPat searched tirelessly to meet our expectations and Brooks brought it all together in the end. Between the two of them, I was able to get some really nice Perrelli's mounted, balanced, installed all in the same day in and out in less than an hour!
