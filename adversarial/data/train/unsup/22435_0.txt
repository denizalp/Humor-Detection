I need some flyers printed up and looked them up and found out they are the cheapest in town. 28 cent color copies 4 cent b&w copies.\nPerfect copies, great price but customer service was lacking..and BTW..they were not American..LOL\nNot that it matters.\nI will for sure come back tho..u can't beat the prices!
