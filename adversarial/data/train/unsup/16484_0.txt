Just a chain lovers mall without a roof!  \n\nNot impressed with Crocker Park at all!  Place is filled with mostly chain stores that you can find anywhere else.  Shoppers are mostly teens driving around their mom and dads BMW's & Mercedes.  Traffic is a nightmare, and they actually make you pay for parking?  There is no convenience here, as there is never any street level parking available.  You have to pay to park in a garage & walk to the store that you want to shop at.  With the biggest mall in Cleveland right in my backyard, I have zero interest in shopping here!  Crocker Park is not worth the hassle, or extra expense!  Not to mention that Crocker Park has half the stores\/restaurants.
