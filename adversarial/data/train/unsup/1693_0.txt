This Esso right at the corner of Hwy 7 and East Beaver Creek can gets pretty busy during Rush hours....seems like a convenient gas station for people working at \"Beaver Creek\" to fill up before hitting 404.\n\nSmall and outdated.. I usually avoid filling up here especially during weekday from 4:30-5:30 pm\n\nNo car wash... small dirty bathroom...
