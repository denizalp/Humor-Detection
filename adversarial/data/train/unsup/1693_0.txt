Their customer service Was horrible because after I went home with my car, I noticed on the knob below the \"touch screen mouse\" there was a chip on it and I know I didn't make that because it's been less than a week since purchased. So I called and ask to get it check out. When I arrived, the lady seemed like I made the chip myself. She asked me so much questions about if I wear any jewelry (which I don't at all) or if I dropped something on it. There was an actual piece chipped off, I highly doubt jewelry or something falling on it can cause a chip since their vehicles are supposed to be high quality right? (The best or nothing) they replaced the knob within 24 hours which was nice, I guess. \nAfter few months with my car, I came here for an oil change as well since it was one time complimentary, I might as well get it. This time Dennis serviced me, I only remember his name because he provided excellent customer service. Within 2-3 hours I got a text back from him saying my car is ready to be picked up. When I got in my car, my floor mats and a pair of shoes I leave in my back seat were just thrown onto the seat and it was nice that they vacuumed my car but, really? Just toss my stuff onto the seat? Thanks... \nOnly reason this place gets 3 stars is because of Dennis
