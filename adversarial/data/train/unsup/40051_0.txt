I only give this 5stars because of Dr. Ezell. I have brought several of my pets here, and unlike EVERY other vet on the planet, INCLUDING the one I worked for in college, Dr. Ezell is VERY knowledgeable, VERY thorough & even though it was painfully obvious I was willing to do anything for my poor little Brussels Griffon Petít Brabaçon including dropping tons of coin, he assured me her little pink belly turned black was just a little reaction to spending more time outside. \n\nInstead of running up bills on bloodwork, doing scrapings to test for scabies, etc, he repeatedly assured me she was fine and insisted we just keep an eye on her and maybe give her a Benadryl if she seemed itchy. This was the difference between a possible $300+ bill and the $40 office visit he charged me for! \n\nDr. Ezell is a genius and a godsend and is part of the reason I am reluctant to move from vegas. Once you have a true professional & one who cares about your pets and not raping your wallet in the meantime, it's hard to think of leaving - especially if you have a gang of dogs and cats you consider family members! \n\nThank you Dr. Ezell, and although my kitty is with you right now in a very sick state, I can only sleep well knowing you're caring for him.\n\nMarina
