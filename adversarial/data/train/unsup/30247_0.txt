Disclaimer: I'm not vegan but I still love this restaurant!!!\n\nFirst of all, the food at Fresh is DELICIOUS. No, this restaurant is not the same as freshii (you'd be surprised how many of my friends made this mistake) and no, vegan food is not just salad. \n\nI really recommend the banquet burger or the bbq burger; if you're craving a burger this will definitely satisfy you (even though it's completely meat-less). I also recommend the onion rings with chipotle sauce, trust me it's really addictive. \n\nIf you're in the mood for something more healthy my go-to is always the Buddha bowl (the baby size bowl is more than enough) with rice. Something about the peanut sauce mixing with the rice and the veggies is just magical honestly
