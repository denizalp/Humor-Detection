China Poblano was more like China Problemo with indifferent service and mediocre food despite interesting drinks.\n\nIt's not good Chinese food and it's not good Mexican food ... it's also not good fusion food unless you consider \"sweet plus bland\" a flavor.\n\nOlivia started with the Jade Garden Cocktail ($14) with Cilantro-infused Milagro Tequila, Sichuan Peppercorn, Lime, and Makrut Lime. It sounds interesting, right? It was. It also was the only thing I'd order again. My Salt Air Margarita ($14) also sounded cool being Jose Andres personal creation and all. It wasn't ... as the foam distracted from the tequila.\n\nFor food, I ordered a couple of my go-to-favorite Tacos: Lengua ($6 each). The Beef Tongue was tender (as expected), but the somehow sweet Salsa Pasilla was the only flavor. Tacos are a simple food, but I don't know if I've ever had more bland, yet sweet tacos in my life.\n\nAn even worse choice was the Ants Climbing a Tree noodles ($14.88) dish which Olivia hoped would bring back fond memories of eating this while growing up in China. Sadly, the thin glass noodles were mushy disappointment with a flavor that was neither fusion nor Chinese.\n\nDespite still being hungry, we simply paid the check and headed over to STK for drinks & dinner instead of wasting any more time finding out what other problems exist at China Poblano.
