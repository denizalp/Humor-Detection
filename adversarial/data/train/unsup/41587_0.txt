Made a reservation thru Open Table for 6:00 on a Friday night. Really didn't need a reservation, plenty of room (was busy when we left). Hostess sat us next to the dance floor. I guess it's the \"best spot in the house\" when the dancing and live music starts. \nWe ordered the Pulled Pork, She's a Hottie Wrap and Grilled Chicken Wrap. Only complaint on food was the grilled chicken on the wrap was rubbery. The Pulled Pork was delicious. \n***Only thing I would change*** I was seated right next to the garbage can for the wait staff\/bussers. I wish they would have side guards on the can so I wouldn't feel and splash of anything coming off of plates or cups. Really kinda gross!
