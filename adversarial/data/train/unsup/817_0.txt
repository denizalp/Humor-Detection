Love this place!  Terroir has a classy elegance with a down-home down-to-earth vibe. They often have live music or dj (sophisticated music, not loud) which adds to spice to the place.\n\nService is efficient and friendly. Like another reviewer stated, the servers\/bartenders will remember you and talk to you as much or as little as you'd like. They make you feel at home and comfortable. The other patrons at the bar are oftena also friendly and will join in chit-chat if you want to make friends.\n\nTheir HH wines are always $7 and huge pours! LOVE THEM! In addition I have eaten some of their food. Its pretty tasty and flavorful, just wish they had more salads and healthy choices to choose from\n\nThe biggest downside of this place is that it is not located closer to my house in Oldtown. If it was, I would own a stool and never leave. :)
