DO NOT GO TO THESE SCAM ARTISTS..I went here on 5\/9 because I had a toothache..  The gave me an exam and said I needed 3 root canals, wisdom tooth pulled, and a deep cleaning.  Which all of this came to over 3,000.00 and it gets better for the root canal and the wisdom tooth said i had to go to a specialist that it would be more on top of that.\nSo I declined and decided to go back to my dentist that was way over on the other side of town.  Well, he told me all i needed was a deep filling for one tooth and a regular cleaning and the wisdom tooth to be removed which costed $395.00!!  If you want a great dentist go see Dr Chiang in Gilbert, AZ he is awesome and honest!  Don't fall for these scam chain dentists that are crooks and just looking to make $$.
