I went to this location today cause I had to return a product for my husband; he was looking for a specific brand that they didn't carry.  Anyways, the general manager (according to his tag) was absolutely rude during the return process (his name was Andy according to my receipts).  He was polite the day before when I bought the product, but today was a different story; I'm assuming he was about the return.  I would have liked to give this store a 1star, but my very first visit here was pleasant.  The guy working was polite & patient & answered my questions as best as he could; he was pretty well knowledgeable, unfortunately I cant remember his name
