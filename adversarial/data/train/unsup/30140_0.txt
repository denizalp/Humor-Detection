I adopted a cat from Little Rascals several years ago and due to her demeanor and health, when it came time to adopt another we wouldn't go anywhere else. We got another cat who was just what we were looking for. Both of these cats are amazing and I love them very much. The first one was saved of the e-list by Little Rascals because she was a kitten and country doesn't bottlefeed them. Thank goodness for the kindness of volunteers who bottlefed her until she was ready to be adopted. The second cat was an adult, returned when his owner needed to return to her home country. Due to regulations she was unable to bring her cat with her. This organization took back the cat after being in this woman's care for nearly a year. Tha's what I love about them.  I had such a great experience that I recommended them to my in-laws who adopted 3 cats from them and my parents who adopted a dog.
