Ok, I am going to sound like a scrooge, but I don't particular like Toys R Us. I say this in spite of its awesome location just off of McKnight Rd (southern entrance to Ross Park Mall), and in spite of the fact that in any given school year, there are 50million birthday parties to attend.\n\nEvery time we are lured in by a promotion, there is a catch. A big catch!  This especially happened when purchasing much needed baby items. \n\nLast year we bought a rather large gym set\/playhouse from TRU. They no longer offer assembly but the set was at a pretty decent price compared to every other dealer we checked out. The catch? None of the parts were specifically marked to correspond to the directions. It took 3 truck loads to pick up all of the parts boxes and they weighed a ton!  Result? It took over 6 weeks for 3 highly educated, self starter types to construct .\n\nBack to the store. As a child, I fondly remember trips to the TRU equivalent, Children's Palace in Monroeville. It was a magical place and so where the employees. Each one, regardless of age, seemed to hold close to heart the joy of being a kid.A far cry from the present day TRU associate. Mechanical and business like. Perhaps they have seen one too manyspoiled, children demanding more. Who knows. All I know it isn't a funeral home, it's a toy store. Mr Magorium's Emporium it's not, but how about some smiles.
