The clerk at this UPS location in the north part of Downsview is very professional and helpful. Just one problem. Only one staff person on the counter and a long line up. And I have a disability that makes it painful to stand for long periods. And every single seat in the UPS Centre was taken up by people waiting for packages or their friends or their kids! So I had to stand. And stand. Because I had to sign for a delivery :( So either UPS hires one more staff member, or gets more seating, or gets a bigger office with more room for customers! I don't look forward to ever having to do another pick up, let alone something I want to deliver here! NOT disabled friendly at all.
