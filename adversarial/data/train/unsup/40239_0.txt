What an unexpected find this place was. We dined downstairs vs the traditional dinner show upstairs but still had a fabulous time. The atmosphere and employees really make the experience. They're really good at staying in character. Be aware that the entertainment is mostly in french, so if you don't understand you may feel a little left out. They did sing a few songs in english for us which was nice. We were also pleased by their willingness to accommodate for my wife who is celiac and they even prepared the poutine for her and she had no issues. Definitely recommend.
