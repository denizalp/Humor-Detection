I'm literally salivating right now while reminiscing about about the poke I had here.\nThe guy at the counter was so nice, he let us sample about 5 or 6 different things since we were having trouble deciding what to get.  We went for the ahi furikake with avocado, the spicy ahi with masago and mayo and the seaweed salad with 2 sides of rice.  Everything was soooo good.  I wish We could have taken better photos but we just wanted to eat!  I will definitely be returning to this place when I'm back in Vegas.
