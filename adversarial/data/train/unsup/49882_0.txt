First impressions are good very clean well organized dining room very friendly staff welcomes you as soon as you walk in the door willing to explain about their menu I ordered a mushroom and onion  can mushrooms and white mushrooms pizza nothing spectacular taste just like Papa John's even smell like them too very corporate place Papa John's Domino's any large chain place will be the same thing prices are average may go back to try something else but nothing to go out of your way for
