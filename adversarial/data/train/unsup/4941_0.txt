Half a star for the food. 4 stars for the beers. The patio is nice and offers a nice view but honestly I will never eat there again. We left all of our dishes half full. I would grab a beer there though because they have some rare stuff usually on tap. Went there during football season and was watching a game and cheering for my squad but the bartender and his boys were talking so much crap about my team that it wasn't even worth responding to. Paid my tab and left their nasty half eaten food on the table. Ice Cold wings? Nah, I'm good.
