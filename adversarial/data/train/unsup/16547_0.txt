**I am prefacing this with the fact that the employee and her husband are lovely people, it is the owner Maria who was heinous.\n\nI just picked up my shirt to discover that a botched stain removal turned into fake Louis Vuitton being sewn onto my pockets without consent. The owner since yelled at me, telling me my shirt is cheap and that she made the design better (the shirt is from Anthropologie and cost well over $125, not that it matters).\n\nThey refused to give my money back and did not refund the cost of the dry cleaning. I still can barely fathom that this has happened. \n\nHere's a link to the photo and story. It's completely shocking. http:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/kvHhmVv\/
