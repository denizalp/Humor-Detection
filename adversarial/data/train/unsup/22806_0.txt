This is a nice addition to the Green Valley Ranch Hotel and Casino.\n\nI must say, whoever they have working on their social media marketing campaign is worth all the money because they're doing one hell of a job! They have a strong presence on almost all my social media platforms and that was one of the reasons I wanted to check them out.\n\n-They offered free Margaritas upon check-in with Yelp.\n\n-They have fun, interactive Facebook posts.\n\n-They even have a Snap Chat Geotag!\n\nThe decor is beautiful and warm. The plates are too die for! So cute and perfect for their theme. You could tell they recently opened because the wait staff seemed like they were still getting the hang of things but they were all super nice and helpful!\n\nThe menu was kind of blah. I expected there to be a lot more fun options but it was a pretty standard menu. I'm hoping they expand it once they've gotten going a bit. What we did eat was made well and it was tasty though!\n\nTheir little slogan is:\n\nTequila for the Soul, Tacos for the Heart.\n\nHow could you not love that??
