I love allegiant airlines. It is my favorite airlines. I love the service. Although I went to the group interview in Arizona which it was totally crazy to spend so much money to travel there from Hawaii and didn't get the Job never doing that again unless I'm living in the mainland. I thought I wasted time to get a job as a Flight Attendant. I wish Allegiant would have paid for my flight there and my rent a car which I flew on the same aircraft. I wish they would have gave me the chance because I came all the way from Hawaii which I knew I came by far the farthest than anyone that attended the interview. I notice that the second interview people were people that live there in Arizona.
