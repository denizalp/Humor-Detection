Food was excellent! We started with the deconstructed maki roll & that was by far my favorite part of the meal. It was everything inside sushi. Amazing! My husband really enjoyed his salmon & the shrimp bowl was delicious. We also fought over the last piece of the untraditional cheesecake. Highly recommend. Great wait staff. Jamie was a doll!
