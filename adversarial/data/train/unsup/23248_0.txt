Are you f%#^ing PHO real right now? Never again. Save yourself the heartache and stick to our old faithful down the street- Pho Kim Long.\n\nThe waiter asked 4 times what I wanted and it still came out wrong; The vegan pho as is with rare steak on the side.. Strange, I know. But straight forward. The veggies were almost nonexistent. I had 4 pieces of broccoli, 4 mushrooms that couldn't have been washed because they tasted exactly how toilet water smells, and shredded carrot. No baby boks (boo) and 3 baby corns. It was pathetic. I'm actually very annoyed I spent a cheat meal here. \n\nService was..... Yeah. Exactly that. No one brought me a water with lemon. I had to ask for an extra water because they just decided they weren't going to give J one. Not to mention, no one ever informed us of the $4.99 special. \n\nThe only thing keeping me from giving it 1 star were the nam nuong rolls and the fact that I checked in to use the 10% off of $30 and they accepted it even though it wasn't $30, which honestly, they should have done anyway because the cashier asked me how our meal was and I politely let him know it was pretty terrible. But he made excuses about how they didn't make much vegan pho so that's why after 3 months of being open, my vegan pho was so awful. Hm. \n\nAll I gotta say is... Good phoking luck leaving here satisfied..
