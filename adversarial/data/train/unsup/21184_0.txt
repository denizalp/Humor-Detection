Lighthouse Management recently purchased this property and the property at 1550 Fahrenheit.  I miss the OLD management staff\n\nHere's my review of the current property management\/manager.\n\nThe community recently had a burglary; 27 residents information was compromised, and notices were put on everyone's door, (including myself).  This is a very small community, if the current management staff cared, they should have contacted everyone by phone as well as the notices on the door.  But, of course no one has 'time' for that.  They are too busy renovating the office, but since their personal information was not compromised, they could care less.  Great job Lighthouse.\n\n\nAs a supervisor and current property manager, I would expect more from the current property manager at The Marq at 1600 in Las Vegas, NV.  I was very disturbed and disgusted at the treatment I received from Patricia Scurry (Property Manager).  No friendly greeting, she seemed as if she was in a hurry to get me out of the office, none of the forms I asked for were in stock.  I mean, where do they find these people when you hire them??? Oh my...  If no one else will make a complaint, I surely will.  Of course, nothing will be done but, I will let EVERYONE know before they think about becoming a resident at The Marq at 1600.  My Property Management company has goals, standards, and practices.  Customer service is one of them.  Maybe, in this case, the standards and practices for Lighthouse needs to be reviewed with Patricia.  You never know who you will encounter, so it's best to be nice with EVERYONE that walks into the office. \n There's no excuse for her behavior.  And as a Property Manager I expect NOTHING LESS.\n\n\n--Maddi
