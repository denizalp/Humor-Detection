Really disappointed in TextBroker customer service. The system let a handful of authors drop my order causing the delivery to be way too late. After having a local copywriter write my content I was actually told to message the author asking them to drop the order. Then I was told I had to manually cancel the order faster than the system could allow another author to pick it up.. Endless cycle. \n\nAfter one customer service chat that was completely apathetic I got the same run around from rep number two that gave a snarky passive 'apology'. Beware. TextBroker will not support customer issues. Now I have to fill out forms in order to get the rest of my balance credited to me. \n\nSearch for other ways to get your content.
