Delicious beer, even delicious-er pasties. If I could live here, I would. \n\nThere's maybe nothing I would improve upon except slightly faster service. But even then, I've never gone here while I was in a rush so that's never been a major issue. \n\nThe Pilgrim is my favorite, but my friend recently ordered the beef abodobe or something like that and it looked so good I thought about murdering him so I could take it. Ultimately I decided I was too full to eat it, but that guy knows to watch his back now.
