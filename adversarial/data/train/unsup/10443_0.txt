These Charming Charlie stores are overwhelming with a capital O. The amount of rings, necklaces, purses, earrings, bling, glitz, sparkle, estrogen and pleather is off the charts. Thank the Gods of accesorizing that they organize everything by color because, holy crap. I wouldn't be able to handle it if everything were jumbled together like a flea market. My head would pop off in a spray of sequins and fake gold links. \n\nI walk up to the cashier with my one little $6 fake gold ring and feel pretty damn proud of myself when she says \"that's it?\" with a smile on her face. \n\nI'm all... \"hell yeah that's it! I almost lost my mind in this place. I'm proud of my one, tiny, insignificant ring. Bish.\"\n\nThe ladies working here are comically nice. They're all, \"can I help you find anything?\" and I'm all, \"um... No. Unless you found my OCD cowering somewhere on a shelf with the purses and sandals... I'm good.\"
