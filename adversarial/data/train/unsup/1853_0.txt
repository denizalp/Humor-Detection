I stop into Yummy Grill regularly for Happy Hour.  They have a high standard for their fish, serve a quality products across the board, and their HH is a great value.  They also typically have a Yelp Deal going with a Check-in, though not always compatible with HH Specials. \n\nI have not explored most of the menu since I normally come for HH.  HH has a good amount of options, and one of my favorite things to order off the that menu is the Chef's Special Roll.  It changes based on what they have in at the time and also based on what other rolls you order...but it is always excellent!  They are an easy 4 stars in my book...maybe even 4.5 stars.
