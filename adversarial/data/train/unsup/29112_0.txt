This place is STRAIGHTFORWARD. Just pure, phenomenal ramen. Simple one-page menu, which I liked. I ordered their shoyu ramen (chicken-based) with added black garlic oil. Broth was hot and heavenly. Noodles smooth yet complex, I don't know, it was crazy. And chashu just melts. I also didn't feel the need to nap afterwards. A+ for sure. Will be back.
