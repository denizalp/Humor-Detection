Ate here for brunch. Guess maybe I should have shopped around a little more. It is one of the cheaper options for the buffets located on the strip. It's not bad it's just underwhelming. I think if you can afford it you are better off paying a little more and going to some of the more highly rated buffets. The variety isn't bad but the quality is what brings the rating down for me. It's definitely better than going than the Golden Corral but with so many great food choices in Vegas it's hard to recommend.
