Y'know how it is, when you haul those leftover meatballs from the freezer, type in 2:22 on the old microwave, stand there watching the carousel?  *ding*  Cut into that big ol ball o' meat and... and... uh-oh.  Still cold on the inside!\n\nYeah, that shouldn't happen at ANY restaurant.  For ANY price.  \n\nHappened.  Last night.  At Tre Belle.\n\nI can count on one hand the number of times I've refused food.  (Yeah, I'm counting jail, wise guy.)  I refused the waitress' suggestion they \"heat it up.\"  Why?  Let's see:  Because I ordered it heated up?  Unless it was preparted al dente?  Or perhaps \"Meatball Tartare?\"  Or like eggs, \"over easy?\"\n\n\"The little man walked up and down\nTo find an eating place in town.\nHe read the menu, through and through\nTo see what fifteen bucks would do.\n\n\"One (semi-thawed inedible) meatball.\"\n\n-- Josh White, adjusted for inflation
