First of all let say that this restaurant pays a company to give them good reviews...the reason I know this is bc the owners daughter goes to school with me and told me about the company. \nWe walked in this place around 5ish thinking it will be fresh dinner. This place was completely empty. The hostess sat us way in the back of this filthy place. She brought us warm water with no ice In it and cups were dirty. We looked at the menu and decided to get the spinach samosas which I love! Theses samosas were grossed and tasted like they were frozen in the freezer for a while, it didn't have the cheese or the nuts in which the menu claimed it did. I ordered the dinner platter that came with few different meats chicken, lamb, kabob all DISGUSTING! There was more caramelized onions on the platter than anything else. The rice was super cold...it looked like prison food served in metal bowls. I love Indian food but this place grossed me out. My husband ordered couple things from the menu his was even worse. Everything tasted the same. I gotta say though the only good thing was their Nan, bc it was freshly made. Crapy service with crapy food! I told the server I didn't like my food but she didn't seem to give a damn. Never again am I going to this place to eat even if it was for free.
