Slacking on these reviews,, but trying to get back into it :D. \n\nDecided to come here because we were staying at MGM and didn't want to go through the hassle of going to another hotel and rushing back to get ready to go out. I made the reservation day of at around 3 pm for 14 people and told them that we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday and they were able to accommodate.\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant, we were led to this little room near the wine rack. It was nice because there was a sliding door that separated us from everybody else, so we kind of got a private room. When we sat down and looked at the menu, it had \"Happy Birthday Eric!\" on the top. I was so surprised! 5 Stars for printing out new menus just for us :) Service was amazing. Always checked up on us and everybody who served us was very professional and friendly. \n\nThe menu is not too extensive, but there was a good variety of food. I ordered the ribeye and the fried calamari. The fried calamari was light and delicious, but I've never had bad fried calamari. The ribeye was very good. Cooked perfectly medium rare. Came with potatoes and some veggies. The glaze was a little on the sweet side, but not too overbearing. I was also able to try the chicken breast and let me tell you, it was the juiciest chicken I have ever had. Probably would get this the next time we come here. The food did take a little while to come out, but I think it was cause they wanted to serve us all at the same time. \n\nAll in all, food was good, service was amazing, and boy did they make us feel special. Last but not least, we had a party of 14 and they didn't even charge the 18% gratuity!! Our waiter told us that he was leaving it up to us, but of course we gave the 18% for the wonderful service we received. \n\nTAKEAWAYS: \n+ service!!!
