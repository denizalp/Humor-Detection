You know how most chicks love Michael's?\nThink of this place as the Michael's for dudes.\n\nAisle after aisle of craft beers. \nHandles of everything including Jager.\nAnd when they say Total Wine, they're not kidding. I saw wines from practically every country in the world except maybe Somalia or those really sandy, oily countries. \n\nThey even have a tasting room, which you'll want to get the schedule app'd into your Iphone like right now. \n\nIf there was ever a Mecca for the budding alcoholic, this place is it. \nWell maybe not exactly Mecca, since you'll likely be facing south after coming here.
