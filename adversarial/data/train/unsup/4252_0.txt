I was done fornicating with a cast member from Glee a few weeks back and we wanted some tasty Chinese food and I said, \"hey, let's drive out through Broadview Heights and get some new and exciting Asian food in North Royalton.\"\n\nWhew. That was a long sentence. And that was two fragments. No, three. I digress. This place has changed. It used to just be GUM DO and then about fifteen years ago they got a new sign and it became THE NEW GUM DO and it has been new ever since. Thank God for that.\n\nIt is awesome to get little drippy boxes of Asian authenticity from this place and the people are so nice in there. You get the sense that they appreciate that someone is actually going to buy food there and well, you feel special.\n\nI ordered two full-size dinners because they're really small but I was touched by the generosity from the nice woman who gave us two large blocks of congealed rice. Two big ones instead of the two little ones you get everywhere else. \n\nI don't remember what I ordered but, who am I kidding - it's all basically stew, right? They got this kind of stew and that kind of stew and well, that's fine but what's with thirty variations on the theme? Maybe they're copying Michael Symon who roasts a couple of pigs and finds a dozen expensive ways to make it seem different. \"Mmmm, tastes like a really expensive pork chop only it's the pig's face! Amazing! Genius!\" You get the point.\n\nNEW GUM DO is good at making stew with chicken in it and pork and beef but the shrimp dishes are yucky because they fly the shrimp in from Bangladesh and they aren't dying in this hemisphere so they aren't very fresh. The egg rolls are dark and greasy and will stain the hotel sheets worse than an Alton Brown Sardine and Avocado sandwich.\n\nMy fortune said, \"That the future beholds is certain\"\n\nSo, I got that going for me.
