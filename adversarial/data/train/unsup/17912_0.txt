took a tired & cranky pal directly from the airport to Oscar's in search of some red meat and drinks to soothe her weary bones. we showed up around 5:00pm on Friday evening & caught Happy Hour at the bar. (there's a bunch of drink & appetizer specials, plus we each got a free glass of wine for checking in on Yelp.) comfy barstools, lots of room for us to spread out and eat, convenient purse-hooks under every seat. the only ding for ambiance is that the bar was SUPER loud (and only got louder about halfway into our meal) and i could barely talk to my friend without SCREAMING at her. service-wise, Steve was a gem. (not to mention fine as helllll. hey boo hey.)\n\nthe food was delicious. i had the beef carpaccio. (which was on special for $9, usually it's $17.) next time i'll order it sans capers, but the beef & mustard aoili were both delicious. i also had the burrata & heirloom tomato salad with microgreens which was killer. my friend had the spicy flank steak, which was insane. i may have to get it next time. if you're the type of person to get excited about finding whole cloves of spicy garlic hiding in your steak, this is the dish for you.\n\nif you're staying downtown and craving steak, Oscar's is an extremely solid choice. (but i'd stick to Happy Hour if you're not looking to spend $$$$.) my only reason for withholding that 5th star is the loudness of the music\/stereo system. nobody wants to be screaming at their dinner companion at 5:00pm, yo.
