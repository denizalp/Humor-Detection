Every time we go see a movie at the Pollack Theaters, we always leave plenty of time beforehand for a dinner at Yupha's. We love our Thai food and Yupha's is one of my two favorite Thai places in the valley (the other being Thai Spices in Mekong). \n\nI always get Pad Thai every time I go to Thai restaurants...I really wish I could try more things but I can never stray from Pad Thai! Arrrgh. Anyways, I love the Pad Thai here but one unfortunate thing is the heat fluctuates each time we come.\n\nThe first time, I got hot and oooo-weeee my bowel movements hurt the next day! I ordered a step lower on the heat scale the next time, and I barely even felt a singe of heat. So it's kind of hit or miss if the level of heat is there that I want, but regardless the rest of the taste of the dish is the same and it's great. \n\nMy husband thankfully changes up his order each time we go so I can try more of their dishes. Everything he's ordered has been good. \n\nThe ambience and timeliness of the food is also a plus -- we don't have to panic about not making our movie on time because we're usually in and out in 40minutes tops. \n\nYupha's will always be a staple of our movie date nights.
