This place sucks so bad. I don't even know why people bother coming here when there's plenty of better choices around it. \n\nThe food here is so over priced for basic American food that I thought I was going die looking at menu. I went for a birthday and they wouldn't let our party sit down until everyone got there. \n\nOh god. When it came to ordering that was a disaster. Our server took my order and then walked away? Even when he came back five minutes later, it took him literally 20 minutes to get everyone's order. There was 11 of us...\n\nONE HOUR AND HALF LATER...\n\nI was the only one that got my sad soggy little island Caesar salad $7. No else got their food yet. Then slowly we got nachos and then that's it! No ones drink even came yet. So the birthday girl complained and their excuse was \"they wanted us to get our appetizers first\". Okay that's a lie. There was only two of us that got appetizers. Also our waters were never filled either! \n\nFinally one by one, every 5 minutes, the food was finally coming out! I got my chicken tenders $10 and it only came with 3 pieces? The buffalo sauce tasted just like red hot. \n\nWhen we got checks, our server just put all 11 checks on the center of the table. Too lazy. \n\nThis place is a tourist trap and I will never step foot into a rainforest cafe ever again.
