First tip, make reservations! We came on a busy night in Phoenix with games in both arenas and a variety of shows, but made reservations and were sat within minutes of arriving.  Portions are not huge (more than enough to fill you up though) , and quality is amazing!  Service was very helpful and friendly.\n\nGreat place, highly recommend!
