This place is an OK find for more natural produce.\nHowever, I get a tad disappointed in their fish and meats department.\n\nA lot of their fish is \"previously frozen\". Which means that they get it frozen, and then defrost it, and sell it to you. Meaning that you can't freeze it when you get home.... I guess it would be okay if you were going to eat it that night..... but still, that's gross to me....\n\n I can get previously frozen fish from just about any where.
