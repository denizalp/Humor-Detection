Went to breakfast on a beautiful Sunday morning. \nWanting to try something new, so we came across RnR. \nThey have a nice large patio, but there was a wait. \nSo we sat at the bar. \nThe menu was small for breakfast, but whatever as long as i get some food. \nThe bartender ask us what we like to drink, then she ask if we wanted to keep it open..... \nWell, we're having food here! She continue to ask for credit card. \nReally?!! I understand if it was sat. night at a bar, but it's Sunday morning and you can keep your eyes on your bar so people won't walk off?! \nBreakfast was limited, so i order a Grill Cheese Sandwich.  The bartender came back and said they're not serving lunch just yet.  Come on its a Grill Cheese!  and if you're just serving breakfast put a time on there so everyone would know.  Some how he talked them into it.  Let just say that i won't be in there anytime soon.  \nTop it off the bill came out wrong too....
