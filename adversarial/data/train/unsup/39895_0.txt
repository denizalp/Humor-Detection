Loved this spot! A lot of people had termed it a dive bar but I think its more of a warm cozy place with a nice little patio in the back. It was not too noisy when we arrived (earlier in the evening on a Friday night) and they had some good specials going on. I really enjoyed the banana infused bourbon - different and tasty!\n\nNice place to catch up with a friend or 2 over some drinks..
