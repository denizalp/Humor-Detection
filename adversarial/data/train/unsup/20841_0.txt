Segway is better than Subway. At least you can move around on a Segway. You eat too much Subway you won't be moving much.\n\nSeriously though it's not healthy stuff. The young man serving us here was perfectly nice, but I specifically didn't order anything because the food never is. We got 2 sandwiches between 4 of us, and if I can recall, 3 of us thought it was crap. But then I always think it's crap. One was a Ham Sub, the other was Chicken Teriyaki. Which tastes like sugary syrup, but then the bread tastes like sugar too. I can't with Subway.\n\nSo much good food in Pittsburgh. Can't believe that people still eat here. But hey, it's convenient. And that was our excuse too. I enjoyed my Orange Julius and some coffee from Gloria Jeans a lot more. And I don't even like Orange Juice - or drink coffee!
