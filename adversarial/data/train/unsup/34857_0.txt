Why one star?\n\nBecause there's no zero rating. \n\nTruly an awful buffet. \n\nThe geniuses at MGM have taken to squeezing money out of every orifice without regard to customer satisfaction. Rising resort fees. Parking fees. \n\nYou can see this Nickle and dime mentality at this buffet. First, it's $40. That's not a cheap meal. \n\nHowever the brain trust at MGM does everything they can to make certain they maximize profit. Paper napkins. Plastic cups. Except for clearing plates there's no table service whatsoever. Everything including drinks is self service. \n\nThe food is mediocre at best. Turkey roll not real turkey. Much of it looks like it's just reheated Costco fair. There's only one fresh station, a Japanese stir fry. That was decent. Everything else was forgettable. When the best item at the dessert station is soft serve ice cream you know the bean counters have been working on cost control. \n\nIf you want a cheaper buffet save yourself $$$ and go to harrahs. Food isn't great but it's also $10 cheaper. \n\nFor $10 more the buffet at caesars is worth the walk. \n\nPass MGM grand buffet by.
