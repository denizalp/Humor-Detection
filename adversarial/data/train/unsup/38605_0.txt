Have patronized this shop for a few years.  My office is within walking distance.  Prior to the remodeling over this past Summer, the bakery items were much fresher and they had a wide variety of made to order sandwiches.  Not anymore.  They are limited to pre-made sandwiches and salads which are marginal in taste and quality.  And, the pastries taste like they have been frozen. They also use to have a half-price Friday, every 2nd and 4th of the month.  No more.  My favorite has always been the red velvet brownie and today's was stale and definitely had been frozen.  I wish they still had the expanded lunch menu and the fresher pastries.  Disappointed.
