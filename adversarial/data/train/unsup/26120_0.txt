Went here with a large group (16) for a celebratory dinner.  The staff seemed to manage us ok relative to taking orders and bringing the food out, but thereafter, they seemed absent.\n\nFood was decent.  I got the traditional Korean BBQ short ribs, which in typical fashion, proved to be the traditionally greasy, fatty, and flavorful dish I expected.\n\nBYOB and Karaoke help distinguish Green Pepper over other offerings in the Squirrel Hill area, but don't over stay your welcome...  at closing time the staff abruptly shut down the karaoke gig and ushered us out.
