Everyone seems to be in a rush to try this place, I for one could not give a hoot as never heard of them before and it sounds more like a swear word than a food place.\n\nIt was pretty busy when I went but I guess with the location and being a new place that is is expected but we were seated quick.\n\nOkay so its nice inside, its new so it should be. The service was quick but nothing exceptional about it.\n\nI ordered what was the only mixed drink on the menu,  had various spices and had it certainly had a kick to it.\n\nTried Ramen for the first time so went with the pork, and either Ramen is just generally a tasteless  and oily dish or these guys just got it wrong. So plenty of hot sauce later I got something that I was able to kind of enjoy. \n\nPork buns were just as bad with the pork being so fatty and tasteless I might as well have been chewing on lard.\n\nWhy a big deal was made over this join I do not know but I will not be recommending it or trying Ramen again any time soon.
