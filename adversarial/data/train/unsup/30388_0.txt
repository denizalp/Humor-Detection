We had the most pleasant experience with Matthew Brown, owner of Northstar Services. He was knowledgable and efficient with cleaning out a very clogged dryer vent, showing us pictures of his progress along the way. His pricing is ridiculously low for the thorough service he provides. We highly recommend his service!
