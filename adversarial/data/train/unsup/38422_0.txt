The outside of this place gives no indication of the surprising eclectic inside. We enjoyed the most fantastic delicious BBQ. I absolutely could not get enough of the brisket. There are plenty of sauces to choose from but I didn't even need any. And there is even shopping and bakery treats. You have to check this place out.
