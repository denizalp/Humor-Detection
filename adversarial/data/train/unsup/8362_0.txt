I looked for a Honda Pilot for several weeks. After having been told numbers on the phone by other valley dealerships which turned up to be tricks to get me into the store, it was Bell Honda who gave me the best deal and stuck to it when I showed up. And the sales guys were all great. Extremely helpful and never pushing me to buy something I didn't need or want. Yes, I am extremely happy.
