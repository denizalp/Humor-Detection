My friend and I just went to sundrops and Loooved it! The place was so cute I would never guess I was actually in a salon. I got the Island Indulgance and it was wonderful.  The scrub was absolutely relaxing. I enjoyed shopping in the front retail area while waiting for my treatment. Such cute stuff.  They have great package deals and reasonable prices. \n\nI wasn't offered something to drink which I would have liked. Other then that it was a wonderful experience and my friend and I will be back for sure.
