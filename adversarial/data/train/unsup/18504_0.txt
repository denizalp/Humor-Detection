After reading the reviews and bookmarking this place ages ago I was more than a little excited when my Brampton travels found me at the front door of Poutine Dare To Be Fresh.\n\nThe location is less than a block away from the intersection of Queen and Main St, and from a branding position, I love the lime green coloured smiley face which greets you at every corner. I think the concept is pretty cool...\n\nUnfortunately their name is about the only thing Fresh I encountered. I should preface this review by stating I can't speak to if this is the \"normal\" practice or merely I caught them on an off day. This review speaks only about what I was served yesterday.\n\nI ordered the following:\n- Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich which came with a pickle\n- Local fave, Bacon Double Cheeseburger Poutine\n\nTo begin, the sandwich meat came in a single serving plastic bag which was microwaved to warm it up. Having had pre - packaged Montreal smoked meat here in the GTA before I know it should be warmed up Sous-vide style inside the bag in a hot water bath. What was worse was the sandwich was tossed together on remnants of rye bread which by the time I opened my wrapped package, had crumbled and gotten soaked through for the grease of the meat brought on by the microwave.  I didn't finish it....\n\nThe sandwich came with a 1\/2 pickle, I LOVE the fresh snap of a good pickle so I asked if I might have a second to go along with my lunch. That was no problem so I was thrilled to see two MASSIVE pickle halves waiting for me with my sandwich. The pickles however had no snap, were overly pickled to the point of being mushy. I typically don't spit out my food but after trying a bite of each pickle I had to spit it out and get rid of them....\n\nLastly, I decided that the poutine was the reason for really coming here and so i shouldn't really judge them too harshly on things they don't specialize in. That said I was disappointed with the \"freshness\" of my order. The fries were not made to order, they were simply scrapped together from the remnants of the two previous orders, so my fries were lukewarm not hot and crisp. The gravy tasted alright and the rest of the toppings were good as well. I did however have an issue with the cheese sauce being served from a pump, I've had this at other joints and they've served it from a warming pot with a ladle. To their credit, I did appreciate that they layered the poutine (fries + cheese + gravy, followed by more fries + cheese + gravy) without being asked. ALSO, unlike trips to Smokes, I ate the poutine and didn't feel terrible afterward!\n\nI'd gladly come back and try this spot out again (that's why my 2 stars are always open to a second chance) but I hope management addresses the gaps in their freshness offering.\n\nEatcrest Out
