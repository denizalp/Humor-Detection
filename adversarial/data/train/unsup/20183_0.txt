3 sat down for breakfast on Saturday morning at 10:00AM and ordered coffee. This took 15 minutes and There were two other parties in the restaurant.\n\nRealizing this restaurant was putting our 3pm flight time at risk, we promptly asked for our coffee to go and left.\n\nThe coffee cup had a beef advertisement sticker on it that I took off because I don't like looking at beef advertisements when I drink coffee. The sticker residue left my hand gross and sticky.\n\nThis place has potential but is somewhere I would avoid until they figure out how to run their business.
