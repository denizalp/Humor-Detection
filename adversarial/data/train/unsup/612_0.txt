Earl's is good any time of the day. Sober or drunk. But I firmly stand on my belief that Earl's taste especially delicious when intoxicated. I'm so glad this location is 24\/7. Lines are long, but workers are fast. You end up waiting in line for only 15 mins the most. I've tried a few of their sandwiches now and my favorite is the Italian. \n\nWhat makes Earl's work in comparison to other sandwich chains is their ability to create you a simple sandwich with the BEST\/FRESH ingredients. I don't think they have any secret, they just go above standards. And as with each sandwich, there's a unique taste so it varies and not just the same mustard or mayo you're used to.\n\nNo, I do not want either white or wheat bread!! My only wish is if they served their bread on dutch crutch. That's the real bread winner right there
