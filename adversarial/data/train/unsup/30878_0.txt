I had to stay here for an extended period of time. The staff was friendly and knowledgable, and the beds are extremely comfortable. The bar downstairs is good to unwind if you are on business and the it has an amazing view for jogging along the lakeside in the mornings.\n\nMy only complaint was the lack of lighting in the rooms. Reading documents is difficult for my eyes due to the lampshades.
