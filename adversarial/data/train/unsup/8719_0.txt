*** note: they accepted plastic when i went.......\n\n\nthe man wuz in the mood 4 chili and cheez.  in that case i'm happy 2 oblige since he's a part-time vegetarian (pescetarian).  *evil grin.  the online menu said they had a fried fish sammich, but it wasn't posted on their menu when we got there.  *bigger evil grin.   \n\ni don't know wut kinda freak gets a brat w\/chili and cheese, but he did along with a one-footer.  i got a polish.   decent stuff.  i noticed they use Aunt Hattie's potato buns..... Aunt Hattie makes some goodarse sliced bread so i wuz pleased with that.  also, they use real charcoal, not just a gas grill.  double plus.  ahhh....... the taste of carcinogens on greasy chargrilled mechanically separated pork\/beef processed products.    \n; D\n\nthe onion rings........ very different from what i usually expect.  they were decent, but shredded thin........ i personally like them in decent sized rings.   \n\nok....... so good dogs.....  but not nething out of the ordinary i couldn't make @home, besides my laziness.
