Went with a pair of out of town friends on the locals discount night, and had a blast. In brief; The show's fun.\n\nIt's sort of a cabaret style show, with a lot of different small acts tied together with a thread of \"hehe, aren't boobies fun.\" Every segment definitely won't be 'sexy', for everyone, but I think it hits a pretty nice \"medium\". There's plenty for whom it would be way beyond risque, but my group found it tame but visually stunning. It more \"eludes to sex\" than emphasizes it, which is what I would expect from an artistic circusy interpretation of that. They also make an effort to elude to kinks and quirks of all different flavors, but all with the same \"rating\". So they evoke BDSM and schoolgirl fantasies in equal measure to...different(?) results. Our friends were shocked (!) to find out the host was a cross dresser, for example, and my husband and I were more amused at his discomfort than we'd been shocked by anything in the show.\n\nAs with a lot of extremely low yelp reviews, I tend to see the low reviews of this show following a \"We did not understand what we were walking into, so our expectations were WAY off.\" \nIt was about what I expected; a pretty classically art-house allusion to the good the bad and the absurd about what happens when humans sex. If you go expecting porn, or serious theater or a wacky madcap rom-com...you're gonna be disappointed.\n\nPros:\n- Gorgeous acrobatics, some very cool acts, and some visuals that have just stuck in my brain like skull-geckos.\n- Fun night, if you're a fan of cabaret style shows, and ready to laugh at taboos. Some acts will intrigue, some will make you laugh, some will probably turn you on at least a little, and some will just be boring or unmemorable or possibly scandalous depending on your crowd. \n- Find out if your friends are racists or prudes! Guaranteed conversation starter! Or ender. Forever.\n\nCons: \n- A bit spendy, even at the locals price.\n- If you're not a fan of cabaret style shows, and want to love the whole thing, do not waste your money, you'll have favorites and less favorite skits. \n- Definitely not the most \"over the top\" of the Cirque shows; it's smaller, shorter, and again, a cabaret. If you want lots of flying and leaping and stuff, go to Ka. Want music and dancing and choreography, hit up Love. Want to laugh and let your dinner settle, talk about the show over drinks, and then shag when you get home? Bingo. Know what you're getting into.
