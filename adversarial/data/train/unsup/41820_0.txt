I've taken my car to Greg at HA Specialist for a few years now. I have a 2012 Acura MDX, and I even drive from Strongsville to get my oil change done there. He and the other guys that work there are so friendly and knowledgable. I never will go anywhere else. Fair pricing and very trustworthy. Highly recommended!
