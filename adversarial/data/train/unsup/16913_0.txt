Magnificent neighborhood Italian grocery.  They have everything from pasta to pastry. There is a hot counter where you can get sub sandwiches, pizza and pastas. There is an olive bar, a deli and a cheese counter.  I think I heard angels sing when i walked in the door.  We had a eggplant parm sandwich. A vegan veggie sandwich they made special for me. Some pasta with marina sauce and some Sicilian pizza. Prices are very reasonable too.  Super friendly staff too. Double super highly recommend.
