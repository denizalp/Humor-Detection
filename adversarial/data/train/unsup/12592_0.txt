The last time I came to a Cobblestone, I hated it. Like a lot. Crazy high pressure sales. I had to snap at the associate several times to get them to stop trying to up-sell me on a car wash and oil change. It was ridiculous. I left feeling stressed and annoyed af. \n\nSo I was wary when they sent out a coupon for a cheap car wash, probably their lowest car wash available. Still, I came, because why not? \n\nI pulled up to the Express side. It was wonderful. No associate to bicker with, as you simply have to type in the code on the computer screen, then pull through where the guy hands you a damp towel to clean your dash while you roll through the wash. \n\nIf you pay for the hand dry\/interior clean and vacuum, then you take a left where dudes handle that for you. If not, then head straight out, then take a quick left to get back in to head over to the self-vacuum spaces. Here is where I pull out my shammy towels and finish drying off my car before I vacuum up hidden Cheerios and the piles of playground sand. \n\nThings have changed for the better.
