We had a coupon at work - buy one 6\", get one free.  Believe it or not, 6\" is plenty for this lil girl! ;}\nI got the #5 sandwich, which was turkey with cheese and cranberry.  There are two different breads to choose from and two different dressings.  I had the whole wheat bread and the garlic dressing.  They have the sandwich menu split into regions of the world, which I thought was cute, though then the number selection of the sandwiches was off.  It affected my OCD, but not too much!\nThis was one of the best sandwiches I've had in this area!  I'm in the Scottsdale Airpark and surrounded by restaurants.  Most are just trendy places that people go to, just to say they've been there.  And they suck, for the most part!\nSo, the sandwich was ooey-gooey and delish!  I had sauce running down my arm and cheese sliding out the sides.  That's how we do it on the East Coast, yo!  Oh, and a cranberry popped out onto my \"shelf\" (the chest, dudes!) but didn't stain, luckily.  5-second rule, right?\nAnyway, with the coupon, my co-worker and I paid $3 for 6\"!!!
