I'm SO sorry, but I can only see fit to give 3.5 stars.\n\nMy first thoughts when I heard about the concept of these stores was fresh, pre-made healthy, quality foods at decent prices.  I thought I'd be in heaven when I finally got a chance to make a visit.\n\nI have to admit I was a bit disappointed.\n\nCertainly everything was fresh and had nice packaging...but I was not impressed with the prices.  First of all, they weren't consistent.  There were some things that were pleasantly much cheaper.  Then there were items that were ridiculously expensive.   The location I was at only had 75% less fat ground beef.  You could see all of the fat swirling around the meat.  Yuck!  And it was more expensive than Safeway...and that's saying a lot.\n\nI've seen Tres Leches cake (a whole cake) sold for $2.50.  For maybe 4 bites....I'm really not exaggerating....of the same cake, they were charging $4.\n\nBut then I found vietnamese noodles and some nice looking Indian, British, and Thai foods that looked pretty yummy, so it sort of made up for the wierd prices.  Sort of.\n\nSo I'm sorry to say I wasn't overly impressed.  It's definitely not a bad place to be and look around, but I like bargains a lot more.
