How hard is it to understand that I want a regular #1 burger with mustard?   The options are mustard, mayo, or ketchup.   I selected mustard and guess what?  that is all I got on my burger.  Seems like there is some training needed at this establishment. I have been to Sonic establishments all over the southeast and have never had an issue.  This is the second time I have had an issue with this place and will not be back.
