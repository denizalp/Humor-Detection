So one of my fav  ex-yelper asked where Los Parados was located since she was hankering for a taco.  After a couple visits there she felt great tacos were to be had elsewhere.  A day later she proclaimed victory in finding a better taco at Tacos El Gordo.  Hmm... i'll be the judge of that ( then again, she speaks fluent spanish, knows mexican food like i know burgers so the reality is SHE'S THE JUDGE  not me ! ) \n\nAll the tacos are $2  - they have about 10 varieties.  other options are tostada's ( also $2 ) and interestingly, asada fries which cost $10 ...$10 ?!?!?   okaaaay.\n\nWhen you come in , a lil unusual method of ordering - basically 4 separate lines based on which taco you order - english is definitely the 2nd language so be careful how you order, but the employees are very pleasant and work with you.  So i order a spicy pork, pork, asada and cabeza tacos.  You stand there as they chop the meat, place the meat on the freshly prepared tortillas ( you see the tortilla lady cooking away ) \n\nThey put a guagamole\/avocado sauce on the asada - very good .  the spicy pork had a creamy sauce, too - not sure what it was, but tasted great.  all had cilantro and onions.  btw - they also give you a plate of grilled green onions and a chile - wasn't sure what i was supposed to do with them - looked around - saw a few people gnawing on them - sure why not !  \n\nThe cabeza was just ok, the pork was a lil on the fat side.  The tortillas were delicious ! \n\nI don't think i'll try the beef brain tacos ( not cabeza ) but the chorizo tacos looked great - next visit .\n\nIs it better than Parados ...it's very possible.  Further tastings are necessary.  Interestingly, this place is in the same center as a los tacos ( not a fan ) \n\npics posted
