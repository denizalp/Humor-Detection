I probably will not end up back here anytime soon. The food itself was very unique in the way it tastes\/seasoned. Some of the dishes were quite spicy for general buffet options but I don't knock it for that. Some other broken english 1 star review\/1 user review only exists for this which honestly screams a review by a competing restaurant yet I agree with a bit. The largest problem is the space, space and service. Our server(not sure if we had one assigned) seemed new or nervous and spilled water all over. After changing seats, we were more or less ignored beyond our initial drink. There was little communication as to who our actual server was and wasn't even sure where to get the bill. After a while of being ignored, we just walked up and got it. But lets face the ultimate problem - the space. It is like Taqueria Guadalajara seating combined with a buffet table set in a strange corner\/alcove. The buffet table itself even borders tables where you MAY be seated. Do you like having people constantly standing right by you grabbing food or lining up? The strangest thing is when you get to the end of the buffet line, it's a dead end and you have to like walk awkwardly around people to try to get out... It seems nonsensical. And like another review said -when there is a lot of people waiting to be seated the place has a very strange limbo zone by the door where you can't really get in or heck - even goto the bathrooms from the dining area. I just don't think the space itself is suitable for an Indian buffet. Buffets need a lot of spacing for the constant amount of people getting up, lining up and returning to their seats as well as a logical flow and layout for the buffet plates. Instead it is a dead end with seating similar to a High School Cafeteria..be prepared to sit next to strangers...
