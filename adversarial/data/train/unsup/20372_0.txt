So far I have been here 3 times with the hubby. Its a beautiful club. Didnt eat while we were there..who eats @ a strip club? LOL\nEvery time we went we sat by the stage..the best seats in the house!\nHubbys goes and gets 100 in singles..cuz thats what we do..we like to tip the ladies & they like the attention. Most guys dont tip..they just sit and stare..lame!\nAlways a nice amount of dancers on hand.\nThe girls all do the same thing..walk around asking for dances or VIP.\nI think we found pretty girls every time to dance for us. And they never were pushy about drinks or VIP.\nSome day we will get to visit Treasures again..someday..
