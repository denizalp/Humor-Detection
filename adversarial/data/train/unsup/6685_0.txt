Oh Nobu - Mi Amore!!  \n\nI've been to this restaurant countless times and it is always amazing!   After my recent visit I realized I have to give proper respect and yelp my love for them.  Here are some of my favorites:\n\nToro Tartare with Caviar - This dish makes me want to commit a felony.  If I were on death row it would be my last meal, I would definitely die happy.  As one of my favorite sayings on Howard Stern perfectly stated, this dish will make you 'go ahead and release the poison'.\n\nYellowtail with Jalapenos - Always fresh and delicious!  I believe that all other sushi restaurants have tried to duplicate this dish but can never quite get the perfect flavor. \n\nSashimi Salad - BAM!  The dressing is off the chain, the tuna beyond fresh.  \n\nKobe Beef Toban Yaki - I'm not a religious person by any means but I'm certain the heeled hands of Jesus came down and prepared this dish himself with the blessing of his father.\n\nOf course you cannot go there without consuming a couple of their saketini's.  Why can't any other bar\/restaurant get their saketini's to be this delicious??  They are alone worth a visit there.
