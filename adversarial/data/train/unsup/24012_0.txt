The owners backgrounds may be in fine dining, but Four Season Diner is simple and soulful food.  The term diner takes me back to a simpler time when coffee came in only one flavor and you found 'Diners' on the side of highways that that cruise slowly through Americas heartland.  Four Seasons is exactly that kind of place, found on the side of State Route 87 in a town that didn't seem to have a stoplight, (at least as far as I traveled).\n\nI had the Chicken and Waffle Bowl with cheddar hash browns.  Yes, this is a more modern day combination but is was served just the way you'd expect at a Diner, simple and delicious.\n\nCome comfortably dressed in your well worn jeans and favorite concert t-shirt to eat and embrace the small town pace.  Be forewarned that if you chose to blow in styling the latest Armani, Gucci or Vera Wang, you'll still get the same friendly service.  However once you leave you will be the topic of conversation of everyone, after all it is a small town diner.
