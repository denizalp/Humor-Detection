I made an appointment for an extraction 3weeks ago. I called 3 times to confirm. I showed up for the procedure and the doctor told me he wasn't capable of doing the surgery. He had not looked at my chart until I walked in for the operation. Then he told me there was a risk of my face being paralyzed during the procedure. This is false.  The nerve the was in question controls feeling not movement, so the only risk is for a bit of numbness. \n\nIt troubles me that even though this doctor is only in the office 3 days a week he still could not find the time to review his patients charts ahead of time at all. If he would have just glanced at my chart I could have been phoned in advance and I would have made arrangements at another clinic. \n\nIt also troubles me that he was misinformed about the risks of my operation, or perhaps he just lied to me to cover up his inability to preform the operation for the agreed upon price. \n\nEither way, I do not recommend this clinic for any serious dental work.
