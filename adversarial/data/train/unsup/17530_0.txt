I did not eat here but boy oh boy did I drink here \n\nI think I had two of the tall drinks twice\/day while staying in Vegas & I only wanted them from La Salsa \n\nThe bartenders made them fast & strong each time \nNot to mention after making the drink they put extras shots of tequila in them to top things off! \nNow that's my kind of bar, the drinks were around $16 but kept me staggering all night long \n\nI should have just came here instead of buying drinks at some club that barely uses alcohol in their drinks at all \n\nRemember in Vegas a little tip goes a long way & also gets you a lot of tequila shots
