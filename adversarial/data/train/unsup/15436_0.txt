I will have a spicy tuna roll with a side of racism. My family and I went to Sushi Tachi a few months ago and it has taken me this long to calm the rage from the experience to write my review. \nOne evening my husband,  daughter and I went out to AYCE at Sushi Tachi. We walked in, sat down and began ordering. My daughter had brought in a Disney Princess doll to keep her occupied. Dinner went on and we were getting odd service from one of the waitresses. My husband and I simply thought she was just a naturally unhappy person and that is simply \"how her face always looked.\" \nThe odd unhappy waitress came over at one point and asked my daughter to see her doll. The waitress said, \"that is a pretty doll, is it Cinderella? .\" My daughter corrected her and said, \"no it is Sophia the First.\" The waitresses response, \"oh, well she is white just like every Disney Princess.\" She then walked away from the table. My husband and I looked at each other in shock.\nWe finally arrived at dessert. I ordered green tea ice cream and my husband ordered a tempura vanilla ice cream. When the waitress brought our order she gave me my green tea ice cream and as she placed my husband's order down she said and I quote, \"here is your vanilla, vanilla.\" My husband a little confused asked her what she said. The odd, unhappy, smug waitress repeated, \"here is your vanilla, VANILLA!\" \nWell, as you can imagine we will never be back.
