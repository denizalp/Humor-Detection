Great spot for kids and families to get out of the heat.\n\nI like how they stamp the kids and families with the same numbers, but just a peice of advice if your going to do that as a security feature you should probably use it and check them when people are leaving. Disappointing. \n\nThey have an all you can eat pizza and salad buffet. The salad is pretty weak, its just mixed greens with a couple choices of salad dressing. The pizza buffet consists of 3-4 pizza options. Its OK for what it is...\n\nGames galore for all ages. Not as many games as some other chuck e cheese's but definitely enough to keep the kiddos entertained.\n\nWhen we were there it was a challenge finding a clean table. We got there around 12 so they hadn't been open too long so how that many tables were already dirty is beyond me.
