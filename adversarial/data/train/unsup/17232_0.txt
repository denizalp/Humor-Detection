The ambiance, the food, the service...everything was wonderful. I came here on a date. My date was not very adventurous with trying new food so we ordered two beers, the oxtail and scallops (DIVINE) and the chicken fried quail (delicious but not as WOW as the oxtail). The portions are incredibly small but with the burst of flavour in each bite was totally worth it. \n\nI would come here again and try the tongue brioche and the meat platter. Not with the same guy though!
