Their customer service is awful!!!\nWent there on the weekend, and asked to see one of the more expensive watches in their display. The SA eyed us up and down (we were wearing t shirt and jeans...if that makes a difference) and said people usually think those watches only cost a few hundreds, but they actually cost thousands and refused to take it out of the display to show us! Then she added by saying \"I'm sure one day you will be able to buy it.\" I mean the way she said all those comments was with a smile, which I don't know if that was making it better or worse. But we both feel deeply offended by that kind of service!
