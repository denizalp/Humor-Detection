I came here looking for chocolate, dark chocolate specifically. \n\nSaw some 90% Cacoa stuff, but decided on the most foreign looking package I could find. No english = even better :) It had been awarded 5 medals this century?\nlooked it up.. red October factory existed before the war and was state run at one time. weburbanist.com\/2011\/04\/24\/soviet-yum-yum-russias-red-october-chocolate-factory\/\n\nTasted it - superb, dark chocolate it's like a Russian Aero bar. \n\nAnyways I left here with the chocolate, a crepes package (again very little english) and some peach nectar juice. \n\nIt's nicely organized, clean and offer a wide array of Russian foods from the regular chained groceries. \n\nJust a note, you can't see the place from the road. It's deep inside the plaza where the Canadian Tire is located.
