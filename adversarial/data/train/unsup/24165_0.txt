This place sucks. Do not go here. \n\nThey advertise that they are open 24\/7 and they aren't. As soon as I got there, I asked one of the employees if they were truly open 24\/7 and she responded \"only Friday and Saturday.\"\n     - Backstory: sometimes I have to work night shift at work. We heard about this new taco shop opening up that is open 24\/7. On two separate occasions, we had a late night food run only to find out that they were closed (as their open 24\/7 sign illuminates the window). Additionally, my girlfriend offered to pick up some breakfast tacos for us in the morning after work (~8:30a.m). She got to the shop only to find out that they weren't open  \n\nWe went there today and the service was shit. The employee taking our order was rude and rolled her eyes at me at least twice. They didn't have any breakfast tacos. Lastly, their regular tacos were tiny and tasted like eating a tortilla with cat food covered in melted crayons. \n\nDon't waste your time with this place.
