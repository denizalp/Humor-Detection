I've read that they are on a soft launch, based on that and that I really want to support a local business I will give them another chance.\n\nFood today was not bad but disappointed, Early Egg with tomato, cucumber, olives and toast (came with no toast and olives, had to request they send it) - the tomato and cucumber are really more like a garnish.. so pricey for such a simple dish.\n\nThe place looks good, service was also good, fast and polite.
