I'd like to dedicate my 300th review to the amazing Las Vegas! Vegas is my home away from home!\n\nI have probably been to Vegas 25+ times in my lifetime and only about 7 of those trips were after I'd turned 21. Because my Canadian uncle loves to gamble, Vegas tends to be a popular family reunion spot for our family. How many people have spent multiple Easter's in Las Vegas?!\n\nI have stayed at the Wynn, Mirage, Planet Hollywood, Venetian, Bellagio, Desert Inn (think it might be gone now), and Imperial Palace and enjoyed them all! (though some are a lot classier than others...) Their VIP suites with chocolate covered strawberries and champagne are a great feature too!\n\nI've also won at the craps table, lost at the craps table, won at the blackjack table, lost at the blackjack table, won on the slot machines, lost on the slot machines, layed out at multiple gorgeous pools (but never gotten burnt!), eaten too much amazing food (at Bouchon, Wynn restaurants, etc but never gotten sick), loved clubbing (at Tryst, Tao, Pure, Light, Body English, etc and often at tables...), shopped (at malls, at Caesar's Palace, and more), seen excellent shows (Zumanity, Jersey Boys, Cirque de Soleil, the Temptations, the Pointer Sisters), ridden in limos, endured strange injuries (piggy back rides can be dangerous!), and much, much more! \n\nI heart Vegas and am always looking for an excuse to take another trip!!!
