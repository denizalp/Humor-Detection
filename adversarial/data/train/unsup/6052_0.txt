This restaurant has changed owners and chefs multiple times in the last year or 2. It used to be wonderful, but recently it has gone down hill. Now I refuse to eat there after being told by the giant sign in the window as well as the host that all of the meat is halal. No thank you. Time to find a new Indian restaurant .
