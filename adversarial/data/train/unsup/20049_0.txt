I was happily surprised to see this cute little shop had popped up on this strip. I used to be taken to this plaza to get a slice on my way back from the Olympium in the '90s when the Pizza Pizza was on this corner. \n\nIt was kind of a run down strip of stores then, with not much happening. But the times are 'a changing and when I saw the bright green 'Singing Lady Consignment' sign and a lovely display of goodies out front, I immediately pulled over. \n\nThis consignment store is like a well-curated garage-sale of neat, shiny and pretty things. Their website is also incredibly organized for this kind of store. They itemize, price, and photograph and categorize nearly everything. This is a great feature!\n\nWhile most items there were a little more frilly and lady-like than my own taste, I still managed to find a lot of great retro housewares that I loved and old picture frames and art. \n\nI think this would be an awesome place to pick up a one-of-a-kind gift, especially for someone of a more traditional taste(Read: your mother-in-law).\n\nI've noticed a trend in consignment shops catering to a luxury market and not just collectors. This means if you have expensive taste, you can save a lot by buying consignment, plus you'll be recycling. Neat-o!
