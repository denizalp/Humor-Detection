Went to a timeshare presentation. Nice units but far from the strip. The salesman Stephen was nice, but when we said no they brought out a \"closer\" and he got kind of nasty when we still said no. \nStephen told us we had to do a review to get our bus pass for the long ride back to the strip and we met another man. Turned out he was just trying to keep selling us on their plan and he was very rude when we said no. No bus pass was needed. He just showed us the door and we took the shuttle back. 2 hour presentation turned into 5 including shuttle time.
