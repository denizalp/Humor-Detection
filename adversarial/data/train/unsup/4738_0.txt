Swish your problems away! or rather in my case eat my heart out! I think Swish is a good place to go for a semi light semi healthy meal. Instead of the typical oily asian food, you get a clean cut taste at Swish. I've been to Swish a couple of times and everytime I've ordered the Shabu Shabu....maybe next time I will move on to the Sukiyaki. In any case, with a side full of veggies and some meat I definitely feel like I'm eating healthier. The taste may be a bit bland to some people but that's why there's condiments to make it salty, spicy, etc. It may be a lil pricier than the Chinese Hot Pot, but Japanese food is more expensive in general. I have never had to order the \"hungry\" portion and I always leave full. Service is good, nothing too fancy here. Overall, I say let's go to Swish especially since now we get 20% off our bill with the 2010-2011 Entertainment book excluding Friday and Saturday.
