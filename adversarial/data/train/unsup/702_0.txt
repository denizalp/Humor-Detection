The revamped Underground is looking good. It is clean, classy and modern. The menu has also gone under an extreme makeover. The food is better than what you would expect from any university pub. In fact, I would say that the food is up there with some decent establishments. The beer selection, with the exception of Granville Island, is pretty lousy. I hope they bring in some stout beer. Won't somebody think of the pretentious philosophy students?! \n\nI was impressed with the new Underground. The space looked nice, the food was good, and prices were OK. The service was an entirely different story. We must have waited 20min to be seated. The food arrived shortly after but our waitress took forever to bring us the bill. She was also not arithmetically inclined. She had a hard time splitting the bill four ways and forgot to charge us for a beer at the end. Looking over at the other tables, there seemed to be an obvious lack in communication and training of staff. The management needs to be running a much tighter ship. There were plenty of staff on the floor but the service was extremely inattentive and most seemed lost. \n\nAtmosphere: 7\/10\n\nFood: 8\/10\n\nService: 3\/10
