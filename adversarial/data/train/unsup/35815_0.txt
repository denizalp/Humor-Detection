The staff were so great. They were friendly and I had a lot of questions and worries when it came to replacing my new hot water heater. They had great pricing to match their great customer service skills. Ken was able to replace my hot water heater in a little over an hour. WOW! I thought it was going to be an all day project,but it was so fast!! \n\nI highly recommend them for ANY work they are so great!
