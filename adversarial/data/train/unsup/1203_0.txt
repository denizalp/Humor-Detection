This was the craziest experience of ALL TIME! I wish the most recent reviews were available when I went to buy this Groupon!!!! ERRRHHHH! \n\nWHERE DO I START!?? \n\nWe stayed at Planet Hollywood (for reference). It was a $20+ cab ride BOTH ways which ended up adding another $50 to the cost of this \"massage\". BOTH TAXI DRIVERS (there and back) basically TOLD US a fare this far off the strip requires a $5+ tip since they are missing out on other fares close to the strip!!!! UM... ARE YOU FRIENDS WITH SAM? Because this seems like it's a \"TIP SCAM\"! \n\n The massage wasn't as bad as the general service!!! SWEET GEEZIOUS! MY MASSAGE THERAPIST WAS TEXTING OFF AND ON FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES DURING MY MASSAGE!!!!! I literally would notice because he would stop massaging me and was kind of soft rubbing me with one hand like he was getting more LOTION... UM, after over a minute I looked up and his face was LIT UP BY HIS CELL PHONE AND HE WAS TEXTING!!!! THEN the person texted him BACK and he went back and forth like a teenager!!!!!! SERIOUSLY!? TEXTING!!!??? THIS IS A NEW ONE, EVEN FOR ME! \n\nI DON'T KNOW WHY THEY HAVE YOU FILL OUT A SUGGESTION FORM BEFORE YOUR MASSAGE!!!!!??? The only thing I put down was: STAY AWAY FROM MY LOWER BACK!!!!! I had to tell him 4 times to stop massaging my lower back DURING THE MASSAGE!!! Then my friend stated she wanted a low pressure and she had to tell him 5-6 times to be more gentle!!! THEN the 5th time they BOTH laughed at her after she said to go lighter!!!??? UM... THIS ISN'T A CRAZY REQUEST!!!!! Also my friends \"therapist\" didn't use lotion!???? UM... This made for a somewhat uncomfortable massage... Lotion is there to HELP the massaging right??? This is a MASSAGE BUSINESS is it NOT? \n\nThis is NOT a MASSAGE! It's actually a FOOT MASSAGE by my standards! And FOOT MASSAGES SHOULD BE ABOUT $20\/HOUR!!! A MASSAGE is when you are in your OWN PRIVATE ROOM and you can RELAX BECAUSE OF PRIVACY! \n\nAND the ODD taking your shirt and bra off in the MIDDLE OF THE MASSAGE!??? UM HELLO!? COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE! \n\nAt the end of my massage I had to use the bathroom... THEY SHOULD BE THANKFUL MY IPHONE WAS STOLEN WITH THE PHOTOS I HAD ON IT... HOLY SMOKES! GROSS! They had a \"public\" comb with TONS OF HAIR in it, and the toilet had pee ALL OVER THE LID, SEAT and ground! It was like a male locker room. :( \n\nPLUS it was very obvious we were REQUIRED to tip!!! They make you sign out a customer service form RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR \"THERAPIST\"!!! They are literally staring at you RIGHT IN THE EYES LIKE A HOMELESS PUPPY!!!! SO GROSS!!!! I have a TIP FOR YOU: A TIP is a TIP FOR GOOD SERVICE!!! If there isn't GOOD SERVICE=NO TIP! We saw \"Sam\" getting out of his BRAND NEW Mercedes... WITH HIS GUCCI ORGANIZER! SAM: You shouldn't TELL your customers to TIP! Take down all those dumb signs that are \"SUGGESTED TIPPING\" and INTSTEAD: GIVE YOUR EMPLOYEES MORE MONEY! It seems these massage therapists are only getting paid \"TIPS\" and not an hourly wage... I feel like I should be calling the BBB? If these \"Therapists\" are US citizens they should not be getting paid like this! \n\nI'm SUPER PISSED that \"SAM\" would be willing to PREY ON VISITING TOURIST trying to have a awesome time in Vegas by SCAMING PEOPLE! \n\nSTOP TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nMy recomendation to anyone considering buying this Groupon: DON'T! \n\n$50 for Groupon+ $50 for cab rides + $50 for tip!!!??? For 2 FOOT massages and the \"Vegas time\" we wasted getting there and back, waiting 45 minutes for our rude cab drivers??? I'd rather pay for a massage at our hotel. WASTE OF TIME, NOT CHEAP and NOT QUALITY!
