I gave this salon a try two times based on the reviews.  The first time, I got a partial highlight and haircut.  The price was pretty reasonable and my stylist and I had alot in common.  However, the color we had discussed was not what I received.  I know hair can take color a certain way or whatever but I have been coloring my hair for years.  So, even though I had a \"meh\" experience, I thought I would give this place a second try.  I really don't like to give a place a low rating after just one visit unless it was really bad.  I asked the stylist for caramel colored highlights, after she washed my hair and I sat down and saw my hair in the mirror for the first time I told her I didn't like how dark it was.  I know wet hair is darker but after the blow dry, I wanted caramel colored highlights and I ended up with mocha colored which looked horrible on my very fair complexion.  And when we were discussing the highlights color, I told her I had gotten highlights in the past that looked like mud and I didn't want that.  My stylist had alot of experience but I really don't think she knew what she was doing.  I always discuss what the results will look like and even have the stylist bring out the hair color swatches to make sure we are on the same page since one persons interpretation may be different than someone elses.  I think the price was reasonable but unfortunately I won't be returning.
