So I'm kinda picky about dry cleaners and wanted a good one when I first moved to Pittsburgh.  Not knowing the areas, I went here.  Yep, it's Homewood, and I'm white.  Anyway, I keep going back and haven't had any problems.  Well done, clean clothes.  \n\nAlso if you pre-pay you get a discount, which I like.
