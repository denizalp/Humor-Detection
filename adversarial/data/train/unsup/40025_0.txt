What a great experience!  My server, Jane, was a lovely introduction to Cleveland culture. Great advice, friendly smile, and attentive service to our whole table. \n\nI felt like we traveled around their kitchen with our selections and it was ALL tasty. \n\nLater, I found out pierogi pizza is a thing, I think it'll be hard to beat the one at Butcher and the Brewer. \n\nIf you have someone to share this rich dish with: try the diver scallops. Now I have a reason to experiment at home again. \n\nThe whole area is rife with tasty looking menus. But don't miss a stop here.
