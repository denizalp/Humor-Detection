Was there for about an hour when exploring clubs in the area. The dance floor was too small, weird people at this one (creepy guys following me around or getting all over me in all the wrong ways), only played two songs that were okay, condoms on the floor it the lounge area. My least favorite of all the clubs I went to that night.
