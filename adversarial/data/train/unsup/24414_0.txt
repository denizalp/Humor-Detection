MUST TRY: Khao Soy Gai. (rice noodles in curry soup)\n\nPeople will tell you that the Ping Gai is the best, but get the Khao Soy Gai instead and thank me later.\n\nSticky rice is a good snack.... though it can be inconsistent. Last time I ordered this, it came as post-sticky rice. The rice had hardened and was one giant grain of rice, so I had to rip off chunks of it and throw the delicious peanut sauce on top.\n\nThis also begs the question: Is there a singular form of the word rice?\n\nThere is a back patio. BTW, it has a really strange entrance where you have to walk downstairs, then back upstairs, and your waiter walks through the kitchen. For a moment, it's all a little bizarre and reminiscent of a bugs bunny cartoon.\n\nServers are good, laid back. \n\nBONUS: Kitchen is open late
