Oh Dotty Dumpling's Dowry...how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways:\n\n1.  Best burger ever.  Seriously.  I take back all the other times that I have thrown this out there and give you the crown.  The burger was perfectly cooked, the bacon was crispy and delicious, the Heart Throb sauce is divine, and the bleu cheese was perfect.\n2.  BEAUTIFUL craft beer list.  There are plenty of awesome local brews on tap (I opted for some Ale Asylum beers), the list is organized by brewery (and state, OG reading, and IBUs are listed...swoon!), and there are also imports and domestics for the *other* drinkers as well.\n3.  Fried Cheese Curds + English Garlic Sauce = HEAVEN.\n4.  The actual restaurant is small and homey and inviting.  I love the speakeasy feel of the outside, the dark wood, the motorcycle paraphernalia, the old timey songs and music...But really? You had me at vintage betches with brews in the bathroom.\n\nI don't think I can ever eat anywhere else in Madison ever again.  Thanks.
