This is a college bar, if you are looking for something quiet, go else where, if you are looking for something super clean and nice, go else where. If however you are looking for a fun, somewhat divey bar with awesome amounts of greasy fried food, you have found heaven. The prices are great, the amount of food you get is great, and if you looking for a good time this place is great.\n\nWhat I would recommend:\nCheese Curds - no self respecting Wisconsin bar can mess this up but holy crap these were good curds.\nThe Curd Burger - I had trouble moving after this but soooo worth it. A cheese burger with cheese curds and onion rings on it, what more could you ask for?\nThe Brats - both white and red, or both, they are great, brats is in the name of the bar for a reason.
