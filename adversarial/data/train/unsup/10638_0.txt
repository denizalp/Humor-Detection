Tonight was evidently not to be either North's or our night. We had eaten at the North restaurant in Kierland a number of times; however, we live in downtown Phoenix thus it was a perfect occasion to try the Arcadia restaurant. We arrived at the restaurant at approximately 9:15.  You have to park with  valet at this location, we ended up waiting for a few minutes for them to arrive -at that moment I thought we should leave, if only I had listened to myself.\nWe were seated, I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio, a cauliflower appetizer, and goat cheese bruschetta. \nThe wine was mediocre, the cauliflower appefizer an abomination. It was a ten dollar appetizer that appeared as though it had been already served and partially eaten.\nThe flavor was a 2.5 out of 5; the plating of it was dreadful\nAfter 25 minutes had lapsed my husband and I became concerned that the bruschetta had not arrived.  A few minutes later ( I believe a manager) delivered the bruschetta. She said \"this took far longer than it should have so we will take care of this\". Impressed I ordered another glass of wine. We then proceeded to bite into the brushettta.  The red peppers on top were right our of the refrigerator, icy cold. My husband chatted with our waiter, and he spoke to the manager. They opted to comp the cauliflower app and the glass of wine ( we cancelled the second one). My husband and I have both worked in restaurants in our lives and understand having a poor evening. We also have visited a number of the Fox restaurants and love them.  Due to our experience tonight we will not be visiting another North restaurant as there are many more options, the experience tonight ruined our evening and life is too short for bad food.\n\nInitially I gave a one star review; however,..... I wanted to be careful to be fair thus changed it to 2.
