I just had a great customer service experience at this location. The salesman Mike was very nice and helpful. He checked in with us, offered suggestions, but let us look around without following us around. It was nice to have that freedom, but know that we could easily find him if we had questions. The only thing that left me with a somewhat sour taste, which is preventing me from giving 5 stars, is the blonde girl who took payment. Mike was with us during payment, told her how much to charge, she repeated it back, and ended up charging a dollar more... not a big deal whatsoever, but instead of owning that it was her mistake, she blamed mike for telling her the wrong amount, even though she had a copy in her hand of the amount to be charged, and had also repeated it back. My boyfriend said it's no big deal, and then she also said yeah it's not a big deal... she also not once made eye contact with us or spoke to us directly until she said bye. Again, mike was great! The experience overall was great, but she needs some customer service skills herself! Can't wait to get our new furniture!
