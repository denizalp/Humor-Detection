The House Special sandwich is great. The peanut butter adds a nice touch to the flavour of the pork loin. I also had cold milk tea which I loved. My sister had the potato croquette sandwich which she didn't like as much.\n\nThe service was Ok but the restaurant was really busy so I understand the staff may have been a bit overwhelmed.\n\nThe restaurant is small, brightly lit and lively.\n\nOverall, I had a good experience and I will definitely be back.
