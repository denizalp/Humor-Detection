My wife and I needed a new family practice doctor after moving to this side of town.  We went in and the only good part about this place was the cleanliness.  Upon checking in the secretary misplaced my wife's insurance card and proceeded to argue that she had given it back.  She eventually found it and apologized.  How about listening to your customers?  The intake nurse was rude and cold.  She didn't seem to care about her job or the patients.  The worst part?  Dr. Patell was more cold then the nurse.  He didn't introduce himself to either of us.  Then my wife and I had similar experiences.  Dr. Patell rushed us through and didn't listen to either of us.    We will not be returning to this facility and do not recommend them to anyone.
