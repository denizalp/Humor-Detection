We celebrated our anniversary at Top Golf last night. It was our first visit and it was rad. When we walked in, a girl helped us get memberships and get registered. Then the concierge took us down to our bay, explained everything and made sure we knew not to \"Happy Gilmore\" it. We had a server, Zach, who was FANTASTIC. He kept our beers full and our stomachs happy. We had some jerky people come to the bay next to us, two guys who were super rude to him and he was just nice as ever. He suggested great food, we had the nachos and the bf had the chorizo and egg sliders and he loved them. The only reason this isnt a 5 is because I ordered the house salad with chicken and it was awful. The lettuce was wilted, the chicken was charred black, and it wasn't so great. But I LOVED the rest of the experience.
