My wife and I were looking for a reasonable sit down supper on our way home a couple nights ago. Usually Montana's serves a decent and reasonably priced supper but this location failed miserably. \n\nService: 1 star (our waiter was MIA most of the night)\nAmbiance: 2 star (typical Montana's casual setting)\nCleanliness:  3 star (appeared to be clean)\nFood: 1 star (fish & chips were crap, manager should be embarrassed the kitchen serve's this food, maybe the waiter was and that's why we only saw him three times, once to order, once when he served the food & drinks, and finally once to deliver the check, he never did ask how the food was.)\nPrice: 1 star (because food & service were so poor)
