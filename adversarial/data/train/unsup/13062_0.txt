Food was ok. Mediocre over priced foods. The problem is that I think they are lost in finding their own identity. Japanese food with a twist but they seemed to be trying too hard in the casual setting restaurant. \n\nwhat made our dinner one bad dinner is when we found out that the server and the managements were not on the same page. It was very awkward and we just ended up taking the damage caused by the server because the way he tried to correct the issue was not right. (I don't want to talk about the details because it may point out the individual.) Also, one of managers who explained us about their whiskey collection had no smile at all even though we were smiling the whole time. The whole experience was so awkward that I will never forget. Managements and the employees clearly need more communication.\n\nWish we went to some good local restaurant. That is all I can say after eating at this place.
