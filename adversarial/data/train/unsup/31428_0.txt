I love Cafe Rio because I grew up near the second location ever opened. This location has had its struggles in the past and if you call in your order there is usually one or two things off. Not a complete deal breaker because everything I've eaten in the restaurant is really good. The one time I sent in a complaint on their website they were prompt in responding and addressing the issue which I do appreciate. \n\nHopefully they get the personel issues worked out, but in the mean time, go in to place your order so you can make sure they get it right.
