I typically only comment about restaurants that I like but I have to make an exception here.  I was walking through the food court at Chandler Mall and could not help but gravitate to the Big banner at DQ that said \"Hot Dogs $1.99\".  \n\nWhen I ordered the dog the cashier asked me what I wanted on it.  Coming from Chicago, I asked for mustard, relish and onions.  He then proceeded to tell me that my total was $2.69.  I asked him what happened to the $1.99 dog.  He said that only comes with mustard or ketchup and that you have to pay extra for relish and onions.  I said ok.  Then, when I got the dog there were onions on it and they gave me a package of relish and a package of mustard.  This is what I paid extra for!  Crazy... stick to the Sunday's here....\n\nI know this is petty, but it rubbed me the wrong way.  A classic case of bait and switch!
