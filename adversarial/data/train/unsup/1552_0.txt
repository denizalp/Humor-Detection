Took a Prius to get checked out as the battery gave. The owner and his wife run a super honest business and are very friendly...a refreshing find in this industry. He tested the expensive prius battery and found only one bad cell that needed replacement as opposed to thinking I was looking at a major repair. Returning the next day and with just over a couple hundred $ out of the piggy bank (as opposed to a couple thousand) she was back on the road. I wouldn't think twice about returning here for an honest and FREE assessment of any hybrid related car issues should a future problem arise.
