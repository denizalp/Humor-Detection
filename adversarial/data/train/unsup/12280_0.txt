Largely regarded as one of the best places in the city for burgers- the reputation is justified! I'd rather spend $12-15 on a burger here than on the Strip- quality of beef and other ingredients is comparable (that is, top-notch) and combinations are fabulous.\n\nKIKI'S BURGER: Angus Beef, Saut√©ed Shiitake, Enoki &\nEryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli. Duh-licious. BF took one bite and said it's the best burger he's ever had. It will blow your mushroom-loving mind.\n\nMIYAGI-SAN'S GRASS-FED WAGYU BURGER: Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, Crispy Onion Rings. An Asian take on a breakfast burger, the chili mayo kicks it up to awesome. Add more if you dare.\n\nService is stellar, call in your order for pick up- they require a card to place the order but you can use any form of payment when you get in to pick up.
