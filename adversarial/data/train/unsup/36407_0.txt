My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to have dinner Friday night when we stumbled upon Honi Honi. - and what a delicious surprise. The best pok√© bowl in town. Portions were generous and fresh, even the portion of my glass of wine was generous. The staff was very friendly and polite. We will definitely be coming back.
