I'm waiting for Finese who had just pulled into the parking lot and there's only one available table so I take a seat and I'm looking at the menu... and the server comes up to me and says excuse me you can't sit here you have to get up because you haven't ordered yet. I'm shocked and finese just walked into the door. We get in line and order and the server realizes I'm pregnant  and goes oh now I \"kind of\" feel bad you should get a free baklava. Long story short I'm super offended and I wouldn't force someone who's pregnant out of a seat and he never got me that free baklava.
