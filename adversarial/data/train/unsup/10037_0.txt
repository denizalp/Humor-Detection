I have never wanted to give a 5 star rating as much as I want to give Richardson's one... and despite the most amazing food I have ever tasted.. I cannot give you 5, Richardson's, because the bartender\/server left a lot to be desired. \n\nMaybe if we had sat at a table versus the bar, it would have been different, but it wasn't, so I have to Yelp accordingly. \n\nI will admit, the temperature was perfect, the ambiance was great, the bathrooms had those thick towel\/paper towel hybrids and I had outstanding company, but boy oh boy.. the bartender had quite the stick up his behind. \n\nAnyway, um... the huevos rancheros with red sauce.. eggs scrambled.. was literally the best thing I have ever eaten in all my life. I literally wanted to sit there and digest fully so that I could eat it again. \n\nI must say that the best part about this place is the menu.. and how it specifically states \"high chairs and booster seets will not be provided.\" Yes, that's right, this place is not kid friendly, which is fine by me!\n\nThis place rules. The food rules. I will be back, and hopefully said bartender will have removed the stick and I can update with 5 stars :)
