My mom and I came here for a nice little ladies night out and it was very enjoyable. We sat on the patio which was beautiful! It was hot outside, but there were misters and the trees provided great shade and added a bit of coolness. The pesto and focaccia was delicious. We tried the bruschetta trio...the goat cheese and asparagus, manchego and another one. All were good. The funghi flatbread was good, and the beet salad was great! Overall the atmosphere was very nice.
