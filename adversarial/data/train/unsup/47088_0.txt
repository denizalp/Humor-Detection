The food looked good...if only they would have served me. I wasn't even acknowledged AT ALL.\n\nWalked in on a Sunday night. The lady behind the counter was already helping someone else so I waited until she was done, then she walked back into the kitchen. Two other fellas came in and someone else in the dining room told the lady she had customers. She proceeded to help them and ignored me, despite the fact that I had already been patiently waiting there. They wanted the last of the sisig, which was what I wanted. I asked her if they had anymore sisig left and she didnt even respond. Walked out with a bad taste in my mouth and a lost appetite.
