Came here because of the reviews and wanted to try a new dim sum place. Well just straight to the point.\n\n1. Our server didn't speak any English. So we couldn't ask any questions about the menu.\n\n2. Dum sum is fast, these took forever 20 minutes for dim sum. Taste like everywhere else.\n\n3. The other foods we ordered were just O.K.\n\n4. Waitress never came checked on us. To busy helping the Chinese customers instead. Chinese customers that came in after us, got their food before us. \n\n5. AND THE MAIN REASON  FOR THIS REVIEW. IS , I WROTE A $5.00 TIP ON THE CREDIT CARD RECEIPT BUT WHEN I CHECKED MY BANK THEY WROTE THEMSELVES A $12.83 TIP.\n\n6. FOOD WAS ALREADY EXPENSIVE FOR THE QUALITY THAT WE GOT. WE DIDN'T even complain about the food. The server wouldn't even understand if we told her. We paid for the food left a 10% tip. But they put a 30% tip without my permission.\n\n7. We never write any reviews on yelp, but in this situation it was forced upon us. To let all the other people about this restaurant.\n\nEAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK. CHECK YOUR STATEMENT AFTER THE FACT.
