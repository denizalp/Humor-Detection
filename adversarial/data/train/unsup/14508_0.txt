The Stratosphere Hotel & Casino gets 3 stars in my book, although I've had five star moments more than once.\n\nGenerous comps\nLucky Blackjack tables\nDrinker-friendly pool bar\nReasonably priced rooms\nGolf courses nearby (for daytime drinking)\n\nThis property values \"moderately\" priced play. In my experience, blackjack play averaging $50\/hand results in 700 sq. ft. comped suites with a jacuzzi tub big enough for me and friends (if I had them). The other strip properties don't even make an effort at that play level.\n\nI have been offered comped tickets, travel, & suite accommodations including the 2007 NASCAR races at Las Vegas Motor Speeway & the 2007 Las Vegas Grand Prix.\n\nI get an awful lot of play without digging too deep into the gambling budget account. For some reason, the dollars don't disappear in a drunken haze like at other properties. Truth be told, though, the $1000 I won for a Royal Flush was gone in five hands of Blackjack.\n\nThe pool bar re-opens in early March, probably to coincide with the arrival of all the NASCAR psychos OR because it's warm again, not sure which. Very basic bar with water-misters to keep you chilled out. \n\nThere are two regular bartenders, Dick & Melody, that I've gotten to know over the years. Watch out for these two. Besides really good drinks, they're still on the hunt for a quality photo of the \"moose knuckle\". They already have the framed photo of the \"camel toe\" behind the bar and wish to add to the collection. In other words guys, go to the bar before you go into the cold water.\n\nYears ago when I began visiting this property, rooms were less than $40\/night and as far as I know, still remain in that price range. I don't care who you are, that's cheap in Vegas these days. \n\nDefinitely a good value for the traveler on a budget or who doesn't need the glitz property to have a good time.
