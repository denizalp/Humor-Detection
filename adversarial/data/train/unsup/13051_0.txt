Meh. I've experienced better. I can't complain too much the room was cheap ($56) on Priceline, but ranking this hotel 3 stars is a stretch. They claim to be 4 stars on their website, which is definitely a falsity.\nThe rooms have sort of been remodeled. By this I mean the floors and bedding have been updated, but the furniture and phone have not. The room could have been cleaner, yes. The phone (which was ancient) was not clean. The bathroom was completely tiled and our tub took a really long time to drain.\nThe front desk was always friendly and helpful. Called us a cab, offered us coffee.\nThe gym (this term is used loosely) consisted of a broken treadmill, an elliptical and some free weights. The water cooler didn't work either.\nThe walls are thin, very thin. Miley Cyrus was at the Bell Centre the weekend we were there and we were unfortunately made aware of that fact. Someone was sobbing (sobbing.) in the room next to ours. (hope everything is ok) but didnt need to hear all that.\nWalking distance to Crescent bars which was nice. \nFor a place to crash, Hotel Espresso works, but thats about the end of it.
