DONT. EVER. MOVE. HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe neighbors are all freaking crazy. like bat (you know what) crazy.  \nLet me tell you about them! \nOur downstairs neighbor likes the BLAST his music until 4 am ... and I mean BLAST to the point when there are pictures FALLING OFF MY WALLS AND I CAN FEEL THE VIBRATION THROUGH THE FLOOR!!! \nAnd our other neighbor is constantly drunk, unemployed and usually slamming things around or verbally abusing his girlfriend. I mean its bad. I sit on my patio with a glass of wine sometimes because Im nosey and want to know what happened between them that day.\nThe other neighbor is a drug dealer. The kids that live down stairs run around completely unsupervised. \n\nThe pool there... yah, just don't. Maricopa County shut it down do to it being unsafe water to swim in and mind you, Maricopa County only checks apartment pools twice a year. So its probably a walking fest pool 90% of the year. \n\nThe bugs! Their are cockroaches that are living in the walls and come out of the vents! No matter what you do ... they paid someone to spray, that didnt do a damn thing. \nThey do a terrible job cleaning the apartment before you move in... like seriously, I should show you the ceiling fan. All the appliances are from the 70s, the cabinets look like a project from middle school shop, and when they told us it was \"move in ready\" it was not.. they had not painted the walls like they promised. \n\nThe people at the front office are cool though.
