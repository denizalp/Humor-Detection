I didn't even know this place existed let alone that it was a chain. \n\nSearching for a quick lunch spot between two meeting places, Heidi's Deli popped up on the Yelp app and figured why not, seems A-OK! The service here is fast, but not so friendly, this didn't deter me from still enjoying my lunch and catching on up on some emails.\n\nI got the Cajun Turkey with avocado; sliced deli style turkey, tomato, lettuce, avocado and spicy Cajun \"sauce\". If you look up turkey sandwich in the dictionary there's picture of this sandwich next to it... look nailing it isn't a bad thing, but damn man, spice this bad boy up. Adding some spicy mayo doesn't really do the trick. This might be the basic b*tch of sammies. \n\nThe service here doesn't come with a smile either. I was a little confused with ordering process and asked a question about building your sandwich or using a prefixed menu and I was made to feel like I just asked where babies come from. BTW - A stork's butt is what I still think. \n\nIt does the trick for a quick lunch, but that's about it.
