Stopped in with the GF on a Saturday night to check it out.  She has been here before and I have not.  Just after the dinner rush, we were seated quickly.  With that being said, there was still a lot of bodies inside the joint.  Our little two person was on the fringe of the bar area and the main dining area.  A possible \"no man's land\" in other locations but not here.  \n\nOur server was very attentive and patient as we checked out the menu. I enjoyed checking out the modern lodgey feel of the place. He rolled by multiple times and I never detected any attitude, even after the third time.  \n\nAfter the fourth time, we were ready to order.  I had the \"Maggie's Snake River Salad.  Which I found to be very tasty.  It consisted of bacon, goat cheese, cranberries, tomatoes, walnuts and a balsamic vinaigrette.\n\nThe GF ordered up a lemon-capper chicken.  It was also delicious!\n\nTogether we ordered up some Cajun fries. The chipotle ranch dipping sauce was nice compliment.\n\nSure, there were tasty and healthy selections on the menu. I look forward to coming back again and getting down and dirty on a \"cheat\" day.\n\nHence the name...you can bring your four legged friend or family member and enjoy a special section of the menu outside with them!
