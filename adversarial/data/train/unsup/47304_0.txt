My fiance and I ended up here after having no luck with finding an open pizza place for an early dinner. \nAlthough this is a little place, quite cramped, with loads of tables and chairs, the staff was extremely friendly and the server was sharp as a tack, and super attentive. \nWe had a simple pepperoni pizza and a Greek salad and we were both quite impressed. The pizza came out of the kitchen hot. The crust was thin, chewy and crispy on the edges. \nI really like this place because it's a no-frills pizza place that uses fresh ingredients. I also like it because it's family-owned and operated...so tired of huge chain places, you know?\nI grabbed a magnet (which boasts delivery service, heck yes!) and a to-go menu on my way out the door. We'll surely be back.
