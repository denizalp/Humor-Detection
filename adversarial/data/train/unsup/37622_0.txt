Came in tonight with family (9 of us) and they were very accommodating and friendly. You order from the counter and they bring you the food. I can't even begin to tell you how awesome the staff is. Friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, funny and every single one of them were fantastic. The 2 guys at the counter helped my parents maneuver an unfamiliar menu, brought out our food in a timely fashion, joked with us and we just had fun. The owner came by and thanked us for coming in and chatted it up with us, telling my sister to find a husband etc...very sweet man. Ok...the food. We tried the crab puffs which we all agreed were the best we'd had, the wonton and egg drop soup came out so hot and had more than a few peas in it like most other places, the walnut shrimp was beautiful and creamy, the Mongolian beef was a favorite and the mushroom stir fry was chock full of veggies. We also did the teriyaki chicken, sauce was a little sweet but ok because it came on the side anyways. I had the lemon chicken which was a bit flavorless for me and came with broccoli, chow mein noodles, brown, white or fried rice ( your choice). The portions were huge and we took a ton home. Also, the lettuce wraps were amazing and the prices were fair for the amount of food you get.This is now our new spot and if you try it, it'll be yours too.
