This review is for lunch. Apparently the dinner is even more amazing so I'll have to return for that.\nThey have $9.95 lunch specials which include a small soup, your choice of entree from a list, and a dessert. The quality and taste are exceptional. And for that price, you really can't beat it. There was no wait at all during lunch. Service was excellent as well. This is a more upscale place than next-door Lotus of Siam.
