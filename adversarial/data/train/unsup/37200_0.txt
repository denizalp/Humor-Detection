Our bartender- Jeffery- was hilarious, on point with the drinks, and full of info about things to do in the area. We had only planned to stay for one drink but we spent the evening laughing with him and the people at the bar. \nThe hotel is beautifully decorated, and the roof deck was amazing, but we opted to stay downstairs and talk with Jeff. I would highly recommend ANYONE visiting to stop in- or stay here. We are staying at a hotel down the street and regret it. The pool looks so refreshing and there are cabanas... Why didn't we stay here??? \nBack to the booze... We had tequila drinks and Jeff gave us the option to upgrade the liquor: so much better! Will definitely be back, thanks to him! :)
