Long story short...\n\nThe staff was all stretched way too thin.\n\nOur Mexican food (2 orders fajitas, one order enchiladas) took about 45 minutes. It was all lukewarm at best.\n\nNo one ever checked that it was all good. Our server went to bartend for about 30 minutes and we actually had to walk up to the bar and beg for our checks.\n\nLiterally the only positive thing I can say is that the salsa was tasty.\n\nIf I return it'll be for the football games by default since it's in the strip of popular sports bars.
