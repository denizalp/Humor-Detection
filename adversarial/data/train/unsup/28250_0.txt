I love this place. Everything I've had was delicious!\n\nI still vividly remember my first visit here, when Ian, the now-manager was our waiter. That was an awesome night. We ate so.much.sushi.\n\nI adore that they offer sushi & cooked options so it's a great place to go with folks who (for whatever reason) don't eat sushi when you are madly craving it. They also keep Tamari soy sauce on hand for those who are gluten-free!\n\nThey have always been super accommodating with my allergies - I was even made special rolls based on what I wasn't allergic to. This sushi addict was deeply grateful!
