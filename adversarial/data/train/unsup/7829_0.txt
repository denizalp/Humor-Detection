This place is cool, if you into this kind of thing. Its just a tons of \"Junk\" scattered around and you get to walk through there and pick what you like. Now, when i say \"Junk\" i do not mean Garbage by any means. Its just..... well.... hard to describe. Some stuff is actually made\/built, some pieces are parts of other things, some others are indescribable, some are actual junk LOL. \n\nIf you have open mind, have some time, a few bux and a car - Go check it out. Its real neat and unusual.\n\n\"I like\"\n\nEugene
