I have absolutely fallen head-over-heels in love with Hula's for so many reasons! Let's just go over a few:\n\n-The amazing tofu tacos\n-The \"I'm-gonna-fuck-you-up\" Scorpion Bowl (they light the 151 on fire!)\n-The kick ass happy hour\n-Outdoor seating with misters\n-Sweet potato fries\n\nThis is a really laid back environment with a lot of options for veggies AND vegans, and they have really awesome drinks. Do yourself the favor and head here with a group of friends and split the scorpion bowl. You can thank me later, just be prepared to call yourself a DD.
