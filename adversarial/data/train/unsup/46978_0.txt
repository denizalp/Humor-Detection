FIRST THING ..... in a sketchy area and doesn't look appealing from the outside \nSECOND THING..... you'll forget about it once you try the #37 bento for $12. It is hands down the best bento in Vegas for the price. The Teri chicken was too good to be true along with the unique katsu with pre added katsu sauce but didn't need more at all, to top it off the 4pc sushi crunch roll sealed the deal. definitely coming back !!!
