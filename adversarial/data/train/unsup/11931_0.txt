Saving the day with dumplings, it's Dumpling Hero! I ran into this bright and cheerful food-mobile at Circle The Wagons and decided to give them a shot. Why? No lineup! The length of the line is always a huge incentive or deterrent to me at food truck festivals and today, The Dumpling Hero conquered the competition at the line game.\n\nI went with the dumpling sampler tray, clocking in at $12(ish) dollars and features an 8(ish) dumpling mix of their varieties. I don't want to blame the beer, but a part from the Hamburger Dumpling, I can't for the life of me remember what the other ones are. They all look very similar so I quickly forgot which ones were which, but instead tried to taste my way through them looking for the hamburger dumpling. Sadly, I also found that they tasted very similar too. While they have a variety of dumplings and they are no doubt good quality,  I found that most of them just tasted very, well... \"dumpling-y.\"\n\n If I'm missing the mark here, and there's a good chance I am - I definitely think there's room some for some dumpling education. I want to be so excited about dumplings and I think there's room for so much creativity to get people excited about them too, I really do! Maybe the flour is harvested by monks? Maybe everything is organic, fresh and made by hand? Maybe it's a crazy concoction of flavours I've never seen before, loaded with crazy toppings? If there's a reason for me to pay $12 for a snack-size plate of dumplings, I'll do it! But in this case, sadly I left pretty confused.\n\nIt was an alright, tasty, albeit somewhat expensive snack to share while we waited in the line at another truck to get a meal.\n\nHave you been? I'd love to hear your thoughts.
