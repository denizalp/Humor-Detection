NO SERVICE, NO SALSA, NO SMILE\n\nWe had walked by several times and finally decided to stop one night when the music wasn't so loud and the bar wasn't packed. We didn't want to fight for a table so it was a good time, late at night. All we wanted was chips and salsa. We sat at the bar but quickly grew impatient as we weren't noticed.\n\nOnce we finally received our menus the bartender had left to do something. I forget what they were asking for the chips and salsa but we'd been told it was just one salsa, (no \"hot\" option; no \"verde\" option) so for whatever the price was we didn't think it was worth it and ended up walking out. \n\nDidn't even get a goodbye.\n\nNote: We did however have a great time another night taking pictures on the four stools as you enter. Fun stuff!
