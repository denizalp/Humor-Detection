To start let me simply say.. You NEED to go here.  Their menu is very small offering only several different types of fish cooked in the classic fish & chips style but they know what they are doing and do it spot on.  They do a HUGE take-out business (sadly i am too far away to be able to do takeout since you really need to eat fish and chips as soon as they come out of the fryer to get the optimal experience) and  dining area is very small so depending on when you arrive there can be a bit of a wait for your food.  They cook each order individually ensuring that the fryer is not over crowded so that your fish and chips instantly sear a nice crispy crust ensuring none of the food is ever greasy.  The portions are large both for your fish and your chips so you definitely won't leave hungry.
