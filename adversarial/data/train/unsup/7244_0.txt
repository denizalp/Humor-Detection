OMG. I may gain an additional 50 pounds thanks to Kneaders.\n\nMy weakness is bread. Always has been...and kneaders is baking up a TON of fresh bread on the regular, nearly every type you can imagine, PLUS the dessert case is brimming with the best brownies, bread pudding, cake and pie that you have ever had.\n\nTheir sandwiches are huge, so if you order one, plan on sharing or having half of it to take home. And believe me, you will want to save room for pineapple cake, a cinnamon roll or brownies. BELIEVE ME.\n\nThey also server all you can eat french toast on the weekends. You are speaking my love language Kneaders!!! And why is is the best, melt in your mouth, gooey, cinnamony french toast ever?\n\nWatch. 50 pounds are coming at me. UGH.
