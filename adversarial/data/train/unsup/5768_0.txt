Pretty snazzy fries and a decent double double were my companions during this workday, and I must say they were truly good company. Perhaps if I was able to sit down and enjoy my meal rather than have to eat it on the go, I could have savored it much better. But, I'm in the process of streamlining our courier service and had to focus more on the navigation of the driver than this delicious burger and tasty fries, so something might have been lost in translation.\n\nNeedless to say, if I ever find myself transferred to our Mesa branch for the day, I know I'll stop by In-N-Out Burger to sate my loins.
