Here's one very important reminder about Holstein's...\n\nHolstein's is located on the strip inside the Cosmo.  \n\nWhat does that mean?  It means that you'll probably have to wait a bit to be seated, a meal here is going to cost a grip, and you may be surrounded by that \"Vegas Baby\" crowd.   It would be very easy to hate on Holstein's.  But I understand what to expect on the strip in regards to the wait times and prices.  Besides, no one forced me to come here.  All that being said, the burgers here are pretty good and only quality beef is served here.  I got the Gold Standard on my first visit and amazed with the thickness, the juiciness, and taste.  It's basically a quality steak in a bun.  I recently got the Nom Nom Burger and it was good too, but lacked the thickness\/size of the Gold Standard.  One things for sure, I'll be having the Gold Standard the next time I come back.  I can't even tell you how good or bad the desserts are because I don't have a sweet tooth and honestly, I just don't remember.  But I suggest that you try them because Holstein's is also known for their desserts.  \n\n2017 Yelp Review #53
