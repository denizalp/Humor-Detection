This was amazing. The food was incredible and I had one of the best lemon drop martinis I have ever had. My friend and I went here before going to the Cirque du Sole show right across from it and I could not have been happier with the service. Our waitress was so nice and attentive even though it was pretty crowded. I had the bbq chicken pizza and it was soooooo good and it was very reasonably priced.
