To all those who love fresh coffee along side with their home made coffee buns, then no further calls as Papparoti is one of the best I've ever tried in Canada. They have their coffee shops across Canada, and this is when I came across papparoti when I was living in BC before I moved to Montreal but they just opened one here and that makes me super happy.\n\nThe caf√© is so cute and well decorated. Love the staff as they just opened but they made you feel so welcome. Their menus are the same with the coffee buns being the main focus here!! \n\nI ordered the original coffee bun and added a side of Nutella. They brought me my bun within couple of minutes and I was sitting at the mezzanine floor where there are sofas and places to chill and even study as it's quiet. Love the flowers and display as it's serene and positive. \n\nAt my first bite of my papparoti bun, I was in heaven as it brought me back so many memories back from  BC, I fell in love with it and it was delicious just like when I first tasted it!  It has a crisp to it which also has a crunchy exterior but so fluffy that I'm gonna die. It has the perfect mix of sweet but salty. Plus, they have so many locations around the world!\n\nI'd definitely recommend it to all go try it and give it a shot as it's amazing and the staff are so nice and friendly! I'd keep going back for sure as it's one of my favs for sure
