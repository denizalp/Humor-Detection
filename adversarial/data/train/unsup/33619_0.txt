Bridget did a fantastic job on my hair. I paid $35 on a groupon to see if I liked her hair cutting \/ dye styles I couldn't be more pleased. Rates are very reasonable but even more so she is personable a great listener. Often I would get my roots touched up and hair trimmed but found my experience was less than friendly. Sure a lot of places have a upscale setting, free drinks, chandlers, mani pedi while you wait but conversation was dull. The environment was very clean, upscale and friendly. Bridget you have a customer for life. My daughter will be getting her hair done with her next week. I will be coming back for facial wax and hair dye\/ cut in May. Thanks again : )
