This place is off da chain!!! Love it, it's my close go to besides hauling across town to go to LoLo's. I did not think this place could compare by looking at the outside but I surely was wrong. I got the two piece dinner and before I could take pictures of my meal it was gone! Luckily, there is always tomorrow. This place is a definite must try.
