I should have read the reviews before coming here - it would've saved me a bunch of time, a very mediocre meal, and $17. I have a low bar for airport food, and this was three strikes: overpriced, poor quality, and poor service. I would've rather had a piece of Sbarro pizza or frozen pizza.\n\nFor starters, the cashier was rude and grumpy. I was trying to decide what to order and asked her which Scacci (stromboli) was good, and she said she didn't eat the food here (that should have been a first warning sign). \n\nSecond, once I got my food, it didn't come with utensils so I went looking for a fork and knife. Normally, they would be by where you pick up your food, not behind where you order, so I asked the cashier where they were. She scowled at me and waved her hand with a rude, \"There\". They were out of forks and it took them a good 3 minutes to get someone to replace it, after I had to ask several people twice.\n\nThird, not only was it overpriced at $17 (with tax) for a stromboli and small salad, but the food quality was poor. The salad was just a handful of not-super-fresh greens but the stromboli was the worst one I've ever had. Imagine a quesadilla, made with super thin pizza dough, then 2 hard, lukewarm mozzarella cheese, chemically tasting chicken, some spinach, tomato sauce, and some spinach. Not to mention the entire thing was oily.  I couldn't work on my laptop or touch my phone since I had greasy hands.\n\nAll in all, a very poor experience. From all accounts - food, service, and price, this was a fail. Go somewhere else.
