With a lot of buzz about this place, I figured I would give it a shot.  The service was good, but the food was a let-down.  \n\nI got the \"Iron Chef Sliders\" with fries and a chocolate malt.  The sliders were ok, but nothing special, and not even remotely deserving of the \"Iron Chef\" name.  I mean, if that's Iron-Chef-winning flavor, then I'd like to take on Flay or Cora with my own grill, because they didn't taste much different than me grilling burgers in my backyard.  The fries were only OK; at least the malt was pretty good. \n\nI'm not gonna dock any points for the ambiance, since I know it's just Las Vegas kitsch, but I grew up when the Soviet Union was always the bad guys, so eating here did feel just a little bit wrong.  I appreciate the clever play on their acronym, but I'd much rather be surrounded by American flags and bald eagles and all that, rather than the sickles and hammers that decorate Kerry's Gourmet Burgers. \n\nWould I eat here again?  Possibly.  I wouldn't be opposed to it, but I think I'd rather roll the dice and take my chances at one of the many other fancy burger joints that Las Vegas has to offer.\n\nTop Tip: make sure to have a Harrah's reward card, and you'll get a dollar off most menu items!
