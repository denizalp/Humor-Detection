Some of the best tacos in vegas. Great spot to get your fix on mexican food with a variety of meats to choose from.. the combo deals are great because they come with beans and rice or french fries.. the choices of salsas are worth trying and don't forget yo try their fries with a choice of meat, worth every bite... also, the owners and the staff in this taco shop are awesome...
