Well I have been here twice this past month (due to family members picking the spot) and I can honestly say after two separate visits I'm still not impressed. \n\nThe food is okay, the prices are pretty extravagant for what you get- the only real good part about this place is the live music and atmosphere on a Friday night. \n\nLast time I had the seasonal pumpkin soup which was very herb heavy. I honestly don't remember my entree so I have no opinion one way or another. This visit I got the salmon which was cooked perfectly. The badness was desert when I decided on the Tu-zookie (think Oregano's Pizookie but not nearly as awesome). In their defense the menu says the cookie dough is half-baked but when it came out it was a raw mess. I could not stomach eating it which is sad because there goes $6.99.\n\nFor such a nice looking place you'd think they'd have it all together, but for what you pay I don't think I'll be going back.
