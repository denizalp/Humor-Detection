We were in town for a concert at Browns Stadium and were looking around for a good breakfast place to go to before heading back home. This one popped up and after reading all the great reviews we decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed!! Portions were large, generous, and delicious. The sausage gravy is very flavorful... They use cut up pieces of link sausage, which is different, but it worked! I was able to substitute a couple items in the combo with no trouble... Our server could have been a little more peppy, but it was busy and she could have been in the weeds. Totally understandable. The manager checked in with us and was super friendly. Even the busser was great. Always polite and ready to refill our water glasses or remove dishes we were done with. Great experience, huge selection to choose from, really great prices. Great find! Oh, and if you're a lady, don't be alarmed if you go into the ladies room and find a urinal. You're in the right place! :-)
