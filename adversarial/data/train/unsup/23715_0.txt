I've dined and gotten to go orders from here more frequently and I've always had fast and friendly service. This Friday's lunch buffet was memorably spectacular, with a large dessert and cold dish row, and numerous delicious dishes including a lovely fried fish (A special item not found on the regular menu but oh so good), idli, dosa, and various biriyani. There were 2 different soups available and free chai tea to the side. The manager(?)\/owner(?) stopped by at our table and recognized me as a frequent patron and welcomed my friend to the restaurant. Upgrade one star for quality and friendliness!\n\nP.S. All their meat is halal for those that have religious dietary restrictions.
