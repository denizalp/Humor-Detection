I had heard great things about Homegoods but I was a little disappointed after finally checking them out a couple weeks ago. They do have a wide variety of items available in the store but it was very overwhelming to shop there because it was just too much stuff crammed into the aisles. The furniture was very poor quality which I guess is ok since they only had like accent pieces that don't need to carry a big load but I just wasn't happy with anything I saw. I was more impressed with the options for the kitchen and bath but after looking at the prices I think that Bed Bath and Beyond can beat them in most cases if you use a coupon. And that is a much more pleasant shopping experience. I don't think I would shop at Homegoods again unless I was looking for something very specific and I didn't care about brand or quality.
