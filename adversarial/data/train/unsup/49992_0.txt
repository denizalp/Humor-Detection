It was my first time to see a show in Vegas and I enjoyed it. The acrobatics and stage settings were breathtaking, and the musical extracts featured throughout the show harked back to memories of a multitude of Beatles' songs. It's played at the Mirage -- centrally located on the Strip. The show was played on a stage with seats surrounding it 360 degree-style, and the curtains draping over in various directions were lifted and put down for amazing artistic effects. I would recommend this show if you're a Beatles fan, or if you're not that into the other more raucous or raunchy shows that are nonetheless a decidedly Vegas staple.
