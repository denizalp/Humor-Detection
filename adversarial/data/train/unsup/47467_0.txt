I have been here 3 times in the last month or two. Twice for lunch with family and had good service and the food (breakfast once and a boxty once--both very good). Love the patio in good weather. The fireplace is a nice touch. My daughter liked it so much the first time, we came back with one of her friends two weeks later. \nLast night, my experience was lukewarm at best. I sat at the bar with a friend. It wasn't super busy, but there was a decent crowd. The female bartender was less than attentive to us or friendly. The male picked up the slack, though. I ordered the Buffalo chicken wrap with broccoli. The broccoli was excellent. The wrap, horrid. The chicken in it was sparingly added and there was about a quarter cup or Buffalo sauce dumped into the lettuce and tomato mixture inside. I had to squeeze the sauce out to eat the first half and then only ate the chicken tidbits out of the other half. Very disappointing.
