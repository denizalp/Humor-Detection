Andrew was super nice but the hypnosis was more like a relaxation meditation. I've been to another hypnotist that I had results with but he was unavailable so I booked with Toronto Hypnotherapy. I felt kind of nice afterwards because it was relaxing. There were no changes to the issues I came in with so it was rather disappointing. I won't go back because I can use a guided meditation CD to do the same thing that happened in his office.
