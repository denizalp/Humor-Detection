4 stars because there are so many delicious mouth watering dinner \"special\" that I am teased with and the current menu is different than old menu.   I spent almost 30 minutes trying to find something.   Well I did, it was a chicken mock with BBQ, caramelized peppers and onions, I added avocado and it was on a soft roll.   I added side of grilled Brussels sprouts, they were crisp still, a little over seasoned.  They would have been better softer, less seasoning.. I enjoyed house made lime drink, and then soft served nice cream.   Overall, place was well worth my stop, prices are fair.   Its also a very busy place.   Every few minutes 2-3 more cars pull up and I see the parking lot full with I think all of your customers.   Line to order was not a long wait, 2-3 mins each time i went up to counter.   Bring back some of those specials :)
