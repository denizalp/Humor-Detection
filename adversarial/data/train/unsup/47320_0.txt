Legit chill Irish pub so this review is based on Irish Pub criteria. It's dark and moody, it's got good food...great drinks, and good people.\n\nFood - B+ Bordering on A. Get the mussels. Done.\nDrinks - B+\/A- I like the availability of Irish\/English brews on tap and they have cider. I am a freak for cider, but that's just me. Oh and their house wines are legit. \nSeating - A++ Dark Corners, tables, Booths, High tops. \nThe Patio - Decent sized for what you gotta do out there.\nHey, and there's a game room! Sweet.\n\n\nWhen I used to live in Chandler this was an often visited watering hole. I kinda miss its chill vibe OH and I forgot to mention: There's a Filibee's in the parking lot. So, if you need some grub at 2:15am...you're covered.\n\nI just decided after writing this review, I'm heading back ASAP. You dark mistress Fibber's...ya got me.
