Located on the ground floor of The Juhl directly on the corner of Bonneville Avenue and 3rd Street. Ample street parking surrounding the building and beyond. Very easy to access and away from the the usual tourist traffic of DTLV.\n\nAfter three visits, I've had a really good sampling of the menu. There are still a couple dishes I want to try, so I would definitely try those on my next visit. Bottom line: great food and great service. Although the location is very far from me, I'm happy to make the drive!\n\nChicken Wings ($7): Crispy Wings quick-tossed with housemade tamarind sauce; topped with garlic chips. The chicken is cooked well and the sauce is delicious. There is a Five-Spice Salt and Pepper version ($5) offered during Social Hour (4-7PM daily) that is also really good.\n\nEgg Rolls ($8): Fried Northern-style with pork, crab meat, Wood Ear mushrooms, carrot, and cellophane noodles. Crunchy and tasty; a solid egg roll.\n\nTraditional Spring Roll ($7): Shrimp, pork, vermicelli noodles, fried wonton, bean sprouts, mint, and lettuce. Decent, but nothing exciting.\n\nVegan Spring Roll ($7): Fried tofu, shiitake mushroom, bell pepper, grilled onion, lettuce, mint, and bean sprouts. I love this option for my non-meat eating friends, but there wasn't a lot of flavor going on.\n\nLe Pho Roll ($7): Grilled five spice pork, basil, lettuce, and scallion oil. So, so much flavor in the pork and accompanying ingredients. The rice noodle is perfect, too. This is my favorite roll!\n\nNem Nuong Roll ($7): Vietnamese pork roll, fried wonton, lettuce, bean sprout, and mint. Just like the Traditional Spring Roll, this is just okay and not very exciting.\n\nBo Bia Roll ($8): Lap Cheong, dried shrimp, shredded omelet, and jicama. This is a fun \"breakfast\" roll that is also very tasty.\n\nLotus Root Salad ($10): Lotus root, pork, shrimp, roasted peanuts, cilantro, and fish sauce vinaigrette. Served with sesame rice crackers. I love the crunch from the lotus root and everything tastes so great together. Great low-carb option without sacrificing taste.\n\nVietnamese Poached Chicken Salad ($9): Poached chicken, cabbage, red onion, rau ram (Vietnamese coriander), crushed roasted peanuts, fried shallots, crushed shrimp rice crackers, and fish sauce vinaigrette. This was good, but no exciting flavors either.\n\nHouse Special Banh Mi ($9): Toasted French baguette with pork cold cuts, pork pâté, mayonnaise, pickled daikon and carrots, jalapeño, scallion, and cilantro. The bread was crusty, but soft, so it was the perfect vehicle for this popular sandwich. Tasty, though it could use more meat!\n\nPho Dipped Banh Mi ($11): Toasted French baguette with slow-cooked beef brisket, bean sprout, basil, pickled daikon and carrots, jalapeño, hoisin, and sriracha sauce. Served with a bowl of pho broth. Even though I'm usually drawn to a traditional Ban Mi (I loove the meats), this is a really great sandwich and their pho broth is seriously amazing.\n\nRibeye Pho ($10): I had this on my first visit and it revived my faith in Pho. Again, the broth is phenomenal and the vermicelli noodles are just amazing. I've had the House Special Pho ($12) as well with Ribeye, flank, tendon, tripe and meatball. Also wonderful.\n\nVermicelli Bowl ($17): Grilled pork, lettuce, bean sprouts, mint, crushed roasted peanuts, scallion oil, fish sauce, and vermicelli noodles. *Add Shrimp and Egg Rolls. They have the best vermicelli noodles in town; it's slightly thicker and have a great texture. The dish itself is fantastic. The charbroiled pork and shrimp are really delicious.\n\nBen Thanh Market Fried Rice ($12): Dried shrimp, Lap Cheong, eggs, and diced asparagus. Topped with salted egg yolk. Everything about this dish would make me think I'd like it, but it was rather bland compared to a lot of the other flavors going on in this place.\n\nHoi An Chicken Rice ($10): Poached chicken, pickled daikon and carrot, and turmeric rice. This is very similar to Hainan poached chicken. The chicken is flavorful and prepared nicely. The rice is also tasty and everything is great together. Add Nuoc Cham for added deliciousness.\n\nDuck Noodle Bowl ($15): Five-spiced braised duck, thin egg noodles, bok choy, shiitake mushroom, organic Onsen egg, scallion, and garlic chips. The dish was a little salty, so that made it hard to fully enjoy, but the noodles and ingredients were great.\n\nWok-Tossed Filet Mignon ($18): Wok-tossed filet mignon and seasonal vegetables with black pepper sauce, watercress, red torpedo, and spring onion mix. Served with white rice. A good version of \"Shaking Beef;\" flavorful and tender steak.\n\nBanh Beo ($9): Steamed rice cakes with ground mung bean, dried shrimp, scallion, and crispy pork rinds. Not bad, but it was missing crispy shallot and lacking slightly in flavor.\n\nFavorites: Le Pho Roll, Bo Bia Roll, Pho Dipped Banh Mi, Ribeye Pho, House Special Pho, Vermicelli Bowl, and Hoi An Chicken Rice.
