I'm 400% done with this place. \n\nI used to live near here and it was everything in my childhood- used to be sketchy and skate here, even when the red flag was up. Oops. & the hills are okay for tobogganing. \n\nWHY I HATE IT:\nThe people that come here are the ratchet mainlanders that bring their fishing rods to fish beside the sign that says \"no fishing\" or old Caucasians that turn their nose up to everyone else. I can't deal with it. The bridge is only .5cm wide and only half a person can fit through at one time. I don't even need to bring up how many times I got pushed through by the mainlanders that are rushing to take a picture for their WeChat. \n\nThe pond water is also rancid and these geese attack everything. You can't even fight back because that shit's illegal. You also have those idiots that bring bread to feed geese - yeah they'll eat your dollar store bread because they don't know that shit's killing them. The pond is not deep (proven to be waist-deep), so don't even think about drowning your enemies here, because you will get caught immediately. \n\nOverall, too crowded with weird people and high school kids. Somehow, this is the new place where people hang out???? It's not a romantic place at any time of the year. The amount of people that come here during the fireworks shows in the summer makes me want to die. \n\nAgain, 400% done with this place.
