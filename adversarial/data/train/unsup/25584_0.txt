This is one of downtown Pittsburgh's unappreciated restaurants. My wife and I have never been disappointed by the food or service. My go to entree is the mushroom risotto. My wife always gets the meat and cheese board, which is exquisite. I'm a fan of the ambiance especially when the weather allows the windows to be open.
