I still think I prefer the Studio B buffet over at the M hotel, just cuz it's quite the hefty price to pay around $40-50 each time I've been here. The first time I went was during the weekend during brunch. The food was quite impressive then. The second time, however, not so much. Though that last time, I came on a Thursday night. Seems to me they're not entirely consistent. The wait for this buffet is pretty ridiculous!
