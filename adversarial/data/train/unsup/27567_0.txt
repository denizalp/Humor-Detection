This is a good place for a dinner date.  Cantina 1511 boasts a great atmosphere, eye-catching decor, and romantic lighting.  The menu is split into two sections: authentic Mexican dishes on one side and the Americanized entrees we're all used to on the other.  Their specialty is handmade guacamole made tableside with a mortar and pestle.  I usually avoid guacamole like the plague (mostly because of the appearance, if I'm honest) but I gotta admit, this stuff was very tasty!  If you're looking for a unique Mexican dining experience, give Cantina 1511 a visit!
