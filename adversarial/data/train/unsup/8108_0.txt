Where I go when I want to get smashed!\n\nThere are a lot of burger joints in this town, so the competition is fierce (like Sasha).  When I have those off days I want a burger but aren't feeling In N Out or Five Guys, I often end up at Smashburger.  Gotta love those griddled burnt edges!  Smash, smash away my friends!\n\nI'm one who likes the ease of combos on a menu, and finally Smashburger has a few \"Smash Specials\" on their roster.  For $5.99 you can have your choice of a regular:\n\n-Classic Smash\n-All American\n-Mushroom Swiss\n-Classic Hot Dog\n-Classic Smashchicken ($6.99)\n\nEach special comes with a small order of French fries or Smash fries (fries seasoned with olive oil, rosemary & garlic).  For another $1.89 you can add on a small drink.  I like the convenience of this as well as the price so I often get this as a meal.  I usually go for the Classic Smash (American cheese, Smash sauce, ketchup, lettuce, tomato, onion & pickle on an egg bun) or the Mushroom Swiss (Crimini mushrooms, Swiss & mayo on an egg bun).  Don't get me wrong, I love the Sin City burger just as much as the next guy, but sometimes I like my fries included with the burger, you know?\n\nYou can of course add another $1 and get your Smashburger upgraded to the 'Big' size, but honestly I think it can be a tad dry.  If I'm gonna eat a 'fat' burger, I want the middle of it to be pink & juicy!  Yes folks I said it.  And I mean it.  Their egg bun is where it's at though.  Supple, yet firm, makes their burgers tasty!\n\nThe Smash Special combo is just enough to satisfy my appetite.  You hungry eaters will most likely just order the bigger burger to begin with.  I have yet to try most of their other side or options on the menu, but they don't look half bad.  Fried pickles or haystack onions?  I'm in.  Cobb Salad?  I'd give it a whirl.  Hand-spun Haagen-Dazs milkshakes?  I think I will!\n\nSmashing!
