The place has been open for a little over a week now so I had low expectations in terms of service as a previous review mentioned. I was pleasantly surprised that our three course dinner was done within an hour and a half and we also got to visit their garden! After being seated by the host your waiter\/waitress comes to your table offering you sparkling or flat water and explains you their concept: you choose either the 3 (45$ + extra 30$ for wine pairing) or 5 (65$ or 60$ vegetarian + extra 45$ for wine pairing) course dinner, tell them your food restrictions and based on that the chef decides what to serve you. The menu only says prices as I mentioned therefore there are no food description and no ingredients... so I don't feel this is the ideal place for picky eaters. We we're served: grilled asparagus on pistachio pesto with dill and anchovies (oh so good), homemade buckwheat pasta in butter lobster sauce with roasted tomatoes and lobster meat (incredible), and a little Japanese cheesecake with mango, strawberry and rhubarb (every bite was delicious). The service was fantastic, the wine pairings were delicious and for the quality and freshness of the ingredients along with presentation and taste, 45$ for 3 courses (as well as the amuses-bouches at the beginning and the mignardises at the end) was a very reasonable price. I was satisfied with my three-course dinner and wine pairing, my boyfriend still felt like he needed a little more food so those with bigger appetites should opt for the 5 course menu. I loved every moment of my experience at HVOR and recommend to every foodie in town.
