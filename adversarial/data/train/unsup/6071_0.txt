I was referred to this office for my twins stomach issues. The doctors office is on the fourth floor of the building and to even get into the office the staff must buzz you in. Which they did, safety is a plus nowadays and a reality in our lives. To see this level of security upon entering the office I feel safe at least coming here knowing that the office is willing to invest in this level of safety for their staff and patients. \n\nAfter doing the paperwork and insurance check in I sat and waited in the chairs in the lobby. The chairs are leather and are very comfortable. The lobby is very inviting and welcoming. The art is very modern in the waiting area too. The staff that checked me in was highly professional and had all the paperwork in order. She was very pleasant to speak with as well.\n\nWhen I met with the doctor he was professional as well and asked more in-depth questions to help diagnose what was bothering her. I informed the doctor of her symptoms and he went over some dietary changes that we should incorporate. Also he sent her for some extra testing too. I was extremely happen with this doctor and believe that he had a great bedside manner and is highly trained. We will return when soon too.
