The food is always amazing!! We can never decide which is better so we get both a full chicken and 1lb carne asada. Also the staff is friendly and helpful. We use Pollo Picante for catering large parties and for just a week night dinner at home. If you pick up from the restaurant be prepared, you will be drooling the whole time you're inside because it smells delicious, like grilled meats!!
