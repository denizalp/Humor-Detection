Wow! Talk about Drinks with a VIEW! My company recently flew me out to Phoenix on business and I had the pleasure of staying at the Kimpton Palomar. The Lustre Bar is right on the rooftop featuring some of the best views that you can get downtown Phoenix! They also had a pool to enjoy if you are wanting to take a dip while enjoying the views. \n\nMy co-workers and I grabbed a cabana one night and ordered a few rounds of drinks! What surprised us all is that the prices for the drinks were actually pretty decent! The type of scenery and vibe that this place gives off is EXPENSIVE! So when the bill cane we were pleased to see that they weren't as much as we thought! \n\nThe service from our waitresses was awesome! They stayed very attentive and fast with the service for our drinks. This is something that would definitely ensure that we would come back over and over again! Oh yeah and make sure you don't miss a great photo opportunity by taking a picture in that huge chair they have!
