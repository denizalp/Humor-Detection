After the Elite Event, we caught a flick at South Side Works Cinema, and after that, barely got to the Hollywood Theatre on time to experience the bawdy, midnight madness of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. A rowdy, toilet-papering good time was had by us in what is a South Hills treasure, \"virgins\" that we were. It's also a pretty darn nifty theater that shows all manner of lesser-known features you'll only be enriched by having seen.
