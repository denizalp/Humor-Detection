I had such a great experience at Bridal Boutique of Arizona. Brooke was so sweet and very helpful. Of all of the boutiques we went to, she definitely took the most time making sure each dress fit properly before showing my bridal party. She was incredibly accommodating and my bridal party loved her! Once I found my dress, she pinned my hair back, added a hair piece, and helped me look at veils. I told her I had a dress I wanted to try on at one other boutique before committing to the dress and she was completely fine with that and very supportive. I ended up calling back right away! We saw her the next day at the bridal expo and she greeted us with hugs and a huge smile. She brought my contract since she knew I would be there and it would be convenient for me to sign it there. Thanks so much to Brooke and the rest of the staff at Bridal Boutique of Arizona. Such a sweet and supportive staff!
