All I can say is wow, wow, wow! I'm not one for martinis but the one I got here was literally to die for! Came with a raspberry inside. Martini's is centrally located right in the middle of the airport air side mall.\n\nIt's a great place to relax and settle down if you have extra time on your hands either for your flight or on a layover. Believe me the glass is a lot bigger than those little bottles you pay for when you are in flight and tastes better too.\n\nThey serve food here too but since I was here for an event I had already eaten as much as I could. Therefore I declined. Will have to check out food as well for my next visit. Staff very friendly and courteous.
