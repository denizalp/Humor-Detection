We were there for celebrating an occasion. The food was delicious and more than enough for each person. I mean u can't eat all of it coz it was a lot. But it was salty! Anyway... In Lachine area right by the water it's a perfect place to enjoy the Mexican restaurant. The ambiance was good and Mexican music it makes you more happy. The service was OK!! It seems that they were hire new waitress that they have to learn more and more!  In conclusion it's fine to go over there for once or twice a year. We will be back next year too ;)
