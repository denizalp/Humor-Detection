I visited Montreal a while back, and found myself in Simons. I quickly found some cute tops, a hat and a belt that I fell in love with, and quickly ran to the register.\nKeep in mind, I am from NJ\/NY.\nAs I stood there, in front of the cashier, I imagined myself wearing my new duds and sashaying through the street, compliments flowing from every direction.\n(this is slightly exaggerated, this next part)\n\"That will be 2 million dollars\"\nJaw drops.\nI could have sworn I picked up a 20 dollar hat, and a few 20-30 dollar tops. Not more than 3 of them, actually.\n\"Well how much is the tax?\" I ask.\n\"14.74 %.\"\nWHOA. \nLOL. So it's not what I'm normally used to, but in any event, I enjoyed my time there, and yes, I did get my tax back at the duty free shop.
