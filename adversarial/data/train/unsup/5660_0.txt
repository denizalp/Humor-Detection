I live 10 minutes from Austin's, and as my wife and I eat out several times a week we'd LOVE for this place to be worth a crap. Not happening. At least we'll never know it because we're never going back. \n\nWe have tried it three times and every time the food was either1) tasteless 2) poorly cooked 3) tasteless.  What, I said that already? That's because once wasn't enough.  \n\nHere's how bad Austin's is: I'd rather go to Boneyard in Broadview Heights, and I HATE that place. \n\nReally, just go out of business already and do us all a favor.
