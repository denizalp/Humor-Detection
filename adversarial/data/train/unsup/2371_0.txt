Well that was an hour of my life I'll never get back...  I feel sorry for anyone who's had to pay to get in here--I got in for free and still feel taken.  \n\nLong wait to get in, even with wristbands.  Once we did get in, we realize the club's half empty (this is Saturday night), so all the people waiting outside were just being kept there for show.\n\nThe floor is black concrete, and there are sudden slanted ramps and at least one stairstep, all painted black with no warning that you're about to go down an incline...this is not fun or safe when you're teetering on high heels.\n\nMusic sucked.  Like, really really sucked.  One minute it was 70's and the next song, rock&roll, and the next one, hip hop.  Several times everyone would just stop on the dance floor looking confused.  \n\nWe left after about 40 minutes, and they wouldn't let us go out the way we came because they didn't want people trying to get in to see us leaving.  They had us go out the back way.  Clever.\n\nDecor:  Looks like they blew all their money on the entrance foyer.  The rest of the actual club is stripped bare and painted black.   Not nice black, but \"I ran over budget on the giant chandelier so I will just paint the whole place black and hope nobody notices\" black.
