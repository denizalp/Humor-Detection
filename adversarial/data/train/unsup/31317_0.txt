Went with my boyfriend on a Thursday. We drove straight in from California. We waited about 20 minutes for him to get a haircut. Not too bad. The guys were very nice and friendly. Offered us a monster while we waited. My boyfriend enjoyed every minute of the haircut. His cut is very simple because he likes to get a 1 all the way around but it was one of the best fades he gotten. Job well done. I'm sure next time we are back in town he will get another cut and maybe even a shave.
