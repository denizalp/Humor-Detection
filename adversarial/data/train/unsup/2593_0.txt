First timer at Tina's. I mainly went here because it was near my house. When I got there I immediately felt like I was in Daly City. If you from the bay yadadamean! They had TFC going and the Filipino decor. \n\nThe lady who served us was friendly and always made sure our cup was filled with water. \n\nMy daughter and I shared the bento lunch box special. I ordered pinakbet and BBQ pork. Both were good. \n\nFor dessert, I got a rice inside a fried lumpish wrapper. It was actually sweet rice. I've never tried it before and was glad I did. I'm coming here for my cheat days!\n\n***Yelp Challenge 2016 22\/100***
