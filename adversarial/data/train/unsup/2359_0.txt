If this was not a Symon joint then all the reviews would be worse.  You are paying for the \"Iron Chief\" not the food.  The guy is turning into a one trick pony.  He hasn't changed the Lola menu in 3 years.\n\nI will start off by saying I had a horrible experience at the B-Spot.  The waitress treated us like we were stupid.  After ordering my burger well done it came out red in the middle.  I asked them to cook it a bit longer.  When the burger came back out it was just as red.  After this I had them send it back again to go back on the grill.  This time the cook came out and watched me cut into it making sure it was done.  He was rude and it was a total slap in the face.  By this time the rest of my table was finished.  When the bill came they still charged me for the burger!!  I couldn't belive it.  Honestly, the burgers arent even that good.  Symon, we get it, you can put an egg on a burger.  Burger, Beer, Fries, and a 50 dollar bill for 2 people.  Not a quick and cheap burger joint like they try to make it into.  B-Spot=Fail.
