For me, when in Las Vegas, Fat Tuesday is a must. Think of it as a rite of passage and that you didn't do Vegas right if you didn't cruise the strip with a yard dog in hand. The go to... A $15 yard dog filled with half 190 octane and CAT 5 hurricane or what I recently learned they officially called it a \"44 magnum\". Oh yes... Don't forget that extra shot or two of everclear, only a $1 per shot!\n\nYou'll want to hold on to those containers if you're going to be around for a weekend as refills are cheaper! Note that yard dogs of the 44 magnum are pretty strong. Just 1 will get me pretty good. Yung Fran once tried to go 2 yard dogs back to back and barely made it back to the room. Use caution & sip slow & go $100 on black at the roulette table when the confidence kicks in. ;)\n\n'Til next time, cheers!\n\n24\/365
