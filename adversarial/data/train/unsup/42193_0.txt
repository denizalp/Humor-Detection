This place is the epitome of bad customer service. Always short of help and never kind or courteous. Store rules, such as \"no exchanges or returns until after 8am and not allowing 19 or 20 year old employees ring up wine and beer, in spite of the state law saying they can. \nThis is a 24 hour inconvenience store.\nOnly come here in an emergency. Expect the worst.
