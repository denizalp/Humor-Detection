After getting an estimate from another company I called to get one from Sunset Gates. They immediately emailed me information on gates I said I was interested in with the price right by each picture. Then they scheduled a free estimate at my home.\n\n  Shawn took plenty of time to explain each step and the price with different options. When they came to install it I was really impressed with the workmanship of the project. I just love my Sunset Gate.\n\n Oh, and Sunset Gate's estimate came in at 1\/2 the price of the other company.\n I highly recommend Sunset Gates.
