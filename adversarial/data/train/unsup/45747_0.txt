I loved it!  We were immediately served boiled peanuts, and then lots of wonderful Korean side dishes after we placed our orders. Everything I had was well prepared:  grilled chicken, kalbi, and meat jun (okay, maybe the meat jun was a little heavy on the egg, but it was delicious)... just like a great plate lunch on O`ahu.  My buddy's sweet-and-sour chicken wasn't what we were expecting, but it was great, too. The service was friendly and nice.  I was slightly apprehensive about the location, but the apprehension was unfounded. Yelp did not let me down.  I know where to get my Hawai`ian food fix when I'm in Las Vegas.  I even had them make me a Spam musubi to go... yum!
