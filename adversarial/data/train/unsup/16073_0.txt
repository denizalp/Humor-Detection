Thanks to Christie O., I found a very specific type of shoe here so I wouldn't have to order them online and also have the opportunity to try them on first.  I shouldn't be surprised that there's a store like this in Sin City.  Let's just say the selection is eclectic and fits right in with our town.  Even the sign out front says that the shoes are exotic. Hint:  there's a pole next to the register, and, no, I'm not exotic or a dancer, but you don't need to be to shop here. This store is larger than I thought it would be and there are tons of shoes, sandals, and boots, some with heels higher than I've ever seen; I'm in awe of women who can wear those without breaking their necks.  I had called the store earlier in the day to confirm that they indeed carried the shoe that I needed in my size and when I arrived later to try them on, the gentleman was very helpful and courteous.  Check Red Shoes out for a selection of shoes you won't find at the mall or your everyday shoe store.
