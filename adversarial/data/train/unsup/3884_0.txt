I was having lunch at a neighboring restaurant and was in need to do grocery shopping for my meal prep. The Market is a pretty small store with more common produce items, cereals, frozen vegetarian treats, teas, coffee, non-dairy milk, chocolates, snacks, dried spices and mixes, O Face doughnuts, cookies, pies, etc. It's not a full-on grocery store so, there are items you won't find here. I was looking for fresh cilantro which they didn't have but they were nice enough to get me a small bunch from their kitchen. Talk about going above and beyond customer service!\n\nThat's what impressed me the most about this place. The people that work here are from the area and I think it's important for the local community to benefit from current development downtown. They're helpful and friendly. We got to chat with the chef that makes all the prepped food who told us how he makes his dishes and when they serve certain dishes. Soul Food Sunday, anyone?\n\nGet a reusable bag for $5. They have items with clever marketing strategies: Bruce Tea if you're a Bruce Lee fan...Grumpuccino if you like Grumpy Cat. I'm a sucker for both so I ended up getting one of each flavor teas and coffee they have.\n\nThis may sound bizarre but they have the best shopping carts ever. They're tiny so, going up and down aisles and making sharp turns are easy. They're like the BMW of shopping carts: FWD + power steering.\n\nWould I make a special trip just to shop here? No. But this would be the closest store similar to Trader Joe's or Whole Foods to home.
