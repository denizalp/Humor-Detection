Mexican food has gotta give you a kick in the butt...and I mean that in the nicest way possible.  You have to have that special pizazz in your pico, zest in your mex, taste in your taco....you get the point!  \n\nComing here there's no kick, no punch, not even a wimpy slap in the face.  I agree with Beth M, it's just bland.  I ordered a chicken burrito and the chicken was that stringy kind you get in a can.  They had to have stuffed the whole can in because all I could really taste was bland chicken with a little bit of lettuce, tomato, etc.  The rice and re-fried beans were exactly the same.  No real taste.  I was pretty disappointed in everything BUT....\n\nFREE CHIPS AND SALSA!  \n\nI get pretty bitter when chips and salsa aren't offered for free, so this was the only plus.  I scarfed down enough to make myself not as bitter about the food.  So maybe stop in for the chips and salsa....you'll potentially look cheap...but hey, the food should be better!
