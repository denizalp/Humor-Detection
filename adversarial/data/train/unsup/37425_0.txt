The food is what you'd expect at Steak n Shake.  The service is what you'd expect at a State Fair food tent.  The hostess didn't even speak to us except to say \"follow me\"\nWe waiting nearly 10 minutes for a waitress who greeted us with \"ok what can I get you?\"\nWe waited almost 15 minutes for a glass of water - and she forgot the second glass of water.\nOur food came without utensils\nWhen my wife spoke to the manager he merely looked at her and said, \"ok.\"\nWe will not be back to this location.  Ever.
