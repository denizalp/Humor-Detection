6\/25\/15: Wow... now here's a hot pot that is sure to separate the hot pot PROS from the WANNABE's!!!  It's AYCE, and who doesn't love AYCE?  They even got that island with the sauces and various side dishes.  ......... and it's HORRIBLE!!!  I mean holy crap it's bad.  Absolutely frightening how bad those side dishes are!  And that is totally a good thing... as the weak will be shed, and some will even run away... and for those that do stay, but not bring a linguistic guardian capable of dealing with the stubborn Chinese tongues, heed thy warning...\n\n...but for those that remain... The careful well-honed sense of true hot pot aficionados, developed over hundreds of meals gathered around boiling pots with family and drunken friends, that sense will guide those so gifted to the ultimate prize:  Their Menu.\n\nAnd spy thy treasure....... glorious creatures of the sea, authentic Chinese specialties rarely found this side of the world, and in particular one creature so rare, so delectable... giving its precious lives to you.  For that one morsel so cute and so adorable, for it is worth a trip of great distances!  Yes, hot pot lover, pick those crazy rare items and as your table becomes a sauna, rejoice!  Rejoice!\n\nEverything is delicious, but let me entice you with these....\n\n1. Handmade Pork\/Beef\/Fish\/Shrimp\/Lamb Ball:  Yes they are indeed hand made, probably by underpaid and sweaty workers hating life in the back, but expertly.  Definitely exceeds any Ranch 99 (or whatever the equivalent is in Canada) purchased factory-made balls you might have had.  Truly special.\n\n2. Thick Rice Noodles:  I have NEVER had this before, ever.  My gf's eyes lit up though when she saw this on the menu.  They're 1\" wide noodles, and pretty thick too.  Transparent when cooked.  The texture is very chewy (for noodles), what Chinese call \"qq.\"  For those that have had the authentic liang pi, it's kinda like that but wider.  Awesome, and must get!\n\n...and the Golden Chalice...\n\n3. Cuttlefish:  Best hot pot seafood item ever.  I have never seen this at any other hot pot in America before, or anywhere else for that matter, China included.  Ain't cheap stuff.  Eat your top-of-food-chain heart out.  So cute, so amazing.\n\nAre you a pro?  Test yourself.\n\n5\/5\n\n#canada #chinese #hotpot
