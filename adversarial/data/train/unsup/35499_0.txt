Whenever I visit LeeLee's market, I always visit this place.  It isn't really cheap if you consider how much you get and how much you have to pay.  It's about the price of Baskin Robins\/Cold Stone.\nHowever, the selection of flavors is absolutely awesome and there are certain flavors that are rotated through and the atmosphere is very quiet, cool and perfect for small gatherings with friends.\nFlavors I've tried:\n-manga\n-chocolate\n-taro\n-rose (I'm not a big fan)\n-double chocolate\n-pistachio\n-orange\n-mandarin\n-lemon\n-lime
