We enjoyed the quaintness sitting outside on the little shaded porch.  If you are in a hurry you might want to skip this place but we wanted a relaxing meal so it was perfect for us.   There was no wait when we arrived close to 1 on a Sunday.  Another couple that arrived just after us had their order taken first and their food and drinks came out very timely.  They were gone before we got our food.  My husband ordered well done bacon so we pretended this was the reason our food was so slow.  We enjoyed our drinks--my husband regular coffee with half-price refills while I had a chai tea latte--and the atmosphere while waiting.  We loved our waiter who was just helping out for the day and actually is a chef!\n\nWas it the best service?   No because food was slow.  Would we return?  Absolutely!  It was just so pleasant and the food was good.  And while French may be the first language of several of the wait staff, speaking English was no problem.  We were dressed very casually while some were a bit spiffier.
