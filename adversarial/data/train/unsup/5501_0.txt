This place just emits first class all the way...from the beautiful courtyards, to the amazing lobby and the Indigo Bistro. Came here for a preschool conference\/seminar and it was held in one of their corporate conference rooms. It was very elaborate and roomy. Perfect for the conference. We had lunch at the classy Indigo Bistro. Our food was prepared just right and very delicious. I had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with lettuce and tomato. It was one of 3 items specially prepared for participants at the preschool conference. \n\nI recommend coming to this hotel for a stay or even to hold an event at.
