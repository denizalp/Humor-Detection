I LOVE THIS PLACE. This is the first place I tried Indian cuisine and was over the moon about it! I can't believe I went 26 years without these divine flavors in my life. \n\nMy office is just around the corner from here so my coworkers and I often come here for the $11.99 lunch buffet. They put the menu up on their Facebook page so you know what they're serving that day before you show up. \n\nThe view of the airport and strip is gorgeous and they sometimes have live music that's pretty decent! \n\nTheir butter chicken is amazing and garlic naan is to die for! Service is absolutely exceptional every time. Definitely check this place out!
