I stopped in with a small group of friends to order a variety of small items, including drinks, for our pre-dinner activity. I was craving wings, so I ordered their Grilled Ginger Soy wings, in addition to the fried calamari, bacon wrapped meatballs, zucchini sticks, and steak salad my friends ordered. \n\nWhen you order a variety of items, there is bound to be some hit and misses, as I experience here. For example, the ginger soy wings tasted quite good, but I could not get over the fact how tiny them wings were. I had to struggle to find chewable meat on them bones. I am not kidding, I worked those bones substance, but good thing the flavor was there. \n\nThe fried calamari was good. It was lightly fried and breaded. The calamari inside was tender and sweet as it should be. Well done. The bacon wrapped meatballs were okay. I liked the marinara they came in because it had a good balance between acidity and sweetness, but the meatball itself was to, how would I put it, mushy I guess. It needed texture and density. The flavor was good, and so was the bacon it came wrapped in but, it was almost as if it had to much moisture in it. \n\nThe fried zucchini stick were pretty good, although they did exhibit a water inside of them, which leads me to believe they \"may\" have been previously frozen. They tasted good and had a nice crunch, but I could literally squeeze them and watch the water drain from them. \n\nService was very good and quite attentive. This place no doubt has potential, and perhaps it's already there, but I would refine some of the items I had on this visit. More importantly, some plumper wings would be much appreciated.
