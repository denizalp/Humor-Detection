I hate to give such an iconic restaurant as The Salt Cellar 3 stars but I think I have too.. I'm basing this on the main entrees and pricing. The appetizers were delicious and the service was exceptional. That could have been due to the fact that the place was pretty dead for a Friday night.. But nevertheless our server, I think her name was Destiny(?) She was very very good and recommended we try the Sauteed shrimp San Remo, SO GOOD!. We also got a bucket of steamed clams and some calamari. \nMy main issue was with the average tasting, overly priced entrees. My food was tasty, I got the Scallops with King crab & Atlantic Baby Shrimp sauce. Our server gave an excellent description of what to expect when the food came and I'm glad she did because what I got was not what I expected, but like I said, it was OK. My boyfriend and his sister were not particularly please with their entree choices either. \nI think the moral of the story is, unless you have a TON of money to drop on lobster (I'm guessing that's what they're known for) just go to enjoy the ambiance, have some wine and appetizers. You will still have a pretty heavy ticket at the end of the night but it will be a much better experience.
