Let me ask you a question. Are you a fan of a certain vintage-esque store that ends with 'ology? Well how about the same style but in local format? This is what you find at GROWop which is quite possibly one of the neatest little boutiques out there! \n\nGROWop lives in a historic home surrounded by a delightful (and also important) garden. The garden elves grow herbs that are sold at the Farmer's Market and also to popular restaurants such as Cibo. It's adorable and looks like a scene from the Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland (especially with The Valley of Sunflowers caddy-corner). Once you've passed through the garden, you step into the boutique filled with unique finds, many of which are made by local designers. The delicious scent of burning candles linger through the two room house and on the porch. Every section of the boutique is filled with treasures and mixed with some vintage, some locally made and some handmade finds. They have everything from one-of-a-kind dresses and candles to locally made jewelery and vintage clothing.  The items here range in price but nothing is over the top and it's nice to know that the money spent is staying in the Phoenix economy! \n\nThis is absolutely a must when searching for a unique item or gift and you can even walk to the next street for a cup of coffee for a shopping break when you're done!
