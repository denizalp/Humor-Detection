I really enjoy the novelty of the cart service at Thazard, although perhaps it's just novel to me. Either way, when the cart came by our table I couldn't resist ordering a few treats from it and ended up with kimchi, pickled vegetables, and a veggie sushi roll before ordering any actual dinner.  Luckily my fellow diners were more than happy to share and since the portions weren't giant I still had room to order the Warm Salad (made with rapini, root vegetables, bonito, tofu, eggplant and miso pur√©e) and Miso Poutine (with miso butter, cheddar, and kimchi). \n\nThe warm salad had a lot of potential to be so delicious, but unfortunately I kept running into partially cooked root vegetables. However, the bites that were cooked well were done really well and so I would give the salad another try. For the poutine I ordered it for two reasons: 1. I have to order poutine at least once per trip to Canada (it's part of my contract I made with myself) and 2. it was very different than any other poutine I'd encountered. It had kimchi on it for crying out loud! It was interesting, but I would probably try something else if I visited again just because the menu features a lot of food that sounds worth trying.\n\nThe space is really cozy and warm - I especially like the lighting. And the service is quite friendly. So, it was a lovely dinner experience all in all and I'd be happy to head back another time.
