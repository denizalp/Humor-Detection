First of all I didn't even know that this little shopping area existed before a quick yelp search revealed this frozen yogurt location.  We took advantage of the free parking structure and walked over quickly.  \n\nWe found a small yogurt shop with about 8 flavor selections. I got a pink lemonade tart that was right up my alley. My daughter and wife both found some chocolate derivative to make them happy. The selection of toppings was decent and included some things I hadn't seen before.  If you are in the area looking for a place to stop on quickly and eat some frozen yogurt I wouldn't bat an eye recommending this place and if I still lived in the area would probably go again myself.
