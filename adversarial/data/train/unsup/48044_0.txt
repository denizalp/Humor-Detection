I went here on a wendsday and they had a fight break out at the front door. I was told they had pool tables and it was a chill bar. The security was rude and very unprofessional. I asked if i could play pool they said i would have to pay $20 to come in. I asked to speak to the manager and he was very rude. His name is Brandon he basically ignored my complaint and went on to smoke his cigarette in my face. Never will i go there again. DO NOT GO HERE
