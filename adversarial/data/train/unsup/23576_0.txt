I love wrestling so you know I had to see the Khabib vs Mcgregor fight at (what better place) than Wasted Grain.  \n\nWhat an awesome experience: \n\nLive DJ with good music\nBartenders in booty shorts(girls) and tight shirts (boys) \nGood looking people\nAffordable drinks \nTelevisions everywhere\nSome people had issues with customer service but to was fight night... It was wall to wall people. \n\nAttached is the Bubble room which is an upstairs dance club with techno music and bottle girls wearing lingerie...  It's definitely great eye candy for the guys...the girls not so much! \n\nLet's just say the next big game, fight or event I'll be wasted at Wasted Grain!
