As I sat alone at home recently on a dreary February day staring bleakly at the Television screen a Lobster Fest commercial started to play.  My mood immediately elevated as I thought about summer and to me summer = seafood.  And with the recent Beyonce reference in Formation I knew this had to be kismet.  I had to redeem myself for missing \"Endless Shrimp\" earlier, and the only thing to do this would be to take my Wife here for Lobster Fest.  Mission accomplished.  Yes we spent Valentines dinner here, and yes it was pretty amazing.\n\nThe service was efficient and hassle-free and the dueling lobster tails hit the mark.  How can one not enjoy a lobster tail topped with lobster mac n cheese, this just seems impossible to me.  We finished off our dueling lobster tails with the warm chocolate chip lava cookie.  This was the perfect choice for two, as it would have been a bit overwhelming for one of us to handle.  This is as it sounds,  a giant warm chocolate chip cookie filled with chocolate and topped with ice cream.  Red Lobster you have done it again.  I apologize for waiting 5 long years to visit you.  Our next visit will be so much sooner I promise.
