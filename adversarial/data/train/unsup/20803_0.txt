This review is more about the process of obtaining a marriage license than of the building itself, but since marriage licenses are issued by Maricopa County, this was the closest location for us to go to.\n\nWe arrived at 4:40pm... I had no idea what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised.  Once through security, I found the office and the paperwork needed... \n\nKyle walked us through the process telling us that he loves his job because he gets to deal with happy people all of the time.  He apologized for the delay as their systems were slow, computer delayed printing, and credit card machine not functioning either.\n\nAside from those things, the process was simple... We left the building a few minutes after 5pm with an official marriage license.  It will become active once it's signed by the rabbi on our wedding day and mailed back to the Clerk of the Court.  In addition, we were given a wedding present from the state of Arizona - a  \"marriage handbook\" that we have yet to explore!
