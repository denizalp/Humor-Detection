It is undoubtedly a Calgary institution, but Peter's can be extremely unpredictable in their quality. I've had some great burgers, and I've also had burnt turds on a bun; juicy, crispy onion rings and just plain juicy with grease; and let's not get too into their milkshakes! If you've ever tried to suck a golf ball through a garden hose, you have had a Peter's milkshake. This isn't even to mention the ridiculous number of flavors to choose from, calculated to boggle the mind and never to find a perfect combo. A trip here on a pleasant summer day can turn into an all-day nightmare as you go from one snaking line to another in the midst of suffering heatstroke, or else suffocate in your car from the fumes of twenty cars ahead of you. Try it once to say you have, then decide if its worth the inflated prices.
