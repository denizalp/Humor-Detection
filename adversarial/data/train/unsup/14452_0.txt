Oh, the bar that tries way too hard.  On the first floor of the Constellation Apartments, I am sure the owners thought they would be pulling in the residents that live above but during the times I have been there, this wasn't the case.  The decor is a mismatch of reclaimed lumber, industrial lights, ikea shelves and random pez dispensers.  Trying to be hip?  Trying to be ironic?  Trying to be urban?  No clue.  The last visit, there were several wines that were not available yet were printed on the menu.  The same goes with one beer tap.  When asked, the bartender simply replied, \"They don't tell me these things\". \nI guess if you lived above and there was a monsoon, tornado, or other severe weather event, it would be ok to come here.  Otherwise, go to any number of places in Madison that are truly authentic and deliver a great experience.
