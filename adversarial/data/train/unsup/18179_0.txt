I'll start out by saying that I'm a huge fan of Fox Restaurant Concepts...  So when I heard the buzz that Sam was getting into the juice biz, I was excited to have another healthy option added to his mix of awesomeness in the Valley.\n\nBefore actually experiencing any of the Juby True juices first hand, I attended a TedX event and had the pleasure of seeing Kelly Watkins' \"Chew Your Juice\" presentation amongst many others... it was fun to hear her thoughts and advice for juicers.\n\nSince then, I've tried JT juices at The Henry, True Food, and most recently, at this new Juby True location.  To date, I've sampled the following:\n-Fennel Destination\n-Little Miss Sunshine\n-C-Horse\n-Golden Child\n\nI've been pleased with them all, but Golden Child was my least favorite.  I am excited to try others in the future, although I admit, I can be a creature of habit, so I may be sticking to my top three faves for awhile!\n\nI happened to meet Kelly when I swung by this store the other day and she couldn't have been more friendly.  I hope to visit again soon and learn more about the other products they offer (smoothies, hydrators, juice boosts, almond mylk blends, organic salads, snacks, sweets, coffee and tea).  I'm not sure I'll ever do an actual cleanse, but if I do, I'd absolutely start with the JT 1,2, or 3 day options.\n\nCheers to the emerging juice \/ good-for-you options the Valley is seeing lately!
