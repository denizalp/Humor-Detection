Okay so I've said before that I'm a big fan of owner operated businesses, and small local businesses. This place is one of them. You walk in the door and to your left are six refrigerator doors chocked full of about 250 different specialty sodas. All priced at a $1.89 and to your right there are the two owners and two helpers. One of the owners is at the cash register and handling the customer service and the other is that the sandwich table whipping up delicious hamburgers subs and the like. Very friendly and helpful!!!!! \n\nWhile I was there I asked a couple questions of the owners. One was do they weigh the meat before they load it into the sandwich? The guy at the sandwich making table shook his head no and said we want to make it good. Indicating they just cut a lot in there until it looks right. Needless to say my sandwich was well portioned. Rand H. and I both got a Large Ruben on Sourdough and split an order of fries. I really like this place for a lot of reasons, some of which I noted in my review. While we were eating I saw a few more orders roll by and they were all generous servings that looked delish.
