Happy Dog was awesome (if you can get past the hipsters)! They had a great craft beer selection with several local and draft beer selections. The wait staff\/bartenders were friendly and attentive. They knew about their beers as well. The food was yummy! Loved all the topping choices and dips. Knocking 1 star off because there were only two dog choices and only a plain, standard bun. I would definitely come back and am glad we stopped here on our way through town.
