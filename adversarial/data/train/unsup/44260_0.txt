I honestly have to work near this Dunkin, and their coffee is cheaper than Starbucks and the sandwiches are great in the morning, so I sometimes go to this Dunkin'. BUT the employees ruin everything. They hired a new person to work and they were training another person shortly after they were hired, neither of those two people do anything right. EVERY time I go to this location, my order or someone else's order is wrong, forgotten about or skipped over. ALSO their customer service is absolutely horrendous and they can't even put napkins in ANY of the bags??? \n\nIf they actually want to do better, they just need to fire the whole staff from this location and rehire a whole new crew. Then maybe customers will get the correct order and some freakin' RESPECT! If I didn't work near this Dunkin' I wouldn't never come here again.
