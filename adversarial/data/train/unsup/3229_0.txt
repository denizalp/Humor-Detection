Oh wow.. I should've read the reviews before getting the groupon.. the most horrific experience I've dealt with a hair salon. I'm disgusted that the joke of an owner even touched my hair. \n\nSame as the previous reviews, told me it would be an upcharge for the length of my hair. I'm sorry you expected someone to come in with a pixie cut lol \nHer outdated hair was about 4inches below the shoulders and I said my hair would be cut to that length, so why the upcharge. After she looks at herself in the mirror and flips her hair, she retorts, \"that's just what it is.\" So, of course, I walked out with a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nHere's some advice: close your shop and find a different career or get an education on how to run a business. A first-time client should be treated as royalty so they'd keep coming back and tell allllll their friends about it. \n\nBut, no, seriously, close that shop because y'all hopeless.
