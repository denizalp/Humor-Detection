The Good: \n1) Decent Location but kind of not\n2) The Spanish speaking tellers\n3) The three (3) tellers that will work hard to learn. Monica was EXCELLENT as she vocalized, \"Ma'am, I don't know but I want to learn.\" And was sincere about this. Got to respect it. \n4) Same layout as other UWCU's\n\nNow the Bad: \nMy word... my word! I've never been subjected to such crap as this location has exposed me to. I mean I literally drive by this place on the way to the gym and remind myself DON\"T DO IT! Just wait...fight with the traffic on the Square that's walking the Farmer's Market like cattle being herded and make do than go into this place. WHY you ask?\n\nChild, no one knows nothing. And yes I know that's bad grammar but you know what sometimes only cetain words can be used to convey the real meaning. I hope I'm flourishing enough with this write up that you feel it through your spine or laugh long enough that you get a side cramp. Take your pick. \nService: you think it's easy?! Think again. Hell, I broke out into Spanish to make things smoother for everyone on one occassion. \n1st trip(that stood out) - get to the counter. Ask for proof that the cashier's check cleared. Uhh. no one knew. But the teller tried. \nShe asks for help. No other knew. No worries, I can explain what you offered is not what I'm looking for but we can call the Capitol Square. No one calls. 4 people are now trying to figure this out. Then someone tells me, not the teller, that it can't be done. lol \nI'm laughing now but not then. Something I've been doing repeatedly for a few months now can't be done. Here's the switch......\nI break into Spanish. Monica is caught off guard but we go back and forth. I explain to her about the Cap Sq or Monroe can help. \nOther guy stands in marvel (Idk why? I just presume most folks get befuddled when a 'darkie' speaks anything other than English or heck Ebonics. Because I promise enough Anglo's get confused when I speak proper English and not Ebonics. Yeah...you've seen it. Those folks come in the store talking loud\/using slang - they get A1 service and fast but me....I've got to call on Jesus to give me strength just to be heard). But that's not this show today. \n\nBack to the teller. She actually says, in English, \"I want to learn. This may come up again with someone else.\" She learns. *BAM* 72 minutes later I got that document. It took a 4 minute call to the Cap Sq branch walking them through the process to get it done. Folks apologize and I'm like no problem because I appreciated the effort from the service provider. \n\nNext trip- usual deposit\/withdrawl transaction. But get this, I need change. TWO $5 BILLS. May I have change please? Two fives. \nClerk: ok\nMe: Waiting\nClerk: walks off. Types on the computer. Talks to another teller. Types again. \nMe: Wait, what's going on 5minutes has passed. (I don't say the 5min part)\nClerk: I have to wait for her. She points to clerk. Then talks to older lady\nMe: I can just go to the other line. (She's just standing idly by watching me)\nOld Lady: LOOKS DEAD AT ME AND ROLL HER EYES. \nMe Again: Whatever the problem is, I can just stratch it and go to this young lady\nClerk: types again and gets a paper then says...I am going to get it. \nShe's sweet, I don't say anything else. But I'm watching. \nMe: GUESS WHAT???? I'm thinking she could just pull cash from a drawer. NO! These folks have to enter into a computer what they're doing. Then this large PRINTER Looking machine delivers the cash. What?!?! (Please know I'm just thinking this and not saying it out loud. Just keeping titles so you can follow.)\nWho came up with that smart idea. That didn't save anything. It won't reduce theft. Arghh..I bet some genius in management decided this was perfect, yet they've never worked a teller line. \nClerk: I'm sorry ma'am for the wait. \nMe: Don't worry. \n\nOverall: At any point the clerk could have explained she has to get it from a machine and the machine processes the cash request in the order received like a printer and three other people are ahead of us. Then the machine ran out of money and had to reload. \nBut she didn't \nThe old lady gave dirty looks (far from professional)\nI learned a valuable lesson. Just stay the hellllllllll away. (see, nothing else would have worked or conveyed my seriousity as helllllll with so many l's).
