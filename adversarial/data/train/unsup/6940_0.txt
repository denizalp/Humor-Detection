Who hasn't heard about Secret Pizza at this point? Definitely lives up to the hype BUT I can't decide if inebriated me prefers pizza or the ever-so-comforting Earl's. However, if one is at Marquee, I don't see why not! \n\nJust look for the hallway! \n\nTIP: Just order a whole pizza in advance and pick it up. It's cheaper than buying individual slices &  you don't have to stand in line.
