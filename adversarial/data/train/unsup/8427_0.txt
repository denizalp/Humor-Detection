I've walked by this store front many a time and was a little thrown by the decor. The black table clothes with their bright white napkins led me to believe this was a high price special occasion sort of joint. I was very much mistaken. This place is great. While the decor could use a little warming up the food and drink is delicious. With a variety of happy menu items and customizable cocktails this is a great spot. \n\nI had the chicken Kung pao steam buns and they were delicious. The accompanying side slaw was stellar bonus! I tried some of my friend fried rice and my was it tasty and more than enough to share. Their cashew brittle made it quite the different dish and they did not skimp on the chicken. The steam buns were flavorful and had just enough kick for this gal!\n\nThe staff is super friendly and helpful and happy to lend a dinner or drink recommendation. \n\nDefiantly five this place a try!
