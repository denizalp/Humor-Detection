Perfect. What more can I say? Great selection, reliable delivery, great quality. I love that I can easily put future deliveries on hold if I'm going to be away, or if I simply don't want one that week.\n\nAs a single person, having organics delivered has been a great way to force myself to eat more fresh foods. It's more expensive than if I went and bought from a store...but that keeps me from wasting it. It's here, I paid good money for it, so I'm going to eat it!
