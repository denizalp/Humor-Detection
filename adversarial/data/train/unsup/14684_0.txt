They're pet friendly!  Big plus!  It's a $75 flat fee for pets, no matter how long you stay or how many you bring, just as long as they are small to medium sized dogs.\n\nThe rooms are about 900 sq ft, the size of an apt.  Huge soaking tub, separate shower, but the thing that really gets me is the full kitchen!  When we stay in Vegas for a few days, the kitchen really comes in handy.  Esp for reheating leftovers so you don't have to stumble too far out of bed to get some much needed breakfast.\n\nThis hotel is not too far from the Strip.  It's about a block away from Ballys.  I really prefer it to staying in a resort or casino hotel.  It's a lot more quiet, plus it's non smoking.  The big thing for me is no long lines for check in, valet, elevator, etc, and you don't have to walk a mile through the parking structure to get to the casino then walk more thru the casino to the elevators, then another 1\/4 mile down the hall bc my room is ALWAYS at the very end.  Factor in some 4 inch heels to that equation and my feet aren't very happy.  At the Platinum you just walk a bit down the the valet, and the valet gets your car in about 2 mins flat.  \n\nThe valets are really nice guys too.  If you stay there more than a few days, they remember you and greet you by name.  When you return they always ask if you will be leaving again soon, and if yes, they leave your car in the front so you only have to wait a mere 30 secs for your car.\n\nThis is the ONLY place we will stay when in Vegas.
