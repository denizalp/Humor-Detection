What's not to like about Main Street? \n\nTheir parking structure is five stars! It's the least creepy and possibly the cheapest one that I've found in downtown. Okay, yeah. I'd rather walk from here and get validation than park, let's say, at the Binion's structure even though that one has an elevator that takes you right into the hotel.\n\nBut you know what really makes Main Street Station great? The buffet of course! Check out the reviews for Garden Court buffet. Best value in downtown, a true Asian destination ;)
