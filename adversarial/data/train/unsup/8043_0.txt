When I'm looking for a little better quality stuff than what Wal-Mart can deliver, I head to Target.  This particular store is one of my favorites in Las Vegas because it's a Greatland Store....which means it's massive and has a lot of items to choose from, which is what I prefer when I go to a big-box store.\n\nThis store is also always very clean and the employees are friendly.  I was there earlier today to pick up various household items and was able to find it easily and get through the checkout line quickly.....two huge points in my book.\n\nWill I return?  Absolutely!
