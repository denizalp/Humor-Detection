One of my new favorite restaurants in my area.\n\nBeing vegetarian, I love the chinese vegetable quesadilla with their delicious hot sauce drizzled all over it. I normally get this with a refried bean burrito (combo), white rice and refried beans on the side. This is a ton of food. My girlfriend & I normally split this meal and are plenty full afterwards.\n\nThe finishing touch of a snickerdoodle cookie is fantastic. Love this place.
