This post is about the JUST SPORTS retail store located at Tempe Marketplace. One word to sum up customer service: RUDE. The employee was rude the second we walked in at 11:00 AM. We were trying to return something that had been ruined by our dog. We did not have our receipt, but the tags were still on and there was the same exact product on a rack by the counter. We were not asking for money back, just a simple exchange. The employee would not offer an explanation, just said, since this is \"our fault,\" there was nothing he could do. (Prior to this, we went to Target for the same issue, and we had no problems). When we asked for the manager, he said, \"she comes in at 1, but I doubt she will help you either.\" Needless to say, JUST SPORTS, you lost two valuable customers that USED TO do all of our sports shopping with you. We will be taking our business elsewhere.
