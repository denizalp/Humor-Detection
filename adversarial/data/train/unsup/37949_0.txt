I went to this place for the first time today. There a few options for your car wash, and they can do exterior and interior.... But from what I understood you have to get the exterior cleaned in order to get the interior cleaned. I opted for the exterior and interior, which was $32. I lived in Dallas before moving here and would pay $15 for this same thing (maybe even better quality) exterior and interior. So I thought it was a bit pricey, but this may be average for the area, not sure. My car looked nice when it was done, but they didn't wash the windows on the inside and didn't wipe the dash inside. Service was pretty good, I spoke to a man inside who may have been the manager, who was super nice. Most everyone else was friendly as well, except for one guy vacuuming who was a little rude (maybe he was just having an off day? Who knows). Overall, it was a alright experience and if I return I would opt for just the exterior wash.
