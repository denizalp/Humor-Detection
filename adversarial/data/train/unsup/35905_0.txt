Kingsley is a great guy and has owned this place since I can remember, one of my best friends was an employee when he was in high school.  The staff know their fish but can a little green when it comes to customer service, mostly because they are so young.  The quality of the fish has been great, don't think I have had any problems with dead fish.  The store can get quite busy and this is where it may be a problem for the younger staff.  I still go here all the time and find it to be one of my favorite places to buy fish. Another place is the Pet Shop but that's way out on the east end of the valley.
