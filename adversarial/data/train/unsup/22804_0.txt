Went here for a long overdue lunch date with a group of friends. The service was excellent. There was water on our tables within seconds of being seated. Really it was almost as if the water magically appeared. I totally didn't even notice the waiter bring the water! Shortly afterwards they came to take our order. No fuss when we needed more time. The waitress was very patient with us as we changed the order she had just taken :|\nWe ordered two lunch specials and one dish from the main menu between two people thinking the lunch portions would be small. However just one lunch portion was more than enough food for two people to share. The portions are HUGE! Can't go wrong for $5-7 when it includes a soup\/spring roll or pop! \nThe food itself was delicious. We ordered Hakka noddles with Manchurian veg balls. The Manchurian veg balls were so great! they were small and a little crispy on the outside. Just perfect with the right amount of spice. We also ordered the Cantonese noodles, but those were just OK. I probably wouldn't order again. Not enough veggies and the sauce wasn't as sweet as other places.\n\nNeedless to say, I could hardly breathe when I was done. I couldn't let all the deliciousness go to waste! All in all, this place is great. So great in fact, I went and got take-out two days later! :|\nHighly recommeded!
