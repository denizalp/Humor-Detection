I have been buying from TJ Maxx for years, but mostly in Scottsdale. The crew at this store could use some training on customer interaction. I can appreciate friendly service, so when they ask \"did you find everything you were looking for?\" That's when I start the interaction.  They don't ask because they really care, they just have to. When I asked the manager for something, it was too much trouble for her to do her job, and she just said to the new clerk, \"you can take care of this, I am going on break.\"  This manager has no business with customer service. (Is anybody paying attention to this?)
