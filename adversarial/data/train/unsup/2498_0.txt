We were excited to see this new location when it first opened and decided to check them out. I'm a sucker for HOT SAUCES and they definitely have a large selection.\n\nInside is a little crazy and the seating area is a bit tight. Just order at the counter and wait for your sandwich to arrive. TICK TOCK!\n\nNot sure how long it should take to make a sandwich. Actually I do know and twenty minutes seems longer than normal. How hard can it be?\n\nOrdered the New York Steamer with some Elvis Burning Love hot sauce on my first visit and then a Large Italian with a side of Mango Habanero sauce on my second.\n\nThe sandwiches were good and pretty expensive. Even my wife thought it was a bit pricy and she is the queen of sandwiches.\n\nService was mediocre and it took longer than we expected. Maybe it was just this location or I'm just not that crazy about their sandwiches. The best part was the selection of Hot Sauces for me.\n\nGive them a try and see what you think. I can make several sandwiches at home for the same price and everyone should know that Hot Sauce is my middle name. A-OK ALREADY!\n\n2.75 STARS
