Went for the crab leg special. Had no idea it was $17.99 a person!!!'\n\nWow things have really gone up here. The quality of food from the side items to the fried items all were horrible. I have never seen grapes with seeds in them and watermelon that tastes like rhine.\n\nThe bathrooms were not too bad, expect for the light switch that hasn't been wiped down in 5 years! I could only imagine that back kitchens sanitary practices are like???\n\n\nWe were served by an American gal, she was point on with drinks dirty plates and crab crackers . If no stars existed I would give this place that, but because our service was good one star remains.
