Got my order and it wasn't right. Asked for (2) Double Beef and Cheddar​ but received (2) Double Beef and no cheddar​ and brought it back to the counter and told the youngster there was no cheese, and he looked at the sandwiches (dumbfounded​) and told me he'd take care of it. So now I'm back at my table with my wife eating my curly​ fries (which are almost gone) and 15 mins. later I receive my sandwiches which this youngster, ​ not even bringing it to our table,​ lazy I guess, took a bite out of my sandwich which was the Double Beef and cheddar and to my amazement​ there was bacon in it ! I thought the beef was hard but it was the bacon.\nReally didn't go with my usual Beef and Cheddar when I go elsewhere. Curly fries were hard and cold. Thanks for the Coke float which really saved the day.
