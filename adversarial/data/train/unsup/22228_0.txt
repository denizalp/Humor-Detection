This doesn't compare to the Chinese bakeries I'm used to in the GTA or that I grew up visiting, not by a long shot - especially when considering price and quality. But, when you're craving egg tarts, Asian-style buns, or sesame balls stuffed with red bean paste in the Financial District, and you really have no other option in the immediate area for these types of treats, this is the next best thing.\n\nLocated in First Canadian Place, just east of the Exchange Tower, north of the TD Towers, and right across the Longo's and David's Tea in the heart of the PATH system, this place doesn't have much variety, nor does it have the friendliest service - but it's there to satisfy your cravings, and is available when you're hunting for various filling items to eat under $5.00. Prices range from $1.00 - $2.00 for various treats (the sesame balls are $1.40 each, FYI), and it looks like they have a limited menu of some prepared hot foods as well (though I've never had them, I always see a lineup for them). \n\nIn short - variety is limited but fairly reasonable (the store isn't very big), decent in taste and quality. It certainly and definitely isn't the best - but if you're downtown in the PATH, this is a quick and convenient spot to grab something filling and comforting (that doesn't break the bank).
