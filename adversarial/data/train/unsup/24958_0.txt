I ordered the greek salad with chicken falafel on top.  The dressing and salad was good, but the chicken was cold and dry.  It had the texture of dog food.  My roommate and all his buddies always get delivery late night from oliveo's, but after seeing my chicken falafel we are all on the edge about ever eating here again.
