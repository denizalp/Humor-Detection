This cafe is in my neighborhood of El Mirage. We Love it here....the food, Margaritas, especially the Coyote Margarita with jalapenos, the service and strolling Mariachi band, the decor and ambiance.  You are greeted like an old friend and valued as a customer.  The manager walks around and asks if you are happy.  If you want hot and spicy, ask for it otherwise, the food is generally on the mild side.  What is superb about this place is that locals, others and snowbirds flock here like an oasis in the desert. Also, patio dining is romantic if you choose outside.   It is always crowded, busy and great positive energy!  Don't miss this place.
