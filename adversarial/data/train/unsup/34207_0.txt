very cool shop. this shop has a great and wide selection of vinyl, cds and tapes, both new and used. they have really decent prices as well. got one of my favorite albums for $4!!! the guy working at the shop was very nice and gave us some good recommendations for places we had questions about. they also have a gender neutral bathroom which made the place feel very welcoming to all people. definitely check this place out.
