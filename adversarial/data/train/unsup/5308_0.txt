GET YOUR SCARE ON! It doesn't matter how old you are (well there is a rated R house here), you can still have fun with friends at Haunted Houses. \n\nEight work colleagues including myself, met up at the Freakling Bros haunted houses located at West Flamingo and the 215 freeway on a Wednesday and the lines were not long at all. We all decided to do all three houses which was a discounted rate of $39 instead of $47 individually.\n\nCoven was based on witches and I will leave it at that so you can experience the tingling, moist fun!\n\nVampyre was a castle that had some dull points but cool none the less. Choose wisely when you come to the roped area and make sure to lean on the rail when you choose!\n\nGates of Hell...lets start with you must sign a waiver before entering this Hell hole. Unique from the previous two houses as the actors will touch you whilst experiencing this dark, electrifying experience. Be prepared to overcome your claustrophobia!\n\nTip: don't let the nun spank you with the paddle...you'll see why during the speech!
