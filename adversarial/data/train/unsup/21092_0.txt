Stayed here with my family on a quick 2 day vacation.  We were looking forward to experiencing Old Vegas but did not have such a great experience.  We paid extra to guarantee a NON Smoking room.  Got to room after winding through dimly lit halls to find out Non Smoking room to be very smokey.  Called front desk to have room changed, no one ever came up.  Went down, they could care less.  Gave us new room, still smelled like smoke but less.  This ruined our vacation.  Once they have you there and your money, they could care less.  Never going back there again.  It used to be good when Wynn used to own it.  If you have kids, I would not stay there.  Pool was terrible.  Smelled like it was super chlorinated!  Valet takes forever.  Only 1-2 guys working.  Very unorganized.  No WI-FI, no coffee for free.  They will squeeze every penny from you.
