Rick Moonen's RM Seafood is located at Mandalay Bay. FYI - We had to go through the THEhotel entrance.\n\nThe food:\nThe cornbread and cheesy crackers you get as a side are really really good.\n\nCobia (with quinoa, lobster, tomato, seasonal mushrooms): Your normal \"simple fish dish\". Fish was cooked well, and I really liked the quinoa. No wow factor, but a solid dish.\n\nRM style \"Cioppino\" (calamarata, mussels, clams, king crab, shrimp): A seafood \"ratatouille\". Definitely better than the cobia. I actually think I ate more of his dish than mine. \n\nAll in all, I had a good experience, but I'm not sure if the food was worth the price. Not sure if I would go again.
