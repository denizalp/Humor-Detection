One word : FANTASTIC! \n\nI would rate a solid 4.5 - why the loss of a 1\/2 star nothing horrible I assure you.\n\nWe arrived late... And we were in a rush! Our own fault and the staff were over the top accommodating! So great!!! Our server Heather comes highly recommended to any future diners by myself and Michael. We ordered a bottle of wine (DELICIOUS) and some food based off her recommendations right away! And delivery was super quick! We chose the small CHARCUT BOARD, a salad, Brussels sprouts and poutine. \n\nThe salad was arugula and fennel with buffalo mozzarella and it was delicious I think it was one of the best salads I've ever had, so fresh and bright! The meats were tasty  and it was piled high so plenary to enjoy but I longed for something to put them on bread, cheese, anything but it was simply meat and mustard very tasty mustard but I assumed the board would come with at least toasts. The photos I have seen seemed to suggest toasts and cheese and even other spreads were accompaniments although perhaps all must be ordered separately.\nThe poutine?!?!  OMG to die for seriously there are no words get your coat and go try it right NOW! \nOur Brussels sprouts were SUPER SALTY! I love Brussels sprouts but we could hardly eat them, they were the last to arrive and we were rushing so we didn't get to let Heather know until we were paying the bill. We let her know just so the kitchen would be aware in an offhanded comment not angry. Well as we were putting our coats on  not 2 minutes later the manager came by , apologized and gave us two bags of fresh baked cookies so we could take them with us to the play!!  AMAZING! \nThanks CHARCUT for a wonderful experience! Your food is delicious but your staff are the real treat! Such a delight!
