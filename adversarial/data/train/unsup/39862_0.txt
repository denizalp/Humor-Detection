Please hire more cashiers at the galleria! I live so close and I can't tell you how many times I leave with out the items I wanted because the line is ridiculous, after spending an hour or more picking out my items to purchase. \nThe employees are so helpful & nice. There's just SO FEW of them. If you need help or don't have at least a couple hours to shop don't bother going in during the afternoons or weekends. \nI've been in line for 30 min already today and witnessed 4 people behind me leave.
