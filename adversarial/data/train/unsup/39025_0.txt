I just move to the area and was apprehensive about finding a doctor because I had been with mines for so long. I had been dealing with some issues and right off the ultrasound tech was very calming and comforting. She told n showed me what was going on. Then Dr. Watkins was kind and very understanding of what I was going through. Glad I made the choice to chose this place.
