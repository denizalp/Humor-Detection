First visit yesterday- I ordered a burrito.  Whole wheat wrap, no lard black beans, steak asada, shredded cheese mix, lettuce, jalape√±o slices, and sour cream.  $8 and change. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/blue-burrito-grille-scottsdale-2#ejrnr7b_7ryVNTisxMGpvQ  Tiny wrap, since I had omitted many fillings, but delicious! http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/blue-burrito-grille-scottsdale-2?select=NDnyxZS0u-DfeOVDZyMVKQ#NDnyxZS0u-DfeOVDZyMVKQ  I'd like to return, but $8+ is a little pricey.  I'll have to make sure not to be\/become hungry while at the mall...
