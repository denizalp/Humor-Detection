Hmmmmm the sandwich I had was pretty damn good. But it seems as though that I was the only one that could have eggs on my sandwich though. \n\nThe place was dead and yet they had no eggs. I felt bad for my friend Meg who couldn't get eggs on his sandwich. The coffee I got was huuuuuuge. \n\nI did also feel that for a sandwich, large coffee, and muffin that $13 is a bit much. \n\nI also didn't really care for the workers changing the music to something that they wanted to hear. I was getting into the classic rock that was on but then it was gone and Three Days Grace was bumping. \n\nSorry not sorry.
