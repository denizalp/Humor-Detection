i was hesitant to write a review about this establishment because they are locally owned and i did not want to give them a bad review, however today is the straw that broke the camels back. i have been a regular at warren's up until now..i have been here probably at least 30 times even though i have had poor service. the reason we kept going back is because how close it is to my home and the great music. \n\ntoday the waitress was rude and kept reminding us about the minimum table drink amount (which is 15 dollars per person)...that is required if you are not dining.   mind you..we have been here many times however they act like it's our first time here each and every time!\n\nso today we went to dance and they gave our table away even though we had not paid yet and we made no signals that we were ready to go. wtf?\n\navoid this place! i will not return here due to the horrible service.
