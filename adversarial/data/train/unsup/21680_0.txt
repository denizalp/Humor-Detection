Had a bearing assembly replaced that cost $1,000 yesterday at this location and now im stuck a few kms away from the place after the service was done because i didnt feel it was safe to drive the car and so far ive called 6 times to try and get some assisstance but no luck. I've fully explained my situation and yet nobody seemed too interested in my problem that Toyota Dixie has created. The service rep has the nerve to tell me that the problem might not be from the service that was done. i was so pissed off the sound coming from the bearing they replaced was clearly the problem.\n\nKeeps geting better and better. Its been 3 hours now stuck here with my car and in my last conversation with the lovely service representative i was told they are busy with other customers and will get back to me shortly.\n\nFinally after several hours the service rep calls me back and gives me a number to the tow truck. WTF! seriously you cant call them and have my car picked up? I have to do it myself. It's almost appalling the service coming from here after spending $1000 on a 2 hour service job. \n\n (side note: there was nothing wrong with the bearing just a faulty sensor in the bearing but they replaced the entire bearing)\n\nto be continued.....
