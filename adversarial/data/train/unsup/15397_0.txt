My new favorite Toronto vegan restaurant! Planta is creative, classy and healthy. Don't get me wrong. Sometimes you want simple and casual (Fresh). Sometimes you want comforting stick-to-your ribs (Hogtown Vegan, Doomies). Planta is my ideal because it's slightly upscale and feels like the kind of place to go on a more special occasion when you're not quite in the mood for a big healthy bowl of goodness and green juice (I really do love Fresh), but want to dine on more unusual creations and wash it down with a fine glass of wine (they have a full bar). \n\nThe menu features so many tantalizing options! This go-around, I ordered the cauliflower tots (utterly decadent!) and The Frenchie pizza (slightly rich, overall healthy, thanks to the piles of arugula!) To say that I savored and devoured my meal is an understatement but sometimes I'm left a little speechless. It's a good thing. Note that the pizzas are enormous. I took half home and enjoyed for dinner the following night. \n\nAs I mentioned, the environs is slightly elegant, slightly dark, slightly romantic. Just like me! I figured being alone meant for the perfect situation. Heh.\n\nMy waitress was \"in training,\" but so lovely and actually quite perfect. I never would have known she was in training if she hadn't told me. One thing to mention, though... when I walked in, the hostess was a little off-putting and if I were an insecure person, I would have felt like she reluctantly sat me at a table when she wanted me to sit at the bar (I hate eating dinner at a bar, even when I'm alone, sorry). So although the experience started off on a bit of a sour note, I left Planta singing its praises thanks to amazing food and service.
