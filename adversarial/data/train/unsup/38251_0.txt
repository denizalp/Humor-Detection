Below avg.  and highly disappointing. .  \n\nCame in during lunch. Wasn't busy by any means but yet still waited over 45 minutes for 4 simple orders of wings.  \n\nService was ok. Wasn't terrible considering she was training someone but could have been better, she didn't even acknowledge the fact that our order was taking longer than usual other than it'll be right out. When clearly that wasn't the case.  . \n\nOnce our order came. The wings lacked all flavor.  I ordered Medium and Honey Chipotle and medium just tasted like breaded chicken breast.  The honey chipotle, same bread in with a drizzle of syrup style sauce.  \n\nCan't say I would come back unless it was extremely convenient.
