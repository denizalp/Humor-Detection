It's 3 am in Vegas...do YOU know where your children are at??!\n\nOf course! They're scarfing down on some good ol' American grub at Ellis Island Cafe. Open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week AND they offer THE best steak and eggs special that Vegas has. For $5.99?! You better bet your bottom dollar that's right!\n\nI thought Mr. Lucky's was a done deal but boy was I wrong. Ellis Island Cafe is where it's at. It's a little off the strip on Koval and Flamingo and it's located inside the Ellis Island Casino. This place is perfect for a 3 am grub session after hitting those crazy clubs all night or even just for a plain and simple breakfast at 8 am. All-in-all you just can't beat those prices AND portions.\n\nI've been here a couple times and I ALWAYS get the $5.99 steak and eggs special. It's not included in the menu but it's usually written on their chalkboard sign by the front of the cafe. The special comes with 2 eggs (any way you want it), 6 oz. sirloin steak (cooked any way you want it), home fries and toast. The portions are perfect and I never had a problem with the chefs over or under-cooking the meat. Plus, those home fries are so deliciously crisp and well-seasoned. For $5.99 what's to complain about?\n\nSIDE NOTE: the special is only from 11 pm to 11 am. Other than that, everything is great! \n\nSo please stop by this place whenever you're in Vegas. If you're going to spend $80 on drinks at the Marquee or Tao, might as well treat yourself to the tastiest, cheapest breakfast they got.
