From the moment you walked in the door Tony makes you feel welcome and relaxed. Greeting you shaking your hand asking your name. The food was phenomenal. Had the fresh baked knots. Hot and good. The pizza was fantastic. We were seated in the bar area. The bartender seemed a little overwhelmed. Never checked back with us, asked the busboy to send him over so we could order a few more beers before our pizza came out.  But other than that everything was great. The pizza was fantastic. We had the 1\/2 and 1\/2 half white half marinara on a Sicilian crust.  Wow amazing.... top was soft and airy and the bottom was crunchy and fantastic..Will definitely go back.  Tony even said bye to us by name.   This place will put you in a great mood and the food is fantastic..
