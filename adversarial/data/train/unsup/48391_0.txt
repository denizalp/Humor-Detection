I have gone here for over 20 years.  Dr. Glick knows so much, has such a superior ethic, knows how to give painless injections and has handled many dental issues for me. I trust him implicitly. He also teaches dental students, and stays ahead of the work that is being done in the field. If you want a Dentist that knows what to do, and can handle any dental problem with ease and  a high degree of knowledge and confidence, this is your dentist. You may have to wait a few weeks to get in, but the wait is worth it. He also has a very nice manner, which greatly helps, when you are in pain.
