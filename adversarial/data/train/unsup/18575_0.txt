The hubby and I finally made it out to Z Pizza over the weekend. \n\nI ordered the Moroccan and my husband had the Greek pizza. Both pizzas were very tasty. The carmelized onions and pine nuts on the Moroccan were simply yummy!\n\nI think the prices are a little high, but the pizza is pretty good. \n\nThere weren't many customers in that night which made for a nice and quiet dinner. The feel of the place seemed pretty laid back to me and I felt comfortable. \nThe serivce was fast and friendly. \n\nThey have a small, but great drink selection, offering Sweet Leaf Teas, Blue Moon, Stella Artois and of course fountain drinks.\n\nI will definitley be back to try their other pizzas out.
