If I could give zero stars I would.  These people don't care about their patients at all (with the exception of one nice receptionist whoever you were, thank you for trying).  I've been to a lot of doctor offices and this place is by far the worst. \n\nI was in a pretty bad car accident and injured my spine.  I'm in a ton of pain and I ran out of my pain prescription.  I couldn't get a doctor to call me back for a refill or even talk to me about the pain I was having, so I agreed to suck it up for the weekend until I could get back in.  \n\nOn Monday at 7am they apparently called to cancel but DIDNT LEAVE A MESSAGE.  I drove 30 min from physical therapy to the location only to find it closed and locked up.  I call and am told it's okay for me to get in at the main location. \n\nSo I drive another 30 minutes and then I'm told ALL the doctors are going to lunch and it's going to be at least an hour.  Why have me go there to begin with??\n\nI'm in a ton of pain, it hurts to be driving, it hurts to be sitting and now I'm forced to go to urgent care until I can find a medical facility that gives a sh*t.  \n\nDo yourselves a favor and just don't go here.
