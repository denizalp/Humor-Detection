My sons i touch was stolen from the console of the car.  He was playing the i touch prior to entering the wash.  He left the i touch in the console and went inside with me to pay.  After the wash was complete and they dried the car he got in the car and reached for the i touch and it was gone.  I did not leave until I spoke to owner.  Owner was very bad to deal with.  I called the police and filed a report.  Police said that this was second complaint that they had in less than a month about this same issue.  Pretty sad.  And by the way the wash was terrible....never going back...be careful if you use this establishment...I would go down the street and use Auto Bell...
