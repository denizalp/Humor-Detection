I stopped by this past weekend for lunch by myself.  Having never tried Polish food except for the ubiquitous pierogies, I was keen to sample this unfamiliar cuisine.  Because I can be quite picky about the type and form of meat that I eat, I decided to play it safe and order the meatless platter ($11). It came with the following items: a generous helping of haluski, two potato pancakes, and three pierogies (farmer's cheese, potato\/cheddar, mushrom\/sauerkraut), as well as sides of applesauce and sour cream for the potato pancakes and pierogies, respectively (see photo).\n\nAll of the dishes comprising the platter were cooked perfectly, and were absolutely delicious.  The haluski was al dente, and had a nice butter-herb sauce; the potato pancakes were crispy on the outside with a soft, pliable interior; and the pierogies were flavorful and stuffed with filling.  All of them were good, but my favorite was the potato\/cheddar, which had a deliciously warm and savory filling that was well complemented by the cool, creamy sour cream.  These were definitely not your grocery store variety Mrs. T's pierogies, which are served at many restaurants around town--these are the real deal!\n\nAs I was waiting for my lunch to be served, I browsed the store and was intrigued by the wide variety of Polish foodstuffs.  My attention was captured in particular by the pierogies in the freezer (the same ones served on my platter, I presume), as well as the interesting soups in the refrigerator in the back (tripe soup, anyone?).  If you're looking for hard-to-find Polish goods, this is probably one of your best bets around town to find them.  If, on the other hand, Polish cuisine is as foreign to you as it is to me, stop by for a delicious, filling lunch that will provide a great introduction to it!
