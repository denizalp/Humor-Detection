Although our stay here was due to a flight delay, the staff turned our terrible situation into a more enjoyable one. The staff was very friendly and the amenities cant be beat especially in vegas. We arrived and upon check in were delighted to find fresh baked cookies at the desk. Rooms were clean and toiletries were provided. We jumped on the first shuttle to the strip (every hour) which brought us to mandalay Bay (the night shift driver will bring you anywhere though). For pick up you just call them whenever you're ready to head back. Breakfast is ready by 3 am but if you want the hot stuff you have to wait till 6. hopped on the shuttle back to the airport and was on our way to our final destination.
