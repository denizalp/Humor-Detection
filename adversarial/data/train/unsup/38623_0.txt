Amazing little kiosk in the sidewalk on the north side of Dundas on the east side of Spadina. I tried the taiyaki, which is a cute little crepe type of Japanese dessert filled with red bean, green tea, or pineapple. Tasty and warm! And I also tried their BBQ which was good as well. They have several different meats on a stick but my fav was the Philippine sausage, yummy!\nAfter standing there (no seating) for a few minutes, it was obvious I have to return soon to try the Chinese savoury crepes which look very good. It's a crepe coated with egg as it cooks, and wrapped around a crispy cracker with lettuce and some sauces. It's from northern China and people were telling me they come from Mississauga to seek out one of these delightful looking snacks. I'll be back!
