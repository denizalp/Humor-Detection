This is a family-run halal meat store with a small menu of sandwiches. As far as deli\/club sandwiches go, it was one of the best ones I've tried in a while. The meat in the sandwiches, especially the Montreal Smoked Beef, was absolutely delicious. The house sauce added just the right amount of flavour. \n\nThey also sell many different types of prepared meat items that are perfect for barbecuing. Will definitely be visiting again to try a few of the other sandwiches or to buy their products.\n\nAlthough the seating area is very limited, our overall experience was great.
