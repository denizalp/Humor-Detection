Finding myself a long way from home (over 65km), I referred to my trusty Yelp app for somewhere to have dinner. I don't recall passing many restaurants when I got off the highway to get where I was and Yelp didn't reveal too many options in the immediate vicinity either but noodles sounded good.\n\nMeet Noodles is in a small strip plaza just off the QEW. It's clean and spacious with a modern conservative decor. There are booths, banquette seats and taller seating available. All the built-in seats, however, have sharp edges and no padded seats. They were kinda hard. Maybe they don't want you staying too long?\n\nI ordered grilled lamb skewers to start and a noodle soup with ground pork.\n\nThe lamb was nicely seasoned and tasted good. Personally, I would have preferred a little more sear at a higher temperature, with a little pink inside. This was cooked evenly, well done. That's not a criticism, just my preference.\n\nThe soup was attractively presented, with the meat and some beans placed in the middle, along with a sliced hard boiled egg. Spaghetti noodles? I wasn't expecting that at a Chinese restaurant. It was cooked perfectly al dente (if I was eating pasta at an Italian restaurant) but I'm used to softer noodles in my soup. Again, just my preference. The soup did taste good. Everything was properly seasoned, with just a little bit of heat. Very nice. I might have liked the dish even more if it was Chinese egg noodles. Maybe.\n\nThe service was very good, with staff checking on me and refilling my water frequently.\n\nThe one thing I can't ignore is the temperature in this place. It was HOT! I was sweating buckets and going through napkins like crazy. Yes, it was a hot summer evening and hot soup probably wasn't the best choice but that has nothing to do with whether or not an air conditioner works properly. The sun was just going down when I left and outside was cooler than inside. For real! Hopefully, this is not an everyday situation.
