Despite the mixed reviews here, my mom & I had a fantastic stay at the Palms Place :)\n\nFor those who are feeeeeling iffy with this place, I strongly recommend checking out Airbnb for better pricing + reviews. It seems like the owners tend to take better care of their place and is a step up with the cleanliness in comparison to typical hotel cleaning. \n\nFor me, I was fortunate enough to find an awesome Airbnb listing with fantastic owners who took really good care of the place. \n\nGeneral things to note:\n~Check In \/ Check out: Was a breeeeeze \n\n~Size of the room: Perfect for parties of 2-4 (or more). There's a comfy king size bed + a queen pull out sofa\n\n~Kitchen: There's a small stove\/sink\/fridge....if you go with Airbnb, you will most likely not have to worry about the typical stocked fridge that has motion sensors and would charge you an arm + leg for water\/soda\n\n~Balcony: Again, perk of Airbnb = you having the ability to open the door. Awesome views \n\n~Bathroom: ahhhh, the waterfall shower + Jacuzzi tub = fantasticcccccc\n\n~No smoke: It's nice to step into a hotel that doesn't reek of smoke\n\n~The skybridge between Palms Place + Palms Casino was pretty convenient, especially if you want to catch the free shuttle (Palms Casino) that goes to the strip (at half hour intervals)\n\n~Uber rides: Usually around $6-8 on average. I love catching uber here since the pick up\/drop off point is right at the main entrance, and not some weird off to the side location like some of the hotels on the strip\n\n~Food\/Restaurants: Even though the majority of the food places are located at the Palms Casino, the walk between the hotels = a few minutes. For those who like Asian cuisine, Chinatown area is literally less than 5min away by uber :)\n\n~Security: There is security that checks your room key prior to boarding the elevators from the lobby. So yay for no randoms wandering around\n\nIn summary, Palms Place is a great hotel to stay at if you're traveling with family\/friends, or want a quieter area to stay at. Plus, uber rides are pretty inexpensive, so don't let the location scare you off with its distance to the strip.
