Don't shop here.  We go to Vegas twice a year.  Don't know why but we always seem to end up at the Forum Shops and stopping at this Fields of Dreams shop (more like Fields of Disaster).  Our last trip there, my son and his friend wanted to get a souvenier.  They're big baseball fans.  My son's friend accidentally bumped into a display upstairs and a framed\/signed plaque fell over and the glass broke.  The two rudest salespeople demanded we pay for the broken plaque at $129.99.  Are they out of their minds?  We demanded to talk to the owner, but he was off and too busy to deal with it, leaving two dumb girls to call the police.  Police came and we explained the whole situation and showed them the flimsy display.   Needless to say, we did not pay for that plaque.  I guess when you have two dumb, rude people working at a store the best thing to do is to bring in somebody with a brain.  I guess this is their way of moving inventory.  They're just lucky nobody got hurt.
