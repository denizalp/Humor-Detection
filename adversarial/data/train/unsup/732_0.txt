i never, ever, ever shop here...unless it's to stock up on my louis vitton socks and underwear. it is a beautiful mall, with all kinds of tricky levels, a good food court, and a movie theater. \nthere are some reasonable stores there...express, h&m, gap. it's a really nice mall to go when it's ridiculously hot outside and you don't have to shove too many tweens wearing skinny jeans and 80's glam t-shirts off the escalators.
