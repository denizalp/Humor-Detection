I adore, love, crave, & dream about good Greek food. \nThat being said, I just don't enjoy My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. (And I really hate when people just call it My Big Fat..how appetizing is that??)\n\nMy biggest problem is with the pita. I mean, really, you're a Greek restaurant, you should at the VERY least have good pitas. They taste straight out of the store-bought bag. After that, there really is no redemption.\n\nThe menu is very chain standard, and is good for families with kids and big groups. It's definitely good for people with big appetites because their portion sizes are out of control.\n\nThere are better restaurants in the area for sure, even better restaurants right there in the AZ Center.
