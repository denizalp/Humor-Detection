The food was delicious and plentiful. The heat index was high, I requested a red curry with a 3 heat index, just perfect but still made my nose sniffle. Wife had Drunken Noodles with shrimp, incredible flavor and texture. The pumpkin custard is a must for dessert. The service was a little slow but food was quick.\n\nNice treasure if you are heading towards Ross Park Mall..
