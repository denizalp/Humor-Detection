I'm going to trust my Indian friend Nakul who travels back and forth to the states and India often that this is good food. He took me here and I was astonished how much I enjoyed the flavorings, nothing too over powering and the taste was great. Service was prompt and for lunch it is a great inexpensive place to go. :)
