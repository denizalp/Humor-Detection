Wow never going to eat at any other sea food place again. I've heard about this place and had it on my list of things to do for a while now and regret not coming here sooner. Let's start from the moment I walked in.\nWell I walked in and it was a tad busy I got seated in another section on the right side of the building. I had an AMAZING SERVER her name was McKenna (insanely attractive ). Expected the normal type of customer service ya know? But no she blew it out of the water! She got my order and the food came out pretty quick. She kept checking on me making sure everything was perfect just like her. Kept checking up on me and even made sure I never ran out of the little things like more condiments such as sauces and lemons (which I need a lot of for my water). The manager (Maggie) also came up a few times and we had a great talk while she was making sure everything was to my liking and that I was enjoying myself. This staff is pretty amazing even the other servers would check up on me (Haley), would check up on me often it's like I never not had someone checking up on me. I felt like a celebrity. This location prides themselves in customer service and making sure everything is to your liking, you can tell by the way they make you the top priority on their list of things to do. THIS IS A MUST!! If you love sea food with some entertainment from sports, great background music and amazing customer service well this is the place to go!!
