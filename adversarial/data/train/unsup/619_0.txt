After lunch Nadia, Jackie, and I wanted to check out Wet Republic at MGM. When we got there we got rejected they told us the guest list was closed and we had to pay 10 bucks to go in. 10 bucks to hang out at the pool? I don't know about that. We then decided to just chill at one of the other pools in MGM. It was hot as hell but it was nice to be in the water and just watch people. I got to hang out with Nadia and Jackie is always fun and cool. Wish I got some jello shots at the pool. Next time I say.\n\nThank you Michael L for getting us towels and letting us borrow your sunscreen
