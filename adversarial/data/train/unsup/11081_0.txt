Like the other reviewers have mentioned, there are two places to skate in the Charlotte area, Extreme and the Ice House.  While the Extreme facilities are more up to date and have two surfaces, the people that run the rink are an absolute joke.  Starting at the top I have heard the owner (I found out he was the owner from the front desk) using fowl offensive language numerous times within the earshot of children.  From what I can have experienced, the skating program is being run in the ground and has the worst customer service.  The sports bar upstairs is a cool concept until you realize that all the food comes from the horrible concession stand fryer and grease griddle downstairs.  I felt sick for two days following consumption of a burger I made the mistake of ordering, the wings I tried certainly did not help either.  I have no clue how this place is even still in business.\n\nTake my advice, steer clear of this place, there is another option in Pineville, GO THERE!
