I have been coming here since they first opened & Yonaka Sushi never disappoints. The place is small but it had no problem accommodating my  party of 15+ people who all had an excellent time even for those 'sushi beginners'.  Salmon orenji is an all time favorite! Tea ribs are really good too. Save room for desserts, especially the cheddar flan !!!
