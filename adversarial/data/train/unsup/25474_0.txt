I was in a hurry to find a salon that could give me an all over color before I had to go on vacation. All other salons open around 10pm but I had work at 1pm and didn't want to risk being late. I looked on Yelp for salons and found Beauty Brands! They opened at 8am and were able to get me in that morning at no problem right away. I had Sydney as my stylist and he did an amazing job! I got the color and cut I wanted and everyone at my work was blown away with it all! I was very impressed with the place itself and the other stylists that were there. These are professionals that know what their doing and really take care of their clients. I have definitely found my new \"go to\" salon. I am extremely happy with their work and help. Thank you Beauty Brands!
