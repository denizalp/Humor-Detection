I found this and booked it online with gotobus.com.  The price was about $40 cheaper than greyhound. The bus was clean and the driver was very professional. The seats have power plugs which was cool. AC worked great. The movies were either in Spanish or subtitled in Spanish. I could only hear about every other word due to road noise, so whatever. \n\nI called before the pickup time as requested on the online reservation ticket and stayed on hold for 15 minutes! Hung up then called again and got nothing but a busy signal. I was lucky there were other passengers waiting because the bus doesn't stop if they haven't been told someone is there. I guess that makes the drive faster. \n\nAlso: I had no idea there was a transfer. I'm stuck at the bus terminal in Vegas for 4 hours. My ticket says depart at noon arrive at 3 am. I would have preferred to see that on my itinerary like with what I've seen on plane tickets. The terminal is an old repurposed convenience store. It's old and the seats are plastic row seats.  At least the ac works. \n\nI would ride this bus again if I have to like today, but I don't typically ride the bus for good reason.
