My boyfriend is new in Toronto and was looking for a good and not so expensive place to get a hair cut. After reading some reviews here and other sites, I suggested the Maverick.\n\nMy bf called to make an appointment and the lady on the phone was very friendly. My bf had found a style on the Internet and since they have ipads there, he was able to show Mike what he wanted. He was a bit serious at the beginning, but he was very professional all the time and gave his opinion on the style my bf wanted. The entire process took almost half an hour and included a hot towel treatment (for no extra $$).\n\nAt the end, my bf was very happy with the hair cut and he absolutely loved the hot towel! he thought going here was a good decision.
