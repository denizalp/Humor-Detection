Is RC Willey great for everything?  No.  I don't think any store that tries to \"do it all\" is.  BUT they are great at furniture.\n\nOur first purchase was at their old Lamb & Craig clearance location.  We bought a microfiber dual reclining sectional.  It was one of the most comfortable pieces of furniture in the house!  Great price, warranty, and friendly sales person.\n\nA few years later we moved into a house with a smaller living room.  So we decided to get a smaller sectional with only one recliner.  This time we went to the Henderson location and, again, ended up buying something from the clearance section.  Great price, warranty, and again a friendly sales person.\n\nFor the past two weeks we have been bed shopping.  We dealt with four different sales people at the Henderson location.  One was nice, two were okay and one was friendly, knowledgeable and a total pleasure to work with.  We purchased the bed frame from the regular part of the store but the mattress from the clearance section.  (They have some brand new mattresses back there, so definitely check them out).  Kim was the best.  He answered all our questions, didn't try to \"up sell\" us on anything and just made the buying experience perfect.  \n\nI definitely recommend checking out their clearance sections and ask for Kim while you are in Henderson!
