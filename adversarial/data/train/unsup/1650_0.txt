I don't remember everything I ate here. I'm terrible at writing reviews for buffets because all I do is pick whatever I like and eat it and if I don't like it, I just trash it. Well, I  do like this place because I actually did almost eat everything I picked. \n\nThis is random but I'm a Mac and Cheese lover. This place has the best Mac and cheese. it was in a mini casserole dish and the breadcrumbs just topped it off. Brilliant. This buffet won my heart. Their desserts are pretty bomb too. I had too much of those. I ate a lot here, period. I wish I remembered exactly what i ate but I don't. I just know I came out here as a happy camper with food coma lol.\n\nI'd definitely come back again whenever I have the time to eat because I never have the time to eat in Vegas!\nI'm sorry for neglecting you but I will be returning this summer =D
