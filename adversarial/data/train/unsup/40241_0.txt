Had lunch at CF yesterday.  The food was terrible.  The french fries my son ordered were cold and soggy.  I had soup and salad.  The soup was cold and the salad was over dressed.  The couple next to us had sent their lunches back.  I overheard them state their food was raw.  They were brought new plates 15 minutes later and they didn't eat them.  All in all, not a good experience.  They need to employ a new day chef!
