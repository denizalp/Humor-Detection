Love this place!\n\nThe chicken and waffles are better and cheaper than LOLOS (which is just down the street). \n\nDisappointed I couldn't substitute my eggs for another waffle or anything, but that's just how life works, I guess. \n\nThe food is delicious.  The prices are decent.  The service wasn't bad.  \n\n4 stars!
