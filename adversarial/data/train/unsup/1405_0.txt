I think this place just doesn't hit the mark. I canceled my membership recently for two reason, first is I purchased a spray tanning package 4 tans for 35-40$ can't remember which but the attendant only ever credited me 3 tans, she mentions several times in our conversation \"oh yeah your three tans.\" Then I corrected her, \"I thought it was four tans?\" She mumbles \"Yeah, four.\" I notice she doesn't fix anything in the computer, my brains works honey. If you just said 3 you probably put 3 in the computer, so I asked again, \"You sure you put 4 not 3?\" She answered \"Yeah, dont worry about it.\"\n\nSo, I tan in a bed and leave. I don't think twice except i'll MAKE SURE to ask next time someone else is working besides her. \n\nSo next time I tan, I ask... and sure enough she only put 3. And I explained the situation to the nice girl who said she take it up with the manager and fix my account. After the whole experience, they did credit my account for the right amount of tans and apologized it still doesn't feel right.\n\nThere was a bunch of other random fee that popped up with the beginning of the membership, which just seems shady. If you wanna charge more just be up front about it. I'm not stingy, I could pay 50-100$ a month for a tan, I HAVE BEFORE. \n\nAnother recommendation would be stop putting little cards and useless crap advertising in the actual tanning bed. Put a table or something then the customer doesn't have to waste time and effort removing it every time they tan.
