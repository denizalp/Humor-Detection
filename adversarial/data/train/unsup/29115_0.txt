This is my absolute favorite hotel in Las Vegas.  I've stayed here at least 6 times already.  It's beautiful, has great service, and has the biggest rooms out of all the hotels in Vegas.  Their most cheapest standard room is a suite, so theres no need to upgrade if you're traveling with up to 3 people.
