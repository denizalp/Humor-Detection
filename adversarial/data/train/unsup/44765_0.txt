When a Yelp reviewer described this restaurant as being a \"hole in the wall\", I didn't believe them until I actually saw it in person. I've been in the same shopping center plenty of times and I have never noticed this place. \n\nWhat makes this place memorable and enjoyable is the customer service. Our server, he was a man, was nice, funny, and attentive. His persona is that of like a really cool uncle.\n\nAs far as the food goes, it was decent. Their kalbi and teriyaki chicken are worth getting. I disliked their spam musubi ($2\/roll) because I could make better tasting ones at home. The spam & egg sandwich was drenched in so much mayonnaise that the spam slipped out when my boyfriend was trying to eat it. I also did not like the fact that their water tasted like tap water. :-\\ \n\nI think I would only go here if I was nearby.
