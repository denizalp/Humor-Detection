Went for an early (4:00) dinner on a Saturday.  Was seated right away by a polite and helpful host.  Waiter was very personable, helpful with suggestions, and attentive throughout the meal.  The stuffed mushroom appetizer looks so decadent because it looks like the mushrooms are swimming on olive oil or butter, but that is actually chicken broth so you don't have to totally kill your diet to eat them.  The eggplant parmesan was good but only order it if you understand you're going to get something that looks like lasagna.  When they say it is baked, they mean as in a casserole.  Different but good.  Even so, I still consider the lasagna my favorite, though.\n\nLots of parking because of the location in Downtown Summerlin.  Just try to avoid the area where theater-goers tend to park.
