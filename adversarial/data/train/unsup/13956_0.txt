6\/1\/11\n\nI finally made it to HoT for happy hour!  Parking is in the back- be careful parking anywhere else, as your car might get towed.  There are misters for those who like eating outside.  Since I've only been here once, and I had to eat at the bar area for happy hour, I don't know what the noise level is indoors, but it certainly seems nice in there, if not a bit cramped.  A big minus for me is that smoking is allowed outside, so I'm hoping to secure a table indoors on my next visit.\n\nOrdered the only cocktail on the menu that uses ginger liqueur (sorry, but I forgot the name), and really liked it!  It tasted light and refreshing, but packed quite a punch, so be careful-- it went down very smoothly and very fast!  Happy hour knocked off only $1, down to $9, so I suppose it's good that the bartender had a heavy hand.  ;)  As for my entree, I had the Roasted poblano, artichoke, and spinach dip, which came w\/ both crostini and water crackers.  Skip the water crackers (they felt stale when I bit into them, and they're very bland) and stick w\/ the crispy, nicely-toasted, and olive oil-drizzled crostini.  I did, and I ate the entire thing!  (Well, minus the water crackers.)  The base was very creamy, yet also chunky (I love foods that layer on many textures!), and I really appreciated the heat that the roasted poblanos brought to this dish.  From the moment I took that first bite, I thought that  this dish was different from any other spinach and artichoke dips I've ever tried.  Try it if you're into s\/a dips, and let me know what you think of this one!\n\nThe rest of the menu sounds great, but can get very pricey (salads and soups, $6-10; starters, $10-19; and entrees, $20-32).  Will try to return for lunch!
