I've been waiting in quiet anticipation for this Meijer to open its doors ever since I've moved to Urbana. When they finally turned on the giant spotlight welcoming beacon, I hurried right over to acquaint myself with what I planned to make my new home base for groceries.\n\nBoy, is it going to take some getting used to.\n\nThe layout of the store is a bit baffling to me. I guess I'm not expert on ergonomics, but it feels like they just threw sections around haphazardly. I found myself walking around in circles -- seeing food, then non-food, then food again -- and I swear I saw lunchmeat show up in three different spots. The prices were okay; better than Schnuck's, at least. I'll probably still go here because it's so darn close to where I live and the employees seem nice enough, but I'm giving a thumbs-down to the floor plan that spits in the face of efficient shopping. \n\nI'm all for changing things up and taking new directions, but when it comes to groceries, I guess I'm just a hard-nosed conservative.
