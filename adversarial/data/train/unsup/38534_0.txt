This bar was formerly Lolabar, but has since closed and reopened under new management as Dundas and Carlaw.\n\nSo far, it's been ok.  They are open during the day, and serves coffee and sandwiches.\n\nThey also have a bbq on the patio, but I don't see that used as often.  The people are nice enough.  The patio is large.\n\nSometimes it gets super loud because they blast music on the patio and have live bands on occasion, which isn't that great for people on the patio because you can't talk to anyone, and not great for people who live in the area who can hear all the noise even with their windows closed.\n\nOverall it's ok, and seems to be busier than Lolabar was.
