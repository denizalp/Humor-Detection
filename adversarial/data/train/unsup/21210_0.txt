So I'm aging myself but I came here when it was Big Bang. I was so excited to see a lot of the same performers when I ventured back here. I had a blast. The crowd was pumped and Mickey C can still bring down the house with some Beastie Boys. Lots of varieties of drinks and the fishbowls seem to be a big hit. I appreciated that security took care of some people acting inappropriately and not following the rules. You can reserve tables if needed which is awesome. The music is super cool and everyone is welcomed at this place. If you want to have a blast on mill ave come here. You won't regret it.
