This is slowly turning in to one of my favorite happy hour spots in Ohio City.  A group of us checked this place out when it was new and fresh.  My first impressions were: the old Garage Bar space looks grown up and hip now and WOW - that's a lot of beer.  The unfortunate part was that we got there when things were really heating up so the place was PACKED.  Didn't really skew my first impression as a bad one - just had some reservations because the service couldn't really keep up with the demand.  \n\nWell, boy - things have changed since that early day and I can't seem to stay away from this place!  Grab a couple friends, plop down at one of the tables on the side (the back patio is great, too), and dig in to the extensive beer\/drink menu.  There's a beer for everyone - stouts, IPAs, Belgian Wheats - you name it, they have it (if you're reading this and Nano still has it, do yourself a favor and try the Fat Heads Bumbleberry.  You're welcome).  \n\nFood is great too - it's bar food with a serious kick.  It's part of the Market Garden\/Bier Market\/Bar Cento group, so expect the goods.  Stoner fries are amazing (I'll let you process that for a second), Mac & Cheese bites are pure amaze-balls, and the bf tried the PBJ Burger (yes, it's exactly what you would expect and more - peanut butter, BACON (the surprise factor), and jam all piled high on that juicy burger) and he said it was delicious.\n\nSo when Market Garden is a little too packed or you're looking for a more low key, super chill vibe, venture down 25th a little and you'll run yourself smack-dab into Nano.  You get it all - beer, food, and patio all wrapped up in one amazing place.
