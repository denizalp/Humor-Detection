I may never leave! 3 pools, grills and outdoor kitchens, pet friendly, and staff is amazing! I've lived all over vegas and henderson and move every year because so many communities don't maintain their property, have rude staff, or inconsiderate neighbors. There's kids for my son to play with and have made lifelong friends here! It's a great value for the size and finishes in the units and the amenities are great- I use the pool daily and the grills at least a few times a week. We even had our sons birthday party here and our friends couldn't believe what we were paying. I 110% recommend living here!
