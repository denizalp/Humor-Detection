Went here for lunch.  Portions are good and service was ok.  Quality was acceptable.  There was only one other table occupied during lunch so it was quiet and the food came quickly.  It's a good alternative to fast food since the price is comparable to a combo at a QSR (quick serve restaurant).  I would come back if I was in the area and was driving on the same side of the street as the entrance.
