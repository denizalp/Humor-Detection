Came here to check out the margaritas and bar food\nBar food usually isnt the best but its always good to eat while youre drinking\nAnywho I had me a beergarita and I really liked it\nThe service was nice and it was a pretty chill atmosphere\nI think its a great location and I had a good experience here\nI think it would be a good place for a group of friends\nAfter all it is on Mill\nNow you can start your crawl on the North End\nand stumble down South \n:D
