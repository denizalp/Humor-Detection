Staff was really helpful even though our flight was over 6 hrs late, so we were technically​ picking the car on the next day. The office is in the airport itself but the car pickup​ area is a good way off ( free shuttle). So the staff was very helpful in suggesting that we keep buffer time for traffic delays and shuttle delays for our return flight .
