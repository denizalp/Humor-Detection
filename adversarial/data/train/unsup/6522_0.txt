The lions are all lazy and boring. THey are in captivity. There are no gazelle to chase, hunt or maul. They are fed dead flesh. Poor lions. They have such a boring life. AND with all the kids and drunk people banging on the glass and ooohing and aaahing over their faces smushed against the glass, they must all be suicidal. \n\nHowever, I was one of those idiots who paid $25 to take a picture of myself and my step-daughter with the lion cub. I must admit, the picture turned out really cute. But, alas, that cub will also grow into a lion, and end up being just as boring. \n\nIts still fun to see lions in a casion though. =)
