I always want to try the Afternoon high tea at Mandarin Oriental, but I'm too cheap. I don't want to spend $$$ for it. We've been playing the free MyVegas game on facebook a lot and we had enough points to redeemed for Afternoon High Tea at The Bellagio for both of us. I was so thrilled.\n\nI made reservation couple weeks in advanced. I was so excited on the afternoon of high tea time. I even put on my nicest dress. We got seated right away and I noticed how empty the place was. All of the tables had reservation signs on them. This is really high class frou frou activity that I usually don't care of doing. \n\nThe server presented us with menu of teas and finger sandwiches. I forgot which two we ordered, we pretty much got our own teapots, and ordered both menus. I love everything from scones, to finger sandiwches, and to their petite desserts.\n\nWe were stuffed. I swore, my belly grew two sizes from couple hours of indulging in this fiesta. Service was very very good even when we told them we had vouchers so our meals would be free. They didn't care and still gave us excellent service. \n\nWe will be back and I highly recommend this experience to all of you. Do it once and you will be happy that you do it.
