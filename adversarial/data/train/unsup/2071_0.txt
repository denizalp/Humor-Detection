As soon as I moved to the Valley I started scoping out the liquor stores in the area. You've got your BevMo's, Total Wine, and a few nice little neighborhood package stores; but this store... THIS store...\n\nMy girlfriend and I call it 'The Most Convenient Convenience Store in the World\", and with good reason. You need something, you come here first. Briquettes for your grill? Check. Toilet paper? You got it. A larger selection of imported, craft, and hard-to-find beers than you can find anywhere else in Arizona... .... uh.... ... check???\n\nI'm not sure that their selection beats other stores, because honestly I haven't been to any other stores in God-knows-how-long. Full disclosure, this place IS just right up the street from my house, but every time I come here I've discovered something new and amazing. \n\nScenario:  You have a day full of chores that you just don't know how you're gonna do. You've got a box full of old clothes for Goodwill, you're planning a grill-out with your brochachos, you need to mail off your tax return, and you think you might like to try a nice cigar. Normally you'd have to pop all over town... or you could just come here. Donation box out by the pumps. Full walk-in humidor. Amazing selection of beers, wines, and liquors. AND IT'S A FULL US POSTAL SERVICE LOCATION. Yeah, you need something 2-dayed, you just holla at my people at 777. Seriously. \n\nSo come check this place out. Stop inside and say hello- everyone here is really friendly. I'm sure that some other places around might have better selections of certain things, but for a one-stop shop, this place knocks Costco out the park (okay, so maybe you can't buy an LED TV here, but I think it's just a matter of time...)
