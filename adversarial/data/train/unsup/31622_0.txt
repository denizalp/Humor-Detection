I can't speak for anyone else's visit, but my visit today was exceptional. I have been to this urgent care quite a few times and have never had a bad experience, but today's was by far the best. I came in with a sudden anaphylactic reaction that had started about 15 minutes prior to my arrival. I went in, told the 2 ladies at the front desk that my throat was swelling pretty quickly and they got me right back. William Gabbert DO saw me, asked what happened, took a look at my throat and I was given shots of Epi & a steroid almost immediately. The LPN or MA (not sure what she was) was very kind and made me feel very comfortable considering I had to pull my pants down to get shots in my butt :) I'm a registered nurse so I know how this stuff goes and that it could have been very bad, so I'm thankful for the quick acting and knowledgeable staff. Dr. Gabbert watched me for about 15 minutes after my symptoms had subsided, checked in on me frequently, and I was on my way :)\n\nThank you to all of the staff that was there today to help me :) P.S. I am never eating a kiwiberry again :)
