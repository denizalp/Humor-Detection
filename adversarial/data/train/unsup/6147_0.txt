We, party of 4, were very sceptical coming in here for lunch. There are so many good Chinese restaurants on Highway 7, what makes this one so special?  Well...this place has,in my opinion, the best roast pork and bbq pork on Highway 7. The skin is very crispy and there isn't a lot of fat. The beans around it just compliments the dish. The bbq pork is also very tasty and their awards on the wall is no lie. Vegetables we order is very tender and the curry beef dish is delicious!!!!  The servers here are polite, attentive and very helpful.\n\nIn retrospect, we will definitely come back for more roast pork and bbq pork. Next time will try their dinner service.
