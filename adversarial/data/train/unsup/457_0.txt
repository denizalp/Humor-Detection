This is hands-down the most efficient, and friendly gas station in Arizona. \n\nEvery morning if you come in here at 7 AM you will see multiple employees working at least two registers in order to accommodate speedy line flow. They are always nice and treat you with a smile.\n\nI'm consistently blown away by the cleanliness of the store, the attitude of the employees and the fast pace they work. \n\nStop by and let them brightness your morning.
