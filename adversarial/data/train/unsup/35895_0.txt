So we celebrated my sons birthday here last night and I got to try their new dish to $16.99 a pasta, fried coated with garlic bread. It was a big meal and I ended up giving half of it to my aunt and even had a take home lolzz.. let's get to the taste, aesthetic appearance is appealing, smell is appetising;however, the pasta is spicy for me and I'm not a fan of spicy dishes..all in all I'll give it a 7\/10 because the chicken and garlic bread was okay.My son also had fun is it worth the money? Well if you love spicy pasta then yes and you can share it!
