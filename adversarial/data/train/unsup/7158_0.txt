With two years in business, a growing family and now a second location opened all the way across the country one wonders just how Owner\/Chef Jonathan Pluvinet does it, another look at his Las Vegas flagship on South Rainbow Boulevard showing absolutely no fall-off in terms of quality even with the Chef currently splitting time between time zones as his current team even continues to create new items to line both the refrigerator and Pastry cases.\n\nCrossing the 24-month mark in August, an impressive feat for any Off-Strip business in the 702 these days, Autumn 2017 sees Rosallie Le French Café expectedly dressed for the season with Gourds and Haystacks lining the register and although many old favorites remain there are also plenty of new items to entice both first timers as well as returning guests, the front of house staff as friendly as ever with Dean Martin and Old Blue Eyes serenading diners from overhead speakers while they are eating.\n\nIntentionally visiting while Chef Pluvinet was in town, the Orlando iteration of Rosallie reportedly already doing well even after a week-long loss of power thanks to the Hurricane, it was once again sitting at a four top that a substantial order flooded the table with mostly sweet selections, the house-blend of Beans still turning out a great Double Espresso while the Croque Rosallie remains one of Las Vegas' best bargain Sandwiches at just $8.95 despite offering one of Jonathan's city-best Croissants, thick-cut imported Ham, melted Mozzarella and creamy Onion Sauce.\n\nFinding the Butter Croissant slightly tweaked from prior, an Egg-wash adding color but preventing the same internal expansion and thus making things a little more dense, it was on to Rosallie's Paris-quality Almond Croissant that Brunch moved onward, nothing changed here and Las Vegas still better than anywhere else visited in the United States because of it as the housemade Almond Puree should make any bakery using packaged Frangipane ashamed of itself.\n\n Wrapping up previously tasted items with the Strawberries and Cream Pastry and an Espresso Opera Cake, a layer of Apricot Glaze giving the former just enough sweetness without making the interior soggy, it was here that Jonathan and team once again showed a steady hand when working with Nuts, the Almond Brittle a nice take home treat and a slice of Nutella Almond Pie like a slightly sweeter version of the world-class Walnut one that hasn't grown less delicious after more than ten tastes and likely won't, ever.\n\nFinally finding a way to use up left-over Egg Whites while also answering the age-old question of whether a Meringue should be hard or soft with a jumbo-sized white cloud that shatters on the outside before yielding a slightly chewy center, it was here that another half-dozen items were taken for the road, both the Strawberry Linzer and Sablé speaking of good Butter as well as technique with the later every bit as good as memories of Dorie Greenspan's version previously tasted in New York.\n\nWisely rationing Jonathan's Housemade Country Peach and Fresh Basil Jam from Summer for good Bread, Rosallie's Wheat Roll definitely fitting that definition and the Jam still great three months after being opened, it was here that the baking team once again impressed by way of a Buttery Tart Shell lined with Raspberry and topped with Lemon Curd, the lip-puckering sourness a very different experience from their Lemon Meringue Pie while both the Chocolate-dipped Palmiers and soft, fudgey Brownie were also quite delicious.\n\n*****:  With no less than four additional French Bakeries popping up in the wake of Rosallie, one a rebrand and the other three simply not as good, those looking for Parisian quality baked goods in Sin City need only point their Car, Bike or Scooter to 6090 South Rainbow Blvd and order anything that looks delicious while those looking to make a real trip out of it can start planning their Winter or Spring Break Vacation to Rosallie in Winter Garden...or maybe just add that as a side-trip when visiting the bigger, better Disney.
