I stay here regularly due to the convenience, but the wifi is not great, cell phone reception is actually sort of spotty even in the lobby area, and the breakfast is hit or miss depending on how busy the breakfast area is when you go (or who is working). I've had dirty rooms here before - beard hair in the sink, etc. - and it's been addressed by moving me, but it's nothing stellar and the experience has been inconsistent at best. Not how you'd like to be treated as a customer, but certainly not how you should be treated with diamond status.
