Claim Jumper is usually a no-brainer with great food and great service. Not so at this location today. Restaurant was less than half full but service was very slow. Server never came back to check on the entree. I ordered the Shrimp Fresca Pasta, and the pasta was horribly obercooked, and the shrimp coating was mushy. Very sub par for this chain.
