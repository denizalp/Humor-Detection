I'm completely torn about the Phoenix. It has excellent acoustics, and a great layout for concerts. On the other hand, the idiotic drinking pen and the near-rainforest heat and humidity make it almost unbearable to stay in the building.\n\nThe lineups in winter are brutal, there's no reason that they need to keep people out in the cold when it's perfectly withering inside, and there's generally plenty of room.\n\nI doubt you would ever find me here outside of a concert setting, as the only night they have anything else is Edge 102 Saturdays, and that appeals to me about as much as thumbscrews or Susan Boyle (the two are roughly equivalent). \n\nTheir website plays music, which is a big no-no, and it comes back with every click, which makes a bad thing worse!\n\nSomehow they manage to get great bands to play here, so as long as that's par for the Phoenix, I'll probably be back.
