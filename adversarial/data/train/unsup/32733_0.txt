I would say Caf√© Monarch has reached its full potential with the new location. The service is truly outstanding and now the property is as well! There were no fewer than five people sharing duties to entertain us with our meal last night. Everyone was superb and their spirits were high. The cocktails were perfect. The food was superb. The ambience was fabulous.\n\nFor me, this is a special occasion restaurant. You can't be faint of wallet when going here.  The prices are high, but here you get what you pay for.  They are also extremely accommodating. My wife and I split meals, with me getting about 2\/3 of it. That was fine with them and we enjoyed the four course dinner between the two of us.\n\nSince the menu changes constantly, I won't get into the details of every course. Except to say that each course was magnificent! The flavors were just outstanding!\n\nIf you haven't been, go! If you haven't been since they moved, go back!
