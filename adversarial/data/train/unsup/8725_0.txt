Who can resist? All those pretty sweets under one roof. I did not try anything as I just came out of the Studio B Buffet. But I heard their gelato is the same as the Buffet and it is amazing!! They have red velvet cupcakes, and peanut butter chocolate are the my favorite European style desserts  of pastries, cakes, cannolis, gelato, etc.
