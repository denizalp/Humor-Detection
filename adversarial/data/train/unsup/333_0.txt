This was my second escape room experience, and my second time visiting this particular business. Originally came with a group and had misunderstandings about start time and was unable to participate, returned with a Groupon for a date night experience. It was more frustrating than fun for us, unfortunately.\n\nThough we ultimately did not solve our room, I really appreciated how staff took the time to go through and explain how the rest of the clues fit together to solve the room. The room itself was a bit thrown together and some components were not well-maintained (flashlight went out, a recorded-voice part was difficult to understand, one lock needed extra verbal directions to open even with the correct code, etc.). \n\nAs far as our room (Unknown Room #1), some clues were vague enough that we were applying them in the wrong way causing significant delay. For example, a month in a code could have been used as a 1 or 2 digit number, leading to confusion about which lock it went in. I feel like this should be more clear. Knowing how complicated our room was, I feel like staff should have stepped in with tips sooner (\"you're doing it right but in the wrong place,\" etc), though I realize some people don't want hints. Perhaps this also would have gone better if we simply had a larger group. \n\nI like the escape room concept and find them fun, but this particular room didn't really go as well as I'd hoped. I'd be open to trying others here though, as I do enjoy a challenge.
