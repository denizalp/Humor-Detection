So I heard that pizzaiolo has vegan pizza, they do, but it was quite disappointing.\n\nIt was a late night and i was hungry for a slice. The only vegan option that was available had zucchini and spinach for toppings. Now if you are going to serve vegan pizza then at least put some effort and use mock cheese, or maybe consider more palatable toppings. Regardless, the crust was not up to par.\n\nBut it's not like I had better options. I guess vegans can't be choosers.
