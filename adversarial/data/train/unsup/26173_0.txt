Great service, great drinks and great food! What more can you ask?\n\nWe ordered their chicken wings with honey hot sauce, mad Mac, and sausage party.\n\nChicken wings - cooked perfectly, juicy and the honey hot sauce actually has a good kick. It's nice that the sauce came separately with a brush, so you can lather the sauce on the wings yourself. Highly recommend!\n\nMad Mac - pasta was cooked al dente with tons of yummy cheesy goodness. The top was baked with bread crumbs, so a nice play on texture. Add bacon for extra $3!\n\nSausage Party - German sausage, pretzel, sauerkraut, and potato salad. I love that the sausage had a great snap and not too salty. It paired really well with the grainy mustard. The potato salad and the sauerkraut were both good. The pretzel was nice and warm, although a bit too oily because of the butter. But overall I quite like the dish, I would order it if I was craving a smorgasbord!\n\nWe will definitely be back!
