Oh Chumlee..where art thou!!  Oh there you are in all that merch they sell at Gold & Silver Pawn Shop.  I hope you get some royalties for your image.  \n\nIt's a cool place as far as pawn shops go.  Some cool memorabilia and items.  I doubt you'll find a deal here but admittedly, I'm not a pawn shopper except for an occasional craigslist find here and there.  I had to go though just to pass time after getting whacked on the tables so it was a good waste of an hour reprieve from losing.\n\nIf you watch the show, then it's a must see.  Parking is free and plentiful and the crowds vary throughout the day.  I know that since I like to gamble on the strip and downtown and drive past this place at different times between casinos, eateries and shopping.
