This is one of the best, most entertaining shows I have ever seen in my ENTIRE life. So much fun! I can't even describe how good it is. So much fun. OMG WORTH EVERY PENNY! The top level seats or the bottom seats- it doesn't matter! \n\nA lot of celebrities attend this show as well! I've seen them up close after the crowd leaves in the main lobby. \n\nAMAZZZZZZING! OH MY GOD! I must go back soon!
