Just a few words to start this review... You paid what you get, it is A LOT OF FOOD.  \n\nNow... On to the review. Came here for a friend's birthday dinner after deciding on where to go for dinner. The prior reviews got us enticed to come here. I made a reservation the day before and when I arrived, my table was early. The restaurant is quite clean and the service is spot on. \n\nOnto the food. As stated earlier, it's a lot of food. Plus the pictures to go with it. Taste wise, it's okay. The fish is fresh. And taste isn't too overpowering. I ordered the venti sushi dinner set, and I was quite full from it. \n\nOver all ambiance of Aroowha is casual. Staff are active to keep tabs on us to ensure we are all looked after. Keep up the good work.
