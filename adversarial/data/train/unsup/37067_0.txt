Came here for lunch the other day for the first time! The restaurant is very spunky with bikinis and swim shorts hung all over the place. The menu has a bug variety of breakfast and lunch items. I decided to order the Waikiki burger, this was after I was indecisive on a few items because I wanted everything! The burger was huge, delicious and juicy. The restaurant only had a few other guests there, but Angie made it feel like home for us! She was very hospitable and funny. Definitely will be returning to try out more options. (:
