Fantastic atmosphere and coffee.  Lots of good vegan options.  All of the staff is bilingual and the menu is in Spanish and English, which I love!  The only down side was that I loved it there so much and hung out for so long that I had to leave because they do not have a restroom there.  And neither did the gas station nearby!  I actually had to drive away to find a restroom after drinking so much good coffee!
