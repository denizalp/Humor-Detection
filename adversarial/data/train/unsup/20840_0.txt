Potomac Bakery has been on my \"To Try\" list for many years, and I stopped in while in Dormont this past weekend.  I ordered a Vanilla cupcake with vanilla icing ($.70) and a mini heart-shaped glazed doughnut ($.40?).  Clearly, the prices were great, and the baked goods tasted amazing as well.  The glazed doughnut was perfect, and the Vanilla cupcake was just the right amount of sweet.  Another highlight was the crazy inexpensive day-old bread!  I wished I hadn't bought a fresh loaf the day before because there were a ton of options with unbeatable prices.  \n\nThis is a great bakery and worth a stop.
