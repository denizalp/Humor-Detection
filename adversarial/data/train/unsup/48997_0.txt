This restaurant was a pretty good buffet. Lots of seafood selection. I'm a sushi lover but i didn't like their sushi. The fish was smelly and i couldn't eat it. Other seafood dishes were great like crabs and shrimp. Great soup selection too. There was chicken and meat dishes however they were all sweet. Why should meat taste like dessert ? I'll go again though maybe it'll be better next time. I like lin's buffet on Baseline
