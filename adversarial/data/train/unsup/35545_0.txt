The customer service here is so bad like horrid. When I came in no one asked if I needed help and I had to go up to someone to see if they could assist me. They all were just standing around not doing anything which is so annoying! I ended up buying a pair of shoes and the person checking me out barely said one word to me and after I paid instead of passing the bag to me he left it on the counter and walked away. Jesus take the wheel.
