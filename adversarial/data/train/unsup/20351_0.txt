The good: the cupcakes! We got a four-pack of, I believe, red velvet, pink champagne, smores, and the peanut butter chocolate one. They were all good, though I'm not sure what the pink champagne was supposed to taste like - it was a little odd, but you know, it's a cupcake. So I ate it. They're moist, the frosting is good, and that's what matters. \n\nThe not-so good: when we went in there were a few people there, not sure if they were the owners or their employees (they looked to be in their mid twenties or so) and they were all kinda.. rude. They just gave us this dead stare and seemed really impatient with us, even though we came in at a dead as hell time (monday afternoon, pre-lunch, since we were out). It just seemed like they wanted us to get OUT asap. After trying a few more flavors, the orange creamsicle and strawberry cupcakes taste really artificial and have a heavy chemical smell - ick.\n\nOn the chalkboard it said, \"Can't say anything about customer service, but the cupcakes are good!\" and I feel as though that sums this place up perfectly.
