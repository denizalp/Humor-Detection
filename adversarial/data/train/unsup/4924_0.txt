The Paris Hotel and Casino is now the best representation of the Parisian neighborhood of Belleville, including the grime, dirt and the old prostitutes dressed like Britney Spears. Bring hand sanitizer...\n\nThe place was run down, dirty and the hallways were disastrous. Doors with giant scuff marks and the smell of trash and old food every time you walked through them. The registration process was slow, with long lines and uncomfortable, as the woman who checked us in talked to us like we were toddlers during class. When we asked for an additional card she lectured us about not putting our cards near our cell phones, when we just needed a card for the second guest. \n\nThe room was ugly and old, no extra covers even in the middle of winter. The view was an old parking lot. Needless to say, I do not recommend this place to anyone and will never stay here again. \n\nNow to top things off, they double charged us. They charged both our credit cards the same amount and now I have the hassle of having to call the accounting department to sort this out. \n\nThe WIFI is not free, welcome back to 2005. Neither is the gym, or anything for that matter. Just a cheap, run down and ugly sight. Just like the registration desk staff.
