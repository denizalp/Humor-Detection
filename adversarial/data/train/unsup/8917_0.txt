I was a little concerned about the reviews but I had a great experience here.  Both food and service was good.  My only complaint is that it felt like they forgot to turn on the air conditioning.  We literally sweated through dinner.  Great views of Charlotte!  I had the salmon and my husband had the pad thai - both were very good!
