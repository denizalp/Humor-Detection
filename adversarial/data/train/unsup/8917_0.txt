I love their food!! No wonder they have so many customers right after they opened!! We waited them to open at 11:30AM after Run or Dye 5k Run. We got there around 11:20AM. Door was opened so we walked in and they said we have to go outside and wait..-_-;; I didn't understand that part because why didn't they lock it until 11:30 to open the restaurant if you don't want us to walk in.. right? Well.. but I know they do have lots of customer and they have good food so me and my group of people were just waiting outside for like 5-7 minute and finally we just walked in and they let us seat.\nAfter we got the table.. the service was really fast and good setup.\nThey knew what they're doing and of course, food was great! we were the first customer and people started coming in and it was almost packed after an hour.\nIt was only 2 people serving at the time but they knew what they're doing.\nEverything was so fast and guy there, he was really smart to remember(Well, got  95% right) everyone who ordered what when we asked for separate checks.\nGood food and good service!! I like Soyo!
