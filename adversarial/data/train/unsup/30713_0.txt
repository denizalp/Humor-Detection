I want to first mention that the last time Clint worked on my cars was in 2004 only because I moved out of the State, but I would be surprised if the quality of his work has changed in the past 10 years. \n\nBefore meeting Clint, and way before the days of Yelp, I relied on the insurance companies recommendations and the work performed was mediocre.  They would use these big companies that would send boys that were getting paid a bit over minimum wage, and had jobs as bussers in restaurants at night.  Work had to be redone, moldings never fit right again, etc.\n\nThen I called a high end car dealer in Scottsdale who said they only use Clint.  \n\nFor the next 10 years or so, he replaced 4-5 windshields on my Nissans & Mercedes, as well as a couple of repairs.  The Mercedes windshields were very complex--had water sensors built in, auto dimming rear view mirrors, etc.  The work he did was perfection.\n\nHe was reliable, focused, and neat.  Unlike the boys the insurance companies send you, this was a full-time business for him and his family, and he was very successful at it.  \n\nI wish that I knew someone in the Los Angeles area, or even Southern California that had the skill and I could trust as much as Clint.   There have been times I was thinking of driving back to Scottsdale if I needed a Windshield replaced.\n\nInterestingly, while my Windshields would crack and damage all the time on Arizona roads,  I have never had a need for a windshield repair or replacement in the 10+ years on California roads.  Why is that?
