Excellent meal for my mother's birthday. Superb service and attentive staff. Elegant setting located inside the South Point Hotel, Casino and Spa.\n\nMy mum, wife and I started with a large bottle of Peligreno sparkling water and enjoyed the house basket of assorted breads and decorative rose shaped butter. We perused the menu and decided on seared scallops and a couple of steak filets.\n\nThe steaks came with a Siverado salad that was tossed table side. The house dressing was delicious.\n\nMy wife had the seared sea scallops served with baby spinach and topped with warm bacon dressing. Nice presentation but a couple of the scallops were sandy, seems to be the risk you take when enjoying scallops 3\/5. The non sandy scallops were delicious 4\/5. We also split a side of grilled asparagus between us.\n\nMum had an 8 oz. filet with a baked potato which is also prepared table side to your liking. She enjoyed every last bite 5\/5.\n\nI ordered the 12 oz. filet with mashed potato and cake topped with a homemade potato chip. Cooked medium to perfection 5\/5.\n\nBecause it was mums birthday, we ordered a couple and shared. We enjoyed the warm apple crumb cake 4\/5 and the creme brûlée topped with fresh berries including blueberries, raspberry, strawberry and blackberry 5\/5.
