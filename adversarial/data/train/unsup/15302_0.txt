What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. What happens in the Las Vegas Museum of Natural History (shortened to the museum) stays in your head. Museums are institutions of learning that enrich the mind with knowledge that lasts a lifetime. Now , what stays in my head also stays on Yelp. Through this review, I am going to share on Yelp why my recent visit to the museum left me a fan. This review breaks down the museum by exhibit. \n\nWILD NEVADA EXHIBIT \n\n  If you enjoy Nevada's great outdoors, this is the perfect introduction to the State's wildlife. Dioramas and videos explain the animals, plants , and ecosystems found throughout the state. There are dioramas of the creosote, blackbrush, and pinion juniper communities. The attention to detail is commendable. The animals represented include bighorn sheep, gopher snakes, and elk. As a hiker, I see WILD NEVADA as a field guide to Nevada's great outdoors. \n\nTREASURES Of EGYPT \n\n  The highlight of this exhibit is the replica of the entrance to King Tut's tomb. On this walk back to Ancient Egypt there is fact after fact corresponding to a replica of an Ancient Egypt marketplace to the Recreation of Tut's Tomb. If I learned anything it is that beer was the main drink for adults and children, as it was healthier than water drawn from the\n water.... Maybe Fremont Street just a mile North could capitalize on this fact. The reality is this is one of many facts that I learned. \n\nPREHISTORIC LIFE GALLERY\n\n  This is the exhibit at the end of the main level hallway in this two-level museum. This is really a prehistoric dinosaur gallery. There are realistic replicas of the parasaurolophus, allosaurus, trodon, deinonychus, tyrannosaurus rex, and triceratops. I recommend bringing a notebook and camera because the museum throws fact after fact. The coolest fact I learned is that two hundred million years before dinosaurs there were sharks. \n\nMARINE LIFE GALLERY\n\n  You can say this is where the Museum comes to life. There are tanks of live sea creatures and a turtle. The star attraction is the live shark tank. This tank is home to California Round Ray, Bamboo shark, Port Jackson shark, Japanese horned shark, smooth hound shark, & horse shoe crap grouper. The gallery features a video of a shark shown on a monitor in a shark cage. There are replicas of sharks with incessant facts. \n\nINTERNATIONAL WILD LIFE GALLERY \n\n  This room is a living encyclopedia of the animal kingdom. The replicas of animals are arranged by family. They include the bear, cat, horse, and dog family. This is a nice spot to sit on a bench to take a break from all the reading. \n\nOUT OF AFRICA \n\n   Out of Africa is out of this World. This is a large room bordered by two diaramas showing wildlife scenes from an African savanna. This includes a termite mound with bat-eared fox, Mount Killmanjaro which is Africa's largest volcano, a cheetah, waterbuck, lions, zebras, and African wildlife. \n\nAFRICAN RAINFOREST \n\n   This is a dark room overlooking a replica of the rainforest. The signing is replaced by audio. When you press a button, the lighting focuses on part of a rainforest ecosystem that the audio narrator explains. It's a nice break from constant reading. \n\nTHE EXIT\n\n   This museum is so worth $10 ($8 with AAA). I feel that I came into this museum knowing less than when I walked out. I would learn more by combining it with the Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort, which is nextstore and costs only $1. This museum is an experience that is fitting before a night in downtown Las Vegas,  watching a Minor League game at Cashman Field, or spending an evening at the Fremont Street Experience is a rewarding way to end an afternoon of learning.
