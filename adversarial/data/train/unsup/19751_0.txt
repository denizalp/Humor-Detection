Do not waste your time at this place. I already went to another Hyundai dealership and got a quote so on my way home I thought it would be a good idea to drop by this place and see if they could offer me a better price. I was straight up honest with them and told them the price i was offered at the other dealershup for the exact model i wanted. The sales guy kept saying how they needed my personal information and a credit card to show that i am serious about buying from them before they can give me a quote. After spending 15 mins of back and forth on this issue, I emphasized the price im looking for and told the sales guy to talk to his manager and tell him the price and if they can do something... i will provide my information and credit card. 10 mins later he comes back and says that they really need my information and credit card to prove I'm serious before they can provide me with a quote. Fine... if they can do better than the price i have, i will buy from them so i gave them what he needed and he took it to his manager. 10 mins goes by, the sales guy comes back and asks me about my car colour preference. So at this point I'm thinking that things are going well. 20 mins after that he comes back and says that they arent able to do better than the price I got. Wtf?!?!? I told them from the start  the price i had.... so all in all they wasted 45 mins of my time on what they couldve told me from the very beginning without be giving them my personal information and credit card. This sale guy (and I'm going to include the sales manager as well) are just too incompetent to be in sales or customer service. No wonder i don't see any other customer at this dealership. Hyundai's are great cars but go elsewhere to buy one.
