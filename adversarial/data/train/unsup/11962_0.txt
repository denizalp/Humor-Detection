This place just isn't the same. I've been eating here for a while and keep noticing the decline with each visit. When I walked in it took forever to get seated and the smell was really bad inside. It smelled like rotten eggs so they might have some pipes that need a checking. I did have 6 people at my table but there were no other customers so waiting just over a hour for our food was beyond ridiculous! The egg drop soup was a gloppy mess and my beef dish was tough with a terrible flavor. I have ordered this dish many times and just isn't what it once was. hen the bill came our server assumed we needed split checks after I specifically told her that I was paying for our party and she made it very confusing and awkward for the myself and the others at my table. I questioned coming back since the experience here wasn't what it once was ans then I saw a ROACH running across the floor and knew I'd never be back again.
