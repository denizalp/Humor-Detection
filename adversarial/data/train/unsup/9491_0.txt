CORAOPOLIS ENTRANCE is off busy RT 51 hard to find becareful sharp turn. There is 1 porta potty in the parking lot during warm weather, not winter.------- During the winter trail can get icy. The parking lot is plowed. Nice and flat for bike riding. Summer hot and crowded not much shade except sunrise\/dusk. They have porta potties every couple miles\/ occasional drinking fountains. Creek is stocked with trout for APRIL KIDS TROUT DERBY. Weekends and summer crowded. -----------------------------ALWAYS BRING A CELL PHONE---------- because during cold weather\/weekdays it can be deserted if u fall off ur bike get hurt etc... i am a women and feel safe walking my medium sized loud vicious barking dog (its all show) i carry mace\/knife also, yes, i am a little paranoid after a run in with a huge pitbull.\nI do see alot of lone female joggers at sunset so just make sure u tell someone one where ur going and bring the cell. ******There was a sex predator -  further up the trail last year that was flashing his kibble and bits to the public, thank god he got caught and arrested via his face was on CCTV from a nearby building.\nThe Coraopolis section doesnt have streetlights along the trail. U need a flashlight its really dark at night.  BE SAFE. The farthest i have road my bike was MOONTOWNSHIP, it was flat.  When i walk my dog from CORAOPOLIS parking lot to HASSAM RD\/EWING MILLS its 3 miles round trip. Pretty lots of trees.
