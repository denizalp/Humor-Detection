It's a charming-looking little restaurant inside the Rio, but the service and food were only so-so. \n\nI started with the New England clam chowder and that was actually pretty good. Unfortunately my entrée, the Seafood Charlotte was totally sub-par. The menu describes it as fresh fish, bay shrimp, bay scallops and mushrooms in a velvety cream sauce, topped with buttery puff pastry. I don't recall any mushrooms at all, the sauce was velvety but lacked any kind of flavor and all of the seafood was so overcooked that it was just basically a hot mushy mess. I got two sides with the entrée - sautéed mushrooms and sweet potato fries. The fries were passable but the mushrooms had a really weird taste - not like they had gone bad, but I just didn't care for the seasoning at all.\n\nSome other people tried the fresh fish and boulibase but overall it was a resounding \"meh\" from our whole table.
