If a bar offers match play, we're there.  The reviews certainly didn't hurt the place either.  They had a \"text and receive $20 match play\" but they informed us it took 24 hours to put it on a player's card so we would get it the next time we came.  That's a lock for repeat business.  \n\nWe also had a restaurant.com coupon but it wasn't necessary during happy hour since all drinks were $2 and appetizers were half off.  Everything is full price if you use the coupon.  We ended up ordering chicken fingers, chicken fajitas and the carne asada tacos.  Everything was just OK.  I didn't really like the tacos since the salsa was already put on them and the beef was kinda cold.\n\nWednesday night was insane.  All the regulars were there for the video poker drawings they do so if you're planning to play, avoid Wednesday between 5pm and 8:30pm.  You will not get a seat at the bar.  The staff was friendly and attentive.   \n\nWent back again last week on a Tuesday to redeem the free play and got a plate of the carne asada nachos which were better than what we ate before.  All the patrons sure love their slots and everyone knows everyone else for the most part.  The restaurant area was dead both times but I imagine it would be packed for certain sports events since the TV's are decent.  The football deals sound sweet so maybe we'll try that in the fall.  \n\nThey also just sent us another $20 match play in the mail along with a bogo entree coupon for signing up for their slot club.  I guess we're going back!
