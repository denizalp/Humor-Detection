The Pony Express Cafe is under brand-new ownership as of winter 2013.  The reviews expressed on Yelp to this date (4\/15\/13) seem to be from the previous ownership.  The phone number is incorrect, also.  Just thought that needed clearing up.  :-)  The new owners are a mother\/daughter team, transplants from CO, and they are wonderful!  The prices are modest (contrasted against previous owners' prices) and the food is great!  It is a great little \"find\" on the corner of Alma School and Dynamite Blvd.  The coffee is excellent, the breakfasts are home-cooked to order, lunches are terrific, and Lorraine's homemade baked goods are worth the caloric intake.  Alas, they're only open Mon.-Fri.  Weekends are family time for them, and we can't fault them for that.
