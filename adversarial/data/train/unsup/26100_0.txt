So after going to this office for 6months I am so happy to be moving and finding a new doctor. This office is so disorganized and just unprofessional. I have an auto-immune disease which requires monthly blood tests and daily meds. They have misplaced blood work which then I had to have redo and even when my RX refills were up on my daily meds I called them to simply have them call back in more refills they did not have my meds on file and didn't even know what I was taking even though the doctor there prescribed them to me! Nice doctor but obviously should not have a private practice seeing she can't manage it!
