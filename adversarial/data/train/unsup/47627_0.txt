I love Postino and visit the Central location almost weekly.  The food and service here is on par with the other locations.  The crowd is considerably older than the other Postinos; as other reviews have mentioned it appears to be a location very suited for a 55s up demographic.  Probably one of the reasons the walls are decorated with nude pictures from Playboy....everything old is new again?
