Had our Valentine's-Day-a-day-early-dinner here on Friday, February 13th.  Very nice overall, and a special building like Grand Concourse is just the kind of place for a special meal.\n\nThe crowd favorite \"dynamite scallops\" appetizer--overrated, in my opinion.  I'd wanted the brie with warm apples to start and was bummed the server's explanation of the scallops won over my husband.  Good but nothing special, essentially little scallops served in a tasty sauce in the shell for presentation.\n\nFor an entree my guy ordered one of the Valentine Specials, a medley of various seafood, and liked it.  I ordered a salmon entrée--salmon is one of my favorite things to eat, so I was pumped that during our dining there happened to be 3 salmon entrees available--and ordered the fish medium-rare, as I always do.  Was so disappointed when my fish arrived medium-well and lacking flavor.  In addition to the salmon SNAFU, there was another component of my plate that could have been better:  some of the brussel sprouts in the otherwise solid crab-brussel-potato hash side were super hard, basically raw.\n\nOne of the best aspects of our meal, other than the pretty setting and the very professional service, was the complimentary stuff--bread, doughy poppy seed rolls, butter, and salmon pate.  I thought the poppy seed rolls and salmon pate were to die for!  Husband ordered the lobster bisque, and we had a blast dipping the breads in the soup.  Delicious.\n\nA very nice meal, one that probably would have been 5 stars had the execution of the salmon been better.  I thought the entrée prices were very reasonable.\n\nI opted not to take food photos.  Camera flashes wouldn't have jived with the mood, and we had dining neighbors on either side.\n\nOne more thing:  we hit up Gandy Dancer's Happy Hour for $5 glasses of wine--there are other drink and food Happy Hour specials too--just before our dinner reservations.  Highly recommended.
