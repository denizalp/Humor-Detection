Great customer service from both Hostess\/Waitress: Meyung and Sushi Chef: Xingh.\nBeautiful atmosphere. Pricey - had 15 piece sashimi and the portion\/slices are small and cut thin.  I posted a picture, but deceiving since there is a huge pile of daikon underneath. Yummy items. I'll be back for sure! :)
