Hello Robyn!!!! \nWhat an amazing staff!!! I was so excited to get a fountain for our backyard but was really anxious on how to transport it from their store back to our home out here all the way in aliante area!! \nI was so ecstatic when Robyn said,\n \"Your fountain will include delivery and installation you don't have to worry a thing!!\" \nThey delivered the fountain on time with really friendly staff and made sure everything turned out great and working good before they left.. \nI will surely recommend this place to all my friends!!
