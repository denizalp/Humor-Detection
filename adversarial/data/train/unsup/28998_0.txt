We had been here for our anniversary back in February and really enjoyed the place. We were told about a great Monday night special for two when we were there and we decided to try it. We called the night before to verify the special was still going on and then proceeded to drive up to Scottsdale for dinner.  We had a waiter who it was his first Monday working and when we went to order told us that wasn't the deal of a salad and entree for each of us plus dessert plus a bottle of wine. We were wondering what was going on and were led on . The manager finally came out and apologized for the error.  The food was delicious and what a great deal for $50. For the two of us. We will be back again and not just on a Monday.
