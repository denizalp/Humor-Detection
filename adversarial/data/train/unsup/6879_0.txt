It's a dive... nothing special. Usually bad music on the jukebox, some dudes yelling about a ball someone on TV is throwing, pool tables, a cheap bartender... the usual. It get's really interesting during the day... There is an empty \"Yarn Shop\" next door where the craziest most drugged out lunatics come in and out and pace back and forth outside the establishments in this strip mall... I would say, it's probably not safe at all. Also, last time  a tranny hooker and her Pimp hung  outside the bar for what reason... I don't want to know.
