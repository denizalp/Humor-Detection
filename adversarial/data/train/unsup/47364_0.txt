This Staples store on happy Valley Road has the worst and I have to express again The worst customer service in their printing department. This is not the first time this is not the second this is not even the third they're always so busy talking about ridiculous sidebar conversations I will you ask for help they act as if the customer is a hindrance for them For their non-work related conversations! I cannot stand lazy individuals who could not even say let me print one piece of paper I had her stay in there for four minutes and then finally see excuse me can you help me. They know who they are the morning shift and they are lousy representation of Staples because all the staples but I've got to they act with professionalism
