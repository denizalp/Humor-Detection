I wish I could give 0 stars. This filthy dump of a gym is the worst place I've ever had the misfortune of stepping into. From the old, ripped, smelly equipment to the absolute lack of cleaning supplies ( seriously - I looked. Not one spray bottle or paper towel station ) to the UTTER disrespect of the employees, this place is to be avoided at ALL costs. I signed up for a 15 month pass for 100$ thinking hey, how bad could it be? Only to quit during my first and only workout. Fortunately, I was wise enough to video-record my attempt to cancel my membership, only to be berated for 7 minutes ( seriously, it's all recorded, unbeknownst to them. ) After all was said and done, I was promised a check in the mail within 10 days. One month later, I've still yet to be refunded. Today, I had enough and called them and told them that I would be posting this (100% truthful ) review unless they made an effort to refund me, rather\n than telling me to \"call back tomorrow\" for 3 straight weeks. The employee speaking with me told me he would \"call the police for defamation (wtf!? Would it be \"defamation\"if I posted a video of excellent customer service? NO! Me posting a video of you treating your customers like s*** is not defamation! ) And to \"do whatever the f*** I like.\" I told him that I had recorded the entire convo and would be making as big a deal as I could with it. FINALLY he called me back after hanging up on me three times and told me I could pick up my refund this Friday for the full amount less 15$ ( and that they wouldn't be sending it in the mail, too-bad, come pick it up Friday.) I'll happily edit this Friday with an update to the situation, until then avoid this dump like the plague. Thanks for listening.
