I was with a friend and she insisted that we stop because she wanted a cherry pie. So it's around 3:00pm and we drive through the drive through. The staff is apathetic and they take an order for a cherry pie. They gave no receipt and ask us to pull ahead and park while they make the pie. So we sit there for about 20min talking and when there is a lowell in the conversation we realize how long we had been sitting there. We both walked in and immediately got \"attitude\". First they argued we never placed an ordered. I pointed the girl that took my order and she with deer in headlights look agreed that I had been through the drive through. Finally, they gave us a pie. We got out to the car and my friend took a bit of the pie and low and behold it was strawberry cream. She insisted we go back in and have them make this right. Well, even after saying \"cherry pie\" from the originally order on we find out they don't have cherry and more just strawberry cream.\nMoral of the story is this is what we get for stopping a McD's. This company makes crap food. The have no respect for their employees or customers on profits. They even add Wood Pulp to their food. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.slate.com\/blogs\/browbeat\/2014\/07\/02\/_wood_pulp_in_burgers_it_s_just_cellulose_and_that_s_nothing_to_worry_about.html\n\nTo top this off, I stopped a while back with the same girl and she was insisting on a milkshake that time. She is cute and charming and I took her through the drive through and got her mike shake. This time the service was adequate. My friend ordered a large vanilla share and she slurped down half of it and had put the cup in the cup holder in the door of my car. fast forward a week later and I'm cleaning out my car and find the cup. I pick it up to through it out and it was heavy as in half full. I shook it and little and it was not a liquid as I had expected (as in melted cream) it was still the consistency of a milkshake but it was in my 80+ degree car! I opened the lid and it was still thick like a shake well above room temp. WTF! Clearly frank'n food. I wish my friend would not eat this crap. Who knows what this is make of, pink slime, mechanically separated chicken, animal butt glands, bugs.\n\nhttp:\/\/newswatch.nationalgeographic.com\/2013\/10\/01\/beaver-butts-emit-goo-used-for-vanilla-flavoring\/\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pink_slime\n\nhttp:\/\/www.livescience.com\/36292-red-food-dye-bugs-cochineal-carmine.html\n\nhttp:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/rumors\/m\/msm.htm\n\nhttp:\/\/www.rodalenews.com\/pink-slime\n\nThe truth is out there
