Came here with my parents, including Velma S. Frankly, I was surprised to find food of this quality in Calgary. I've eaten at many similar-priced restaurants here (Il Sogno, River Cafe, Muse, Catch, Belgo), and all have been good, but Capo is just a step above. \n\nWe started with a dish that wasn't on the menu but was highly recommended by our waiter. I don't remember it well enough to describe accurately, but it was amazing - so the moral of the story is to trust your waiter here. Otherwise I had ricotta gnocci with lobster and black truffle oil, as well as a trilogy of meats (lamb, veal, and pork belly). The veal was accompanied by a tuna aioli - which was interesting because of how well the flavors blended, but was ultimately the weak point of the menu (it was merely great). I tasted some of Velma S' scallops, and I knew within three seconds they were the best scallops I had ever had.\n\nI'm a little surprised they don't offer a tasting menu (we didn't ask, maybe they do if you ask), and I didn't feel totally comfortable with the organization of the menu. I think if they were to incorporate a menu style similar to Cyrus (a restaurant in Healdsburg) they could pull it off successfully while allowing a diner to try more of their dishes. But who knows, whatever is allowing them to produce food of the quality they currently are probably shouldn't be changed.
