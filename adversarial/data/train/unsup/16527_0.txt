Went in today to order a sausage egg and cheese biscuit only to find out they are all out of biscuits...smh? Its not like I could of had it any other way since most of their breakfast items are on biscuits.  \n\nIt's like going to a pizza joint only to be told, \"sorry we're all out of dough\"! \n\nSuch a disappointment. Get your inventory straight Carl's Jr.!!!
