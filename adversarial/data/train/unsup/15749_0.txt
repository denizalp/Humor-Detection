I do not seem to share the same enthusiasm as a lot of these reviews but I guess we all have different experiences.  I will break my experience down simply.\n\nPROS:\n- Beautiful Casino.\n- Surrender and XS look like they would be a great place to shake your tailfeather.\n- I definitely liked their pools and cabanas.\n\nCONS:\n- I upgraded for an additional 50 per night.  Total rip...there was no special tower pool and the rooms were the exact same.\n- Surrender's thumping base could be heard til the wee hours of the morning.\n- Customer Service was not up to par and people didn't really seem to care if you were unhappy with the service they were giving you.  You think this would be the opposite since Vegas is hurting so much for business.\n\nI will definitely be back to check out the Clubs but not as a guest.
