I called on a Wednesday and was able to get an appointment for that Saturday for partial highlights and a haircut.  This was my first time at this salon, which was recommended by my roommate, and I loved my experience there! Ashley did a great job with the highlights (she used three tones, so it looked very natural) and the cut left my hair looking healthy and very stylish.  My roommate told me they always give great head massages with the hair wash, and I was not let down!  They have five levels of stylists, with 5 being the highest (and prices go up accordingly). Ashley is a 2 and did such a great job. Very satisfied with my experience there. It's also in a cool old house and everyone who works there was super friendly.  Check it out the next time you need a good cut and\/or highlights!
