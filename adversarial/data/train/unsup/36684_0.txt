The facility was so clean I was very impressed. Definitely an amazing class tho room was  warm and comfortable. I joined the Yin Yoga class, she advised me this was a very good class for relaxation and perfect for before bed, boy was she spot ok! I dozed off a couple times. Emily is an amazing instructor so very helpful. Will definitely be returning!!
