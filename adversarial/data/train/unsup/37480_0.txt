I tried this place today with high hopes. I usually keep things to myself when it comes to issues. I just will never go back. \nI ordered the first item on the menu. Two eggs over medium, potatoes with ham and a muffin. I later added coffee and tried the coffee and nearly choked. It had an after taste that stuck in the back of my throat. I had added the non dairy creamer into the coffee and perhaps something was wrong with it. I sent the coffee back. (Out of character for me) I am not a coffee snob. I have always been able to choke down any coffee to satisfy my addiction. I drank down my water to clear my throat, but it never cleared. I ate my runny not medium eggs and ham, but left the potatoes because they were seasoned heavily. I never received the muffin until I caught the waitress and she apologized. She brought two in a box as a take out since my meal was finished. Go Figure! She was pleasant, but did not check on us after someone else delivered the food. I could not wait to pay my bill and leave.\nI raced home only to get sick as soon as I arrived. I wish I knew what triggered my sickness. Perhaps the coffee creamer? I hope it was only me today. Not a good experience!\n\nI just added a star because the muffins were good.
