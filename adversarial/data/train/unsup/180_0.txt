Another place for cheap eats after 10pm..Reverse Happy Hour here means ask for the lunch menu and all the items listed are no higher than $7.50! It's also good to go with someone who can speak Chinese (Tony T.) You always get better service.\n\nWe started off with some Hot and Sour Soup and followed with Salt and Pepper Shrimp, Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles, Beef Chow Fun, and Pork Spareribs.\nOur party of five devoured everything in no time, thanks to the workout session at Shine Alternative fitness a few hours earlier. Each dish had its own distinct flavor and was very delicious!\n\n All the plates were empty, but all that was left on our lazy susan was a pot of about 750 to 1000 grains of rice which would be very shameful to waste, so we decided to order an Eggplant Hot Pot with salted fish which was also delicious, and we cleaned up leaving no survivors behind.\n\nTotal damage? $40.....a great choice for cheap late night eats, and if you're in Chinatown deciding where you wanna get your grub on....ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(215\/365) \"Lunch Specials After 10pm\"
