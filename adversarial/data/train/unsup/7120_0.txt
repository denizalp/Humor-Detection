The place, stunning. The doors on the ceiling, the wood work, the taxidermy, the lighting, the piano...no detail was left out of the design of this speak-easy. One truly felt they were in a secret temple devoted to the fine act of cocktails during our country's darkest days....prohibition. \n\nThe staff, so nice. The hostess was perky and kind. The bartender had one of the most beautiful beards I've ever seen, and I'm from Portland OR. \nHis knowledge of the craft was top notch, making a balanced drink with the spirit of my choice. \n\nSo why the one star? I'm so glad you asked. \nThe owner of the place came in. He seemed pleasant enough. He was affable and was genuinely pleased that we four had found ourselves in his little back bar. So pleased he was that he offered to buy us for a round of drinks on him.\n\nThen he thanked us once again, shook our hands and left...neglecting to tell the bartender that he had bought us a round. I was on the hook for drinks I didn't really need or want. Thanks a lot asshole.
