I went to this school and managed to learn next to nothing. God, where do I begin? My classes always seemed to be at 7am, making them impossible to make half the time. I had literally the worst English 102 teacher (Ms. Landry or something) who was just out to fail me. The night I got my first MIC was an absolute nightmare. He confiscated my backpack full of nattys but managed to overlook the coke in the front pouch ;). I swear the cops on campus are bringing in so much revenue off of underage drinkers. Oh and the Dutch bros on campus is so crowded, you're sure to be late to your class if you require coffee like me. The mill scene is ok but I tell you, I'm not going to miss it. Dropping out to work at my dad's towing company has turned out to be the best decision of my life
