CPK is one of the few chain restaurants that I LOVE. I love their veggie sandwich, spring mix salad, roasted veggie sandwich, tequila fettucine, the broccoli sun-dried tomato fusili. During my trip to vegas, we decided to go to CPK to get some lunch. \n\nWhat I find odd is that no matter what CPK I go to, the service always seems to suck. Even the CPK I always go to at home, the service sucks! I am just surprised since I know people who work at CPK and I know how strict and intense their training is when people are hired. Regardless, I continue to return because I love the food.\n\nWhile we were at this location, the service was just blah and SO SLOW. the restaurant was empty, but it took forever to get our food. On top of that, they didn't have the AC on and it was so hot and stuffy in the restaurant that everyone I ate with was uncomfortable and sneezing. After we complained, they turned the AC on and it got much better. I was just really surprised no one else in the restaurant complained. But anyone who works at the restaurant should know that the AC should be on in a restaurant. I knew it was off cause once we complained, I felt the AC blowing on me. *End of rant*
