Celebrated my friends birthday on Saturday.  Battista's is a favorite of hers and rightfully so.   We had reservations and they were ready for us and seated us as soon as our party was there.  All I can say is the wine was flowin (free btw-coplimentary with your dinner) the bread kept comin and service was great!  The bread is drenched in butter...not good for the cholesterol but pretty darn good.  My bf and I ordered ziti with meatballs and pink sauce.  Pink sauce isn't on the menu but they said they would do it for us.  It was pretty average.  I've definitely had better.  We also ordered sausage and peppers and the bf loved that.  From the looks of everyone elses orders it was a wide variety of selections and I didnt hear any complaints and there were alot of clean plates.\n\nI've been here several times and we definitely don't come for the food...it is pretty average...mainly for the the ambiance and the one of a kind experience.  Gordie, the accordion player, is such a pleasant addition to the experience as he gifts us with his music and witty songs.  It is a good place to celebrate special days with a group or even for date night.\n\nThe place is a Las Vegas staple amongst the locals and vacationers.\nIt is all about the simple things:  Gordie, the decor\/ambiance, the menu on the wall, the complimentary wine, even the door to the restaurant that looks kinda like a barrel when you come through the front door.  Sometime simple is best. ;)
