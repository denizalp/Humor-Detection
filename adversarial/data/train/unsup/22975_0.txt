Like all Cambodians, we are all donut and pastry experts. The dough was definitely done right so the pastries were amazing to say the least. I had their spinach croissant and it was delice-cious ;) Ate it so fast I forgot to instagram the pic #fattieproblems #followforfollow @chhapaya. Also tried their chocolate croissant and it was bomb.com. \n\nNow the downside... Their macaroons weren't my favorite but I haven't had any good macaroons in AZ so I guess it's on par with other bakeries. The black coffee was lackluster. Although better than the coffee we have in our breakroom, I think the extra walk to cartel will be a better idea if you're coffee fanatic like I am. \n\nBe sure to call an ambulance for the ambiance because the decor was killer. It's good to see restaurants take pride in the small details.  Goes to show how much respect they have for the craft.\n\nOverall I give this place 5 stars because I came for the croissants and they delivered on my expectations.  Service was great and the ambiance was a nice bonus. Only take away I have is that with the thousands of Chase employees that are a walking distance away, having a great coffee selection will probably be the most profitable source of revenue if done right.
