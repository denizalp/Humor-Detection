I decided to try their popular Oxtail Pho which is a one-size Large bowl for $13. Wait time was +15min which is unusually long. It has daikon, meatballs, 5x oxtails, and side order of herbs + bean sprouts as toppings.\n\n   The menu is fairly simple in terms of  description, and is very lacking in photos. Back-side of menu has pics of elements of pho but it is for illustration only.
