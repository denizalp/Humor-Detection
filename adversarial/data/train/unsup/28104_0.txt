So impressed with the Nook! Booked a reservation here for my birthday and got great hospitality and food. Ambiance was perfect for a night out. Even got a visit from the bar manager who explained the origins and plant derivations in their tequilas as well as tasted a few samples. Only thing short of giving 5 stars was the food. The bruschetta, which came highly recommended btw, was cold and the bread wasn't toasted as much as I'd prefer. Also, the price for 4 small pieces seemed a bit steep to me ($16). The pizza was tasty but not the best. Their butter cake dessert was delicious, however and my friends enjoyed their salads. Overall, would definitely return!
