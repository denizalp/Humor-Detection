We went to this location on Mother's day at 1:30pm.\nWhat a horrible experience. Packed, lines for the buffet were 30mins+ because they seated people at specific times so intake seating was all at the same time. I would prefer Mandarin as opposed to this establishment. \nHorrid planned seating times but clever money saving. Had I not been there for another person's special occasion I would have left within seconds of entering the door. \nFood was disappointing, nothing stood out or was vaguely appetizing. After 1 partial plate of sushi and hot foods I opted to save myself any further annoyance and skip the rest. The desserts were enjoyed by those with me but once more it's was nothing outstanding.\nAt $32.50 a person, this was certainly NOT worth it.
