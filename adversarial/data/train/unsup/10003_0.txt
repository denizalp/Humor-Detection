4.5 ! I know my dog would rate it 5 stars. It's a great place for your dog to socialize w\/ other doggies. Honestly, I had no idea this place existed until a lady at a scrapbooking crop told me about it. I had to check it out since I pass by so often !\n\nDuring the day, it seems to be less busy as I was told by a dog walker who was there with 7 or so beautiful dogs. It seems, the place is busier in the evening & weekends (naturally). Apparently the rougher dogs come in the evening. So those w\/ smaller breeds (& small children) should probably have a watchful eye. \n\nThere are at least two gates when you enter. Make sure you close it in case a little furry friend runs out. The area is quite large. It's not covered w\/ grass but with wood chips, which is understandable to help with maintenance costs. There was a section for agility, large spacious area for running around. Even a shaded area w\/ picnic tables for us dog owners. I saw a mailbox w\/ membership information but when I opened the mailbox, it was only full of empty envelopes. It's maintained well & has lots of water for your furry friends & even poop bags in case you forgot yours. \n\nCan't wait to bring my dog here again! Hailey says 5 stars! So happy there's another off leash area!!
