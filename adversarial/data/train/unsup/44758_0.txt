Hands down Celebrity Tux and Tail will be my go to for any wedding, formal dinner, balls or even an job interview. I was referred to Larry from a co worker for my wedding and he delivered BEYOND expectation. Going with Celebrity was a VIP\/ Concierge experience from the consultation to the ceremony. The variety of styles and suit cuts was the icing on the cake. As we all know things never go as planned on the special day and we weren't immuned neither. My groomsmen and ring bearer had a wardrobe malfunction and Larry was a call away and came down to Gilbert on a Sunday afternoon to make sure everything was fixed. #5StarService. Thank you Larry and your team for make our wedding special.
