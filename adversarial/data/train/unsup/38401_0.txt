I literally cannot say enough good things about this place and how excited I am to have happened upon it. \n\nLavender cappuccino ohhhh my god. Perfect mix of sweet and coffee and floral deliciousness. This alone gets the 5 stars.\n\nGot the living burrito with a side of kale Caesar. So. The living burrito. Literally will make you forget you're eating straight veggies disguised as a burrito. Such good flavors and the lettuce wrap just makes it a million times better. The salsa on the side is a great spice to add. \n\nKale Caesar has great flavor, perfect side for when you just wanna add some greens in there. \n\nSo many things to come back and try because I am so into this menu!
