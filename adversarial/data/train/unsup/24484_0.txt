Another one of the terrific free shows that are offered along the Las Vegas strip.\n\nGottta love a FREE show - especially after dropping some serious coin at one of the casinos. \n\nI have seen this show many times and it always seems very cool to me. Maybe because each time in my mind I can hear Beavis and Butthead screaming out \"Fire! Fire! Heh-heh-heh!\"\n\nThe actual volcano special effects and music had been reinvented a few years ago. The erupting Volcano was the first free spectacle show on the strip back in 1989 and set the template for others to follow. Now, this revamped show has new audio\/visual with never-before-seen fire effects and an exclusive soundtrack composed by Grateful Dead drummer and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member Mickey Hart, and Indian tabla virtuoso Zakir Hussain.\n\nFire bombs are shot into the air and eruptions of lava flow down the mountain's fissures as more flames cover the volcano. The lagoon is covered with flames and as the eruption ignites to the pulsating music you can feel the heat touching your skin. \n\nCheesy good fun for people of all ages. You can get a spot along the railings or even see it from across the street - and still feel the heat from the flames!\n\n\nEruption Schedule:\n\nBegins at 5:00 p.m. and runs every hour on the hour until 11:00 p.m. (nightly)
