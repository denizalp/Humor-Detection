You know, it's a Domino's. The Domino's app would have you believe that they don't deliver to my place, but this one on St Hubert totally does, quickly, predictably Domino's-y in term of pepperoni and cheese and flavour and stuff. It's true that some Domino's are truly bad, and this is not one of those. The folks who work the phone and drive the delivery are easy going and friendly and the pizza comes well assembled and well cooked. Nevertheless. It's just Domino's.
