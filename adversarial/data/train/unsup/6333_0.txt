This is a great location for Filiberto's food.  If you want fresh, large portions, and have a craving for Mexican food this is your destination.  We have ordered several times for lunch for work.  We call in advance and place a to-go order which in our case could be 20 breakfast burritos.  The best part is that when everyone at work gets one of the breakfast burritos or Carne Asada burritos everyone is happy.  Nothing like a happy workplace and a satisfying meal.  \n\nThe breakfast burrito has lots of egg, green onions mixed in, ham, pico, bacon, and cheese.  Be ready that bacon is real bacon with fat also, so if you hate fat skip the bacon.  If you love bacon that fat adds a nice flavor to the burrito.  They also give you green and red sauce, but both are mild to no heat.  \n\nI also enjoy the Carne Asada burrito and be prepared it is a large burrito.  Most cannot finish it in one sitting.  I pride myself on doing so and then fall into a work coma after wards :)\n\n\nThey serve breakfast all day I highly suggest a breakfast burrito to fill a really empty belly.  And at $4 it really is a lot of food for the cash.  Enjoy.
