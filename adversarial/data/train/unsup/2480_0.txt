Dined here on a Sunday when they 1st opened at 11am. I love Pei Wei and crave their Orange Peel Chicken and lettuce wraps, my 2 favorite dishes.\n\nRestaurant was clean, they just opened for the day.\n\nDecided to try the fried rice for the 1st time as I normally get brown rice.  It was horrible, so greasy and completely took any flavor away from the Orange Peel Chicken. Ewwww!!\n\nNothing to write about service or anything else as no one came around and gal taking order made the order quick and simple process. Nothing great about this location.  So disappointing for $10 and I left half the plate of food.
