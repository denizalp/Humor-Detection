I closed the account 3 months ago and they are harassing me and saying i owe them money which i do not. They add $8.33 monthly fee for just having the card and I told them I did not desire to pay that any more I was a good customer paid my bill on time and they treated me terribly and are nor trying to collect BS fees not even legitimate charges from a merchant. I would pay if the charge was legit but they are not and many calls to them they promise me they will take the fees off and close it and they stay away from this card it is FRAUDULENT and a terrorist organization. They call me over and over about fees after i closed the card that are baseless and they are useless because they are not easy to reach and they do nothing to resolve anything only lay on more fees and they are making a killing because you pay for the card, then you pay and annual fee, then you pay for a limit increase then after you close the account you pay for being a good customer go F yourself Credit One Bank you are criminal all the way I pray the LORD close you down and throw away the key. I have never been more irritated at the fact that being a on time payer they back door me and rip me off. They have zero integrity and fall short in customer service if they are friendly that is great however they dont do what they say they will remove the fees they just add on more and penalty fees of $25+ if you don't pay the stupid annual fee broken up in 12 payments of $8.33 it is so shady you should avoid it like the plague.
