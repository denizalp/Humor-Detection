World class heart surgery? Yes. Saving Robin Williams and countless foreign dignitaries? Sure. Cafeteria that rivals the finest bistros of the French riviera? Dunno, never been to France. This fiefdom of medicine is probably the only reason Cleveland hasn't been completely left for dead. I used to \"coordinate transportation\" there and other satellite clinics. That made for a fun day. Parking at the emergency room( because you can't park for free anywhere else) and winding oneself through a series of skyways and tunnels to get to a building two miles away was like playing human Mousetrap. Some of the newer wards' decor is very futuristic and conjures images of Kubrick' s \" 2001: a Bedpan Odyssey.\" All of the nurses are very friendly ( the same cannot be said of branches like Euclid, Huron or Hillcrest). Also, none of the doctors have names the average Ohioan can pronounce. The main lobby almost resembles the UN or an Atlantic city casino in it's opulence. \n\n Did this review turn out to be an outtake from architectural digest and not so much about medicine? Yeah, kinda. \n\nThe location smack dab in the middle of the little italy-CASE-University-museum area affords lots of fun activities after you learn you' re going to maybe die. If you suffer from minor aches and pains, you can walk two blocks down to Cedar rd and buy weed if you are so inclined.And I believe the Clinic Club Card is also valid at their Florida location. Two more transplants and I get a Cleveland Clinic hoodie!\n\nI have two minor gripes. The lack of immediate greenspace around the campus( the closest is the icky Rockefeller Park ). And saving Robin Williams.
