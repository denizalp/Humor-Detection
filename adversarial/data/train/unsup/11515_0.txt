Man, I love baseball. Sometimes going to a game can get expensive so I stick to the value menu. A buck fifty for a hot dog? I'll take five please.\n\nKettle corn, pretzels, nachos, and frozen yogurt helmet sundaes. At Chase Field they've got it all but bring some cash because a lot of the vendors are prehistoric and don't take plastic.\n\nDuring the 4th inning, I always head to the upper deck to get an autograph from the D-Backs mascot, Baxter. They say it's just for kids but he doesn't seem to mind.
