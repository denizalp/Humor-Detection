I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time and finally got the chance to try it today. We decided to use the drive thru based on the amount of time we had and didn't have to wait long at all which was surprising (we went around five in the afternoon). I decided to get the crispy chicken bowl, horchata, and some dulce empanadas. Unfortunately they were out of yuca, but I will return for those later. Food was fresh, well seasoned, and portion sizes were appropriate. The horchata was surprisingly good, some of the best I have had since being in Vegas. If you are looking for something new to try or just want some authentic latin food, give this place a try
