Very interesting experience!  My friend and I were there for a massage and facial and overall the service was nice.  The location is away from the strip but it's a short ride with Lyft!  So as we walk into the lounge after checking in, the decor is very old fashion Vegas!  You'll see pictures of Sinatra, Monroe and animal prints and stripes furniture.  The locker room is actually a unisex restroom\/shower room so that felt a bit awkward changing there.  But the staff were really nice and helpful.  Overall it's a good alternative if you want a treatment off the strip.
