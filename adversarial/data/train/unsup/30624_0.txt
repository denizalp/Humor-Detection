Most people don't know that there is also a dining area here in addition to their deli. I try to come back often, as they have the BEST fried chicken AND french fries. It may take about 20 minutes for them to prepare it and they do confirm, but it's worth the wait. This is what I call clean food as you can tell the oil is fresh and so is the chicken. It is so juicy and the crunchy coating is amazing. And the service is always very courteous and friendly.
