These guys have been great to work with.  Evaluating existing clothing to maximize what I already have, tailoring clothing that could be saved and helping rebuild a wardrobe with off the shelf clothing and custom tailored clothing as well.  This helps maximize where and how my money is spent.  The quality of the garnets are outstanding and the staff has always been a b=pleasure to work with.
