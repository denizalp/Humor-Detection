The view! Love to watch the boats on the lake-have to be seated in the deck. Why anyone eats inside is a mystery to me. This place is all about location-you do not come here for the food. The food is okay-not horrible-the salads are good. You come here to view the lake, people watch, and drink. \n\nAlways meet fun, talkative people. Very casual. Car Parking lot is good and the boat dock seems adequate. The kids like the ducks and turtles that hang around. They have pellet machines for a quarter to feed the rascals.
