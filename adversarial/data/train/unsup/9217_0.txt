I don't know much about cheese. I know I miss the government cheese my legless uncle shared with us back in the day, but I couldn't tell you the difference between a gouda and a gruyere - until I visited The Cheese Shop at the West Side Market. We mentioned to the uber friendly helper person that we wanted to do a cheese plate for dinner and he set us up! We sampled each of his recommendations and got advice on what to pair each cheese with - both wine and bread, fruits and nuts! We came home and feasted like fools, trying to remember the fancy words he used to describe the cheeses and could only manage \"this is awesome!\" (not a real cheese term)
