I enjoy pinball, and there is no shortage of it here in Portland.  However, we decided to go check out the Hall of Fame when we hit Vegas last week.  \n\nFinding the creepy warehouse like building with the plywood sign was an adventure in itself.  Not that it's hard to find or anything, but riding the bus off strip into the real Las Vegas is fun in my book.\n\nAnyway, the place was dark, no formal greetings (in fact I didn't really see anyone there that looked like they actually worked there which was kinda disconcerting but added to the weird and awesome vibe), and pretty much empty when we visited late on a Wednesday night.\n\nLots of games that I didn't know existed and that can't be found in Portland.  If you're into super retro games this is definitely your place, but I found it kind of lacking on games from the 80s which are my favorite.\n\nAll and all we had a blast, we kinda felt like we were in the arcade scene from Hobo with a Shotgun so that was most excellent.  Well, minus coke fueled violence and hobos with shotguns.....\n\nAnyway, check this place out!!
