I came here around 10:30 and the doors were closed. So I decided to walk to the window, just in case they can still help me with my order. I am in the stratosphere hotel across the street. Our server Raven, spoke to another vehicle in front of me saying I wasn't going to get my order standing in the drive thru. If I were an employee there I would have told the person standing there that we are not allowed to help people walking in the drive though as soon as I noticed. She needs to be talked to about that behavior period.
