YES PETLAND SELLS PUPPY MILL ANIMALS...Investigation video proof about Puppy Mill included in this review.\n\nIn 2005 I bought my dog from Petland.  I didn't know anything about Puppy Mills back then and didn't plan on even buying a dog when I entered this store back in 2005.  It was love at first sight. I just fell in love and bought my dog. I love her to pieces and wouldn't change a thing.  \n\nShe had kennel cough and an ear infection at her first vet appt. which we went to within the first 5 days of owning her (per Petland's Warranty at that time--you had to have a vet check-up with in 5 days of purchase.)  I didn't know she was from a Puppy Mill for the first few years I owned her.  I kept hearing stuff about Puppy Mills and Petland so I googled her Breeder.  What I discovered was actually shocking.\n\nBreeder: Linda Kleven\nUSDA # 41 A 0015\nFair View Kennels\n\nOn 6\/14\/2005 there is a video investigation of the Fair View Kennels in Minnesota where my dog was born.  A dogs pregnancy is about 63 days.  My dog was born 8\/18\/2005 which is 65 days after the CAPS investigation and video took place.  There is a video online of the actual puppy mill so you can see for yourself that Petland does in fact do business with Puppy Mill Breeders.  You can see the conditions of this particular Breeder's operation which had 130 dogs at the time of the investigation.  My dog's parents lived at this terrible place.  \n\nLink to video from CAPS the Companion Animal Protection Society below:\nhttp:\/\/www.caps-web.org\/rescues\/item\/175-linda-and-craig-kleven-fair-view-kennels-2005  \n\nIf the link won't work just google.
