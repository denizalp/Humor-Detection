Recently had to sit through six days of software presentations at work, two days from each Supplier. Interesting albeit long days of technical jargon mixed with real world scenarios.  The upside was that each of the Suppliers provided lunch each day.  It's been said that the way to a mans heart is through his stomach and some of the Suppliers pulled out all of the stops.\n\nHonestly, my heart sank when I heard we were having pizza the last day.  We'd been treated to some really tasty food the previous five days and my mind now imagined having to choke down some Hut or Dominos.\n\nBoy was my world rocked!  I had heard about Spinatos but had never had it.  Welcome to the Top Five with a bullet!  ((Maybe top three). This pizza is absolutely some of the finest in Phoenix or anywhere for that matter (and Phoenix is becoming known for having some fo the best pizza in the country).\n\nI couldn't stop eating this addictive pizza!  My colleagues probably thought I hadn't eaten in weeks the way I kept going back to get more.  The sauce and hand-tossed crust were perfect together and the toppings were varied from the standard meats to a fantastic veggie with feta cheese. In the week since this meal, I've honestly had dreams abut this pizza-it's that good!\n\nI know pizza is highly personal but Spinatos is truly worth a shot if you love pizza.
