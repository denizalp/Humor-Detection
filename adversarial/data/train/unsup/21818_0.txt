I came to get a price for my LV wallet but they pass on it because they said something about the serial number too small they mentioned that if I have the receipt for it they could probably match the numbers and since I know the receipt of that wallet and another purse are actually in pawn with them I ask them to go and get it for me but I guess they just don't feel like Goin back and get it I don't know if is because is Saturday and they just don't want to give that Xtra help.they said that i needed it to pick up the purse in order to get location of it... what a bssh***. thank you to the redhead and curly Spanic girl managers on duty that day. ( oh by the way the black lady that was helping me question why I don't take the wallet to the pawnshop I work?) Like really!! Maybe because sometimes I'm lucky and find good help with maxpawn!!
