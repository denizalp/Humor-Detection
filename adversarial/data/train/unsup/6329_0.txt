I gatta say the Ruben here is really good! Stacked and piled high with shaved corned beef, on a bed of sauerkraut, lightly dressed in Thousands Island, all sandwiched between two slices of grilled, fragrant, and flavorful marble rye bread. Slices of swiss cheese were melted on both side of the bread, a plus! \n\nIt comes with a side, feeling a little heavy,  I opted with the side salad resulting in an additional $2.75.\n\nThe Ruben was $10.25, so $13 for lunch before tip may seem a bit much. However, if you get a regular side is a worthwhile lunch.
