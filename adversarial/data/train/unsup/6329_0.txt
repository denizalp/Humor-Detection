Gap is a decent place kid kids clothes. Lots of options to choose from, and the deals are good possibly? It's hard to know because the signage is usually advertising sales but some things are in the wrong pile and you don't know if the discount is already applied to the listed price or something else. \n\nThis location had poor service as well. I was carrying around a 20 month old who was behaving perfectly but for some reason I was getting the stank eye from the employee. Admittedly I'm no male model, but also not the elephant man- so not sure what that was about.
