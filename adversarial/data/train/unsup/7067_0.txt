If brisket is your first menu item, and the most expensive, I will drive 30 miles out of my way to give you a try. The brisket wasn't their best item on the menu, but I'd keep Bell's in mind if I were on this side of town again.\n\nMenu features the choice of a meat plate (8oz with two sides, house-made pickles, and Texas toast) or a sandwich, and you can add on additional meats (~4oz?), as they don't have multi-meat combo plates. Sides of mac and greens were just okay.\n\nPORK BELLY: The highlight. Was surprised to see it on the menu, but it ended up being the best thing. Tender, falling apart, juicy, and full of flavor. Wish I'd just ordered this!\nBRISKET: Close, but no cigar. Nicely seasoned with visible smoke ring, but the meat itself was dry and hard in spots. I suspect this is because it wasn't all that fresh, being that they're new and not quite so busy yet. I'd give this another try on a future visit.\nPULLED PORK: No. This was the oddest meat in the meal, cut into odd pieces and drowning in sauce, portion also seemed smaller than the others. Meat was very tender but sauce was overly sweet, did not care for this at all.\nRIBS: Got the St. Louis style, add-on. They're large and meaty, but BF found them a bit too fatty for his liking. I'd get them again, but kind of wish they came sauced, as the cups provided for takeout make it an odd fit for dipping the bone without making a mess. Pleasantly surprised with these!\n\nDESSERTS. I'm not big on desserts, but I couldn't resist the cute jar presentation! Opted for the cashier's favorite, the S'mores. The graham cracker crust bits were on the clumpy side, but the rich, chocolately mousse tasted just like hot chocolate and the browned marshmallow fluff on top was nicely subtle.\n\nService was welcoming and friendly, interior is clean and modern with country d√©cor touches- love the strands of lights above the dining room! Rounding up for potential, will come back as they get settled in and work out the kinks.
