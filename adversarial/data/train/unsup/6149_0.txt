It was an unusually calm and quiet night in Vegas, but there was a party going on in flavortown! OK, so I'm not much of a Guy Fieri fan, but Hubert Keller... that's another story. Started out with amazing onion soup shooters... FANTASTIC! In fact - the entire dinner was great (duck terrine, grilled octopus, fleur burger with foie & truffles), but the beginning (that onion veloute! OH MY...) and ending with Chef Keller's famous Gran Marnier souffle... magnifique!
