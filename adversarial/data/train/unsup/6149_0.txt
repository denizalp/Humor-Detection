IcePics has some of the best drink specials in town, not to mention the strongest. I'm not kidding, bring a DD. The bartender on Tuesday nights makes me what he calls a Patron Cosmo. OMG, yuuuuuumerz! After three of those you'll be transported to a world where everything is wonderful and hope abounds ;)\n\nThere still are nights to avoid\/support depending on the company and your dis\/likes\n\nKaraoke nights are best if you wanna hang with your straight friends.\nUnderwear night, best if you're a voyeur and\/or exhibitionist\nStripper nights best for those of you who like to pay for NSA or appreciate the skin of a stranger.\n\nI still go here almost every week with friends for drinks and new episodes of Glee. Good times, noodle salad (if you get that reference then you are super cool and we should be friends!)
