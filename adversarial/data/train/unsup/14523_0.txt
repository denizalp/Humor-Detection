With a name like, \"The Pink Pony,\" I was expecting a strip club.  I was pretty sure my parents and their friends wouldn't take me to see naked ladies dancing, but I couldn't help but wonder if they were undergoing some sort of dementia.  Once we arrived to the restaurant, I still wasn't convinced.  Cut outs of pink ponies adorned the exterior.  \n\nThank goodness, my parents hadn't lost their minds:  the Pink Pony was indeed a restaurant.  This was one of those old-style steak and dry martini joints, apparently frequented by the local baseball teams. Melba Toast and plastic packaged bread sticks rested in a basket on our table.  I wondered how long they had been there.\n\nThe menu was fairly straight forward:  a few different types of steaks and some seafood items, mostly fried.  I opted for the Pink Pony Special:  top sirloin and my choice of a potato and salad.  \n\nMy steak was served as I ordered it, medium rare.  The salad was nondescript and the potato came with a tiny ramekin of sour cream only.   The interesting items on my plate were the deep fried onions and zucchini.  \n\nThe food wasn't terribly exciting or tasty, but I liked this place.  It actually had personality in a town that has been taken over by large shopping malls and chain restaurants.  It boldly declares its character without any kind of shame.  I think that's pretty cool.
