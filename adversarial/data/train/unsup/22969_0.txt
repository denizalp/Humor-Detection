I freaking love Ikea. It's super far from where I live which is probably a good thing because I would spend all my money here. I buy all my furniture from here and nearly all my home accessories. \n\nYou walk in and theres a winding showroom. It has rooms filled with products as if it was really someone's living room or kitchen, and then it shows you all the sofas etc they have to offer all bunched together. Hmm.. this is hard to describe! When you finish walking through the upstairs portion, they have a cafe. I highly recommend this cafe for a snack!! The veggie balls are awesome and so are they seasonal veggies and mac n cheese! Try not to get too full because the bottom floor are the textiles, lamps, and accessories. \n\nNot only is the stuff fun and reliable, it is CHEAP my friends!!! It spoils me to come here and I jump at an opportunity to come back.
