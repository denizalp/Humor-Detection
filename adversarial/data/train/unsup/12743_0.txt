If you enjoy Oktoberfest everyday, this would be one place you need to go for that.\n\nThanks to our awesome tour guide Susan R., she introduced us to this place when we vacationed here in Vegas at the holidays. I think we asked what unique part of Vegas in that we the tourists don't know about. This was one of the place she suggested that was slightly off the strip.\n\nTo the drivers, you will need to be a little bit more careful as one portion of the street is an one way street in front of the parking lot. There are no issues with parking at this facility, but will have some anger management issues as the space to back up is very narrow. Avoid these clowns with some patience when you are trying to back out.\n\nOn a cool Monday night, it was very festive as we were seeing live performances of a cool Oktoberfest band dancing and singing. Like all German beerfest, they seemed to like long tables with picnic bench seats as a way to dine. The restaurant like a big cafeteria with benches in a conference hall. They have a very high ceiling where I can imagine a circus performing here on an off day.\n\nTo start off, we have one of their big pretzel special we had to try according to our waiter. He suggested this as they don't have this special often. The pretzel was huge and the three of us almost didn't finished that off. Lovely soft tender thing with the right dip tasted better than your Auntie Anne's soft pretzel.\n\nI think I ordered the Nrnberger Rostbratwrstl which was a three roasted Pork Sausages with sauerkraut and Mashed Potatoes  Believe me when I say that with a mug of beer, this thing would totally blew you away. These delicious suckas are roasted to succulent tease that can melt in your tongue.\n\nOf course I had to weasel out by ordering root beer as I was already plastered earlier in the day with plenty of vodka drinks at the casinos.\n\nOh, please don't be a wuss by ordering burgers. You came all the way to this place and you knew this is a German sausage house and yet you still want to order burgers? Shame on you!\n\nFor the veggie lovers out there, they don't want to leave you out because they offering soups and salads to keep you from your meat eating significant others enjoying some good food. They want to make sure everybody is happy here.\n\nThe place is so happening, they decided that restaurant was not good enough so they add in a gift shop right in front of the entrance. Very clever of them to extract more money from you on the way out.\n\nA real fun time that is better than Medieval Times or a Ninja sake tasting at a wine garden. Give this place so love as they also have a kids menu to bring your whole family to enjoy this unique experience.\n\nIt may not be the same beerfest as in Germany, but it come very close with their offerings and performances. The only thing I wish they had was having Helga bring the beers to us. \n\nOh that would have been so sweet!\n\nQuality: *****\nDecor: ****\nService:****\nAmenity: ****\nAmbiance: ***
