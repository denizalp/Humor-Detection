Short weekend staycation on Dec 5-7. Our room was on the 6th floor facing some rooftop parking lot. View was less than ideal to some but it didn't bother me. You're in Las freakin Vegas!!!!!! You shouldn't be in your room often anyways so who cares about the view right? Our room was comp'd but when I checked the regular rates, it was around $209 per night. This was a busy weekend with the Rodeo and Cowboy\/Country Christmas and other conventions in town. Personally, I think the rate was NOT worth the quality\/size of the room. \n\nPOSITIVES:\n-Casino. Yes, it was on the small side but the slots were good to me, dealers were friendly, casino was modern, well-lit and absolutely did not reek of smoke. \n-Giada's. Separate review for this restaurant. Food\/restaurant was worth the \"hype.\"\n-Location. This is literally the center of The Strip. You are within walking distance to all major hotels.\n\nNEGATIVES:\n-Parking: I know previous reviews have mentioned that The Cromwell have its own separate self parking garage. But where is it!?!?! No visibly signs of it whatsosever. The front drive is confusing. We just valet the entire weekend but I still would like to have an option to self park in case I need to personally grab stuff out of the car.\n\n-Rooms. Although my Luxury Room (this is the most basic room) was clean....the walls were thin, room was dark (barely any lights) and the room was small!!!!! I know it's smaller than most Holiday Inns I've stayed at. Maybe like what one other review had mentioned: the oversized tacky furniture and huge headboard made the room feel even smaller. Boyfriend liked the room theme, but I didn't. To each their own. I suggest looking at the pictures before you decide.\n\n-Noise. Because of the thin walls, I could hear people chatting and running down the hallways. People weren't shouting or acting drunk either. They were talking normally but I could still hear their every word. \nNOTE: The Monorail passes through The Cromwell. I think they have actual stops at Ballys and maybe the Flamingo. Our hotel was between those two. So every 10-20 minutes, up until like 3am, we would hear The Monorail rumbling through. It's annoying if you are a light sleeper. It seriously sounded like a roller coaster. We heard the bass coming from Drai's Nightclub\/Afterhours but it was very faint. The Monorail was more painful to hear than Drai's bass. We checked out a night early because of this. Why suffer a Sunday night's sleep when we can go back to our quiet house 15 minutes from The Strip? \n\nWe will NOT be having anymore staycations here. Casino, restaurant, dayclub\/nightclub, yes. But rooms, no thank you.
