I heard some great things about this restaurant, so I went with a friend for his birthday celebration.  While the ambiance and the view were spectacular, this restaurant fell far below my expectations.\n\n#1. Fahrenheit, your vegan menu is pathetic and sad.  Vegans eat more than salads you know, so step your game up there.\n\n#2. I ordered from the vegan menu.  The first salad?  Full of pancetta.  They remade it and brought out a second one--cheese in it.  There was no communication between the server and the kitchen and I was THOROUGHLY disappointed.  The only bright spot was the lemongrass rice; I have to admit that was awesome.\n\nI won't be returning because my overall experience just was not good.
