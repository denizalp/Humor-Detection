Pump It Up is a kid's play area located in a non-descript industrial park off of Sunset Rd, close to Dean Martin Dr. It's basically a warehouse with different rooms filled with giant inflatable slides, obstacle courses, and moon-bounes.\n\nMy kid's friend had his birthday party here. About a dozen highly energetic kids (2-4 years old) were running around like crazy going up and down the slides and bouncing around. They first start you off with a  safety video then take you to the first room for 30 minutes or so. The room has a moon bounce, obstacle course that leads to a slide, and a basketball hoop.\n\nAfter that they take you to the second room for more of the same for another 30-60 minutes. That room has 2 different moon bounces and another slide. All the kids (and most of the adults) had a blast sliding and jumping around. Nothing beats the joy of seeing your two year old light up as he learns he can handle going down the slide all by himself and the screams of happiness he lets out as he flies down, gets up, and runs back up for another turn. \n\nWhen that's over they take you to the party room where they had tables set up for all the kids to eat with plates already set up with pizza, a juice box, cookies and grapes. No, the pizza isn't the greatest, but the kids didn't seem to care.\n\nThe staff, while friendly, didn't seem overly enthusiastic about being there. But, if you have to deal with rambunctious kids all day long I guess you can't blame them. The facility could use some touch ups. It felt and looked a little dingy with obvious wear and tear on the carpets, floors, and equipment. But, while it isn't the cleanest place around, it's still a fun place to take kids of all ages. I would highly recommend it for birthday parties if you have young kids.
