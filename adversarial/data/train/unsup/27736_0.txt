The food here is amazing! My friend and I had walked up and down the Strip and completely missed this place! We walked into a bar and asked the bartender what she recommended and she pointed us across the street to Odd Seoul. The food was SO YUMMY! It's a tapas style place, so you can order and share. I wish there had been a bit more description on the menu--I felt a little silly having to ask the server about items. That being said, the servers were very attentive--filled our water glasses, made sure we were happy.  In some ways they were more attentive than I'd like--I'd wanted to lick the plates clean but they kept clearing them before I could. My friend was glad I couldn't lick them! :)
