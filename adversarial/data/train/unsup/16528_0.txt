If you like sweet frozen lactose treats, there are two ways to get them.\n\nOne is to pack your bags and head for the Arctic circle, hoping to meet some big Eskimo tundra-beast named Nukka Nukka, latch onto one of her semi-frozen titties when her creepy Uncle Nanook isn't around, and go hog-shit wild. \n\nThe other is Sweet Republic.\nWhere you'll find lacto-centric creations designed for the Gods themselves. \nThe Food Network Gods that is. \n\nSweet Republic has created frozen desserts so sumptuous, they've actually been featured on the Food Network's \" My favorite thing to eat.\" \nAnd with good reason.\n\nThey use Madagascar vanilla in their cream, and caramel made from sugar crystals that were once Cinderella's tears. \n\nI'm not a Food Network God, but I do know a thing or two about frozen treats.\nAnd until you've had a tasty delight from Sweet Republic, (or one of Nukka Nukka's whale-ishly lactating hooters) you simply haven't lived.
