As dog parks go, this one probably needs a little work. \n\nFirst, it's massive. I think dogs tend to be more social in tighter spaces. Mine tend to wander if left with enough real estate. \n\nSecond, it's just dirty. The grass tends to be dead, or brown, there is dirt everywhere, it's just not a peaceful, beautiful environment like most dog parks I've visited. The lake lends itself to making the area much better than it would be without it, but it still lacks something. \n\nThere are many areas for dogs and it's hard to tell which one will be most suitable because it isn't uniform: small dogs here, big dogs there, mixed up, no one knows, crazy. \n\nIt's just not as nice as other ones, but people seem to love it. I think it's an excellent place for larger dogs that love water, it definitely is awesome to see them play. I just wish it were a nicer place for smaller dogs that don't like water, dirt or big dogs.
