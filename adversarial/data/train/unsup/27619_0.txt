Platter for 1 satisfied my hubby, he is so picky. The baked beans were some of the better beans we've had. The pickles were like grandma made.  The BBQ chicken & ribs were tasty. I liked the grilled pineapple side.  Our only negative comment would be we had to wait a while for server to bring more ice tea. They were very busy.  Generous portions
