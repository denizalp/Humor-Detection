Fast service. They use a tablet to order from the kitchen and a food runner will bring it out. \n\nLots apps and sides and meat options to choose from. Potato salad, japchae, kimchi, edamame, rice paper wraps, steamed egg, corn cheese....\n\nThey had a lot of different seasonings for the meat and dipping sauces to accompany the meal. \n\nReally good about changing the grill out and refills. \n\nLove that dessert is also included in all you can eat dinner. Was a perfect meal and left very satisfied.
