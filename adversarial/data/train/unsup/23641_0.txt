One of my favorite places, which is weird seeing that I hate looking in the mirror and have spent most of my life looking like I'm coming off an eight day bender. \n\nMost places I go in, drop a US Grant or two and come out looking like Gen Sherman on his way to Atlanta. Not here. I always get my money's worth and more. \n\nIt's a nice relaxed place where they're not trying to get you in and out of the chair quickly to run your card through the machine. And it's not a strip mall clip joint where you're afraid to ask any personal questions to the person cutting your hair, because you're afraid they'll tell you more than you want to know about their sordid backstory. I only make it in every few months, but if I had the time and my hair grew quick enough, I'd be there weekly. Hell, I'd be there daily.\n\nIt's a great place and you'll look good when you walk out. I go in looking like a losing lottery ticket and come out looking pretty damned good for goofy dumb dope. Better yet, I stay that way for at least a few weeks, so it ain't just the way they're combing it or funhouse mirrors or dirt on the front window distorting my view. \n\nCall them now. Get into the chair. You can thank me later.
