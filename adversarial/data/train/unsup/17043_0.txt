I'd have to say the best authentic food around the Coventry area for sushi and Malaysian food. The ingredients are fresh and you can actually taste it. I came here with a couple of friends before and haven't really written a review  until I went back recently and tried their Prawn Mee soup. \n\nThis was hella (excuse my North Cal slang) excellent. Even though it didn't come with prawns as the picture but it had the prawn taste to it. Plenty of shrimp and noodles, this hit the spot especially on a rainy day like yesterday. I came here with a friend and we also ordered their spider roll and it was plenty (they pack their food big here). My friend ordered their beef noodle stir fry which tasted great as well. Like other places I've tried, this was the best. The noodles weren't soggy and there was plenty of food for just the 2 of us. \n\nThe wait staff was friendly and attentive. The place was getting busy around dinner service around 6-8pm and I'm not sure what their hours are on Sunday but if a place still gets busy around 8, they are doing something right. The only downside of this is that parking is metered so make sure you bring plenty of quarters!
