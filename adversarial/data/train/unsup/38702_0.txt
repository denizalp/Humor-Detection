CHADA exceeded my expectations.  I totally enjoyed all the dishes we ordered (special spring rolls for the night, shrimp cake, grilled Cornish hen, pad he'd shitake and shimej mushroom  stir fried with brussel sprouts and lotus root,  panang curry, mussaman curry, drunken noodle,  charbroiled pork and braised pork belly) Other than the excellent excecution of the dishes we devoured, the intimacy of this place and the extensive wine list is a big bonus! Had dinner here last night, we were a table of 5, we all agreed the food is delicious!  Not your typical westernized  thai place.  Each dish was flavorful. The spices  you can taste yet not overwhelming. I personally  like this place over lotus.  I have been going to lotus of siam for the last 4 years but I know now I will be going to Chada for my thai cravings!
