Came about a month ago in an effort to explore the restaurants in the Westlake-type area. Had a pretty weird and underwhelming experience. \n\nOne: It was a weeknight and just to be safe, we called ahead and made a reservation. When we arrived exactly on time, they seemed surprised to see us and had us wait for a table for a little bit, even though there were several open ones. Why offer reservation options if you don't understand the concept? I also heard the owner loudly bitching at his staff for not letting him know that someone had made a reservation. \n\nTwo: When we placed our order, I went to order my entree along with soup AND salad, which was written clearly in black-and-white on the restaurant menu I held in my hand. The fellow who took our order (who I assume may be an owner), snapped that you only get soup OR salad, not both. I calmly explained to him (and showed him for good measure) that the menu clearly stated soup AND salad. Despite my cold, hard proof, he continued to argue with me that the menu was wrong, and \"most places don't even offer salad or soup included, let alone both.\" My argument is that Pepper's in Lakewood gives you salad, rolls and PASTA. Marconi's in Huron gives you salad, endless bread and PASTA. I'm totally fine if you only offer one appetizer, just stand by how you represent your business and have a little integrity. \n\nThere were  also a number of weird, rookie mistakes they made like bringing us our meal with no silverware, so we had to flag them down to bring some. The rolls were great, but that's all I got. Everything else was confirmation that we should stick with the Italian we know: Pepper's in Lakewood (atmosphere) and Marconi's in Huron (value).
