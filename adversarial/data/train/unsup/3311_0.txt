\"We'll never go there again\". Literally these are the words we just exchanged after getting home.  Maybe if something about it was good.. The service? No. Terrible. We got our salad, waited 15 minutes, got our wine and then 39 second later, our fish. Maybe if the salad was good? No, the \"wedge\" was lettuce, carrots and bacon. The fish fry? Tasteless and Luke warm. The only good thing about this place was the nice older bartender who served our bottle of wine in a beer pitcher :)
