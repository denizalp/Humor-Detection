Why would a vet still support ear cropping?\nA woman posted on FB the photo of her pit bull puppy on her way to your clinic to have her ears cropped, and likened it to a \"boob job\" . Is this what responsible animal husbandry is about?\nPlease respond.\nIf this was a phony post I will gladly retract my review.
