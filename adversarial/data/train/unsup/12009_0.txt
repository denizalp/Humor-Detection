I'll admit a flaw when dining: that is, atmosphere goes a looong way with me.  Even if the menu is mundane, the wine is uncreative, or the waiters curt, you can still win me over with making me feel like a badass in your restaurant.  After all, most of our palates aren't refined enough to decipher the differences between feral rabbit and wolverine paws.  Not that they serve either of the two here, but you get the point.\n\nRadio Milano, in fact, DOES NOT have a boring menu, average wine or rude waiters ... but there is nothing here to absolutely THRILL you.  What it is, is creative food that is presented magnificently, but lacks a certain flair.  \n\nWhen i went (date night), we had the roman artichoke with bread crumbs (great), vegetable antipasti (good), and the meatballs with some spaghetti (average).  Their portions are pretty small, so luckily my gf is a light eater and is just as thrilled with atmosphere and booze as I am.  For dessert, we had the olive oil cake, which was creative, but slightly above average in taste.\n\nWhat IS awesome are the drinks.  I had a Ginger Press (They use Tito's Handmade Vodka!) and my gf had the Sauvignon Blanc.  Both delicious and unique to the Valley.  \n\nI wanted to have another, but we decided to head over to Postino to continue on a little wine tour, however, their cocktail and wine list is impressive.  \n\nAll in all, i was mildly impressed with the food.  They do a good job creatively, but they need to really improve on their specialties.  Their staff is VERY cool and I would certainly go back to visit the bar.  Also, i like that they are part of the LGO people, cos, face it, they've increased the cache of Central Phoenix one million fold.
