GOOD GOD don't die before you get the Irish Nachos here. In fact just stop reading this and get your ass out here and try them. It's a pound of home made potato chips, covered in Irish cheddar with Bacon, tomato, chives and sour cream. Need I say more besides during happy hour (4-7pm every day) they like 1\/2 off! All the food here is amazing and we'll be the first to admit that most pub food isn't great. The chicken curry pie, the fish and chips and the reuben stand out. Good Lord they have Murphys on tap! \n\nThe entertainment is great most of the time although we've see some hippie non-Irish band there a few times that kind of stink, but still. The decor is awesome, it's like being in the Shire. The mood is fun, rowdy and loud, you'll feel like you are in the lower decks of the Titanic.. uh, before the whole iceberg thing of course and the staff if about as good as it gets. We're not just saying that cause Benji works there, all the staff are good, there are even cute girls with Irish brogues... rawr!
