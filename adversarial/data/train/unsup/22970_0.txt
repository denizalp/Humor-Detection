I have had several wonderful experiences with SADU. I had two piercings done here, and my results have been flawless. I echo the reviewers who tout the sensational staff who offer expert advice and aesthetic suggestions. These guys (and gals) really know their stuff. Equipment is always sanitized, and Corinna makes sure to explain each step of the process, from measuring to marking to piercing, which eases my nervousness about needles and pointy things.\n\nSADU came highly recommended from a friend, and it's my first recommendation to everyone who mentions wanting body\/cartilage piercing.\n\nMy only qualm is that occasionally, those staffing the counter can be somewhat indifferent to customer service and helping those who aren't part of the piercing culture. However, their selection of bones, rings, studs etc. exceeds all expectations.\n\nIf you're expecting a Claire's style piercing experience, please do yourself a favor and leave the flower power at home. \n\nAll in all, it's the only place to go for piercing. Tell them the fainting girl sent you! ;)
