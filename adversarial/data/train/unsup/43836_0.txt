I am from Buffalo, NY, the home of the best pizza and Italian food in the country so I have high standards. This place is ok, pizza has a sweet sauce which I find enjoyable but the spaghetti sauce is way under done in my taste. They are local and convenient so we go once in awhile even though it's not my favorite. Their gelato is really good, my family loves that and Lulu's bread they give when you sit down in the best bread in the city.
