Fantastic place in a decent neighborhood, with lots of trendy bars and restaurants. Close to college campuses etc.\n\nNoah Sintic, someone working there, was very nice, and helped us learn about the local neighborhood. Any questions? He's your guy.\n\nRoom was well decorated and extremely clean. And the bathroom was amazing haha.\n\nHighly recommend.
