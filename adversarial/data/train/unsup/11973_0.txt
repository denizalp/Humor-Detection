The value sucks here for to-go.\n\nDo not come here unless you are coming for AYCE sushi (All you can eat)\n\nWe got a few things togo since we were too tired to eat AYCE\n- 10 Piece Sashimi $19.99 - These were the slimmest \"sashimi\" pieces of fish I have ever had and the worst value.\n- Yellowtail Lower $12.99 - This was the smallest saddest looking roll I have ever had in the $10+ range rolls\n\nOn a friday night, they had plenty of seats open (half the restaurant was open), but weren't seating the people waiting probably due to not having enough sushi chefs.\n\nDo not order togo from this place.  The value is horrible and I can't believe we drove off the strip for this.
