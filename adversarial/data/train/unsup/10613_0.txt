If you're reading this, you've probably heard of Petit Potato's infamous tower of ice cream and bread. \nI will get there.. but first of all, this place is always packed. I love the idea of creating 'instagrammable' food. They definitely draw a big crowd by having food that is photo worthy. I've been here twice and both times had to wait about 15-30 minutes to get in.\nI haven't tried any food here.. only the desserts. And they can be a hit or miss. I tried the durian sago and it was really good, but I've also tried the cold double boiled milk and it wasn't good at all. \nOnto the tower, we ordered the matcha ice cream tower and it took about 20 mins to come out. \nAfter all the pictures were taken, we began digging in. \nDon't expect too much. It's very very carb and fat heavy consisting of just bread and cream and more cream. After the first 5 bites, you'd get sick of it. \nWe shared one tower between 6 of us and it was plenty. You're literally eating toasted bread with heavy cream and some vanilla ice cream. My girlfriend had to go outside and puke because there was too much cream. \nThat being said, no regrets.. definitely a place you'd go once for the pictures and not again. You can find better desserts.
