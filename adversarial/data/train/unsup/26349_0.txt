On the weekend of November 26, 2017 our family visited Juan's Flaming Fajitas. In fact we came all the way from Texas to celebrate our Mother\/Grandmothers Birthday. First let me say the food was really good. In fact it was excellent. But the service was amazing. We actually had 50 plus people come from Texas. They let us set up a surprise party for her on their patio. Their staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. If you want to eat good food with a side of A+ service, visit this amazing place. The Casias would like to thank Juan (the owner) for what he did for us and for making our Mother's Birthday Special. Thank you.
