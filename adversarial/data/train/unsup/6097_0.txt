Oh Flavors buffet oh how you seem to do me better and better every time we meet. This last visit for a crab leg mission was a real treat as the succulence you brought to my mouth was simply mind blowing. Awwww the experience of sucking your sweet meat as the hot drawn butter type juice drips down my lips and chin. Oh how you almost drizzled so far down that you came close to ruining a new shirt.\n\nWhy oh please why do you and how is it possible to keep me so addicted? I truly deserve to know why this must happen to me? I really look forward to seeing you and devouring you Mr. Flavors buffet man.\n\nAll I can say is I want more HOT crab legs. I need more HOT crab legs to devour.\n\nI go for the crab legs, my gal pal goes for crab legs and the all you can drink wine\/champagne. She can drink two to three bottles in a visit!\n\nIt gets better as this succulent suck fest was completely free! I am a fatty and guys love to feed me :) It is a blast watching me eat and suck down all of that yumminess!\n\n\"I did it all for the Flavors\" lol
