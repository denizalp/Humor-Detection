I like this restaurant and think their food is very good. I have tried many different items on the menu and found them to be very good. Their chips and salsa are some of the best I have ever had.\n\nThe drinks are an issue in this establishment. Beer is reasonable but their wine prices are way to high. Louis Martini Cabernet for $12.99 a glass? The whole bottle in a retail store cost $15 and the wholesale price is around $10-$12 per bottle. So I figure they have a 4x to 5x markup on a bottle which is outrageous. The same issue exists with some of their other drinks as indicated in other reviews. \n\nStick with the Tex Mex and Beer when visiting this restaurant.
