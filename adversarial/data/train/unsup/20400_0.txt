I loathe this Metro.  Their house packaged meats are always spoiled.  You can't smell it in the store, but when you get it home the chicken or beef always smells diseased.  I wish they would leave Liberty Village and another grocer comes in and takes their place.  \nMy latest experience on Dec 23 at around midnight is this: Went to the Metro - Liberty Village store at 12:15am to do some last minute grocery shopping.  I got about four items, and went to the checkout where there was an employee named \"Daniel\".  He rang up my totals and I asked him if they still did cashback.  He asked how much and I said a hundred dollars.  He asked for my Air Miles card, and I gave it to him, he asked if I needed bags and I said yes.  I then paid by debt card, and left.  I drove about 10 city blocks to my home and then proceeded to pay the babysitter with the $100 and realized I didn't receive it.  I also did not sign for the money.  I got back into my car and drove back to the Metro.  I told \"Georgina\" what happened and she paged overhead for Daniel who was already conveniently gone from the store (even though she said he usually hangs around after his shift).  I asked to speak to the manager, and she said I would have to come back in the morning.  I asked when, and she said the manager does not come in early so she doesn't know when I should come in.  Basically I don't have my money and I don't know when I'll be getting it because it will require some effort to back track the longer this is not sorted out.  So I have to take time off to go in and sort this all out before the holidays, all because I was not diligent enough and the employee Daniel didn't do the job he was paid to do.
