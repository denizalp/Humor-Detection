A satisfying experience for me when i visited TI. Reserving a room online was simple. They didn't have a non-smoking room, which was an online request, when i checked in but it was not a big deal for me. getting in and out was a cinch. I mostly gambled at The Venetian, which was right across the street so the hotel's location is a big plus.\n\nI can't say much else because i didnt play the table games at TI nor did i eat at their restaurants. Overall, I didnt have any problems during my stay. For the price, i wouldn't mind staying there again.\n\nOn a side note, when i got to my room the first night, i saw these 2 dudes across the hall face-to-face with each other and about to exchange fists. I'd find out later that one of them was apparently at the other man's hotel room waiting to \"meet\" with that man's wife...\n\nIt sounds serious but it's actually hilarious if you saw it through my eyes =P
