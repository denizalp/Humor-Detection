We had some bad experiences with moving companies in Las Vegas before and we were very skeptical to use another one. After reading Big Boys Moving's reviews we figured we would give them a chance. Richard and his team did an amazing job moving us out and into our new home! They were there 10 mins early took their time and nothing was damaged! I can say without a doubt I would recommend them to anyone and will absolutely use them again! \nThanks Richard!!!!
