I want to start out with saying that one star is generous for this gym. I've been a world health member for a few years now and have visited and trained at a number of their gyms. \nFirst of all, Macleod definitely holds up the overall snotty and stuck up attitude that World Health has come to acquire as well as the astronomical monthly rates that they charge for a membership - which is double what most gyms charge. \nWorking out here is a challenge due to the layout of the equipment, and the split levels. It just doesn't make any sense. That is if your lucky to get the equipment you want due to it always being ridiculously busy, mostly with people flailing around attempting to do crossfit. The last thing I need while trying to squat is dodging someone's foot while doing \"kipping pull-ups\" \nIf one thing is certain after a few workouts here, it's that I would never invest in a trainer here. It's obvious that they are under trained and only there as a money grab. Upon further investigation the majority of the trainers working here are \"interns\" meaning they have not completed a program. And even after completion most are only certified through generic Canfit or ace programs that essentially anyone can pass. As a certified nutritionist who's partner is a personal trainer and someone who works out regularly I can say confidently that I have a fairly good grasp on proper form and exercise in general. But I cannot count the number of times I have had to shake my head at the \"trainers\" here as they failed to correct bad form or delivered pointless plans. \nI suggest not bothering to give this rude, money grabbing establishment your money or time and look elsewhere for your workout needs. It's just not worth it.
