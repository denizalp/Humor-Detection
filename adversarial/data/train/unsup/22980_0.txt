OK, I splurged and had a double steakburger, those crispy golden shoestring fries, and yes, a strawberry shake. I had to do a double session of cardio the next day, but it was worth it. I mean, the burger was not too big, which I really liked, because I hate it when they give you some huge monstrosity that you can barely get your hands around, let alone keep together. The fries were fresh and delicious, and the shake... OMG, you knew it was going to be a real shake because 1) it came with an extra long shake spoon, and 2) the spoon stood up in the shake. Sure, I was dying of guilt for possibly having undone all my hard work of getting back into shape, but hey, what is life if you can't enjoy a good burger and fries every once in a while??\n\nWhat I also loved about Steak N Shake was that it was open 24 hours, and the the service was very good and very friendly. Love the condiments!
