Happy Dog is a small divey bar\/restaurant tucked in Cleveland's west side. It's fairly accessible to both east and west siders, so the location choice is pretty nice.\n\nI went with my friend, seeing how this restaurant has an average 4.5 rating on Yelp with so many reviews. I wanted to give it a try to see how I felt about it myself.\n\nThe service is a ok, though I had to wait quite a while to get served. It may have had to do with the fact that filming was going on that day for a commercial, but the wait still was an upwards of 20 minutes even with plenty of open seats.\n\nI find it pretty cool that you can order a hot dog and put as many toppings as you want on it. You can also order the tater tots with as many dipping sauces as you'd like. I wanted to try something different, so I got a vegan dog with chorizo chili, mushrooms, sunny side up egg, tomatoes, onions, chipotle ketchup and \"Korean BBQ sauce.\"\n\nThe resulting hot dog was so large that I was unable to hold it with my hands - I had to knife and fork it or make a mess on myself. While I do like the high levels of customization, I found the flavors to be... fairly standard. The hot dog didn't stand out to me as anything extraordinary. It was still tasty, but didn't taste any different from any hot dog I could get at any restaurant.\n\nA cool restaurant to visit, for sure, but as far as the flavors go, fairly standard.
