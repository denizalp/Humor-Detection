****UPDATE: They changed their menu and now have a lunch\/late night special or nightly special. \n\nWe choose the nightly special that included all options. \n\nTHEY NOW OFFER RICE PAPER, which made my heart so happy!!!!!!! \n\nMy new favorite meat is the garlic beef belly. So good and flavorful!!!! \n\nYou also get a free scoop of ice cream at the end, which they also added to the menu!!\n\nHowever, this time around... the service was lacking. Worse than the past few times I've visited. The food took forever to come out. We ordered various meats at random times and our grill still remained empty more than 3 times. Our server blamed it on their tablets and told us it was lagging, but he didn't think to tell us until I asked for an update on the food. Some of our appetizers never came either. The service should be a lot better, but overall this is still my go-to kbbq spot in Vegas.
