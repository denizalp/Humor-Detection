Terrible. Do not use this group.  I rented for over a year. Paid my rent months in advance and was served eviction papers twice by accident because their computer system Kept losing my rent.  I went without a dishwasher for months because the maintenance system and response time is ridiculously slow and I ended up fixing it on my own. Upon leaving the property they attempted to charge me for items that were not my responsibility and things that were at the house when I moved in. Document your move in carefully!!  Here's the biggest one. John is very dishonest. He told me to keep the utilities in my name and it would be worked out .... I gave them the keys and full access to the house since I moved out early ... now he is denying it to his company and I'm out hundreds of dollars but they don't care because they were able to rent the property prior to my lease being up. Everything worked out for them. Slum lords. Go somewhere else.
