This place has great food but if you have kids stay away.  I had my 9 month old with me and had to hold him on my lap while sitting on a backless chair because they did not have high chairs.  I know hipster places like these do these kinds of things to passively NOT encourage families to come and cramp their cool style but I would have just preferred  an honest answer from them when I called ahead of time to see if the place was kid friendly and they told me yes.  Other then that the Mac and cheese was bomb dignity
