I'm from San Francisco where we have plenty of great Thai Food. I rented an exotic car in Vegas an while driving around got the hankering for some Thai and through Yelp ended up at Archi's... FAVORITE Thai spot to date. The pricing for what you get is amazing. I've never taken leftovers from a Thai food place but here I only finished half and spent the same as I would have here in the Bay Area. Can't wait until the next time I go back so I can make my return to Archi's Bistro!
