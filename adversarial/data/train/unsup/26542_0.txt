I'm excited to have a place to get horchata in the neighborhood! Only drawback is that I think they make it with cinnamon syrup and not actual cinnamon. Ki nd of dissapointing to not see any cinnamon flecks in my beverage. Had the chicken chimichangas platter which was very good. Try it with the homemade cheese sauce. The complimentary chicken and rice soup is a nice touch. Warning about the guacamole: it is mostly just mashed avacado, if you like tomato, onion, and cilantro in your guacamole you may want to also order a side of pico de gallo to mix in. Overall a decent place to grab a bite to eat. I'm sure I'll be back.
