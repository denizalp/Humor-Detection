In days gone by, I think I may have given the Chinook Cineplex a higher rating.\n\nI have heard tell that this is the largest movie thater in Canada (or is it Western Canada? Or is it the largest CINEPLEX in Western Canada? I DON'T KNOW).\nEither way, as you probably already know, it's big.\n\nIt's bizarrely confusing \"Egyptian\" theme (complete with gargantuan scarabs scaling the outside of the theatre wall) is, to say the least, impressive if not just flat out strange (perhaps \"The Mummy\" was a new movie when they decided to put these designs in motion). \n\nBut it's a big multiplex, and for the most part, they do the big, bold movie-going experience right.\n\nI say, \"for the most part\" because, like an aging Uncle, they are starting to slip in their coherency and sharpness. Maybe it is because the Shawnessy Empire Theatre (which I also frequent) recently renovated and provide a comfortable environment with cushy seats, moveable armrests (so you can snuggle up to your hunny-bunny) and great projection. In fact, I feel like I am almost writing an Empire Theatre review here.\n\nThe last two times I have been to Chinook, my experience has been \"OK\" at best. On both occasions, the theatre was stuffy and the seats were worn out and uncomfortable. It made me long for the pillowy tenderness that the Empire seats hold me in.\n\nChinook is also so often so obnoxiously busy. It's a big theatre, it's more or less centrally located, so naturally you're gonna get the crowds.\n\nOn the plus side, \"Scene points\" are pretty awesome. I can often get some good deals with my Scene card and every now and then I get a free movie out of it. Cheap Tuesdays are also great and they recently offered Scene card holders an extra 10% off on Tuesdays. But until Chinook does something about the comfort of their theatre in order to keep up with Empire's renovations, I think I would rather spend my extra $0.79 on a not-so-stagnant room and a more comfortable seat.
