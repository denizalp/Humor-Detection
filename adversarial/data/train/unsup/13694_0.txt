This environmental center is absolutely beautiful! Really rivals the welcome center in Ohiopyle that was built as far as architectural beauty. Multi-level with classrooms (and really nice bathrooms). It has porch that overlooks the park and it most importantly environmentally friendly. They treat all their water on site and are sustainable. It is a beautiful building that I would give 5 stars to.\n\nHOWEVER! My only (and biggest) problem is that in building this environmental center, they massacred many, MANY trees in doing so. The view that you see from the balcony as of right now looks like you are overviewing complete deforestation. They claim on the signs that it is because these trees were invasive species, but they have to replace these things slowly or else there is just a big pile of logs!! They also massacred the meadow in the Meadow trail... my favorite in the summer! I am endlessly angry about it.
