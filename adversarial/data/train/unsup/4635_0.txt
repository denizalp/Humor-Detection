It is always nice to find new places to eat in the neighborhood! I had the chicken shawarma plate, and it was great.  My favorite part of my meal was the dessert. I'm really looking forward to having baklava again because it was amazing. There were so many textures all in one little square. The service was quick too so overall it was a nice food experience.
