Pizza Rock is one of my top recommendations when out-of-towners ask me where to grub near Fremont. They offer some great happy hour deals and the pizza is pretty freaking good. Pay the up-charge, assuming it's not already on the pie, and add the ricotta. It's a little cheese filled cloud of epic goodness. \n\nHappy hour runs Monday-Friday from 3 to 6 and every night from 10 to close. They offer some pretty good food specials and there is a good selection of draft beer to choose from. Deschutes Fresh Squeezed is my go-to. It's usually on tap and $2 off during happy hour. Personal pizzas with one topping are 5 bucks and they're pretty big for a personal pizza. \n\nI've had dinner in the dining room and drinks at the bar. Both are perfectly acceptable options. I tend to choose the bar unless I'm with a group. The bartenders are personable and I enjoy the energy in the bar. People always seem to be having a good time at Pizza Rock. I'm looking forward to checking out their other properties.
