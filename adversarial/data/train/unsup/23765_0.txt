I'm in love. RnR has made its way deep into the corridors of my heart and stomach by providing good wine, amazing food, great service and optimal people watching from the upstairs balcony. \n\nAfter the Giants game (beating Cleveland!) we hopped onto one of the handy dandy golf carts and headed into downtown Scottsdale to join other Giants fans as we reveled in the glory of a well-earned win. Not knowing the town, we left it up to our chauffeur to drop us at the perfect location of RnR. \n\nThere are three bars strategically placed throughout the massive building. We opted for the bar upstairs on the balcony overlooking the street so that we can watch the cars, golf carts and people making their way down this bustling thoroughfare. As I walked by one of the tables, I spied and smelled a delicacy that was a must order for me - Animal Fries. Parmesan fries mixed with sweet potato fries, smothered with cheese and topped with BBQ pork. Delicious!!!!\n\nWe left here and went to two other bars in town, but RnR was my favorite. Come for the good food, great service and awesome people watching.
