I refuse to go to LVAC, hahaha.  Why you ask, because they advertise that women join free, how lame.  It's just a gym, not a nightclub.  I'm there to workout, not pick up on women.  That's the only reason i would think why you'd \"encourage\" women to join.\n\nBesides that, LVAC is only in Las Vegas.  If you travel a lot, or plan to, then what would be the point of spending all that money on a membership you can only use in Vegas.\n\nI did give it one star as I do like the fact there there is an indoor track at the 215 and Eastern one.  That's all you get though LVAC.  hahaha
