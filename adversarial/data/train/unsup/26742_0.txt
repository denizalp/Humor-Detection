In all honesty, it's been quite a few years since I've had Chinese food. Mostly I got tired of eating out at the greasy dives back home. We were wandering around the neighborhood and figured what the hell, we're on vacation and the reviews on Yelp were encouraging.\n\nIt was crazy busy on a Friday night, but we only had a quick 10 minute wait for a table. Just be ready to share a table if there aren't many open spots. The staff was friendly and attentive and took time to answer our questions despite how busy they were. The hot and sour soup was amazing. We had some peppered beef and chicken with broccoli, pretty simple dishes but both were flavorful and very good. I walked out of there feeling full and satisfied and not like I just ate a big greasy meal. Which for me, is a sign of good cooking. Like Jackson Z. mentioned below, we were handed two menus one with more familiar dishes and the other with chef's specials.\n\nGreat spot with reasonable prices and hospitable staff. Recommended if you're in the area and craving some good Chinese grub.
