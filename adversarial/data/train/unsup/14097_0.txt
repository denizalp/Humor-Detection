It took him a year to respond to my post and this is some sort of back handed apology I think...for some reason stating that I have a low income or that I am on a fixed budget.  I see there are a whole two positive reviews on here! Wow...  There are a lot of pool companies in the phoenix area.  Im not trying to refer anyone in particular but I would guess there are many better than this one.  This all came from one bad experience.  The explanation of the experience I gave was correct.  The situation was handled very poorly by dan and this response to a post on yelp, which had a few more lies in it, just calls his character into question a little more.  I've left this alone for a year now, I had one bad experience and explained it just to let other people know of what I went through.  That is the reason yelp is here Dan, to give examples of good and bad experiences.  You responding in this way just shows your lack of integrity and capabilities as a business owner.  If you do use this company good luck and I really do hope dan has improved on on the way that he conducts his business because all I see is lies and trying to cover up the mistake that he made in past.  I thought this was over but him questioning my integrity is not right.  His pool tech never came by that week to find a locked gate, he simply did not show.  He did over charge me and became very defensive upon me even asking about it.    \n\nI just can not believe he would say some of those things that he did in his response.  It is very disappointing that a childish response to my one year old post was something that dan felt he needed to do.
