I have to say this place is just not that bad. \nI travel a lot. I have gone to a lot of Walmart's all over the country. I have been to this one about 12 times now.\nFirst off it is well lit. A lot of Walmart's are so dark inside. They try to save money on the light bill or something. Which is ridiculous!! Because, I need to see what I am shopping for. \nI want to be able to see the things in the store.\nHere you can see. Good lighting.\nThe items are well stocked and laid out nicely so you can see it all.\nIt is very clean inside. \nThe staff is friendly.\nPlus, there is one stop shopping here. \nBecause, you can get everything you need here.  There is a Bank, a Nail Salon, a Hair Salon, you can get your Taxes done ,as well as a few other shops and services inside. \nI think this is the only Walmart around for awhile of a drive. For certain the only one in Elyria. But, it is good. One stop shop and it is clean. Even a nice variety of food products. It is worth the trip.
