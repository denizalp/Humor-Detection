Last weekend Rose took me to \"Nove\"  for Valentine's Day.  I know,  I'm a very lucky guy!! ;-)  I'm not really one for super trendy places that are over hyped and under deliver,  so I was a bit skeptical about eating at the Palms. But I have to say \"Nove\"  knocked one out of the park. We had a tremendous 5 star experience.  The food was incredible and the service was flawless.  A  few of the dishes were just outstanding.  We highly recommend the shrimp covered  with a lemon cream sauce, the grilled baby octopus, the seafood spaghetti and the chicken marsala.  Bottom line...Fantastic food with even better company. It doesn't get too much better.  Prego!
