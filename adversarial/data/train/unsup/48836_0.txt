Great job! Got scheduled within 2 days for a carpet and couch cleaning. Michel arrived at first with the normal unit, and realized that a mobile unit would be needed. He quickly called help and the arrived within the next 45 minutes. On top of that, he treated a couple darker spots on my carpet with shampoo free of charge. Patrick was the technician and was polite and did a great job. Purchased with Groupon and was treated like a repeat customer. A+
