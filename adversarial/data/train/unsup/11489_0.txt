Great experience with Adam (salesman), Jeff (manager), and Scott (finance manager). I purchased a Certified Subaru Outback. Negotiated a great price over the phone (I live in CA) without high pressure, tricks\/games, or endless negotiating rounds.\n   Arrived at the dealership and found the car was just as expected from their website photos and drove great. It was immaculately cleaned (except the rear sink drink holder which they took care of immediately). The paperwork was ready and all the costs were exactly what I expected. \n   Scott arranged excellent financing rates and even knocked a little off our already agreed-to price. He went over the extended warranty programs but wasn't super-pushy selling them (I ended up declining them).\n   Even though I live in CA, I'll keep Camelback in mind for my next car.
