First of all, Colleen is the best server ever. She was so attentive, polite, friendly and caring. She is such a people person it is amazing. Coming from a food service managers standpoint, I would be honored to have a staff member such as herself. The food was awesome as well. Great atmosphere, haven't been to a Texas Roadhouse in quite some time but I'm glad we went back and I'm glad we had such an amazing server. Thank you Colleen for all you did tonight!
