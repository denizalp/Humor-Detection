Best food experience I've ever had in Las Vegas. \n\nThe food is incredible, the preparation is awesome to watch, and the presentation is an art.\n\nSome lady was complaining about how they prep stuff hours in advance and that's inappropriate for this style of sushi and in Japan they do it another way and blah blah blah...STFU! She doesn't know what she's talking about. A. They don't. B. Everything is prepped an appropriate amount of time to your menu order. C. Their presentation requires them do prep. It's a restaurant for Christ sake!\n\nSit at the bar. Make reservations. They'll tell you the name of the fish you're eating and where they're from. Mine was Guss, Larry, Charles, Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria from Spain, Seattle, Tokyo and Kickapoo Nebraska...? I dunno my memory may be a little fuzzy on that last part.
