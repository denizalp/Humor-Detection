We purchased the redflagdeal coupon for pi-Tom. It was the worst restaurant experience even for the 'discounted' price we paid.\nThe mango salad is just sliced raw mango. Basil duck has 5 tiny pieces of duck that are mostly fatty duck skin. We asked the waiter if it's normal he said that's the normal amt of meat in that dish but they will add more vegetables to it. Authentic pad Thai has shrimps that taste like rubber. \nIn the end, we got charged 13% gratuity even though we are completely dissatisfied with the service.
