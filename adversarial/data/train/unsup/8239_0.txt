This is a good location to take the kids to a tailgate movie. The location is rundown and poorly managed and maintained. \n\nThe customer service is actually great from all of the employees from the ticket counter, to the concessions. The problem is the old fat manager that stands in the driveway yelling at kids and customers. He is a rude jackass that needs to go to his office and keep his mouth shut. He publicly berates employees, and this is greatly unappreciated.\n\nHe needs to spend more time focused on maintenance and cleanliness. The quality of the food needs to be improved. It doesn't even meet the low standards of Regal or AMC.
