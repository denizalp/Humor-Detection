Holy cr@p this place sucks so bad! No wonder why their other location closed! I can see this one going under as well! \nThe best part of our entire experience is that my friend never had an empty coffee mug! The one thing our server did do right was offer refills on coffee! So sad! \nOk so I had ordered the croissant cinnamon French toast, a chicken biscuit and side of their sausage gravy. Really?? That biscuit was hard as a rock! I sent it back and got another rock hard biscuit! Not once did our server ask me if my new biscuit was any better! It was off to the side and he could plainly see that I was not happy and just didn't give a rats a$$. My friends eggs were way under cooked but he ate his way around it! Sad! What a waste of $55 at this horrible place! The jerk face manager care by and asked how every single thing was BUT my biscuit! So I said yeah your biscuits are hard and dry and no good! And I should've told him his chicken was just the same! I ate the chicken because I was so darn hungry! The sausage gravy was very bland with zero flavor, tasted like milky flour! Disgusting!!!! My boyfriend luckily ordered cinnamon roll pancakes that were ok and nice of him to share. $3.99 2 pieces of dry, over cooked, bland bacon was ridiculous. Everything about this place is horrible. From their service, to their food, up onto their management! Oh and then they even tried to give me 2 biscuits to go! Hahahaha!!!!! Really?! What a joke!!!! I want a refund from this place!!!!! Awful!!!!! I'm so pissed!!!!!!
