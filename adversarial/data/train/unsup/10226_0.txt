Such an odd thing to have a store with just batteries and light bulbs.  I'm sure there was a time where these were hard to get specialty items but with the invention of get whatever you want whenever you want stores you'd think this place would be useless or obsolete, but on the contrary it's actually a pretty useful place!\n\nFor my 100th review I think this place is worth it's number on the chart just out of sheer surprise.  I went to buy an LED bulb that changed colors (the one with the remote).  They used to sell them at LOEWS a year or two ago, but for some reason these awesome bulbs have gone extinct from retail.  Lucky for me, this place has them and at a great price!  I walked in and told the staff what I needed and they knew exactly what I was referring to.  Antonio guided me to their location and even made a few other suggestions.  The store was clean as a whistle and they had some decent traffic in the 10 minutes I was in there.  I didn't get batteries, but the selection was bountiful.\n\nIf you need a specialty bulb or battery or just need either of those things in general, this would be a good place to stop.
