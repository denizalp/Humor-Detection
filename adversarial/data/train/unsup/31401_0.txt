No detail was missed when opening Sienna Mercato - this place is awesome. From the menu to the decor, and everything in between, the restaurant is the new place to be in Pittsburgh.\n\nI ate veggie meatballs with the spicy tomato sauce and vegetable quinoa. I wasn't expecting the quinoa to be cold, and would have preferred it warm. Good beer selection, even though they were out of what I ordered. \n\nOur server was terrible and we sat at our table for a long time before we had to remind the hostess stand we were there... And the server never introduced herself or even said \"hi.\" It was a little bizarre, but I haven't heard other complaints about the service so it must have been an off night.\n\nCan't wait for the Sienna pizza joint on the second floor...
