The Boil Bar is essentially a rip off of Captain's Boil, though if you're not willing to travel all the way to Yonge Street and fight for a table, this place gives you a decent taste of experience you would have in Captain's Boil.\n\nI came here on a Saturday night with my family, and to my surprise the place wasn't busy at all. The tables and decorations were very similar to Captain's Boil. The menu was also similar, although this place offers Presotea, more appetizer options, and other dishes that aren't your boil options.\n\nI went with a pound of snow crab leg, lobster, two pounds of shrimp, and three pounds of clam, with sauces ranging from cajun sauce to house sauce (mix of all sauces) to garlic sauce as well. I found the clams and shrimp to be on par with Captain's Boil, but the lobster and snow crab leg to be disappointing. The portions didn't seem to be 1lb each at all, and the lobster and crab lacked meat. It definitely wasn't worth the amount for both unfortunately. The sauces were overall good, with the garlic sauce being the best of the bunch.\n\nService was disorganized, as my waitress had to return frequently to make sure she took down the current order...and yet she still mixed up a couple of my orders.\n\nI don't see myself returning here, as I firmly believe Captain's Boil is better for this kind of experience...although this place is much closer to my home. Maybe...just maybe.
