Had I not known in advance that this is a chain, I would never have been able to tell based on my experience. As you walk into Jason's Deli, you're immediately guided to the counter by a walkway. The man behind the counter was new but super friendly and able to answer most of my questions. Service at this location was top notch.\n\nAs for the food. Take note, I didn't notice the Reuben (or I would have ordered it) so I went with a Muffaletta which is a grilled sandwich coated to the edges with their olive spread. I had the quarter roasted turkey. The olive spread was divine but the sandwich itself wasn't to my liking. The cheese hadn't melted and the meats were still cold. If I order a grilled sandwich, I want it hot. I was very disappointed with the temperature. Even more so when I actually saw the Rueben that someone else had ordered. \n\nThe service here made this whole experience standout. Especially Teddy who deserves Five-Stars. He was running circles around his coworkers, bussing tables, asking people if they were enjoying everything. He was a kind man and deserves to be celebrated. He really made me enjoy the whole experience just a little bit more.
