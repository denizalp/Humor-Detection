I've been to their location off Eastern, but I am so glad to have this location closer to where I live. Every single time I go in, the place is packed but the wait is never more than 20 minutes. For a lady with my appetite, waiting is a tough game. \n\nWhat is great is that even while packed, they do a fantastic job of turning tables while not making you feel rushed. As always, the food is on point and their specials are always DE-LISH! Always GET THE BANANA MUFFIN! Don't ask. Just do it.\n\nThis location is also great because of it's close proximity to the 215 AND all that fab shopping across the street. Egg Works really does have their stuff together. Love this place!
