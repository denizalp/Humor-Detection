Well where to start... my friends and I were walking past when 2 men approached us and one said, \"Hi, I'm Jason Cheuvront,\" which we thought was really tacky.  Once in the restaurant a hostess asked us if we wanted a table and how many in our party; she then walked away and did not return, so we had to seat ourselves.  We ordered happy hour drinks, and the glass of wine I ordered tasted like vinegar and smelled spoiled.  When I told our server he said, \"I won't smell it because I don't like to tell customers that they are wrong.\" I was so shocked by his response that I did not order another drink.  The server took the glass of wine back behind the bar, and we then saw the owners and bartenders trying the wine and rolling their eyes.  Later, the server returned and told me I could order any drink, not just something off the happy hour menu, (wasn't sure if it would be on the house or not?) and then never returned to take my order. When we finally tracked down another server, I ordered a sangria.  The server gave me a blank stare and said they did not have sangria even though it was plainly listed on their drink menu.  Enough was enough!  We left cash on the table and left.
