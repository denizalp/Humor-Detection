+_+_+_+_+ Logan's is many kangaroo hops ahead of that Australian place +_+_+_+_\n\n      Met friends for a movie and dinner. \n      The steak I and my wife had were $11.99 \n      I wasn't expecting much for this price.\n\nI'm shocked ....... the meal was outstanding.\nThe steak was tender .... tasty .... and juicy.\nFor my two sides ...... I chose a Caesar salad and fries.\nThe fries were very good.\nNext time ..... I would take a pass on the Caesar salad ...... taste wise it lacked zest and was flat.
