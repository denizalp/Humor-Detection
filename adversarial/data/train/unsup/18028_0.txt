The service at this Trattoria D'Amico is quite good. But we go to restaurants for food, right? Unfortunately beyond the service, it's all downhill. \n\nAmbience is quite subdued, although more aptly put, the atmosphere is like a morgue. Even with the live piano playing, it's still a restaurant in a strip mall that's replaced overhead fluorescents with recessed canned lights. \n\nThe only thing worse than the ambience is the food. The Italian food served at Trattoria D'Amico like most Chandler area establishments is amateur Italian. This is the worst of the lot. \n\nFood lacks in flavor(tasteless and signs of a home schooled completely out of his league), presentation(pasta was scooped into a bowl and placed upside down on serving plate, I don't even plate food like that at home not to mention lack of garnishing) freshness and quality of ingredients(lots of pre-prepped food why not just go to the frozen food section of your local super market). Prices were outrageously priced given the quality of food. Any Italian restaurants bread and butter is a bolognese sauce. If you can't get that right, you're in trouble. \n\nAll I can say is yuck, why are they still in business, why isn't there a competent chef, why does this place get 4 stars and why do people continue to frequent this place? Food from the airplane is better, and that's sad. These cooks have no business being in the kitchen and these owners have no business being in business. Period.
