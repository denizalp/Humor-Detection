Second visit and we ordered takeout. Got home to find the pizza was wrong. Starving after a 10K race, I called to let the manager know. He was extremely courteous and had the pizza remade and credited to my card. When I arrived, he greeted me at the door w an additional apology and invitation to return for a complimentary pie. What great customer service! The pizza, breadsticks and arugula salad were all delicious.
