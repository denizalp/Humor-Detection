-If you are trying to get in free as a dude, you're out of your mind.\n-If you're trying to get in free as a chick, be prepared to get in line at 9, wait till club opens at 10, stand in line until 12, then maybe get in for free or pay some cover.\n-Being on guest list means you have your name on a piece of paper....and that's it.\n\nBest way to get into the club without the line and the grief is to just suck it up and buy the pre-sale tickets. Then you get to stand in the shorter line and you can get into the club in about 10 minutes.\n\nTo have the best time:\n\nGet a fucking table AHEAD of time. There is literally nowhere to sit for anyone WITHOUT a table. \n\nIt's going to be crowded.\nYou're going to get lost.\nDrinks are for sure going to cost 20 bucks for a watered down shot.\nThis is what you WANT when you try to come here. If you're complaining about this, then you need to switch up your expectations. You didn't have the time of your life here because you wanted it to be something it's not.
