Brandi:  I am NOT mistaken.  In fact, you were one of the people I spoke with.  My daughter had the same problem.  She spoke with you about the Thanksgiving time.  You specifically told her that you would get her her refund, but it would have to wait until after the holidays since you were so busy.  Well, the holidays are over and we will see if you live up to your word.
