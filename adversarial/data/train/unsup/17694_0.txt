I was baaaack today. \n\nAnother cool thing about Deli is that  they honor special requests without hesitation. Today I got insanely creative like Devin Townsend and ordered an egg salad wrap (lapsed Catholic here who's dabbling in vegetarianism) with get this; lettuce, tomato, ARTICHOKE, and AVOCADO. And the orange deli sauce that might be Thousand Island or Russian.  Yes throw the horns for me. It was richer than a hedge fund manager but was good and comforting rather than greedy and evil. \n\nThey also let me sample their Clam Chowder which defeated anything in a can with ridiculous ease. I'll have to keep checking the website to see when they have it again.
