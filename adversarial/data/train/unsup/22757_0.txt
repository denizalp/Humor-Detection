A little spendy and a decent selection of buffet style foods. The gentleman at the carving station for the prime rib obviously has mastered the art of deli thin slices. Steamed snow crab legs were good, but the partial pre-cuts drove a lot of shell into the meat on a few pieces. Service was attentive and kept the ice teas full at the table. Nice variety of desserts. Not very conveniently set up. The ramekins for the au jus were on the opposite side of the carving station. The steak knives for the meat dishes were not close to the meat stations. Watching people right now grabbing their food and then searching for condiments or utensils.
