I went and checked this place out as I am looking for another gym to join. I found the people there are a bit intimidating as they are all some big dudes, and you get some funny looks as well. I felt that everyone there was establishing an opinion of me even before I could make it into the door. \n\nI am going to go back today and see if I get a better vibe but other than that the price is right and they have a ton of equipment. I will update this review once I have more info.
