Great ambience, wide selection of beers and decent collection of board games for you to try. Not super loud so you can actually have a conversation with the people around you. \n\nI LOVE the Pretzels here! An order comes with 3 and is served with their beer cheese. Sometimes it's a little salty but if you scrape it off you're golden. The texture of the pretzel is perfect - such and warm and goes so well with the cheese. \n\nI also recommend getting their . I usually order the 'Casual Like' which comes with pulled pork!\n\nThey also have Trivia on Tuesday nights at 7pm! \n\n**TLDR: quiet, has board games, lots of beer, delicious pretzels
