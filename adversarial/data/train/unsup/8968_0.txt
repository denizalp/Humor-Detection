Very cool dog park.  Took the entire pack out for a night of fun, and well, they had a blast.  Ziggy is an old guy and has never been to a dog park before, so he was a bit reticent at first, but soon adapted.  He was more interested in exploring than playing with other dogs.  Miley has enough energy for ten dogs, spent most of the evening running and chasing and playing with other dogs.  Beau, our Lab puppy has almost as much energy as Miley.  Fortunately, they both burned off all this energy running and playing.\n\nThis park has a decompression chamber, which prevents dogs from escaping the play area, and provides a nice buffer to the main park area.  There are several play areas, and apparently the city rotates which is open.  This night, the south park was open and features water fountains and a rocky\/sandy play pit.  The park is nicely landscaped, giving exploring dogs like Ziggy some bushes to sneak around and under.  This park was clean and well-kept, with poop bags available and located strategically around the park.  The water fountains come with a bowl or a spigot - some dogs like to bite\/drink from the stream instead of lapping from the bowl.\n\nAll the dogs were well-behaved, and owners attentive to their own dogs, while being friendly to unfamiliar dogs - like Beau, who has to greet every dog and every person he sees.  The park is large enough that your dog can play with others, or find some quiet time.
