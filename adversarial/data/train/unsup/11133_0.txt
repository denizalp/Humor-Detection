O'Sheas is freakin' hysterical.  Just thinking about it brings a tear to my eye.  They have a little person dressed as a leprechaun recruiting people outside.  He's got the greatest voice and everytime we walked by or in, there he was preaching about 24 hour happy hour, $1 beers, loose slot machines and who knows what else.\n\nWe came here for their food court.  Burger King, Subway, Mamma Mia's pizza and I think an ice cream place.  Perfect for during the day to soak up the liquor from the night before.  \n\nAnd nothing cures a nasty hangover like a $1 beer.  Thank you O'Sheas for my $1 cure.
