average chinese food but bad service.  ordered a chicken noodle dish and sweet and sour pork.  came fast but the sweet and sour pork was overly sour and soggy.  asked the waiter to replace the pork dish because it was very bad and he became all defensive.  he refused saying that it is how all the other places make it.  he refused to even try it before saying there was nothing wrong with the dish.  would not go back again.
