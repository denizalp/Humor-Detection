I purchased 21 cookies in Elf Pants for Christmas. I was disappointed to find that the cookies are not come as shown in the picture. I assumed the cookies would be wrapped in a clear cellophane but instead they were packaged in a brown and white branded bag, 3 cookies per package. Reminded me of the packaging Grandma's cookies uses, they kind you buy in the grocery store. The cookies didn't have that \"fresh baked\" appearance I expected.\n\nThe product was also shipped to the wrong address. The owner was rude, lacked any customer service skills and blamed me for the mistake.\n\nI would never purchase from them again.
