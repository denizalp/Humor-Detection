Awesome ice cream. I don't like butter Pecan ice cream. In fact it's been a joke in my family about how much I dislike it. However, the Salted Caramel Butter Pecan has taught me that there is regular gross butter pecan and then there is a browned butter with the pecans adding to the nuttiness of the browned butter ice cream flavor with a delicate delicious salted Caramel mixed in. It's incredible.
