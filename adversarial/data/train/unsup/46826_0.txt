What a charming and interesting cafe!\nWorth a visit just on the originality and pleasant experience of dining in a cafe while you're entertained by 8-10 cats roaming around.  The place could use a little sprucing up.  Service was ok. I was a little nervous since it's only vegetarian foods but the grilled cheese was great.
