\"The Abstract\": There are better places in town - Maize #1, by far, Huaraches Moroleon #2. Chipotle #3. Not exactly trendy, but the food is better at those places. \n\nWas this worth a \"date night\" with my husband ? Not really. When you have to pay for a baby-sitter a date night better be worth it! Wedge was more miss than hit for us, and while it wasn't terrible, it just isn't worth a repeat for us, especially since we can't really come here with our son - too bar-like b\/c most of the tables have high bar stools. There are better (casual and pricy) places for a date in C-U. \n\nPros:\nThe server was great! Mixed up a fancy N\/A juice for me since I'm pregnant. \n\nThe fish tacos- very good- loved the sauce especially. But go easy on the cabbage!\nThe steak tacos w\/ poblano - good.\n\nBeer prices were reasonable.\n\nMeh: \nTacos al Pastor - decent, but not worth a repeat visit, IMO. \nGuacamole - decent flavor- a bit too acidic, not enough salt.\n\nCons: \nChips and salsa are NOT free - it's $3 for an order!\n\nBeans - fresh out of a.... Can. So easy to make good beans, no excuses here.\n\nGuacamole price was high compared to other places around town (and yes, I know the cost of an avocado $0.90-1.79\/each- esp owning the El Toros in town, I'm sure the owners get them cheaper than we can at Meijer. Price was $6 for a small portion that was *maybe*a single avocado. \n\nSeated right by the door - kept getting interrupted so servers could get liquor out, new patrons walking in - it was freezing! Forget a  nice date - we were cold and felt *very* rushed. If you want to get drinks and linger, or dessert, sit in the back. If you want a Jimmy Johns \"Freaky Fast\" experience, sit in the front. \n\nCarnitas taco - absolutely disgusting. It tasted like the meat was rotten. The nuts were whole and just didn't work  - would be better chopped up, but they dont' really add to the taco. This actually made me feel sick. My husband agreed.
