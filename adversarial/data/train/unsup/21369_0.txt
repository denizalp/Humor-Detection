Please, don't bother getting out of your truck and PLACING my Amazon package next to the front door or concerning yourself with the fact that ANYONE could have seen it and taken it, since it was LYING IN THE MIDDLE OF MY FRONT LAWN! Obviously you just threw it curbside from the truck while sitting on your ass. Apparently you've done your job. Good Job, idiots.
