Jack's is what it is. And if everything was normal everyday stuff, I would toss out 3 stars. But this was kind of a joke. I order the kid's cheeseburger combo ($4.19) with fries & drink for C. Nothing on it but the cheese with extra extra extra extra pickles. I guess I wasn't clear enough. What C got was a cheeseburger with 1 pickle. C said the burger was kind of blah and a bit overcooked. Plus, he was bumming about the pickle drought.\nNow the dude working the counter was Roberto. And his name tag said \"in training\" so I'll let it slide. But ... The dining room had 3 dirty tables with debris scattered on each one. There was NO ONE ELSE in the place & we were there between 5:30 & 5:50 Tuesday night. Hmmm, that should have been my first clue.\nThen there was the fly that kept \"bugging\" us. Aaarrrghh! I hate flies and especially when you're eating.\nMediocre food. Dirty dining room. Pesty fly. 2 Stars.
