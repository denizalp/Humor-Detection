I was so excited when this place opened because there's nothing quite as elaborate around the area.\n\nThis place doesn't get 5 stars because they're a bit slow and the prices are a bit high.\n\nOther than that, however, this place is amazing! The decor, the menu, the way you feel like you've stepped back in time when you step in the parlor. Although I mentioned the high prices, the portions are pretty good. Staff is pretty friendly, good hours (stays open the latest out of all my favorite Cleveland ice cream places), and +1 for vegan ice cream!!\n\nI've been here more times than I can count and will definitely return!
