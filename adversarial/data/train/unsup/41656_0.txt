I have been to The Living Room twice. I took my family that was visiting from out of town. I absolutely love this place! The bruschetta is amazing...I've tried them all! The drinks are delicious truly hit the spot! The service is outstanding and they are very friendly. \n\nI have gone around 11:30am on the weekend, which is a perfect time. I could stay all day on the patio just relaxing and having cocktails!  I highly recommend The Living Room for an early afternoon cocktail\/appetizers.
