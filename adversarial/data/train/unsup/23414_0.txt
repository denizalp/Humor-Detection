Wow, something brand new right in my backyard.  I am a frequent Panera diner and was heading there tonight for a quick, healthy meal.  Whoa!!  Stop the bus, Gus!  What is this Elevation Burger joint parked right next store?  This is usually where they seasonally sell really bad Halloween costumes.\n\nTurns out this new kid on the block is about organic, grain-fed, range free beef.  Ok, I am a branding guy and the logo, color scheme and graphics are nice but their brochure is a little too over the top.  They talk about how much they care for their cows - guess what, I am eating that cow right now!  I speak with endearment about my late grandmother but I don't want to see her ground up in a cheeseburger.\n\nOk, down to business.  Pretty similar format to the 5-Guys place.  You have your base burger and then you can pick and choose.  I like this type of format.  Even though I am an In-and-Out fan and just settle for their secret sauce, sometimes I just want mayo, mustard, tomato and lettuce.  Done deal here.  I like the fries  at Elevation best of the three joints.  \n\nBUT, what I really like is there is no circus act.  The Five Guys place all this yelling and laughing and trying to give off this faux enthusiasm nauseates me.  Just give me my burger with a smile and I am happy.  $12 for a meal versus $6 at In-And-Out so it is about economics sometimes also.  I would take a pretty girl to this place.  lol
