I have visited a few LDL's in the valley and have a personal goal of visiting them all before I hop up on the wagon for the long ride.  I was out and about in the desert area south of town and felt thirsty.  Upon my return to the valley thought I would stop in and see a different house Uncle Lee built.  This was one of the more stranger LDL visits.  First, I want to thank ever tourist that comes into town.  Seriously, you are the ones who lube the spokes of our local economy.  Thank you again.  NOW...with that said, don't be pissed off at me when your lost and I go out of my way to help give you directions.  If you are deaf, just tell me to speak louder.  Next, if your a couple wanting to play twenty questions with the clerk.  HIs short abbreviated answers will mean he doesn't give a F$#@.  Use your smart phone or ask a concierge at a casino.  Happy to mark another Lee's off the list but would never come back to this location.  I would drive booze across the valley then stop at this particular location.  The prices are everything promised but....be wary of angry visitors, and clerks with attitude.
