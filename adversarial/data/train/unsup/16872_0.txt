I'm not gonna lie. I went to Gee Beauty for my brows after I saw Natalie on a reality TV show. Ya, that's how I roll.\n\nI needed threading because I was on a medication that made waxing impossible (as in it would have ripped my skin off... attractive) and when I told Natalie what my needs were, she was responsive and pleasant. I also told her that my last experience was with an Persian woman who charged $10 but removed a good 75% of my eyebrows.\n\nI've always been happy with my brows and I have since had other treatments, including a facial and underarm waxing. The women that work there are awesome (Sabrina the receiptionist especially), and I have never been unhappy with a service.\n\nAll I can say to some of the reviewers here is \"Judge not, lest ye be judged.\" Ironic coming from an atheist, I know, but even Biblical sayings have universal truth. So you've been to Gee and felt \"out of place.\" So... were you MADE to feel that way or did you put that on yourself? I am like the least fashionable person I know. I show up there in yoga pants and a bandana in my hair. I am fat and I ride a scooter. Don't think for a second that the Gee chix give you or your outfit a second thought. I am always treated with kindness when I walk in the doors, but that's probably because I rock.
