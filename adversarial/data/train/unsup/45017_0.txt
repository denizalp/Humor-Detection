This is a very beautiful park that's very family friendly. There's a golf course for people to play golf, an amusement park with food and rides (carousel, mini-rollercoaster, mini-train on railroad tracks, swings, etc) for kids and their families, a lake that can be traversed with rented foot paddle boats, fishing areas, designated areas for birthday parties, bbqs, etc, and a bunch of other community based additions. Plenty of birds, ducks, and dogs roam the park to give this place an overall great nature and community feel.
