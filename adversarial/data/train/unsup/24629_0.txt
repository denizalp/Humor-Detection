I really enjoyed our visit to this Archery of entertainment. I highly recommend giving this a try on your next trip to Las Vegas or in your neighborhood if they have it. My first time doing it and it became addictive right away. Definitely got the competitive juices going lol After the first 30 minutes I thought I was Green Arrow from the CW network lol  With rental it is about Thirteen dollars per hour. The staff that was on the range floor and were great. Friendly, knowledgeable, and very helpful with everyone. They stressed safety and was very encouraging to new shooters who sucked in the beginning like myself. lol The mood is very positive and intense with decent music playing. A mix of all types of music.\n\nThere is a waiting room area with a large TV, a Wii, magazines, a chess set and couches. There are also seats in the back of the range. \n\nOne negative is that you have very limited space per shooter so its pretty tight in there lol not much elbow room at all but other than that great experience. I will definitely do this more often.
