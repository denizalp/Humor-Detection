Beautiful hotel with large suites and great amenities. One of the most beautiful ones on the strip in my opinion. Check in and check out was fast and easy and even though we were just there for two nights, it was worth it. The restaurants are great an plentiful and the tables are lucky. Good choice of clubs\/lounges as well. Definitely recommend a stay here if you are in Vegas!
