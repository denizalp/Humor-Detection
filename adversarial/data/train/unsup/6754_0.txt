Pittsburgh is a place of beauty.  One where you have to search for vantage points to view it from many different angles.  Each vantage point gives you a different perspective of how Pittsburgh's beauty can differ.\n\nI have viewed the skyline of Pittsburgh from above on many different occasions.  Nearby Mt. Washington is an excellent place, and when you fly over the city when returning to the airport, that is amazing.  But the West End Overlook quite possibly gives you the best vantage point of viewing the city from above.  You get more for your viewing pleasure.\n\nI have known about this overlook for some time, but never had been here.  In my opinion viewing the city at night is the best.  Lights glimmering off the river, the noise somewhat muted, and great opportunities for some panoramic photos.  \n\nI have known of a few people to have their weddings up here in the past.  That is how I knew this placed looked, but seeing it in person it pretty wonderful.\n\nOne thing to note, if you do decided to visit at night, bring some bug spray.
