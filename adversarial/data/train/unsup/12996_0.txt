Much of what is right in the world is on the chalkboard and on your plate at Hoof Cafe.  \n\nFresh sausage, kraut mixed with meat and topped by benedict crushing beautiful egg orbs accompanied by delightfully perfectly crisp pork belly pastrami.  \n\nI'd recommend selling your domicile and moving in upstairs.
