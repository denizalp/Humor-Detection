I hate i have to give a place a bad rating over eggs and bad services but this is the case here.\n\n\nI was in town visiting my family and my sister suggested this diner for breakfast. We get there in order a grand slam meal that includes 2 eggs. She asked the typical question \"how would you like your eggs\" and my sister said boiled. The waitress leaves with the order and return to let us know that they do not have any eggs boiled. She offers to cook them a different way. My sister explains that she only eats her eggs boiled so cooking them a different way is not a solution  and ask if she can substitute them for something else. The waitress of course says no substitution.\n\nWe asked how do you have eggs but not boiled eggs - She explains that they usually do but the prep did not boil any eggs that morning so therefore they do not have any and again all she can do is cook them a different way - So I again I repeat \"she only eats her eggs boiled\" . The waitress then rudely replies \"That is not my fault she only eats boiled eggs\".  I then state \"and it is not our fault that you serve boil eggs but for whatever reason do no have them to serve therefore a substitution seems plausible in this instance\".  Again very rudely she replies \"Look there is nothing i can do for you\" and walks away. We just all look at each other in astonishment and get up and walk away. She yells out to us \"Bye have a great day\"\n\nTwo words : unprofessional and tacky
