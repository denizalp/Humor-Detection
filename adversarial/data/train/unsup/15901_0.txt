I am eating pulled pork as I write  this review...the keyboard is now sticky with delicious BBQ sauce.  \nI've gone to their Downtown Phoenix location 2 times now, and hope that they continue to do well so that I can enjoy their food, time and time again. \nThe owner is always super friendly when I come in.  Always has good recommendations and always as great food waiting for me. \nPLEASE support this business.  I NEED BBQ DOWNTOWN, and you do too.\nI will be back.
