New hotel. Clean. But whoever designed this hotel did a horrible job. 2 slow elevators and far too many rooms. Waiting 10 minutes for an elevator is not ok. Horrible. 6 stories is too many stairs. \n\nKids running up and down the halls. Very loud. You can hear everything outside the windows too.   \n\nOverly crowded in the common areas. Bad  design.
