A ski chalet\/mountain lodge on a flat corner lot in the heart of the club scene in little old Scottsdale, Arizona. \nThat's what The Lodge is...does it work for you?\nI don't know...it doesn't really work for me.\nI come from ski chalet and mountain lodge-ville, originally...I have spent so very much time in them, so I kinda know whereof I speak:)\nWhen you walk into a log cabin up there, it really is a log cabin, not a remodeled First Watch (with stucco on the outside and faux log's for wall treatments inside...BTW, as a side note, The Lodge must have bought all the mints from First Watch when they took over...exactly the same mints on the way out the door:)\nAnd finally, when it's 102 in the shade, pretty much the last place I want to be is in a \"cozy\" log cabin...that's a place for warming up apr√®s ski, by the big fire, drinking beer and schnapps' until your long underwear melts:)\nThe whole feel is a just a little off...like sushi at Houston's (no, I'm never getting off that one:)\nI needed lunch today and I thought about trying The Lodge. \nThe last time I had lunch at a place with the word \"Lodge\" in its name, it was halfway down one of the back runs at Park City...it was also 5 degrees with a dry, powdery snow falling.\nIt's a brisk 85 today in Scottsdale...certainly a cold snap for this time of year, so I thought \"what better way to warm my bones than a visit to my local ski lodge\":)\nI was going to try to schuss over to The Lodge, but my ski's are in storage, so I bundled up and walked over.\nThe Lodge has a reasonable menu...in fact the menu is an awful lot like the menu at that little lodge off McConkey's Chair at Park City...burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc.\nI ate at the bar and had a Chicken Club sandwich that was OK, along with string fries and a drink for $9.75, not including tip (BTW, the service was very good at the bar and I tipped generously:).\nSo the prices at The Lodge are way better than buying a chicken sandwich in Utah...I don't think I got out of that place for less than $20 for lunch for one...what are you gonna do...it's cold, you're hungry and they are the only game on that part of the mountain:)\nI understand the prices are even better at happy hour...good for them:)\nAll in all, The Lodge is really pretty average, in terms of food and service...they are fine...just fine.\nI don't know how the concept of mountain lodge will finally play out in a desert town, but I know where to head when the snow flies this winter:)
