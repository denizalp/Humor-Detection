I just want to say that this was a great experience with a family owned business that took great care of us.  They were very friendly and easy to work with!  We got a great deal on the spa, they arranged everything including the delivery and electrician and even took my old one away!   We are very pleased with the excellent customer service\/timely delivery and hook up and would highly recommend Renaissance pools to anyone! By the way, the spa is awesome too, thanks again!!!
