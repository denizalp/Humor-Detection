I was referred to Annie by two close friends however my experience was terrible. I brought my engagement dress to her entrusting that she was experienced and it would be taken in alittle with flawless results.. that wasn't the case. The $45 I spent to get a dress returned without my belt and with a pucker on the side of the dress that was in-fact visible to the eye because my photographer noticed it. My mistake was leaving there without looking at the dress before I paid. Would never take anything from my wardrobe to her again .. Thank God this wasn't my wedding gown.
