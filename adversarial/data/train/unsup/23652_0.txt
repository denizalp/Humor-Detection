For my 200th review, wow!  I am reviewing an amazing Greek gyro place.  \n\nAbout a decade ago, I started coming to Kyklos where I met an awesome & wholesome Greek family who ran this place.  Three brothers.  The menu even had.  Picture of them as babies to now.  It was so sweet.  \n\nIt is located in the food court, but their food is so much more than just a 'fast food' food court stop.  It should be in its own building as a Greek restaurant!  The gyro, hummus, baklava, Dolomites, & so much more are the BEST!  I promise you so.  \n\nThe meat is so fresh & so is the pita.  Everything is.  \n\nI took one star off cause the young man working for them this morning was very rude.  I even told him that I knew the family very well & he still was rude.  Wake up kid.  Put a smile on your face.
