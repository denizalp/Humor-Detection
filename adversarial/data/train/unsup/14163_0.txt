My girlfriend and I were warmly welcomed by our server and every aspect was great until I ordered a cocktail. The cocktail was supposed to contain 2 Oz of white rum and 1 Oz of hpnotiq with sprite as a mixer. Served in an 8 Oz glass, I literally  couldn't taste the liquor and there was maybe 1\/4 Oz of hpnotiq. No big deal, I let the server know that the drink was incorrectly made, she offered a new drink but I decided against it. When the check was dropped I noticed the $7 drink charge was not taken off. I work in the industry, I very rarely make a complaint but I let her know that I felt I shouldn't be charged for the cocktail. A few moments later I am aggressively approached by a man who was apparently the owner. Before I could even get a word in he began to go on a rant about how wrong I was, how he ran the place flawlessly, and eventually started raising his voice towards me. I was so thrown off about how aggressive, egotistical and arrogant that this so called owner was that I could hardly respond. After arguing with him (I maintained a professional tone and polite word choice) this guy just gets more and more aggressive. He eventually only gave me half off my drink that he horribly poured with his own two hands that are apparently incapable of making mistakes. Absolutely the most unprofessional, unpleasant, arrogant owner\/manager I have ever encountered. The food was good, our service was flawless. We'll never be back because of this man, who by the way never introduced himself. \nP.S. the owner had no idea what white rum was. Yep, the same owner who apparently knows how to make a flawless cocktail. This guy pulled out a bottle of Malibu because it's rum with a white label, I stopped him and pointed out the correct bottle. What a joke.
