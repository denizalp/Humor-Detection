Solid 3 1\/2 stars!\n\nWhat?  Restaurant promoting fresh, locally sourced ingredients...open 24 hours a day?  In the middle of a hotel casino??  Now that's a big 1st.  For what it's worth, Farm was definitely A-OK.\n\nWifey and I came on a date night with a nice $10 off dining coupon from Aliante Casino in hand.  Ha ha...yep cheap date!  Wasn't feeling the buffet, didn't want Mexican food or tapas, didn't want food court fare, couldn't afford the steakhouse (LOL)...so we ended up at the only choice left, Farm.  And for a Friday night it was actually a near packed house!  Ended up waiting 15 minutes or so for a table.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant it does feel pretty homey.  Reminiscent of I guess an actual farm, or at least some country living.  Their menu is definitely very American, lots of down-home comfort dishes, with breakfast being served all day long.  They also have a lunch menu & dinner menu.\n\nAfter much debate on the dinner menu (there were a lot of great sounding choices), we ordered:\n\n*Fried Chicken ($11.49) - subbed with fresh sautéed seasonal veggies, also comes with coleslaw\n*Fish & Chips ($10.29) - beer battered cod, French fries, coleslaw\n\nCaveat about the Fried Chicken - it takes nearly 25 minutes for this dish!  It even says it on the menu to allow the time for it to be cooked.  According to the waitress, the chefs actually cook each platter TO ORDER.  So don't order the Fried Chicken if you're in a rush!  She wasn't kidding though, that chicken came out piping HOT.  For sure it was fresh out of the fryer!  Wifey had to give it a few minutes to actually cool down some so she could eat it.  But wow, does it make all the difference!  Farm's Fried Chicken is very tasty!  Good crust, moist on the inside, flavorful on the outside.  Generous serving too with 4 nice sized pieces.  Delicious with a splash of Tabasco & a dip of ketchup!  Sautéed veggies and the coleslaw were average, nothing to write home about.\n\nThe Fish & Chips were good as well!  Thankfully battered & cooked fresh, they came out hot to the touch.  Batter wasn't too heavy, cod inside was moist & flaky.  Pieces were large as well!  Had no complaints when I was chowin' down...a splash of malt vinegar & a touch of tartar sauce made the meal complete.  Probably could have taken it up a notch if the tartar sauce was house-made instead of bottled.  The chips weren't really CHIPS, they were well...they were French fries.  So not totally authentic but oh well.  Wifey was right on the coleslaw though, doesn't really do anything.\n\nRather enjoyed the meal here at Farm, I have no real complaints.  Could of course improve, but it's better than a handful of diner\/restaurants I've been too since living here in LV.  Best part of the meal though?  The price!  After our coupon, dinner only set me back $17 and change after tax & tip.  NOICE!!  More money to spend on the slot machines!  Yes, literally right outside the Farm entrance...no more than 10 steps away, are slot machines waiting to make you a BAZILLIONAIRE.  OK, probably not.\n\nFarm, oh yeah I'll be back!  I got another coupon this month!  Ha!
