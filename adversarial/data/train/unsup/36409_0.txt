What a great spot for outside lounging! With plenty of seat choices and wind chimes, we could have relaxed all day and snacked here on tons of options. We enjoyed the inside deco too but on a nice day in Arizona, who sits inside?  \n\nWe only stopped in for snacks - a chocolate chip cookie for me a red velvet cupcake for him. Both were delicious. \n\nOverall: A\nCan't wait to try more on this menu. Fingers crossed.
