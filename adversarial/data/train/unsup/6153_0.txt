My people ate breakfast here three days in a row in mid-May, with no complaints, so it must have been good. My experience was for the dinner buffet on a Thursday evening. Our server was attentive with drinks & clearing plates. But the buffet was the star!\n\nI really have zero complaints about the food on the dinner buffet. If you know me, that's a bit unusual. Sometimes buffets *phone in* common dishes, but I didn't notice that here. Literally every single thing I tried was delicious. While I do love to be critical, my only *note* would be to include more vegetables &\/or non-meat entrees. I only say this because I noticed my plate was nearly all meats. But, I'm a picky eater, so... \n\nThis was my only buffet experience during my most-recent Las Vegas trip, so I may be slightly biased. With that in mind, know that I'm not a buffet fan. Bayside Buffet was an excellent buffet dinner, and I actually *almost* regret missing the breakfast spread each morning, except that I enjoy sleeping.
