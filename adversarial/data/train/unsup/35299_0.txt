How disappointing this place turned out to be.\n\nWe arrived a bit early for our reservation, so we went to the bar to grab a drink.  The drink was nice and strong, but I suspect they do that so you don't complain about anything else.\n\nI ordered a cake to be delivered, which it did.  I had to ask the host if it had arrived, even though days earlier, they said they would make a note of it in our reservation.\n\nThe wait staff barely said 5 words to us.  Seemed like they were being forced to work under sweat shop conditions or had no grasp of the English language.  No idea, they never communicated to us.\n\nThe accordion player was a 90 year old man who did the same \"act\" to everyone.  I felt bad for him.  Being as that I had ordered a cake for a birthday, you would have expected him to sing happy birthday.  So sad. So much potential, but it fell flat on its face. \n\nThe garlic bread was soggy and old.  The salad was drenched in so much vinegar and oil.  The lasagne and other dish we ordered was very bland and lacked flavor.  You could tell they just made a bunch of food ahead of time and just reheated it.\n\nI had to track down someone to find out when the cake was going to come, since we had finished our dinner.  It finally came, after we were about to leave.\n\nAs the wait staff, who still has not spoken more than a few words to us, cleared our table, the waiter dumped a full glass of water into my crotch.  He handed me towels.  No apology whatsoever.  \n\nI thought this would be a fun, quirky place to celebrate a birthday.  BIG MISTAKE!\n\nOh, they let you take your wine from your table in Styrofoam glasses...classy...\n\nThis truly is a HOLE IN THE WALL...  \n\nSo much potential... it failed.. failed big time.\n\nI walked out of there full, but not satisfied.  Oh, and with a wet crotch.  \n\nThis is not a fake post... it had better not be removed by management... they should take note, and fix the issues.
