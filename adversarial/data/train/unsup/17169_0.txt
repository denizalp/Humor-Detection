I always make reservations at one fine dining restaurant for every trip my husband and I take together. During our most recent trip to Vegas, I chose Picasso, and it turned out to be a great choice.\n\nThere was more than one tasting menu to choose from, so my husband and I each chose a different one so we can spread out our options. My husband ordered the Poached Oysters, Tuna Tartare, and Sauteed Medallions of Fallow Deer off of the Prix Fixe menu (4 courses). All three dishes were delicious, especially the poached oysters topped with caviar. \n\nI ordered the Menu Degustation (5 courses), which came with Maine Lobster Salad, Pan Seared Scallop, Sauteed Steak of \"A\" Foie Gras, and Sauteed Filet of Halibut. My favorite dish of the night was the foie gras--so rich and fatty, and the mandarin confit paired so nicely with it! Unfortunately, the halibut was the least interesting dish of the night and it was actually quite dry.\n\nFor dessert, we had the Chocolate Bread Pudding and Banded Angel Food Cake. Both desserts were plated beautifully, and I loved the combination of the flavors and textures in each one.\n\nThe dinner ended with chocolates and sweets, but we were so full we couldn't take another bite. The staff ended up packing that up for us and added additional sweets to the box. Upon leaving the restaurant, we were also each given a box of muffins.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and attentive. The staff was quick to refill our drinks and bring out each course. It seemed a little too quick, because I felt rushed throughout the entire dinner. But to be fair, we were 15 minutes late for our reservation and the kitchen was technically closed by the time we got there. I definitely recommend dining here for a special night, and try to get a seat next to the window so you can watch the fountain water show as you are eating.
