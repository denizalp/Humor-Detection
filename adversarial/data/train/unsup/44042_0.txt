Huge Beatles fan here so maybe it was the years of built up anticipation of combining the awe of Cirque with the greatest group of all time that lead to a 3-star rating. \n\nThe yelpers who said the show lacked the \"wow factor\" hit it right on the head. 90% of the show seemed like the level of choreography a high school could put on with a heightened costume budget.  \n\nAfter seeing 5 other cirque shows, this one let me down. I noticed a lot of the 5 star reviews came from people who had yet to see a cirque show and this was their first.
