We had a really positive experience here.  Definitely pleasantly surprised by the quality and complexity of the food, and also completely intrigued by the social dynamic of eating in complete darkness. Our waiter, Kenny, made it much more organic and less \"gimmicky\" than it could have been with good service, detailed descriptions of how to make the most of it, and especially by joining in on our jokes as we got past the uncomfortable part of being in total darkness.  Ask for him if you've booked!
