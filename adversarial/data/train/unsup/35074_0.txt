This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The food is delicious, in abundant quantities and always an interesting selection. It is a small, hole in the wall kind of place and the seating is limited. The have a backyard patio which is nice and quiet. The lamb wrap and the corn chowder soup are amongst my favoruite dishes.
