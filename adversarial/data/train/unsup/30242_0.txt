I found Rebecca Owen to be extremely honest, upfront and calls as she sees it. I don't need all the hoopla. She understands the value not only in regards to budget but the extreme value of time. I've used Ms. Owen twice, once for personal many years ago and again for a family member. Each time she was efficient and everything went smoothly. I would not and have not hesitated referring friends, co-workers and family members to Rebecca.
