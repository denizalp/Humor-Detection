Food is incredibly delicious.  This location does it right. The Prospect Avenue location has SEVERELY disappointed me an my colleagues. Waiters can't pour wine for guests and have to wait (while food gets cold) for a drink...takes tooooo long.  Food is way underrated on Prospect.  However, completely different story on Chagrin, Beachwood.  Although they promote great beef, the seafood is delicious.  Waitress was so nice, knowledgeable and accommodating.  AVOID the downtown location and head to Beachwood.  More options than this farce downtown.
