My friend had this company for her wedding and while the dinner was wonderful, she got completely screwed on the pass horsdoeuvres. The apps and drink orders were supposed to get back to the bridal and groomsman and they never were, so we all went hungry going into the night. We all had to go order our own drinks from the bar without any help from the paid staff. The groom was even yelled at for trying to grab a breadstick when starving. Thennnnnn when this issue was brought up to the company they the family shouldn't have to pay for this they denied ever agreeing to feed the party, which was a total lie. So the groom and bride had to pay for passed horsdoeuvres that never got to 25 people. I would not recommend this company because of this. If you want to use your money wisely, go with someone who will respect you and your day.  Gail, the woman who went back and forth with us on this issue was not helpful and really put a bad taste in everyone's mouths about the entire catering experience.
