Took the family for some burgers and fries after the first day of moving.  We were starving!  Ordering was easy and per the receipt, everything was ordered correctly.  We didn't have to wait long.  We got our food and started to dig in, and my husbands burger was all wrong.  He asked for a little bacon cheeseburger all the way except tomatoes and ketchup.  The receipt also reflected this.  It was a regular cheeseburger with ketchup and tomatoes, no bacon.  So he took the burger back to the register and told the girl.  It wasn't her fault.  She put the order in correctly.  A young man came up, I assume the manager on duty, and he was very friendly.  Offered to remake it.  He shouted to the back, \"little bacon cheese burger all the way no ketchup no tomatoes on the double!\"  It didn't take long and a new burger was out.  Husband bit into it and no bacon.  He gave up on it and just ate the burger.  We wanted more fries because a large is not enough for a hungry family of 5, so when he went to order the fries, after he paid, the manager was standing nearby and he told him what happened.  He said, \"not a big deal but thought you should know, they still didn't make it right.\"  Immediately the young man offered to compensate him for the burger.  My husband said it wasn't necessary he just wanted him to know but the young man insisted, so he refunded the burger.  While doing so a girl from the back commented that she remade the burger correctly, and had a snarky attitude about it while rolling her eyes.  So I stepped in and commented, \"no you didn't, you forgot the bacon\" and she puffed off.  Didn't care for her vibe but the manager handled it right, good customer service, and turned a 1-2 star review into a 4.  Maybe next time a 5 if they don't forget the bacon, twice.
