I'm done!  I've been here 3 times (twice for my truck and once for my wife's Mustang).  The vehicle is always dirty and they have to rewash it and end up throwing in discounted goodies to help make up for poor workmanship.\n\nToday after they had to wash my wifes car twice and waxed mine to make it right, I got in the truck to find 11 empty water bottles, 2 aluminum coke cans, two Styrofoam cups and an assortment of napkins and trash on the floor (we had just finished a road trip of sorts).  I even have one of those in-truck waste bins.  It was still over flowing with trash.  I thought, \"maybe they just forgot the inside,\" but NOPE!  They did the inside of the windows.  They vacuumed the seats and put the fragrance in.  They even ArmorAll'd the dash!  How did they miss all of the trash in the truck?\n\nDanny's prices are dirt cheap.  I wouldn't mind paying $5.00 to $10.00 more if they could just do the job right the first time.  I don't have all day to be their Quality Control Auditor and they certainly aren't paying me to do it either!\n\nTAKE A HIKE DANNY!  WE ARE DONE WITH YOU!\n\nDoes anybody know of a good car wash place in North Phoenix \/ Scottsdale?
