This man is absolutely amazing! I know how hard it is to find a good doctor for your kids but I was lucky enough to have him find me and be our first try-- and be amazing!\n\nI had my son at Centennial Hospital and hadn't thought much into who my son's pediatric doctor would be until I had him. Dr. Ky was the doctor on duty the next morning and came and introduced himself to me and I automatically liked him and we decided to follow up with him for my son's 1 week. He is also covered under our insurance so even better! He is very thorough and kind, listens to everything you have to say and ask questions. Seeing him for appointments is also pretty quick (usually in, appointment done, and out under an hour max.). Out of the offices he works at, Summerlin Hospital is a lot better staff-wise (my past reviews highlight why I hate the Centennial location-- not his fault). I 10\/10 definitely recommend him!
