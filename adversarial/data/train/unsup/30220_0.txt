Aladdins is a staple in my food pyramid. I have eaten in a few times and the staff has always been pleasant. But I usually get this to go. Their hummus is creamy and some of the best I have ever had. I'm a creature of habit and usual always stick with the beef shawarma wrap or the falafel wrap. Some of the best middle eastern food around! Ask for some hot sauce on the side if you love spice!
