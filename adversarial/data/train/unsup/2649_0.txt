When you're in Philly, driving through little Italy, the pungent aroma of garlic permeates the city streets.\nThink about that for a second.\n\nJust exactly how much Italian food needs to be cooking at the same time to stink-up entire city blocks? A lot right?\n\nWell when you walk into Carrabba's, you don't smell shit. \nNot garlic.\nOr spaghetti sauce.\nZippo.\n\nHow is it that an entire fucking neighborhood can stink like Italian food and one 'Italian' restaurant in west Phoenix has the faint smell of nada?\n\nI ordered the Italian Chopped Salad.\nIt was really good.\n\nI wanted so badly to smell that aroma that used to stench-up my mom's house.\nIt didn't happen.\nDisappointment on the aroma level, if that's even a category. \nFood and friendly service - high marks.
