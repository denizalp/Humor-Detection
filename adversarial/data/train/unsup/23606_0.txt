We rented a car from FOX for our budget trip cuz it was hella cheap. I'll say you get what you pay for.  We were expecting a 96' 2 door Geo or something based on our first impression...being far away from the airport and the caddy shack place they call their office, but instead, a brand new 2009 Ford Focus waiting for us....just fresh off the car wash. We were actually shocked. Then said \"Awesome!\" considering we only paid $50 for 4 days. There was only 80 miles on the odometer. The car was extremely clean and still had a strong scent of the new car smell.\n\nPros: \n- Cheap, cheap, cheap\n- Brand new car\n- Didn't have to wait too much...maybe 5 minutes?\n- Reasonable if you are on a budget.\n\nCons:\n- Main place In a place far, far away. You actually have to take a shuttle from the rental car place, after you take the rental car shuttle from the airport.\n- Main office is just a portable. Looks kinda' scammish but after checking our credit card statement online....whew, no extra wierd charges.
