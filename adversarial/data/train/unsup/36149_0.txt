I dropped by Harumi sushi for a quick dinner, around 8pm. It seemed pretty busy but I got my food quickly. You order off a paper menu, checking things off. I had a three mini roll combo and two types of nigiri: scallops and seared tuna. \n\nI didn't love the rolls but the nigiri were good, with fresh fish and good proportioning between rice and fish. For a quick, no frills sushi dinner, I would be back, but would stick to nigiri. The purple rice was fun and different - I prefer white rice but they pull it off okay.
