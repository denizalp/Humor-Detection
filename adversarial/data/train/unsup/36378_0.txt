My dining companion and I have been here several times over the past few years. The food is consistently good. I usually get the dolsot bibimpap, which is excellent. It comes with six add-ons including kimchi and pickled red onions-delicious! It is a low-key place--you can escape the busy restaurants of Old Town Scottsdale. We will definitely be back!
