I purchased a mandoline set from this store. I used it once and realized how poorly it was made. Food could easily get stuck in a gap behind the blade and it was really difficult to clean. \n\nI took it back for a refund so I could purchase one that didn't have that design flaw. The store manager refused to give me a full refund claiming that ALL of them have the same problem. Not knowing any better, I believed him and accepted store credits.\n\nThe same week, I purchased an Oxo mandoline for about the same amount. It was so well made that I could clean it just by rinsing it under the tap.\n\nThe arrogant manager obviously didn't know how ignorant he was.
