The best part about Fresh Market may be the fact that not many people know it exists. Unlike the chaos and anarchy that is Trader Joe's, you can hear yourself think in Fresh Market. My first time there was almost a therapy session. \n\nFresh market is small, but it has tons of options. Pretty much anything you need: deli, produce, meats, booze, cleaning supplies, etc. They even have a bulk candy\/nuts section, which is awesome.  It may not be as impressive as some other grocery stores, but it should do. \n\nHopefully it stays under the radar, so I can selfishly enjoy it by myself.
