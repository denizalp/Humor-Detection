This Review is for UNITED CARGO, not United Airlines passenger service. It was a separate listing & Yelp combined the Cargo reviews with the Airlines reviews. \nI would NEVER give United Airlines 5 stars. \n\nWe picked up our second German Shepherd Dog at the United Air Cargo location. Our experience this time was as good & maybe even better than the first time. \nOur new boy came off the plane & was delivered to air cargo Location so quickly & in perfect shape.the two girls behind the counter were lovely. Sorry I did not remember their names. \nThe nice guy helped me take apart the crate & brought it out to the car. \n\nThey all came outside to admire our new guy & tell us how beautiful he is. \n\nDefinitely ship your treasured pets via United Air Cargo. Climate controlled & great Pet Care & Customer Service in Las Vegas!!!\n\nThey are So Kind!!!
