I saw this place on facebook and it looked great, so I decided to give it a try, unfortunately I check in at 6:45 pm for a half leg wax and a regular pedicure, they told me to wait 5-10 mins it is 7:18 pm already and nobody has ask for my name or to pick a nail color at all... I am seating right in front of the reception and oh men.... 5 girls past by to pay and all of them either complaint for the exaggerated price, another one was charge 6 dollars extra charge for using her debit card, they do not accept discover or American express either.  I ask how much for my half leg wax and the receptionist told me that it is depend of the person who does it they put the price WTH?! There are 4 other girls waiting like me also and same thing they check in with the receptionist and she tell them to take a seat and that it is. This place just opened and already with all this caos. No thank you I'll pass! \n\n(( I think you are confusing me with another person Asia... I did not got any services because I left your place)) you may have good luck in your year too.
