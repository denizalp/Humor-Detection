Ah excuse me? Am I the only one bothered by the way they make their omelette's here? I ordered breakfast here this morning and was mortified when I saw the cook about to place my omelette in the microwave to melt the cheese!  He was shocked when I told him to stop.\nI know Microwave foods has become an integral part of modern life, but you don't ruin an omelette by nuking it after you cook it in the grill. That's just weird.
