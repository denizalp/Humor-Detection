4\/21\/11\n\nHeard about this place from coworkers who all commented on how tiny it was.  And though they were correct (the space is small), I liked the layout of the bar, women's restroom, VIP tables, and patio.  Thanks to 98.7 The Peak, my group of 6 was able to secure a VIP table (we chose one of two silver-curtained tables) with free appetizers (3 max.), which helped out a lot in terms of controlling costs, as drinks were pricy (which is to be expected from a resort nightclub)!  Thursdays are \"Ladies' Night,\" which means no cover charge for women and drink \"specials\" from 6:30p to 8p.  Drinks include $3 domestic bottles of beer, $5 glasses of wine (choice of 2 reds and 2 whites, Sycamore wine), and $8 martinis.  Shots were $9 each (!!), and our group of 6 had 3 rounds of Pineapple Upside-Downs, B-52s, and Butterscotch!  Mmm!\n\nWe were there from 6:30p through 10p, and there were only about five groups until The Peak's raffle at 8p commenced and ended, and then there were pretty much just two groups- mine and another of about five.  (I'm guessing they also won a VIP pass, courtesy of the station.)  Cuz mentioned that VIP passes can be found on the website, BUT we were able to try the Calamari (w\/ spicy aioli) and the Beijing chicken nachos (w\/ crispy wonton strips, hoisin bbq'd chicken, and Asian guacamole).  We all LOVED the calamari, while the nachos were met w\/ mixed views.  I think the crispy wonton strips were the culprits w\/ the rest of my group-- I actually liked the dish, although my request to have the guacamole \"on the side,\" I'm guessing, went unheeded; The lights were turned down very low, and we couldn't see what we were eating.  :(  I love avocados, but they don't love me, and I am paying quite a price for either the bartender's or the kitchen's carelessness AND my recklessness for trying it (w\/out being able to see what I was eating) for the next few days!\n\nBartender Bob, who was flying solo, was friendly and attentive, but as the afternoon turned into night, he began to get bogged down w\/ drink and food requests.  (He brought over our first round of shots, but we had to take the next three rounds back to our table ourselves; my second order of calamari was forgotten; and I had to remind him of it again about an hour later).  We had a good time, even though Airia didn't start to fill up until just when we were ready to leave (around 10p).  Would I come back again?  Probably not, unless I win another VIP table pass w\/ free apps AND complimentary B-52s!  ;)
