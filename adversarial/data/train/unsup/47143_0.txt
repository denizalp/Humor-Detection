My experience at this great little breakfast place was very positive for my first visit. I am looking forward to going back again. Service was excellent friendly staff food delicious and many choices and healthy eating.  It was comfortable and relaxing and not noisy. I actually felt like we were on vacation sitting there it was fun.
