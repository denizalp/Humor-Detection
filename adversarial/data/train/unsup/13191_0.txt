Our room wasn't ready when we checked in at the Cosmopolitan.  I was hungry and had lost interested in watching the Colts get destroyed by the Bills, so we decided to grab lunch at D.O.C.G. Enoteca.  D.O.C.G. Enoteca had added lunch service since our last visit to Las Vegas.  We'd eaten dinner at Scott Conant's other place, Scarpetta, and had thoroughly enjoyed it, so we figured D.O.C.G. Enoteca was a pretty sure bet.\n\nIt was early in their lunch service and the early NFL games were still in full swing, so the dining room was virtually empty.  We opted to sit at the bar where we were warmly greeted and capably attended to by David, our bartender\/server.  I started off with a cocktail, the Sicilian Fashion ($14), a riff on the classic Old Fashioned made with Elijah Craig, Solerno blood orange liqueur, and muddled orange and cherries.  It was a good drink to kick off my Vegas vacation.  For lunch, I had the Half Sandwich & Salad or Soup ($10) choosing the Porchetta sandwich and \"D.O.C.G.\" Antipasto salad.  The Porchetta was a hot pork sandwich topped with an over-easy egg.  It was messy, but a savory and delicious sammy!  The salad; a mix of Antipasto standards like Parmesan-Reggiano cheese, thinly sliced Italian meats, and peppery Arugula; was no slouch either.\n\nBottom line:  Sure, you could go to Panera and get their Pick Two for a couple of bucks less.  However, you'd be missing out on one of the best lunch values to be found at a Strip property.  The Porchetta and Antipasto salad duo was delicious, satisfying, and a veritable steal for the price.  Top it all off with a well-made cocktail and I was sold.  I'm a big fan.
