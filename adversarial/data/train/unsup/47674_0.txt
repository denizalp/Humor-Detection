The best 24-hour cafe in a vegas casino on the strip. The food is pretty awesome, decently priced, and the setting is what you expect from the Wynn.\n\nThe food here is breakfast and lunch fare. I really like the Tandoori chicken wrap and the greek salad. They pull both of those off very well. Every friend I bring here ends up leaving satisfied with the food. None of it is mind-blowing, but its solid, reliable, quasi-gourmet. \n\nBut the best thing about this place is that YOU (yes...YOU!) can afford to eat at the Wynn! ...if you eat here. Granted, everything is about $3 over-priced, but you pay for the surroundings, which are Wynn-tastic.\n\nIf you sit indoors, you sit on faux-french chairs or couches, surrounded by fancy colored drapes and lighting which are familiar to the entire interior of the casino. But the real winner here is if you can eat outside on the patio. There, you sit directly beneath (and in the shade provided by)  the behemoth Wynn tower overlooking the pool area. And at the Wynn, the pool area is really worth seeing (even if you can't stay there). The table umbrellas even have misters on the corners to keep you cool when it's 108 degrees outside.
