I LOVE the staff here! My family feels welcome and my son loves his class. They are super nice, have patience and actually like being around children. I'm not sure where someone would get \"hospital-like\" atmosphere. The staff and teachers are very warm and inviting. The school has education but seems to enjoy letting kids be kids too with lots of activities. Which is what we were looking for. \n\nEasy pay system and great safety\/security. I haven't had an issue with rates but they may go up- it's a preschool and daycare not family. They are here to preform a service and are so amazing I drive 15 minutes out of my way to reach them.
