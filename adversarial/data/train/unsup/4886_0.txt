THE MENU IS HUGE!!!!!! Take a look at it online before you go and find out which section you want to choose from. Everything about this place screams fun and hilarious.

Sometimes it can get a bit noisy but just one look at the place and you won't be expecting anything else. Creative menu w\/ good service and good quality food. Everyone needs to experience Mike's!
