Okay so as far as authentic goes, this place is it. \n\nSimple but oh so tasty. I had the chiwas and the barbacoa tacos. My boyfriend had carne asada and barbacoa. The flavours on the tacos were for the most part excellent. The chiwas taco was a bit too fatty for me, so I didn't love it. I think the way to go here is to get a simple taco and add salsa and fixings after. Definitely a hidden gem! So glad I tried this place, I'll be back again soon!
