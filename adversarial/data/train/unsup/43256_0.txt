Ok truth is this really a restaurant that doubles for a place that makes beer.  Beer is not that great...Come here because I am loyal to Craft Works brands. Our bartender Chris is fantastic... He us funny energetic and works his tail off behind the bar . Makes it work coming here.... Be sure to Ask for him as he is a server as well
