I would say this is my current favorite Thai restaurant and a frequent go-to for take out. My review is based solely on the food since I have not dined in and have always opted for take out. \nThe portions are generous and price point is reasonable enough to make it a worthy option for take out. \n\nI love their chicken wings; crispy and marinated to perfection in sweet chili sauce. I do believe they have basil sauce option for the wings as well, but have yet to try it. Chicken Satay Skewers are also a great \"appetizer\", but the portion is so large that simply ordering that and a cucumber salad can be a complete meal.\n\n I am a Pad Kee Mao fanatic so it goes without saying that it is my frequent go to. They are very generous with the protein and the dish is not comprised of 95% noodles, onions and peppers like many I have tried before. I am a fan of the shrimp and chicken but they do have several other meat options as well as tofu if meat isn't your thing.\n\n I also enjoyed their Grilled Plate with pork, egg roll and fried rice...it is a pretty straight forward dish, but a great filler when you are doing family style dining. \nWe are also fans of their Panang Curry with duck (extra $5), although the up charge for duck is higher, they are very generous with the portions of duck and meat is of higher quality. Lastly. when I am in the mood for something lighter Pad Woon Sen with chicken is an excellent, light yet refreshing option. Since my pregnancies my tolerance for spicy food has gone down immensely so I have become a weenie when it comes to spicy dishes and usually opt for 1 or 2 which are just right. Thanks kids for the acid reflux so severe that led to GERD. You are a gift that keeps on giving.\n I do plan on exploring more of the menu, but it appears I have found a dish I enjoy to suit my mood and craving at that time.
