This place is awesome. Hofbrauhaus is a must visit. I had a very good time, had some great beer, a nice traditional German meal and enjoyed the ambiance of 500 plus people having their time of their life.\n\nMy idea of a Beer Garden is good beer, good food, good signing and good fun. Hofbrauhaus was all this and more. As I walked in this place it was packed to the gills, but you were able to move around. Their was a wait for tables, Plan B the bar. After a few minutes, score bar seats. Let the fun begin; the beer:\n\nHofbräu Premium Lager was very good with 5.1% alcohol by volume. Lots of body. Nice finish. \n\nHofbräu Dunkel which was a dark beer with 5.5% alcohol by volume. Lots of flavor with a little spice kick. Also very nice. Lighter than most dark beers.\n\nHofbräu Hefe Weizen was fruity with a crisp finish. Very traditional and good. Alcohol at 5.1%\n\nThe beers were all good. They were easy to drink with lots of different characteristics. Very nice. At $5.50 a half liter, great price.\n\nOfenfrischer Leberkase - Thick-cut grilled pork and beef loaf topped with a fried egg and served with German potato salad. This was absolutely delicious. The pork and beef loaf was outstanding with great flavors. Never had warm German potato salad and it was a perfect compliment to the saltiness of the meat. Tangy, salty explosion of flavors. Yum. Entree was devour in less than 2 minutes; that is how good it was.\n\nI realize that it was the weekend before Christmas, but this place was amazing with lots of fun had by a huge cross section of customers. It was as welcoming a place can be considering the huge size of the place. At different points in the evening the crowd would be signing along with the music. I know kichy, but FUN. Can't wait for a return visit and enjoy some delicious beer and food. Good job Hofbrauhaus.
