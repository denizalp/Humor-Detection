I had a coupon for this place. The massage was ok, Hardly any pressure. The worst part was my feet. I paid for a massage and a foot scrub. When she did the massage, she didn't even do the feet! My favorite part! The so called foot scrub was less than five minutes of slathering on salty liquid. Wouldn't do it again! My young son gives better massages!
