It took me a really long time to write this review for this place. I literally have only been here twice and I never plan to go back again. A few things i did not appreciate. \n\n1) The place is small, dingy, does not look too clean.\n\n2) Staff is super unorganized and look like they do not want to be there. How is it that you forget to charge me on my first visit for shots and meds for my pup, but then on the following visit ring up a bill of like over $150 and tell me that they forgot to charge me last visit so they are charging me both visits in one? \n\n3)The vet that took care of my dog was so rough. He did a scrape testing for my pup, who ended up having localized demodex mange and he literally left him a scar the size of a dime on his forehead. My dog was bleeding a bunch. My dog still is trying to grow hair on that spot but no luck yet. He also seemed to rush through all my questions and also seemed really annoyed during my appt. \n\n\nOverall their service sucked and i will not be returning.
