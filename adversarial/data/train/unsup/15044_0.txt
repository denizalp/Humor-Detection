My best friend is always raving about this place and we were nearby on a Sunday morning, starving of course. \n\nPulling in I saw a long line, I was thinking about leaving since I was on a tight schedule so I walked in an asked how long the wait time was, for two people it was only 20 minutes so I decided to stick around, for others with larger groups, the wait time was an hour, eek. In the end I only ended up waiting 10 minutes. \n\nI felt a little bit claustrophobic walking in, it was really packed and all of the tables were very close together. You could lean over and eat off of your neighbors plate! \n\nOur waitress came out quick and took our order. For my drink  I decided to go with coffee, blah! It was gross. The coffee tasted watered down like they prepared it, dumped half of it out and refilled it with water, I could get a better tasting cup at McDonald's. For my breakfast entree I went with Cora's corned beef hash, eggs over medium, and substituted the buttermilk pancakes, instead I got the red velvet pancakes.\n\nFood came out quick as well, the corned beef hash was seasoned well, tasted great, but my eggs came out over easy instead of over medium. The red velvet pancakes were mighty tasty, very fluffy and a little crisp on the outside. They were topped off with whipped cream, which went well with the cream cheese syrup. After our food came out the waitress disappeared, we were to never see her again. We were never asked how the food was or if we wanted any refills. We are very generous tippers when we get great service, on this occasion I was thinking of not even leaving a tip but I'm not that rude, she got $3 for her disappearing act! \n\nHonestly, if it weren't for the food, I would have rated this place two stars, but since the food was great (minus the eggs), they get four from me.
