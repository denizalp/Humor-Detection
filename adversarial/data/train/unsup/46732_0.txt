Love this place, I saw some complaints about no table service... Get over it, this is the way it is, many pizza places are like this. I like the owners, there very nice to us since we been going there. They do get busy so they can not devote there attention to you...\n\nThe food is delicious and it is all made when ordered so you may have to wait, but it's worth it! It is our favorite Pizza by far!\n\nThanks to my buddy Italian Tony for recommending it!
