Thanks for responding.  I do you believe in second chances. However I would like to point out that it was not the celebrity bartenders that were a problem in my instance. I literally waited in line and when I was actually at the front of the line I waited an additional 30 minutes for your bartender\/manager so he said (the one with the knot of hair on the top of his head) to run around and answer questions and speak with other workers before he came back to his line.  It was 9:10 and after watching us stand there an wait for an additional half hour he told me that even though it wasn't 10pm they were done serving free drinks. The charity ticket was from 7-10pm and your bar shut it down an hour early.  At this point... I stated to him that I had been waiting in line all this time and it didn't seem right that you ignored me at the front of the line for 30 minutes and then wanted to charge me for my very first drink.  He then stated literally that if I didn't like it I should leave and pointed towards the door.  I told him how rude I thought he was and then I proceeded to leave.  I stopped and told the doorman on my way out about the service and he just shrugged his shoulders.  Just to be clear.  I am in my 40's and I have used yelp for 5 years to find great places to eat.  However this is my very first post ever!!!!  That's how annoyed I was by the situation.
