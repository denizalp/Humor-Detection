After biting into one of these cookies, I honestly paused and thought - what is life without these? Where has this magic been all my life? Soft, moist, melt in your mouth, chocolate chip goodness. Possibly the best cookies in the GTA.\n\nFirst, pricing and how it works. Everything is by weight, even if you buy just one or two cookies. You still have the option of buying them individually, they'll just have to weight them first. You can get them boxed into half a pound, a pound (roughly around 17 to 18 cookies, at around $18.00), and so on. They also have 'cookie bouquets' for special occassions if you'd rather give someone a bouquet of cookies instead of flowers (i.e. meeee!). \n\nSecond, note that they actually have a 'cookie sale section' where you can buy a pound of cookies at a discount if you buy the 'day old' cookies (while quantities last - at around $11.00 for a pound, with approximately 17 to 18 cookies).\n\nSo I went a little nuts and bought a) a pound of the 'day old' cookies (around 18 cookies), and b) 4 individual fresh cookies (for comparison purposes, of course). The verdict: there isn't much of a difference but the day-old cookies were slightly less moist (as can be expected). Still, very delicious and at a reasonable price point.\n\nThe fresh cookies? They were out of this world. So fresh, so moist, and loaded with buttery goodness. I can't explain how delicious this was - you just have to try it out, especially the Menage A Trois and the Milk Chocolate Chip cookies. Overall, a total gem of a spot and highly, highly recommended!
