This was my first time here. I was referred over for my fibromyalgia from my primary care doctor. I had such a great experience as I was dealt with Dr.Khemka. He was just the sweetest. I felt very comfortable expressing myself, and did not feel as if I was being judged for pain meds, as i have in the past with other pain doctors in the valley. I can only hope this time around things will get better, but i feel I'm in great hands.
