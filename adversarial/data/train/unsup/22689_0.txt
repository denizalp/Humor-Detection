This review should be ZERO STARS. What a horrible guest interaction with hotel security. I was simply trying to deliver a pizza to a guest....and security tried to trespass me.   I was wearing a shirt and tie with my suit jacket in the back seat.\n\nFor them to try and trespass me is absolutely absurd. I have never been so embarrassed or have felt more violated than this experience.  These archaic dinosaur policies of this once great and historic landmark of the Las Vegas skyline will make this hotel continue its downward spiral.  This is why the property has changed hands several times in the last few years. \n\nThe CPA'S need to realize that in order to satisfy guests and locals you need to service them....not harass them.  To all the front office staff... I am your neighbor, i live in Vegas just Like you do. To treat a resident of this great city in that manner is unbelievable .  I will never step foot or recommend your place ever. Keep these business practices up and you will follow the Riviera in LV history.
