At first glance, the Safran et Cannelle may seem small. However, there is adequate seating on the second floor to accommodate many guests. \n     The service is wonderful, and the waiters are friendly and down-to-earth. They made us all feel like family. \n     Be prepared to wait for your food. It took a good 15-20 minutes for our food to arrive.\n     However, the wait is well worth the food. Safran offers a great variety of Moroccan dishes  including tajine, poulet, and couscous. You can even call 24 hours in advance to order more intricate cuisines such as lamb shoulder, and sheep head.\n     The chicken pristilla  is to die for. Our family almost got into a fight over the dish (joking). So we ordered an additional plate. \n     Overall, Safran et Cannelle was a good find. The food was delicious, and the prices were pretty fair.
