Crooks from New York. They told me $200 for belt replacement. After diagnostic They told me $3800 because they found 1000 things wrong with the car. Like not working stop light, which was true but, instead replace the light bulb which costs couple of bucks, guess what? They wanna charge me $380 for the entire break light. Then I'm sure they would just replace the light bulb and charge me for the brand new brake light. (By the way different mechanic replace the light bulb for free ) I'm will not go in to more details what they come up with, this should tell you what kinda shop is this. I told them you guys have good reviews, he responded I don't give a fuck I responded you should appreciate that you have buiesness. so he said we don't have time for so much business. Long story short I didn't want them to work on my car. They still charge me the $200 which was the price for replacing the belt. He said, was a lot of work because we have to be on the phone with your insurance and the car was standing here over night, that's why is $200. But was my mistake to leave the car there and the mistake cost me $200. So get your conclusion. If you want to be screwed that's the place to GO!
