I'm going to make this CON first as every lady should be aware of this:\n\n5. Beauty is in the eye of some DB promoter(s) at Hakkasan - This is the CON to ruin Hakkasan. Whilst in line, I assisted some girls in taking a photo of their group because front facing shots are no bueno a majority of the time. Then I overheard one of them say they had to send it to their promoter. Um all right. Odd. Then I saw another girl send a full length picture that she took of herself in her room to a promoter. Light bulb! Turned to my friend and said, \"If we have to send our pictures to our guy so we can get in, we are getting the hell out of this line because that's not cool.\"  Fortunately, we did not. Hurray for upstanding promoter even though he misspoke about girls getting in free (see Meh category)!\n\nMy suspicions were confirmed when I got back home when I had lunch with a friend who told me his friend was in Vegas  with a group of girls the same weekend and had wanted to go to Hakkasan. They got in contact with a promoter who required her to send a picture of their group to him\/her. All of the girls in their group passed but one did not make the list. So they opted not to go.\n\nI have dealt with multiple promoters (Marquee, XS, Tao...) but I have NEVER once had to send my picture to them. Nor should you have to! If the promoter wants to refuse service, they have every right to do so based on lack of ratio of boys vs girls, untimely guest list request, etc but to have to send a photo?! And they better not put out some PR BS about how they need to confirm the guest with a photo because that's what you check IDs for at the door! Plus, who knows what that skeevy promoter will end up doing with your photo! \n\nLadies, find a nice promoter who does not require this. Hakkasan, get your promoters in check!\n\n\nPros:\n\n1. MUY GRANDE- We covered three floors. The Pavilion has 2 floors and plays EDM: main stage and upper deck. \n\nThe Ling Ling lounge is hip hop. \n\nCeilings are high in both rooms so you don't feel too suffocated. Remaining 2 floors that were unseen are most likely for high rollers.\n\n2. Bars galore - did not have a problem getting to a bar and getting a drink. Drink prices pretty standard for vegas. $15 for a shot of pat-ron.\n\n3. With great space, comes great bathrooms - smart on the designers' part. Line for women's restroom minimal but I had better bathroom attendant experience at XS and Marquee. \n\n4. Got Ladies?  Pro for the Bro- I have always felt clubs had more girls than guys for obvious reason (we get in free) but there was an abnormally excess amount of women. Pickin's will be slim for she who goes to pick up a fellow. \n\n5. Elevator, what art thou? - We both got to enjoy a ride down the elevator when we exited the club. Other ladies were able to go upstairs via the elevator. A lot of the reviews on Yelp contradict this. Maybe we got lucky? But completely saved us from a grueling walk down like the one at Marquee. \n\n6. Music - both rooms: thumbs up\n\n\nMeh\n\n1. Free for the ladies? Yes. SIKE! - Waited 1.5 hours in the ladies only gl line to have to pay $20 at the door. Oh fine. Opening weekend. Ok. The price was at least $10 reduced from the price of presale which was $30 for girls. So I'm only pseudo-complaining.\n\nCons\n\n1. So maany stairs - yeah there are lots to cover if you don't get lucky with the bouncer manning the elevators. And I gather most were not lucky.\n\n2. No outdoor patio - I enjoy this aspect of XS and Marquee just because it makes the club feel more open. Sure, high ceilings make Hakkasan feel less claustrophobic but constructing an outdoor patio would have been a good idea. Perhaps there is one for the pool section of the club? We never came to this part.\n\n3. Boy, is you a high roller, know a high roller, or a money-wise guy? - For the FEW guys that ladies will meet, they will either have been wise enough to purchase pre-sale tickets for about $75 or they'll have spent a lot of time in the casino to garner the Platinum status with MGM or you know a high roller and can ride in on his\/her coat tails . Or if you're a social butterfly you'll have gathered enough friends to live the Hakkasan dream of getting a table for $2G+. There is absolutely no gl for guys. Don't know if it's true, but guy's admission was $500 at the door but we were told by our promoter that it would have at least been $100+ at the door for men. Whomp whomp. \n\n4. Where can I get my dance on? - Hakkasan's architecture is definitely catered to the table experience.
