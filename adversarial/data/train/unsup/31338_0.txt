Obviously, this isn't an eatery so much as it is an awesome bakery that serves some lunch-oriented food. Prices are on the high side, but the quality is without question. The staff are friendly and quick, a must for such a popular place.\n\nThey have a fantastic salad bar where you can mix and match whatever you like with a healthy choice of toppings. The bagels are amazing and you can get them topped with whatever you like, whether it be a fancy cream cheese, or peanut butter and jam, or egg salad.\n\nThere are tons of pastries and sweets as well, which is amazing given my sweet tooth. I have to fight hard not to buy a double chocolate croissant each time I'm there.\n\nThere are a few small round tables and chairs outside that makes a decent patio to soak up some sun during your lunch break. But you better time your visit right because they're a popular draw during the warmer months of the year.
