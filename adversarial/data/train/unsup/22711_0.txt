I often go to this theatre for its selection of movies and because I eat at many of the restaurants in the mall.  Unfortunately, I am almost always disappointed in the attitudes of the staff and the cleanliness of the floors, seats and restrooms.  It doesn't seem that being even mildly pleasant while taking someone's ticket would be so difficult, but they almost always let you know by their attitude that you are an inconvenience and they are not happy to be there.  \n\nThe concession line is unbelievably slow even when there is just one customer.  The concession area is almost always filthy.\n\nI found out why they have so many issues when I had an incident that require a manager.  Teenage kids outside the theatre were harassing customers and pressing their phones up to the windows by the bar area and taking photos of guests and flipping them off.  When I asked for security they said they had none and that outside the theatre wasn't their problem.  I had to ask for a manager 4 times.  They told me he does not like to be bothered by guests!  Finally a young man named Aris came out and told me that I was annoying him and his staff and that I should grow up.  This certainly explains why all the staff working there feels free to be rude and leave the facilities a mess.  If there was a serious security issue at this theatre I fear that it would not be contained and would quickly escalate.  Retraining of management and more attention to cleanliness would go a long way towards improving the experience.
