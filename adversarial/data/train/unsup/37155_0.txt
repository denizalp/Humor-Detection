You should be able to give 0 stars. This is the WORST customer service experience I have ever had!  Alexis there is very nice and tried to help in a terrible experience, however the store manager, Misty was not accommodating.  We ordered a wedding ring and were given vouchers for a future purchase.  They never explained how the vouchers worked and admitted that they made a mistake.  Ok - strike one, no big deal.  Then, we said we wanted to cancel the custom order that wasn't going to be made until January.  The charge for that is $600.   Really?  $600 for no work.  \nSo, we called the manager and explained the entire situation and asked if she could work with us.  No, she didn't budge.  \nI work in customer service and we sometimes loose money on one transaction to keep a good customer.  I have never given one star, but this place deserves 0.  I can't believe we didn't read the reviews before handing them our card.  All the negative reviews are spot on.  This place is awful!  I am paying the money to NEVER do business with this company again.    My family has made several purchases with this company, but this location has ruined their brand name with us.  Jared is now banned amongst my family and friends.
