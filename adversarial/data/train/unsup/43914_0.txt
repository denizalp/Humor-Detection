First time in here the other day. Went based on other yelp reviews. Close to home. Staff was super friendly and took me in relatively quickly. Needed an oil change and new to the area. I wanted a full Mobil 1 synthetic change but they didn't have the Mobil 1 filter in for my model at the time. No worries I went with the next best. Prices seem fair and are cheaper than the over priced and over selling dealership. The car was done in about 50 minutes while I waited even though initially told 30 minutes. Will repeat in the future more than likely. I had my other vehicle smog checked here in the past with much ease and success as well. Busy place with gas car wash smog oil change etc but if you can navigate the parking lot you're ok.
