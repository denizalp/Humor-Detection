If you're into pinball at all, this place is amazing. It's a big room filled with pinball machines from all eras, along with a few assorted video games (Paperboy! Tetris!) It's free to get in, and you just pay 25-75 cents depending on the game. I brought five dollars in quarters and was entertained for quite awhile. \n\nOn a related note, I wish I had $950 to blow and more space because they were selling a Ted Nugent pinball game there for that price, and you know that'd be an awesome conversation piece. Whenever someone would go into my house, it would go something like this:\n\nPerson: \"Um, why do you have a Ted Nugent pinball game?\"\n\nMe: \"It's the NUGE!\"\n\nPerson: \"Okay.\"\n\nBut I digress. Anyway, if you're in Vegas, you should check this place out. It's only a couple of miles off the strip.
