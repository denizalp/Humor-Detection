I popped into Lindo for a quick bite to eat before meeting a client. I sat at the bar and was greeted quickly and served chips with bean dip and salsa. The beans were meh. I added salt but that didn't seem to improve the flavor. The salsa was boring it had no spice. But it was complimentary so I really shouldn't complain too much. To drink I ordered a Tecate preparada, which is beer with lime, salt, clam juice and hot sauce. You can pick your beer by the way, I just felt like Tecate was a good option and it was. That drink was so good and refreshing on a hot summer day. They also have margs and a few other speciality cocktails if beer doesn't tickle your fancy.\n\nI didn't want to eat something super heavy, so I just chose a steak quesadilla. It came out in less than 5 minutes so props to the kitchen for the speedy service. It was good but nothing memorable, it was just a quesadilla. It came with a very small amount of sour cream and guacamole on the side, like a squirt of each which was disappointing. Anyway I was in and out within a half hour, and paid less than $20. Not great, not bad, just OK.
