I'd like to thank Bruce, the smooth, affable, no-pressure sales associate who hooked us up with an affordable new vacuum cleaner after our old one went kaput. We went in angry and confused and came away clear-headed and satisfied thanks to a very helpful, honest employee.\n\nDepartment stores such as Sears make me sad since they remind me of Wal-Mart's ice cold dominance.
