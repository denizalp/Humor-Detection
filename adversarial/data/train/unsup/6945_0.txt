Not an unpleasant experience however, the same as a few of the 1 & 2 star reviews on here.  If you read nothing else skip to #8 and save yourself some hassle. \n\nEmployees were pleasant and polite not really that pushy as I have experienced in other places.  Still let the \"games\" commence.  \n\nGot to dealership, \n1) They figured my trade first! drove it and took all the details FIRST.  That was an odd practice before even knowing what I wanted.\n2) Then they asked what I wanted to spend and what I wanted in terms of a car. \n3) The first car I was presented with was a near top of the line AWD model which was way above what I wanted but I asked if they could really get this for what I want, and was told they would look at making a good deal after all it was a 2012.\n4) went for a test drive for about 5 mins as the car was just about out of gas. \n5) I was presented with a non-binding statement to sign.  Basically they drafted up what I had said I wanted to pay them + my trade (low ball by 40% of blue book) and said if we can do this would I do this now.. right now... OK I said. sure. \n6) came back with a deal which took what I wanted to spend as a down payment and then $600 a month payments???? Nope\n7) stressed no payments I'm paying a large sum + my car.  That is not that unreasonable of an offer compared to the car shopping I have already experienced and offers I have had this week.  I was then told that if we do the price you want will you buy today, now... YES.  OK and I sign a new offer, but I want another test drive due to low on gas. .. Took a 30 min test drive with more fuel.   Came back answer was they could not honor the second offer they had me sign.  The offer and the decision was made by the same finance guy. \n\nREAD THIS TACTIC AND BEWARE!!!!!!\n8) more slight of hand with the figures and I was told by the sale-mans that their finance manager likes customers who play ball and if I seem to go up on my amount I am willing to pay, in turn I am seen as negotiating so they would come down on their price     LIES!   \n\nSo I looked at my bank balance, offered $1500 more expecting them to hold up their end of the bargain, I signed a new statement saying that would be my offer.... the salesman went away... When he returned I was told to come outside and check out something.  I was presented with a classic BAIT & SWITCH.   \n\nOutside sat a 1 year old used basic sorento model of the same color and 14K miles on the clock.  The car was running and ready for me to test drive.  Premeditated bait and switch.  They had me fooled from the start.  Show me something big, out of my range, then push up how much I wanted to spend and then get me into something cheap and nasty.  I have not experienced this type of sales tactic from a mainline dealer before, that was a shock, i have only heard of this game used at Ugly Duckling RIP. \n\nTo add insult to injury I was then told they could provide me with this prime sad specimen for the higher price that I earlier was extorted into volunteering under false pretenses.  When I looked at the sticker on the window their price was actually $2,500 less that I offered. \n\nThank you \nUpdate 1\/17\/13: so i get an email from a domain called contactdealer domain email saying they are the manager and wanted to know why I didn't purchase.  From my own experience and reading other reviews here I believe that this is a marketing tool used to make you think someone is actually going to listen to you.  But in all reality it seems that someone actually does take the time to read the reviews which and respond which is always good to hear, but as of 18th no response from John Thomas.. \n\nSo I will give Sands a chance to amend the situation and I will let you know how that went. Stay tuned. Email sent to John Thomas 1\/17\/13\n\n1\/21\/13 No response from the John Thomas, but that's ok I purchased a 2012 AWD silver fully loaded Saturday from another dealership at the price i wanted. \n\nI guess this dealership loves keeping it's cars more than keeping it's customers.  \n\nYou will get it one day Sands Kia. one day... if you are lucky enough.\n\n2\/20\/13 No response from emails or calls to the John Thomas, which any Monty Python enthusiast knows what that name means.  But I did get a follow up call from the sales guy seeing if i was still wanting a car.
