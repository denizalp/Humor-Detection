Giardini is a cute little Garden Store right off the Belagio Conservatory. They also have a nice selection of Nambe and other pretty gift options. I had fun wandering around and in a couple situations trying to justify a purchase for a particular home improvement idea. Yet: \n\nWhen I found myself in times of purchase\nMary Gayle's voice came to me\nSpeaking words of wisdom, let it be...\n\nMaybe next time.
