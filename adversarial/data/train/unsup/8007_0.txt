This place has gone downhill, the Doctor side and their secretaries or receptionists are extremely rude. Like, listen, I get you make $11hr but calm your little attitude down. We just went in at our set appointment time and said little twat sat there told me they were ALWAYS running late on the weekend and I would have to wait more than 45m for my appointment.... WTF? Why even schedule appointment appointments if you're always late? Doesn't that even make sense?\n\nI've been coming here for 6 years and I'm done over this little bih. Rude arse.
