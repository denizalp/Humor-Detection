Being of indian origin, and being born in the middle east, this is the closest thing to excellent lebanese food!  Very clean and wonderful service!  We ordered, shwarma platter with tabouleh and baba ghanouj, and the filafel sandwich.  Both were excellent!  So flavorful and delicious!  Highly recommend this place to anyone who is into arabic food.
