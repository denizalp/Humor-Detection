I had lunch today at Moxie's.  They have a lounge side.  I sat on the dining room side.\n\nI ordered the Double Stacked Turkey Club sandwich (minus the lettuce and cheese) with roasted baby potatoes.  It's been a while since I've had a sandwich and this was a good one!  The bread was tasty and soft and the bacon was indeed crisp.   The baby potatoes were delicious!\n\nSpenser was my server.  She was friendly and took good care of me.
