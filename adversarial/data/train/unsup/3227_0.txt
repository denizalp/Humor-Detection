This review is for the Canyon Gate Clubhouse only.\n\nSeveral of us from Friends of Red Rock Canyon were invited by the Rotary Club of West Las Vegas to put on a program for them about the book we wrote.  The club meets at Canyon Gate Country Club so I got the chance to see beyond the gates that I've driven by countless times.\n\nThe staff was very polite.  The luncheon buffet for the Rotary members and us was very good--salmon, rice, chicken, salad and some wonderful cake for dessert.\n\nThe meeting room we were in was very nicely appointed and the outdoor patio gave us a great view looking west over some of the golf course holes to Red Rock Canyon, quite a fitting view for why we were there.
