No Vegas trip is complete without a stop at this tiny oyster bar. \nCome at 2am. The wait is much more bearable.\n\nOrder the House Pan Roast. A 10 spice level is cake for those who eat spicy. Served with chicken, sausage, shrimp, and delicious crab in a creamy spicy broth. Enjoy with rice or pasta, so freakin amaze-balls!\n\nOysters on the half are on midnight happy hour special at that time. Fresh and hits the spot!\n\nOne star off because the wait is no bueno. But they always have great friendly service and the food is consistently great.
