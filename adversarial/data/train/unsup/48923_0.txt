My husband and I stayed at the Kimpton Palomar Hotel in Pheonix this past weekend.  We chose the hotel mainly because of it's location, being that it's within walking distance to the Talking Sticks Arena.  \nWhen we arrived we chose to have our car parked by the Valet, it was worth the $7.00 extra dollars vs parking it ourselves.  The gentleman who greeted us were informative and polite.  They even went out of their way to retrieve an item from the car that had been overlooked..and they brought it up to our room, SO AWESOME! \nEveryone at the front desk were very friendly.  Teri helped to check us in.  She was engaging, personable and has a great sence of humor, that's something my husband and I appreciated.  \nThere was a card, fruit tray and champagne delivered to our room after we arrived.  It was a beautiful presentation and the icing on the cake for me.  The room and hotel were very clean and nicely decorated. \nOur weekend in Pheonix was 10x more enjoyable just by staying here. Thank You to all the staff members who made our stay so memorable.  We will be back!
