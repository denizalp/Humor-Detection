Everything was amazing.  The Fall salad was light with plenty of flavor. If my wife was with me we could have split that and the entree.  Which was AMAZING!!!  Veal Schnitzel with dumplings and mushrooms plus the perfect creamy coleslaw on top.  A couldn't pass up the dessert either.  Country fried brownie.  OMG. Wha a great meal all around.  Ambience is great, low light good music.  Michael my waiter was top notch.  It was a Tuesday so it wasn't super busy but i'm sure that changes on the weekend.  If you haven't been here before you definitely need to make a trip. If I'm ever back in the area again I will certainly come back and try something else. Great job Cork & Cleaver!
