Oh, Bar in Whole Foods. You are so special to me, I didn't even know your name the first time we met. I came, we kissed and I left without leaving my number.\n\nI knew you were there, nestled somewhere amongst the many Whole Food gems soon to be offered in Camelback. When I heard Whole Foods was opening, I just had to be one of the 1st two hundred in line. (I really wanted a plant holder!) \n\nI mean, really, A BAR! Right next to my gym. Woof. Heavens. Be still my heart.\n\nSo, on opening day, I just so happened to be first in line.\n\nYeah, that happened. \n(Got my plant holder!)\n\nI'm sorry I did not know your name. My Whole Food's review on Yelp is really all about you. See?\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/whole-foods-market-phoenix-4#hrid:A0B9x4KvMLUISSOBwn3qqw\n\nDid you read it?\nNo?\n\nYou should read it. Come back. Then let's talk.\n\nOk, fine. I'll still love you (the reader) for not going back to my detailed review. Just know you're missing out. There's love for everyone. Just not enough memory for names. For that I need a pen and paper.\n\nHEADLINES\n+ Convenience factor is high  \n+ Wide diversity in beverages (beer, wine. cocktail list)\n+ Food & Drink menu very affordable\n+ Ample seating\n+ Nice employees\n+ Fresh food (Hey, this is Whole Foods!)\n+ No reservations\n+ TV's available\n+ BRING CASH TO TIP! \n   (If paying by card there is no gratuity section.)\n\nDETAILS \nIt's swell that the staff can ring you up, if you have a small\/medium order. You can also place your food order as you arrive to shop. (No need to wait long at the bar for food.)\n\nThe beer tap list is impressive. Every time I go on and on about The Bar in Whole Foods, people ask if I work there. No, the  Bar in Whole Foods just happens to have a lot of beer! LOCAL! Wine too. LOCAL!\n\nSERVICE\nFour Stars instead of Five\nService is a work in progress. Amazing efforts made, but, definitely a work in progress. It may help to sit closer to the bar to remain in staff eyesight.\n\nThank you for making grocery shopping a bubbly experience ;)
