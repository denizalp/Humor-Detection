The actual food was very good. We ordered a menu for $65 a person (without drinks),  they they served us a LOT of food for that price.  So it was a bargain for on strip.  The service was good too- attentive and inventive.  \n\nBUT!  As other yelpers have said, the wait for the plates to come out is extremely slow. It was about 30 minutes between each plate!  And during most of our meal the place was half empty. Perhaps this is a policy to encourage liquor sales?   But it left a number at our table very unhappy with what should have been a great meal.
