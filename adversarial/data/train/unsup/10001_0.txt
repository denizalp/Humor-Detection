Met up with a friend for dinner and Chou's Kitchen was the place that was picked. After checking out the menu I went with the Mongolian beef, I know pretty basic when Chou's has soo much yummy items to choose from, but it was what I was craving.\n\nThe Mongolian beef was a good dish, the meat was tender and flavorful, and the onions were perfectly cooked. But next time I am getting some soup dumplings! My friend ordered some dumplings and he did enjoy them, I had plate envy ha-ha.\n\nService was friendly and fast, this is a nice restaurant, plenty of seating. Look forward to coming back.
