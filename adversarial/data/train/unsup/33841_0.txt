Went there mid week for a bite after work.  Luckily I was there for the $1 oyster night. The bar was not busy so the service was fast and efficient. The bartender really pointed me in the right beer direction. It is nice to have some samples before you commit to a pint. I also ordered the burger.  It was clear that the beef was fresh. I really enjoyed it. All in all the service and food were excellent.
