I was a bit pizza'd off the night I came here.\n\nThere was nothing Pronto about this Pizza. They don't serve slices and aren't at all friendly about being asked. Their Gyros are not made with the actual spinning Gyro thing, which is what makes Gyros in Pitt delicious. So on the whole, I wasn't impressed by anything other than their opening hours, which are not actually reliable since they were closed up a good 40 minutes before the posted closing time on the chilly night I was here.
