This tire shop is so close to me i can walk, yet for 3 years i have never come because of the reviews ive read. I woke up one morning to see i had a flat tire and couldnt even make it to my regular shop. I tried to remive the lug nuts to put on my donut just to get me through the day but because they use the machine i was unable to do it. Pressed for time and cash, i decided to go to the 24 hour shop. When i go there..they immesiately tried to sell me a tire and being extra since i am a woman. I told them i can change myself can you just use the machine to remove the tire. I offered 5 bucks. They refused and said they could do it for $15.i tried to get them to do it for 10 shit ..im local and down the block fine..my last 15 for them the put on my donut. Fune, you cant give a bad review fir being a shity person. I recently came back here for them to put my tire on and take off of an old rim ok they charged me $20 but ok(too much for having my own tire). They said fine..it was Â°110 nowhere to sit so i had to find shade in the parking lot and i could not watch them. They took forever and when it was done i went to the grocery store. Got out and noticed ..my brand new rim had been switched...what?..why didnt i noticed this..i went home and before i said anything,my spouse said wheres our rim cause thats not it!!! I wanted ro go back but i had no prof they were just going to deny it. Because of my prior experience,i did not want to go back. They are not friendly..mean even.if you dont want tobpurchase a new tire,they immediately get an attitude. I will not be going here anymore. I feel like they took advantage of me because i am a woman!. The only good thing about this shop is they are 24 hours and having a flat tire is unpredictable.
