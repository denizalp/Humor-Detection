My kind of sushi place when I have time to take a complete lunch. Also because one of my friends jumps at the sound of Kirei Sushi and is willing to give up anything to go here. I order the chicken teriyaki mostly and wash it down with green tea (for which they charge you so you better drink the entire thing)
