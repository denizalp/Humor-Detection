Had the Bi Bim Bap and the Spicy Seafood Stew.. both were yummy! The serving size you get and what they charge is a great deal! Mama San (cook) and her husband continually checked in on us to make sure our FREE side DISHES (emphasis on free and plural on the sides)were refilled upon request and that we enjoyed our selection. This is a small and casual place packed with flavor. A must try!
