Quite the popular restaurant staple in Scarborough. If you live in Scarborough, you know about this place for sure. It's open 24 hours and has decent cheap dim sum. They also have decent cheap late night food which is a popular place coupled with cheap beers and alcohol. Food here is generally pretty cheap and good. Service is a far from perfect here. The service here always seem vary from each visit but generally it's pretty bad. If I have to go up to get tea, water and a takeout box then I shouldn't be obligated to give tip here. Many folks come here during the weekday and especially weekend mornings for cheap dim sum as it's quite popular. For dinner, they have the peking duck special which we came here for. If you spend $25 or more for dinner, the peking duck is only $10.99 which is a good deal. We ordered a variety of dishes including the Peking duck, a veggie dish, clams in blackbean sauce, sizzling plate of pork chop with and Fujian fried rice. Peking duck is spot on with the flavours and I loved the stir-fried meat they do with the meat mixed with veggies where you eat it with a lettuce wrap- simply delectable! The clams were delicious and of course the sizzling plate with pork chop with a sweet and sour sauce was really good. I didn't like the Fujian fried rice as it tasted under seasoned so this definitely fell short for me. They only accept cash and credit but not debit which is strange. There minimum requirement to use credit card is a $32 purchase which is kind of strange. Overall, a decent place for dim sum and dinner. Always love to keep coming here despite the horrendous service at times. It's the food that really keeps me coming back here.
