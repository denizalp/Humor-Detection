Okay, just as I stated before - Maria is professional and knows what she's doing.\n\nMy Italian came out in a matter of days, I guess.\nI got my Brazilian, which was interesting.\n\nIt hurt like hell. I wish I'd used that numbing cream she sells in the front first.\n\nI found myself in some weird positions, but she acted like a mother changing a diaper for the bazillionth time. It was nothing to her. Wow, what a weird analogy. I don't wear diapers, FYI.\n\nI assumed all brazilians were very thorough and they charged extra for numbing or something. Stupid little me.\n\nWell, I was surprised how quick it was. A few little hairs were left here and there. I was told most salons use tweezers or re-apply the wax strip quickly and it removes most of the remaining hairs. I had to go home and touch up and wash some wax off.\n\nAll in all, I'm going to say it was the BEST place to get a brazilian. She charges WAY less than ANYone I've seen. Also, I don't know if this is supposed to be a secret or not...\n\nBut after you've received a brazilian from Maria once, she charges you $35 instead of $50 for every visit thereafter. Nice, eh? Tell the people charging $80 to torture you and your vajenga about THAT!
