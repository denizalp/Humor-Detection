I love cupcakes! I don't know who doesn't honestly... I am always down to try a cupcake shop at least once! Unlike Sprinkles this place did not fail! I love how big the cupcakes are, the first one I ever tried was the Salted Caramel one and it was super good! I had done all my shopping and I walked past the kiosk by the garages. So I stopped and every since then... I have been hooked. \n\nI got some of these cupcakes for my boyfriend's birthday he loved them too! :)
