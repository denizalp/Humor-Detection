So this park is yet another extension on the whole LaSalle BLVD bike path. My goal is to eventually figure out the 'boundaries' of where each park ends and the next starts. This one starts at the boundary of Parc des Rapides at the LaSallel\/Verdun border. \n\nSeveral nice spots to pop a squat down by the water. Bring a picnic blanket and enjoy! \n\nThere's a look out point too, a deck overlooking the river. It's been fairly busy each time we've passed so we haven't stopped to enjoy it yet. \n\nOur dog likes it over here too, safe to be here being it's technically Verdun so she's not prohibited lol. Lots of other dogs too, enjoying the nice walk with their owners. \n\n**...We think we saw a tick today tho, crawling across our picnic blanket after Irie traipsed through the dead-long grass, so beware! Next time we're bringing the tick-kit just in case but Irie didn't get bit today...**
