Still too date my first Ramen experience in Vegas was at Monta Ramen so going too Monta Chaya brought back found memories. I hardly go too Monta not out of dislike just not someone generally likes too wait. When you have Ramen Sora right down the road not as busy and just as good if not better. Few and far between see Monta. Monta Chaya brought back all the things I first love about getting me some ramen just like back home in da islands. The shoyu ramen broth LOVE it! I love the depth of flavor and the noodles are awesome. The gyoza now that is something sorely MISS. By far all the Ramen places in town been too few but truthfully not all. Monta gyoza is league by itself. I think its cooked too right on and the filling had so much flavor. I also had the kim chee fred rice as side. It was ono. Just had right balance with the kim chee not spicy at all but well rounded with the vegetables and the sauce. I am just happy that Vegas is blessed too add another great Ramen place in town. Now with so many locations not part of town in that find some good Ramen.\n\nThe biggest bonus about this location and if ever need my Monta fix for sure this is location I would go before the original. The food is the same at both locations. Just SO much nicer at Monta Chaya for obvious reason its brand new, LOT more spacious seating from tables too seating at the bar, and like the decor inside very much modern asian theme. The staff was friendly especially since went with my asian persuasian crew five of us in all. They did great job of staying on top of our drinks and everything coming out in timing matter. So if in the area need your Ramen fix Monta Chaya is place too get some!!!
