I absolutely adore this place!!! I have been going here for years and the food is always out of this world. I always end up leaving very happy and look forward to the days when i can get over to The Strip to enjoy it. Nearly every time, I get the soft chicken burrito. The fried burrito is also delicious (but I don't do well with fried) The green sauce is impeccable. I usually add some to sour cream and then dip absolutely everything into it! It's especially awesome on yucca fries. I love being able to add either onions or grilled peppers into my burrito depending on my mood. And of course the plantains for dessert are a must. Now I just need to get all of my Greentree coworkers as hooked as I am so that I can convince them to drive down for lunch ;-)
