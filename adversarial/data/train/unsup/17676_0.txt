I'm not from Toronto so it shouldn't surprise you when I say \"What the fuck? Caffe Demetre is a chain?\" I don't believe it. I can't believe it. I am going to go ahead and deny I even know this information. The desserts here are too ridiculously delectable to be associated with a chain like status. But I guess that's the reason why there is more than one Caffe Demetre BECAUSE it is so fucking good. \n\nI had THEE best Carrot Cake of my life here. That's right as in never had better and probably never will have better. My life seems bleak knowing this but somehow I'll find a way to carry on my sad existence.
