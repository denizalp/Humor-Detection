Gonna end the 2015 year with a review on my kind of peeps...de Pilipinos!\n\nAfter reading all the reviews on Yelp about this new Filipino bakery\/eatery, we just had to mosey on down to that side of town to give it a try.  \n\nGet inside and I swear, it smells like my Lola's house back home!  The olfactory senses going off!  Luckily for most of you, you won't get the hint of patis or bagoong in the air like I used to...but AI SOS!  The shrimp!  The garlic!  The tocino!  The pandesal!  All too familiar and reminiscent of a Filipino home.  \"Ai nakong, have you eaten yet?\"\n\nWe got there kinda late one afternoon so a majority of the what I assume is 'the good stuff' was already out.  There wasn't much left in the cases.  Fortunately there was one tray left of their famous cheese bread.  So of course we (I say we as in mostly 'me') sampled a couple of them!\n\nWhoa!  I was expecting more a traditional cheese bread\/roll of the pandesal type, but these were a welcome treat!  It's like a croissant!  More like a croissant\/roll hybrid!  Stuffed with a creamy cheese filling!  Pretty fantastic!  Crusty, yet light...rich, yet airy!  Certainly a new one in my book.  And I like it!  I could eat a couple of these easily with a cup of coffee in the morning!  All that was missing was breakfast!  But...Chef Zen does that too!  All day!  I will be sure to go in the morning next time and get me a helping of garlic fried rice and bangus (fried fishy fishy) or longanisa (garlicky sausage sausage) to go with my cheese rolls!\n\nWe also got a couple hot empanadas to try, with beef!  Dammmmmm....that thing was so fine!  Chef Zen, she a baker or what??  B*+CH can BAKE!  Beef filling was tasty with lots of garlic & spices, then wrapped with some flaky @$$ dough!  Like biting into a crunchy cloud.  Definitely one of the better empanadas I've had.  Next time I will have to try the adobo fried rice one!\n\nOnly ding I've got for Chef Zen so far is the pricing.  Yep it's gourmet so I guess it comes with the territory.  But man for 2 cheese rolls & 2 empanadas & a taro boba (for the kid) I think it set me back like $11.  Whew!  Filipinos going mainstream hipster, yo!  I remember when I was a kid at home, an empanada only cost me like 89 cents!  But then again back on Maui, you never know if it was filled with actual 'meat'.  Yeah, yeah say what you want..but when you poor in Hawaii, cats & dogs go missing!  I'm just sayin'.\n\nI'll be back again Chef Zen, asking for my cheese roll and my empanada.  Perhaps I'll get some breakfast too, possibly some Pancit Palabok?  Maybe some boba as well?  And a Nutella malasada?  Get some fresh polvorons to take home along with some leche flan?  Oh Hell, I'm just gonna pop a Lipitor & hop on a treadmill for an hour before I come visit again.  \n\nMASARAP!\n\n#igottasayitwasagoodday
