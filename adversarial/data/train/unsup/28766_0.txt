In all fairness to my prior review, the chicken marsala was delicious despite the smallness of the portion.  I also forgot to add that they were out of meatballs and calamari at the time we arrived (6:30pm).  Italian restaurant out of meatballs????? And calamari was to be my appetizer!.  \nThis place is so close to where I live. I wish they would get their act together!
