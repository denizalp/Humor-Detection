This is for only the casino, not the hotel. \n\nSo...Casino Royale was by far the most favorite place we gambled in Vegas. After a terrifying kick-off at one of the $15 min blackjack tables in the Palazzo - $150 lost in about 6 1\/2 minutes - we decided we better slow down with the table minimums, or we'd be eating at McDonald's the rest of our 3 days. We went to a bunch of other casinos, walked in and out, until, late in the night our first evening, we wandered in, lured by the idea of $1 margaritas.\n\nUmmm...heaven. Yes, it's a bit of a dive, but the bf and I are divey kind of peeps anyway. We walked in, I played some slots looser than the hookers on the cards they're passing out outside. Then, we found the BEST GAME EVER... a little gem called Blackjack Switch. \n\nSo, I'd never heard of this game before, but it's SO much fun. Basically you play two hands, $5 min\/each and you can switch your top 2 cards. so, let's say you get dealt a 9\/7 and a K\/2, two pretty awful hands, you switch the top two and BAM you've got an 11 and a 17. Sure, there are a few different rules to make sure the house still has the advantage, but there's something about having more control over your cards that makes you feel like a blackjack master. I put $100 into the table each time I sat down, and I only left down one time out of the maybe 7 or 8 times I played the whole time we were there. \n\nThe dealers and pit bosses were HILARIOUS and awesome, and they kept making sure we were using all the perks from our player's club cards. Matter of fact, the second day we were there we racked up enough points to get like $30 worth of free food at the Denny's next door. Sure, it's a Denny's, but it was 5am and it was free. Doesn't get much better than that. \n\nWe traipsed around a ton of places on the strip and over in Old Vegas, but somehow we ended up at Casino Royale at least once a day while we were there. Honestly, I can't wait to go back in February and get some Switch on again.
