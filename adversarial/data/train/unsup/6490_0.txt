Most of the reviews here aren't very fair to this establishment.  It is what it is, and if you don't want a sandwich stuffed with different fried foods, then you're in the wrong place.  I've been here after drinking, and it was great.  Otherwise, I only come here when I am experiencing a particular brand of self-loathing, in which case it is still pretty good.  \n\nThe \"Fat Sorostitute\" has been my go-to for the past several visits.  If you come during the day, while sober, the people that work here will be pretty nice and courteous to you.  If you come at night, while drunk, they'll be less so.  I know I couldn't serve drunk people all night without getting a bit mad, so I don't blame them.\n\nAlso, I suspect the counter is relatively high to keep drunk people from doing something stupid.  I think this is funny.
