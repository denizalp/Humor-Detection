This place really surprised me. I needed to find a safe dinner option for six people with fairly bland appetites. What we found was a gastropub that truly impressed every one of us, a place that really seems to care about  its salads and explains (unobnoxiously) the process by which they produce their house-made salsas. Great meat, beer, and atmosphere, and a cordial, accommodating staff!
