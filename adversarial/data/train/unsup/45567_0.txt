I've never had In-N-Out before. It doesn't exist in the midwest. I always put off going to In-N-Out when I'm in the west coast, but not this time. Since I'm vegan, burgers are off limits unless I want veggies between a pair of buns. Lol. I ended up with an order of fries instead. I was really excited to try these fries! Sadly, they didn't live up to my expectations. They were bland and boring. I thought the fries were below average compared to other fast food fries. There's nothing special about them. Five Guys make better tasting fries, and the portions are larger! The service was fast and responsive though!
