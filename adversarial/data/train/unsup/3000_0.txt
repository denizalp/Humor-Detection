I was in a rush and needed a bouquet for a friend's graduation. I walked in after they just opened and the florist was super helpful and fast. I walked into the fridge room with him and let him know what I liked, what colors I wanted and my price range. He took everything into consideration and gave me the perfect bouquet.\n\nFlowers are super fresh and high quality. The bouquet looked so good I didn't want to give it away! \n\nGreat service, talent, and pricing. Fantastic flowers!
