Chubby Cattle definitely brings out my gluttony side, especially considering that I already have a weakness for hot pot. No matter the weather nor time of day, I'm always up for hot pot. And this place is one of my favorite hot pot places in Vegas. The meat quality is generally above average and I usually just get the house original pot for soup base. The conveyor belt is a great idea, although a bit dangerous. I just keep having urges to take colorful plates out of it. And next thing you know, I have a mountain plates next to me. It's not always fresh so be careful. Better bet is to order from the menu. Service here is a bit volatile but they generally try to provide great service. I remember James was our server twice and is super nice and attentive. There were a few others that were nice but not as memorable.
