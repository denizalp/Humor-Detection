We were all here for a dog festival today. The event was much smaller than I thought, but I was glad to finally get a chance to stop by and walked around with friends and my two dogs after the event. The park is incredibly huge and cleaned. It felt so wonderful to spend an hour hanging out under the sun instead of laying around at home. The small pond in the middle of the park was very relaxing. While I contemplating the ideal of having picnic here, I've noticed drunks and sketchy looking people hanging out around the park. Yike... I guess not!
