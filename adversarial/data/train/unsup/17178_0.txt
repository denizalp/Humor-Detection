An extremely pushy and rude sales representative just came to my home at about 4:30pm 7-1-2016.  I'm a very polite guy, I am a good listener, and I try to give people the highest amount of respect, even if they treat me like garbage.\n\nThe sales rep knocked on my door, I answered and went outside to discuss whatever it was she was selling.  \n\nShe proceeds to tell me all about her solar plan and how they're looking for 15 homes to be part of their model home program. \n\nShe tells me how they just wrapped up in Waddell and that they're moving into our neighborhood now.  \n\nShe talked a lot without giving me any opportunity to tell her that I'm not interested.  \n\nShe asked me questions, which I politely answered and right as I started to say \"but I'm really not interested\" she cut me off to continue her pitch.  \n\nThis goes on for about 10 minutes roughly.  \n\nAt the end, I tell her that I do research first before doing business with ANY company and she tells me that she'll give me all the brochures and such so I can do my research.  \n\nWithout giving me so much as a chance to continue what I was saying, she starts asking questions about when we are home, are we going to be here for the weekend, when might we be gone.  \n\nEVERY RED FLAG IS WAVING & EVERY ALARM IS GOING OFF RIGHT NOW!\n\nYeah, that's not suspect at all. Asking me when I'm not home.  Yikes!  My mind starts racing, are they going to try and break into my home this weekend?  Do I call the cops?  What on earth am I supposed to do now?\n\nI tell her that she should stop writing things down on the paper because now just isn't a good time for me.\n\nShe tries the typical sales techniques to overcome a rejection, but I tell her again that now just really isn't a good time for us.\n\nNow she's angry with me and storms off in a childish tantrum, saying a bunch of nasty things as she walks down to the next home.  I call out to her saying she doesn't have to be bitter about this, to which she says more nasty things which I won't repeat.\n\nI never got the info I was supposed to get to do my research on the company.  Sadly I do not remember the salesperson's name, but her description is as follows:\nCaucasian female approx 5'6\" with a thin\/athletic build, dark shoulder length hair\n\nI sent a complaint to our HOA to see if they can file a formal complaint with the BBB and inform the company that they are not winning any friends with this kind of behavior.\n\nIf I get burgled anytime soon, you better believe that Pure Energy--and this salesperson in particular--are on my suspect list.  \n\nI mean seriously, are you going to be home over the weekend, when will you not be home, fishing for when I leave the house.  Really?  \n\nI really think this salesperson should be checked to see if any of the homes she has visited have been robbed or burgled.  I'm quite interested to see if there is any connection, the police should check this out.\n\nThis very well may be the final straw for me.  I'm teetering on the edge of putting up a no-solicitation sign on our property.  I hate that the good ones out there like the scouts and teen challenge will see the sign and keep on walking, all because of jerks like Pure Energy and the suspect tactics and personnel they employ.
