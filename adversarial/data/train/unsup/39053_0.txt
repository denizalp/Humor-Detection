This place was great! The food was absolutely fabulous. This is a once a month or every other month kinda place for us though because of the cost. Only complaint if it's even a complaint is when ordering to-go the gal who took our order was \"flighty\" didn't seem interested in what we were ordering. Never got our name or anything and had to put us on hold for a bit because she was talking to someone. Was great for the pick up just not great on the phone.
