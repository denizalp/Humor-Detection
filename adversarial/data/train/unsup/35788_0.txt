Great place for dates!!!! If your looking not too expensive, not to formal but delicious!!! This is the place. I love the cheesecake factory it was one of the very first \"nice\" restaurants i had been too. Well what I thought was nice at the time. The decor inside is great, nice clean tables with linens, yes that right linens! the MENU is EXTENSIVE. They have everything from Asian to American and all in between. The food is really good but not up-scale quality. Always nice plating presentation. I got the chicken pesto pasta dish (wish I could remember its name) none the less delicious. The cheesecake menu is elaborate and they always update the menu with specials added. The bill leaving with cheesecake dinner and app with complimentary bread was around 40.00, YES i said 40.00 for 2. Such a great date night dinner paired with a movie its sure to impress any ordinary lady. A little more about the interior is huge high ceilings with pillars and faux painting to make the insides look like old Tuscan themed buildings. the lighting is a blend between modern and fresco period and lights a set to dim. Each table has its own real lit candles. This is a great place for groups and family dinners birthdays etc. I usually don't fall into the trap of what I like to call COOKIE CUTTER restaurants but if I had to choose between the factory and any other place Ive ever went its in top 3! Plus there is so much on the menu to choose from your bound to satisfy any palette.
