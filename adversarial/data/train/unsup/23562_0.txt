Given my Mr. Tofu, Thai Style Noodle House and late night DJK addiction, I find myself in this shopping center on a regular basis. While window shopping, I noticed a tote in the Morning Glory window that cracked me up. On the side there was a cartoon of a little Asian girl saying something like, \"Look, Mom, I got you a present,\" and her Asian mom replying, \"Why you waste money?\" I literally laughed out loud as this is pretty much the story of Christmas with my parent-in-laws. At least one gift a year receives a Taiwanese commentary about how the giver should have saved their money.\n\nAfter some research, I found that the tote is from a line called Angry Little Girls, a very amusing line if you have experience with Asian parents (Yes, in-laws count), or if you just have experience being an angry little girl.\n\nAfter that, I decided I needed to check out the store. Further investigation found that they have a good, but not huge, selection of Sanrio items and some other cute novelties, such as the Little Girl line. My favorite items were the selection of notebooks with amusing covers. If you are looking for a journal or an affordable present for someone who doodles, writes or collects cutesy items, you can probably find just the thing here. \n\nThe selection is not huge, and I was hoping to find less Sanrio, more indie lines, but all in all a place worth stopping in, especially if you are already nearby satisfying your sundubu craving!
