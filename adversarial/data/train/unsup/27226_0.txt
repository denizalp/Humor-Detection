Pretty darn good cheap sushi! I'm from Vancouver and have pretty high expectations for sushi and this beat a couple places I've been to back home. The server gave us salmon or tuna mix rolls on the house and they were delicious! My meal was also great. I ordered the maki combo a. I usually think california rolls taste pretty bland but here it tasted fresh and they weren't falling all over the place. I couldn't finish the whole combo and I still have 1\/3 left in my fridge :). One thing I didn't like about the place was the lighting and lack of seating, but I guess most of the customers just order take out. I also loved their little pocky and teacup section. So glad I stumbled upon this place!
