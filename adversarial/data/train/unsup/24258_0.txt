Solid 3 star experience for me.  Not amazing, but definitely not bad.  I'd be happy to return, or even order for pickup\/delivery.\n\nWe walked in at about 7:00pm on Friday night for date night, and were seated right away.\n\nThe place itself is a little worn down, but still clean, and comfortable.  \n\nService was...strange.\nWe were seated by a friendly girl, and then a young guy in a tuxedo shirt and bowtie came over to get our drinks...when we gave him our coupon for free meatball sliders, he became a bit confused, and had to get the manager, who took care of us for the rest of the night...but the guy in the bowtie kind of...hovered around the table, almost like he wasn't sure what he was supposed to be doing...\nThe manager was very nice though.\n\nWe waited about 20 minutes for the food, which isn't a bad wait. \nThe food LOOKED amazing. \n\nThe Meatball Sliders:  meatballs, sauce and cheese served on a garlic knot with french fries. \nWhoever came up with the idea to do a slider on a garlic knot...well, they're a genius, and I want to kiss them.  What a great idea!\nFor me, the meatballs could have been seasoned just a touch more, but they were pretty good.  Very heavy.  I only had one (and it happened to be the only slider on the plate that was DRIPPING in grease), and was pretty much done eating.\n\nPantheon Pizza:  White pizza with Garlic cream sauce, Mozzarella, chicken, spinach and feta.  YUM.  Absolutely delicious. \nThe only issue with this, is that the pizza was not cooked evenly...my two pieces had crust that was solid and crisp.  Morgan's 2 were soggy.   The flavor was really good, but we'd have liked to see a little more consistency with the cooking. \n\nAll in all, the meal was good.  The flavors were there, and service was pretty good.  I would definitely go back again.
