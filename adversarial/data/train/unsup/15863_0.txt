I've been at this school for 4 years now. I'll be honest, I can't wait to leave. Most of the teachers are cool but you will never get a warm welcoming from the office ladies. You will get a \"Why are you here? Get back to class and come back at lunch.\" Then, security at lunch will say \"Where do you think you're going. You need a pass to go to the office.\" Roxy in the book store is another problematic addition to this school. I went to see her to pay all $75 of my class fees. I went with a friend who was concerned about paying $25 for a class she never had. Roxy replied with \"It says here that you have that class, I can look it up but I'm not going to.\" Thank goodness the other lady was there to actually assist my friend. I give 2 stars because of the \"quality\" of the office staff. I also really enjoy paying $1 for 5 Cheetos. \n\nDamn VHS!!!!!! Back at it again with the rude administration! Chapter 2 begins when I worked quite hard to complete a script for my fabulous theater class. (Not sarcastic) As I was just feeling proud of my completion of my assignment, I asked my teacher to go print it out at the library. There was my mistake. As I walked into the library glowing with pride, I said \"hello! Can I please print my assignment?\" The \"lady\" at the desk then replied in a very snobby, privileged Verrado woman way saying \"do you have a pass?\" To which I replied with \"My teacher sent me down. Do you need me to go all the way back to class just to come right back here?\" Smiling, as if I was stupid, she said \"Uhhh yea\". NOW HOLD UP!!!! ABSOLUTELY NOT!!! Since when is my teachers approval to leave class not good enough??? As I walked out all I could think was \"10 more days of this ridiculousness.\"
