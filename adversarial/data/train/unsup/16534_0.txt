I attended Bone Thugs and Harmony on Friday November 3. This was the worst experience I have ever had at any show. My tickets said the show would start at 9pm. How curious that at 9pm the door had not even started to let people in. The show (if you can call it that) didn't start until well after 10pm.  When it did start I was expected to enjoy the crappy sound system as the \"entertainers\" sang to the radio. If I wanted to listen to the radio I could do that for free. Instead my friend and I forked out over $90 for two tickets and $8 each for a single 12oz can of Bud Light just to wait more than 4 hours to hear nothing of value. We are so disappointed and angry to have wasted time and money for a really lack luster event. A better use of our resources would have been to have root canal without anesthesia.
