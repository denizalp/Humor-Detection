Not only the best meal I have ever had in an airport but one of the best meals I have had anywhere. Cheese plate, charcuterie plate, chicken pesto flat bread, seared steak and mushrooms, Scottish smoked salmon...amazing white peach Bellini. Fantastic wine list. Too bad they don't have more locations. Unfortunately the service didn't match their amazing quality of food and decor. We wanted to order dessert and another drink but didn't have time when our server finally came back to the table. We own a restaurant and deal with staffing all the time. Made the comment to each other while dining that it was yet another great restaurant tainted by less than average service. I would say the place is pricey but at $111 for 5 small plates and 2 beverages, I felt I got great value for money and have paid way more for lesser quality of food at other restaurants. While the service didn't match the food and decor, it won't stop us from returning to this restaurant. We are already planning to return next month.
