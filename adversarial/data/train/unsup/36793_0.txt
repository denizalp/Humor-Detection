I would never buy water anywhere else. Sure you can get it for 25cents at the grocer but it's dirty! The person before you picked their nose ( yes I've seen it) and then touched the tap. Or they just came with nasty hands. I don't know how often they clean those taps but it's not enough. I'm happy to pay 40cents for clean water. The water person is really nice. They even carry the heavy bottles to the car. I purchased my whole set up from the water store. I have the jug, the stand, and 4 five gallon jugs.
