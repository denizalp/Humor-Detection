Its been a long time since I've ventured into a Jack Astors and I must say they've done a good job of improving upon themselves.  On the particular night I was here it was the date of Elvis' birthday so they were playing his music until about 7:30 and had a guy running around dressed up as Elvis.\n\nOur server, Garmen, was fantastic.  He was prompt, friendly, helpful, and spot on with the timing of bringing refills of our drinks.  The food has really improved since the last time I've eaten here.  I had the Sauced Up chicken fingers which were really great.  I went with spicy buffalo and I must say that the spice balance was excellent.  They were just spicy enough to give you a run for your money, but not so hot that you were crying like a baby.  I also tried one of my wife's veg. fajitas which were also excellent (considering there wasn't any meat).\n\nI'll definitely be back!
