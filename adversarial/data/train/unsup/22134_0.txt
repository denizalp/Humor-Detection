mojo, you fro-yo mofo, i'd go homo for you-o!  \n\ni heart this place...especially cuz i get to SAMPLE!!!  i don't know why i even bought anything...i totally could have filled up on samples...i guess i couldn't have gotten the THIN MINT chunks tho!!!!\n\ntried the pistachio (super sweet), mint (mint-TASTIC) and cappuccino (mmmmmmmmmm) w\/ raspberries and thin mint chunks....SUPER TASTY...srsly, worth the money and it really wasn't THAT expensive.  ESPECIALLY cuz this fro-yo got me thru the rest of my day in my ridiculously long nursing class.  \n\nMOJO is the ROCKSTAR of the fro-yo world...i am now a mojo roadie!
