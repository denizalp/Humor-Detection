Our meal at Liverpool House was excellent and the best way to start our trip to Montreal. We began with oysters and a pasta special (with foie), then had the lobster spaghetti and steak with bearnaise and asparagus. The oysters were fresh and briny, and the pasta appetizer was delicious.\n\nFor the mains, the lobster spaghetti was amazing - rich and creamy with al dente pasta and large chunks of lobster. The steak was seasoned well and had a nice sear. The dining room is cozy (but laid back) and we made conversation with the couple next to us. Overall, the service was good and the meal excellent. We will definitely come back when in Montreal.
