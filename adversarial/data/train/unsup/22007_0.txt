My best friend wanted to try out this place so I said sure, why not since I like going out for breakfast. \n\nWhen I got there, there was very few parking spots available since the plaza is very small with limited parking spots. I guess during peak hours you gotta wait or make your own parking space? Thankfully I found one. When we walked in, we noticed the sign that said the place is self seating. So we went ahead and found a spot. Mind you, if it's busy, you have to stand around and wait (unless if you do take out), which is pretty awkward since this place is REALLY small. \n\nThe menu is on the wall which was kind of awkward for us to look at since we were sitting literally below the menu. Once we figured out what we wanted, we went up to the cashier to order and pay. I ordered the eggs benny with smoked salmon and a matcha tea latte to drink. My friend ordered the same but an eggs benny with peameal bacon. It didn't take too long for the food to come. \n\nThe food was REALLY good. No complaints whatsoever. The eggs benny came with home fries and a salad. I actually couldn't finish everything so I saved one of my eggs benny and brought it home for my boyfriend to try since he was jealous lol. \n\nI will definitely be back here! My friend even said she wants to go there and order to go before she heads to work every once in awhile.
