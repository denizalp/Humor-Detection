Custom make your personal pizza OR choose from a pre selected pizza for $7.99. It's just average. You can get unlimited toppings but many of their toppings were empty or close to empty. I saw some vegan and gluten free options. We got 2 thin crust pizzas and I felt that the crust was burnt a little, but I think that's their signature. Beer & wine is available, as well as salads and dessert pizzas. $6.00 pizzas on Tuesdays.\nReminds me of BLAZE.......which I would have to say is better.
