Go here to see, be seen and hang out on a patio. Of course, hanging out on a patio is done best with a cold, adult beverage, so also go here to drink. \n\nI have been here twice, and the reason for my second visit honestly wasn't because I just had to have some fabulous dish again, it was because my pals that live downtown were hanging out on the patio, and I was jealous. I knew I was probably going to miss something (like Tony Hsieh delivering happiness in person or a Jesus Jam Band on the corner of Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd) if I didn't go. So, I went, and therefore, did not miss either of those things, both of which actually happened. \n\nThe patio offering at Park On Fremont is without doubt in a class of luxury. You can sit out front and watch Fremont Street in all its glory, or you can head out back and go for the Secret Garden experience. Both options have their time and their place. Try both. \n\nAs for the drink offerings, I am excited to see they offer variations of the Bloody Mary! Granted, I haven't tried them, but I think it's an art form we don't have enough of in Vegas. They also have a nice beer list, but mostly in cans\/bottles, and on my first visit, they didn't have 30% of the list. I think it was because they were still in soft opening mode, so I won't hold it against them. \n\nAs for the food, it is a bit underwhelming. Portion sizes are small, and although the menu is a list of delicious potential, dishes are just a little bit less than you hoped for in size and presentation. Everything I have tried tastes good, and I do appreciate that they have a variety of options, including vegetarian, and just the fact that they have food!\n\nSo, I don't think I would go here with a starved foodie (at least not yet), but for a night downtown, it's definitely the happening spot to get your drink and patio on.
