Had to stop in when I realized, on my way to Soul Cafe for some pancakes, I'd forgotten my travel-sized bottle of 100% organic maple syrup at home**.  Oh, but Fry's doesn't sell organic maple syrups-what??  However, I did find a 12.5 oz bottle of Maple Grove Farms' 100% maple syrup.  I used to buy MGF organic buttermilk pancake mixes online, so I was familiar with the brand.  The syrup isn't organic, but I was looking for pure maple syrup, and not one laced with corn syrup, like most of the others offered at grocery stores.  You know that sweet aroma of pancake syrup wafting in the air of grease spoons during breakfast everywhere?  Yeah, that's what pancake syrups made with corn smells like.  I just hope that the majority of maple tree forests aren't sprayed with pesticides, or genetically modified just yet...\n\nStore was brightly-lit, clean, and organized.  The self-check out service didn't allow me to use the Key Ring app I have that organizes all of my loyalty cards, so a Fry's cashier rep had to help me.  Next time, I could just type in my account number using a link on the monitor.\n\n**Thank goodness great fall\/winter\/spring weather is here, and I can soon leave my bottle of organic maple syrup in the car.  $10 for a bottle of non-organic syrup is still $10, especially when I already have an unopened bottle of Trader Joe's organic maple syrup and about four travel-sized ones in the fridge!
