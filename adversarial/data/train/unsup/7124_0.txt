Dined here for the first time maybe a moth ago and experience was great. Food was delicious and had a street food quality to it. Servers were nice and food came out fairly quick. We had no complaints.\n\n2 nights ago, I called in for a pick up order and the gentleman who took our order was very rude. We were still deciding what we wanted to get and he was very impatient and had a negative tone while taking our order - we almost changed our minds and cancelled our order, but we were in a rush and already on our way to the restaurant. When I got there, I tried to pay with 2 credit cards and he wouldn't let me. When we dined inside, we paid with 2 cards no problem. Our receipt said his name was Victor. \n\nOur food was great, just the customer service from this one employee was terrible. Go for the food, just avoid Victor.
