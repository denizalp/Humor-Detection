I'm telling you right now, this place is amazing! This sushi joint features tables and a bar surrounded by a conveyer belt that rotates constantly. You have the ability to pull anything you want of the line and they charge you by plate color, there is even drinks that travel on this. \nI love good sushi and when I'm hungry for it I want it as fast as possible so this place is great. \nMy biggest gripes about sushi are bad rice and chewy seaweed, and haven't experienced either of these things at this restaurant. \n\nMy average trip to Teharu is this: I walk in take a seat at the bar, I'm greeted quickly by a waitress and I order a beer. I watch all this delicious sushi traveling by and I grab everything that looks good and even a plate of edamame to snack on in between. The rolls seem to change a little every day and they have all the great classics. After eating about 3 different rolls my beer comes and then I finish 4 more rolls and snack on the edamame. I can literally eat all the sushi I want and it's pretty tasty and I can have a beer and I can get out of there in under 20 minutes and under 20 bucks. I'm telling you this place can fast and easy or chill and fun. It's a cool experience and I crave it a lot.
