Amazing decor, amazing food, and most importantly literally the best server I've ever had in my life. Maybe he was the manager, but he had us laughing all night. The night was so memorable because everything was effortlessly perfect from the timing of the courses, to the way the server prompted conversation, and how close attention to detail was evident. I always find Italian food to be very simple and hard to get wrong, but some kitchens just know how to add a little extra which takes it to the next level.
