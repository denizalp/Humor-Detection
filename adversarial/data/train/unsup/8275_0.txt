Friendly crowd\nCheap drinks\nAwesome music (jukebox).\n\nTired of $8 beers? Or feeling like you just need to turn off that polished Vegas glamor thing as you walk past the Prada and Tiffany shops? \n\nWell, the Stage is only a block away from the big time & a world away from the pretense that everyone that is in Las Vegas more than a couple days eventually tires off.\n\nThis is about as close to the strip and call it a mostly locals place. Maybe 50\/50. \n\nGreat beer specials including $1 ice cold Michelobs. If you feel like you're saving too much money,  you can give it away & play some video poker at the bar.\n\nOtherwise, friendly folks here, great service and always interesting people to meet and observe.  The later it gets...the more interesting I'd say it gets.
