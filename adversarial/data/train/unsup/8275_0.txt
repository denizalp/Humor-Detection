After receiving a horrible experience at Peoria Ford I went to Sanderson Ford and I could not believe r how great their service was. John and Chris from service Dept went above and beyond my expectation to get my truck service. There is no surprise they have been around over 60 years. I will go out of my way to go back here. \nThank you John, Thank you Chris for job well done.
