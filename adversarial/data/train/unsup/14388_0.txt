I'm coming out of temporary Yelp retirement to review this gem of a spot in the super shady OCAD food court.  I've never been someone who'd penalize a restaurant for it's decor, location, or health\/safety standards so of course it's location doesn't bother me one bit.  I even celebrate it's glorious existence. \n\n1. I adore how the lady calls me baby.  Not creepy at all.  Enduring even.\n\n2. $5 all day breakfast that comes with all five major food groups: bacon, eggs, garlic fries (so damned good), fruit, and unlimited coffee\/tea.  It's a mountain of food.  You can even get salad instead of fries for a reasonably healthy meal but you're going to want to get the garlic fries.  Best deal in the city for breakfast as far as I am concerned.\n\n3. The owner\/operator really cares and you can see how they value their customers.  While I was there she gave some dessert to a regular and was like \"no problem, we'll see you next time\".  I love this give and take relationship with store owners!  It isn't nearly common enough in this city.\n\n4. Clearly I enjoyed this place enough that it forced me to come out of Yelp retirement.\n\nNow to re-retire from Yelp again.  See you when I see you.
