I had been in the mood for grilled chicken wings all week and it's hard to find a restaurant that serves grilled wings. They're usually fried and greasy! After learning that the Dandelion Market had phenomenal GRILLED wings, I had to give it a try! \n\nThey recommended two meals per person because they are smaller plates for sharing. I ordered the fruit-n-nut salad. It had poached apples and pears, cranberries, figs, candied pecans, point reyes bleu cheese, mixed greens, citrus white balsamic and olive oil. I had them switch the blue cheese with goat cheese. My friend ordered the Mediterranean Trio and DANG...it was good! The trio had lemon garlic hummus, sun dried tomato tapenade, tabbouleh and pitas.\n\nMy wings came out after the salad and they were everything I hoped for and more. They were PERFECT! Crispy, sweet, spicy and juicy! My friend also ordered the black bean sliders and said they were the best vegetarian black bean sliders she's ever had. \n\nI also had breakfast there a couple weeks back and I can't wait to go back again. I can't believe it's taken me this long to try this place out.I ordered the Dando veggie omelet with a side of bacon. The omelet had havarti cheese, tomatoes, peppers and onion. I love an omelet full of flavor and this one hit the spot. Their coffee was PERFECT. It tasted like French press. \n\nMy waitresses were super nice BOTH times and it's such a fun environment. The decor is dark and rustic. I love the lighting and the brick walls. You can sit upstairs or downstairs!
