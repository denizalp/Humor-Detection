This place was better than I expected. Seating is tight since airports haven't figured out how to make space for carry on baggage..... I mean it doesn't take a genius. I was going for something lighter so I got the Cobb salad. It was VERY good and packed with meats! I heard the lady next to me who ordered chili say it was tasteless but the salad was ok!
