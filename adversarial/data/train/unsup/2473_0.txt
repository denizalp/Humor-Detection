If you dont want to read the whole review, at least read the last 3 lines. I was given a Groupon for an automatic car starter for my birthday. I had called and gotten an appointment 2 weeks out at 1pm. I was told I would get a call 30 minutes prior to my appointment to confirm. I get a call that morning at 10:30am saying \"we don't have time to do your car later because somebody else brought a car in to be fixed and we don't know what's wrong with it yet.\" Ridiculous that my appointment had to be delayed, but fine. I was told I could reschedule for a week later, but I had work that day and said I would have to call another time to reschedule. The man said \"let me check with my boss and I'll give you a call back, we may have time.\" Great.... until they never called back. 3 days later I get a call at 6pm confirming my appointment for 9:30 am the next morning.... hmm ok. I don't have a ride tomorrow (a work day) so now my boyfriend will be showing up to work late to pick me up..... but ok, at least it'll be over with. 9:30 am the next morning comes and as I drop my car off they want to MAKE SURE I know an additional part will be needed..... an extra $100 on top of the Groupon. I told them I was never told this and that I was not going to pay that, to which the man at the front desk tells me, \"I heard them tell you that on the phone last night because they verified the year and make of your car.\" Yes the year and make were verified, HOWEVER I was NEVER told it would be an extra $100 or I would NEVER have kept the appointment, made my boyfriend late for work, and cancelled plans for the day while I wasn't going to have my car. Needless to say, never again will I go back to this place. Awful customer service, disorganized, no continuity between workers, they don't answer their phone half of the time, and they are extremely rude to their customers. Save your energy, go elsewhere.
