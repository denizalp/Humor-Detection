This is why we have the term \"A-OK.\" While the quality of food isn't terrible, there's nothing on the menu to phone home about (esp. with long distance to India being what it is). They have two-veggie or two-meat or one-veggie-and-one-meat combos starting at $6, and each meal comes with naan, rice and a garden salad.  You can try the mix-it-up combo which gives you two meats and a veg for $7.50. Offers typically include fish masala, butter chicken, channa masala, palak paneer, eggplants and other basics. Not sure why it's called \"Fiesta India\" but a Mex-Indian hybrid would be way more exciting than this.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: More like SIESTA India.\n\nMenu Readability: Typical neoclassical food court style with pics.\n\nNeed to mention:  To answer Kat T's question about the Hindi translation of \"fiesta\": it's fiesta with an Indian accent.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I'm pretty glib about the use of terms like \"neoclassical\"; that's what got me through university.
