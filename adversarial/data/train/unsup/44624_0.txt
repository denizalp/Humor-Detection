Ate here last night with my aunt and uncle while doing business in area. Highly recommend \n\nHad the Ruben which was 7 thumbs up and a snap. \n\nHad pickled tomatoes and peppers. Wow to say the least.\n\nHad a great beer by HE'BREW there as well.  \n\nHonestly our waitress was horrible but the food made up for her. If they could only get the waitress with the green  tints in her hair to do her job it would be 6 stars. Guess that shows how much good food means.\n\nLove this kosher deli!!!!!
