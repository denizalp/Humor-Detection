I only went to this shop because of my nail tech Natalie. I followed her from a previous location. She's the ONLY person I let do my nails. Very professional, very neat, and very inexpensive. But then again, I've been getting my nails done by Natalie for a while now! So she knows what I like and what I don't like. Hopefully whoever does them next, is just as good...
