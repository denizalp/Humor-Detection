Gave it two tries and the service and operations were so bad that we are not going back.  Waited 15 minutes before we were even served water the first time...food took just as long.  Didn't plan on returning but they gave us a gift card because we had to wait for so long.  Went back again today and the same service issues.  Food was fine but not great...we had the smoked salmon Benedict and a breakfast flatbread. Ordered a kids breakfast for my kids and they brought out both breakfasts on the same dish?!?!  Maybe the cook doesn't have kids but children don't really like to eat their meals off the same plate...had to get a separate dish to split the breakfasts.  I will say the pancakes are good and it has a nice indoor outdoor trendy atmosphere but not enough to make us return.
