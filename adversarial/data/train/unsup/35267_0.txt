*** original review was removed as it promoted another pest company... this one has been corrected***\n\n\n\n\nWhile moving in (literally) the guy from HDE showed up and \"sprayed\" the house. I was unloading boxes into an empty house and I accept the fact I should have watched to see if this person really sprayed the house or not. My fault! But as a professional service, I should not have to monitor the if the job is being done or not.\n\nPrior to moving in, we noticed a few dead roaches and one which was alive. The guy from HDE was in and out of the house in about 5 minutes and I can't recall if he sprayed the exterior. Fast forward two weeks... no dead roaches in the house... only alive ones. AWESOME! Again... not even certain if he sprayed or not as I don't recall seeing any wet areas from the spray.\n\nI would not recommend this company for pest control. \nFrank
