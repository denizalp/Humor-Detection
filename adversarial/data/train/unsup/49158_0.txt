Enjoyed the deliciousness of the beef shawarma roll and a fruit smoothie.  Also had some hummus and falafel from a platter.  The hummus and falafel were good,  but a bit bland.  The roll was just delicious.  Loved the pickled vegetables in it. It was also super filling and very reasonably priced. Lots of parking and good service
