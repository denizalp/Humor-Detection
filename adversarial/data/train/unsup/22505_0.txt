I love PHOOOOOOOOOOO and I was really excited this place was fairly close to work. I came for lunch and there was no one else here during lunch (strange?). I ordered the usual...Pho Tai and the egg rolls. My friend had the vegetarian pho since she wasn't into eating all this crazy meat. My pho broth was sweet. I'm not a very sweet person and when I have pho I like it to be savory! The beef was a bit hard to eat and chew through. Eggrolls were good, nothing extraordinary, but my friend seemed to enjoy it seeing it was her first time. Overall, service was good, but their pho could be better. I probably won't be back as there are a couple of other pho places down the street that I love. Sorry Pho Little Saigon.
