What a ride! Looking for something to do one morning in Vegas, we considered Hoover dam, zip lines, dune buggies, and then the idea of a Segway tour came up. We met up with \"Segway Bob\" on Freemont St. and he took us all over town. After a great 90min tour to numerous places around the old strip he turned us loose for 30min on our own. It was a Blast!
