i reaallly like the decor here. i love the ceilings! the lights! the servers\/busboys shirts\"TIP WAITERS NOT COWS\"..\"IF U ARE WHAT U EAT IM FRESH, HOT, & EZ\"! i love the grill area everything and some!\n\nits located in the back of mirage instead of towards the buffet u go the other way towards cpk and pass the deli. then u hit this small margarita bar & bltburger. hannah s & i shared the vegetable salad w grilled chicken (vegetable salad REALLY now isnt that obvious??) it comes with everything possible i mean its lettuce with radish, water chestnut, carrot, cucumber, celery, so much other stuff but my mine just blanked oops. but too bad the grilled chicken was dry as heck...i mean sooo dryyyyy it was like corkboard. also i didnt like that it automatically came with ceasar dressing blah....and they only had 2 other salads which sounded gross\n\ndee got a burger which the other girls tried and they said it was sooooooo tender and delish! too bad hannah & i were sick of burgers after serendipity! \n\ntheir fries are a good portion but for $5...no way whatta rip.\no the girls also got this fully loaded lookin potato wedges that looked off the hook to bad i didnt get to try any!\n\nquick eat in a nicely decorated restaurant!
