I had been going here for awhile for an oil change and carwash with usually good results. Now not only do they try the upsale, but this last time caused damage to my vehicle. Maybe because I refused extra service. And can I just state I ALWAYS do the walk around my vehicle  before it goes through the machine to check for nicks or scratches. It came out and the blinker cover was completely smashed\/broken!! I immediately called the manager over who just ignored me. I got on the phone to corporate without leaving the lot. Then he decided he did have an incident report form while I was photographing the damage with my phone. I'm not an idiot - it wasn't there before it went through the machine. Corporate office even refused to take responsibility. They said \"oh we want to help, and will source the part and put it in...But YOU HAVE TO PAY\". Enter at your own risk folks!!!...
