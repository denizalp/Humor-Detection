Was looking for a new place to try rather than my usual spot and found some good reviews on Yelp. \nA girlfriend and I went this past Friday night. Walking in the vibe is fabulous. Had a very old fashioned feel to it. Dark mahogany wood with plush leather chairs and couches, rich dimly lit chandeliers, no windows so very dark and an overall masculine, sexy feel. I felt like I was in another era, 60's maybe. I could envision all of the men dressed in suits and women with their bobs and perfectly applied lipstick. \nUnfortunately there is no dress code, anyone wearing anything can get in which sort of dampens the vibe a bit. \nWhen I ordered my first drink I asked the bartender to surprise me...he was very rude and did not like this request, wouldn't tell me what their specialty was either so I guess they don't have any. I ended up asking for something citrussy and his concoction was good enough to begrudgingly forgive his rudeness. \nI prefer bars where you can be social with everyone and meet new people and have interesting conversation. Everyone there was very involved with their own friends and didn't have much interest in extending their social circle. Also it was packed full of rowdy guys that night...looked like a fraternity reunion or something. Also the bartenders don't seem to know when to cut people off, I encountered a few beyond intoxicated men that were very grabby with me and could barely stand on their own two feet. Two of them were escorted out by security...um how about you don't keep serving people and allow them to get to that point? \nI got to see the secret room, it is cool because it is secret, that is about it. \nAt about 12:30 am the bar DIED. There were maybe twenty people left in it total. We spent the rest of the night on the tiny patio enjoying the cool night air until 2am arrived. Apparently most people like to start their night here and end it elsewhere. \n50\/50 chance of me coming back.
