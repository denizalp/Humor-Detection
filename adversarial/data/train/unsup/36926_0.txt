Hot restaurant served hot food but cold tart.... It seemed to be lined up all the time because the price was very reasonable for such large portion of chicken. I had 1\/4 chicken with half rice and half fries(Thank the friendly staff for meeting my requirements :) . But honestly, I expected to taste much flavourful chicken not just salty. Even all the side dishes, salad, rice and fries are better than chicken. The bread was good but the tart was not crisp at all!! The cold stuffing was too sweet. So, I only can give it 3 stars.
