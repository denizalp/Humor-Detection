I went back on this trip for the happy hour. It's twice a night, every night, from 4 to 6 and 9 to 11. Appetizer specials are $1, $2, or $3, and a few drink specials are also available.\n\nOur group enjoyed relaxing on the lanai, sipping our drinks underneath the tiki torches, bamboo, and heat lamps. Amongst the six of us, we ordered the Maui burger, Chinese spareribs, popcorn shrimp, calamari, and chicken skewers. I thought my spareribs were excellent and meaty, but Vicky T. really won with her $3 Maui burger. Somehow our group passed on the frou-frou tropical drinks that Trader Vic's is famous for, but we were all content with our cocktails. Even the teetotalers were happy with their fruit concoctions. Sadly, I forgot to try a Drunken Geisha (next time, I promise to remember, Brian S.).\n\nWe arrived shortly before happy hour ended, but our waitress was great at getting our order in on time. As we relaxed with the good food, good drinks, and good company, we joked about hanging out until happy hour started up again at 9. Next time, we surely will.
