Let me start with a caveat: don't go expecting an upscale restaurant. Our rating is with this in mind. Go here for authentic good that is amazing. My husband and I disagree on whether four or five stars. We had the parrillada (Argentinean bbq, arrives in a small charcoal oven) for two. So good! If you eat a lot, consider adding a chorizo or two to the parrillada.
