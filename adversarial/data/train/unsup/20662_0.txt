If you're going to rock a name like THEHotel, you better step up. And in most cases, Mandalay does. Not quite to the level of 5-stars, but close. \n\nTHEHotel is the upscale wing of Mandalay... as long as you don't count The Four Seasons, which I imagine is in a whole league of its own. This would be like the W to Mandalay's Westin. A little more hip, swankier, and, well, interesting. The rooms are sleek and decent size - equipped with plush robes, electronic window shades, Bose clock radios, big screen (but not flat screen? Weird!) Tv's, and my room had a big bathroom with jacuzzi tub. The bath products are L'occitane and include bath sugar cubes for the tub. There's no in-room coffee or water and no minibar or fridge, so be prepared for that. \n\nMy room was on the 62nd floor. No, the hotel is not that tall, but for some reason it skips from 38 to 60  in one floor. Never figured out why. Regardless, my desert view room had a rad view out over the flat wasteland that is the SW off-strip. Freeway noise was negligible. \n\nThe staff here is efficient and unlike the front desks at the mega-resort side, there's no cattle-call action. I walked right up to check in and same to check out. Huge plus! Valet is right next tot he desk too so no long-hauls through casinos or anything to get to your destination. And the location off in the corner of the Mandalay complex means less cross-traffic from the hordes. \n\nAn off-night rack rate of $100 (plus all sorts of hidden resort fees) was good for the quality of room and level of hotel class. I'd definitely stay here again if I could get it for a good price. The only sad part was that I was there on business and didn't get to use the pool, which I hear is the best on the strip.
