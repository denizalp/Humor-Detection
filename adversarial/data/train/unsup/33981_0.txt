Sandy Richards went above and beyond to help me get the best deal possible when I mortgaged my home. She helped me all of the way through the difficulties of cutting through the red tape of finance. I have a complicated financial history and she was with me every step of the way. The Richards are kind and courteous, along with being pinnacle professionals.
