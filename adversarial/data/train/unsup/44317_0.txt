Last night was our first time here and we loved it, friendly service on arrival and once we were seated we were brought chips and 3 different dips! We were then brought complimentary soup which was tasty and my 7 month old son loved it!! Since we were at flaming fajitas I wanted to try them and they didn't disappoint! I got shrimp and they were the best my husband and I have tried for a long long time! I think he wishes he'd gotten them too! Overall a really good dining experience and we will go back for sure!
