I've been seeing her for almost 2 years and we have seen the good and the bad times together she is more like my sister and family. She dolls me and my daughter up and we are never disappointed. Make sure you book asap because her and the staff stay busy and booked. She is a great teacher too. I have even sent a few cosmetology students her way too. Hands down she does her craft very well and does what you want. I like the natural look with a little pop and she makes my hazels stand out for real. I love her to pieces! \n\nOne thing is that a lot of people complain because they think she is supposed to do what they want at the drop of a dime. In a self centered world many will jump online and bad mouth folks but not realize she has a business to run. Treat people the way you want to be treated and remember GOD dont like ugly!
