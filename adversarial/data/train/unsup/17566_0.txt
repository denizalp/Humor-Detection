Been here a few times and usually for a celebration. \nService can be a hit or miss type of deal. However, food is always excellent (except for the desserts which I'll get to later). \n\nSo why 3 stars? It was my friend's birthday and she had a reservation for 8:30pm for a group of 20. Tell me why we didn't get seated until 9:20pm? I understand it's a large group but don't promise us a reservation for a certain time if you can't accommodate. I consider myself a pretty patient person but even I was getting hangry having to wait that long. That knocked off 1 star for me. Onto the food.\n\nAppetizer:\nMussels with shoestring frites in lobster broth - Mussels on the smaller size but they were sweet and perfectly cooked. You get a good size portion for the price. I thought the shoestring frites were actual fries but they're more like the ones you ate as a kid from the yellow can, except these were fresh. \n\nI also had some of my friend's portobello fries and they were fried perfectly and texture was perfect. \n\nEntree:\nFlat iron steak sandwich: this was so good! The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and was so tender. It came with a side or crispy potato chips. \n\nI tried my friend's grilled cheese with short rib and that was bomb! I would get that next time. The Drunken Goat is another great option if you're going for meat-free. \n\nI knocked down another star because of the dessert. I was so disappointed! My friends and I ordered the apple pie and berry shortcake. I could've made these at home. The \"apple pie\" was literally 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, 2 sugar cookies, and topped with cold apples with cinnamon. How the heck is this apple pie? Same for the berry shortcake (2 scoops vanilla topped with berry mixture and shortcake cubes). No effort at all into the dessert. I was still mad about the \"Apple pie\" when I got home that night.
