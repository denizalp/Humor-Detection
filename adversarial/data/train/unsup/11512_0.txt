Sorry to say but the food was pretty disappointing.  We started off with ordering 3 orders of pad thai at $5 each. All 3 was made by different chefs and tasted totally different.  One more flavorful than the other and one out of 3 had no meat\/chicken in it. I've tasted way better pad thai and rather pay more elsewhere for better tasting pad thai. \n\nWe then went down the aisle by buying some meat skewers at $10 for 8 which was ok tasting and ended up the only edible food. \n\nWe ordered one order of papaya salad  thai style for $5.  The order came out pretty small, tasted stale and didn't soak up any juice cause it was that old.  The flavor wasn't good and not spicy at all.  We ordered the spice level of 8 from the scale of 1-10, 10 being the spiciest.\n\nWe bought the banana sticky rice and taro sticky rice.  I still haven't tried the taro but the banana wasn't good. The rice was under cooked, it was raw and no flavor at all. It's supposed to be semi sweet with a hint of coconut flavor which it lacked. $1 each so not bad. If only it was good :(\n\nThe egg rolls. I have to say was horrible. It didn't have any meat in there, it was fipped with mixed junk. That's how bad it was, I can't even tell you what's in there cause you can't even tell\/taste if it was actually food in the egg roll. $2 for 3\n\nWe went for most of the desserts which was $2-5 each and didn't find one kind we liked. \n\nThe thai iced tea was $2 each but too sweet. \n\nThe hainam chicken and rice was a rip off. They gave us a box of rice and a few pieces of scrap chicken, It wasn't even clean cut pieces. $5 for a box of mostly rice and a few chicken is pretty expensive.  You'd think how'd they go wrong making this. Well there was nothing special about the chicken and rice, especially when you pay $5 for a box of mostly rice. \n\nLastly we went to the beef noodle soup vendor. They were $5 a bowl which was reasonable.  We ordered 2 bowls but after seeing them pour broth into the 1st bowl, we decided to cancel the second bowl. The soup base smells like intestine and urine. Eww! Sorry but we had to pass...\n\nMy overall experience was pretty bad. We spent alot of money here and didn't get anything decent enough to eat.  Either we are very picky eaters or people who go here have very low standard.  What a waste of at least $40 there. Will definitely not come back.
