Desserts ETC is easy to miss. At first glance, the establishment doesn't exhibit any particularities over its competitors. That's where our parents' proverb \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" comes into play. The inside of the establishment is clean, well-lit, spacious and welcoming. Cleanness and efficiency have obviously been the priority when setting up the seating spaces.\n\nI'd like to congratulate this establishment for having such excellent, friendly and efficient service. I've never waited more than 2 minutes for my order. I've never had such friendly conversations with cashiers either. This is the first time in my life that the friendliness and warmth of baristas is sufficient enough to make me want to go back to a coffee shop. Laughs and smiles, joyful attitude, etc. \n\nBy now, I'm sure everyone's thinking: \"Alright we get it, you want to marry the cashiers. But what about the food man? Get to it.\" Well, the thing is, I despise coffee. This is one of the very few establishments where I'll drink coffee. The cupcakes are heaven and the cakes are mouthwateringly good. Seriously my dear readers, forget Starbucks, Cafe Depot, Second Cup, etc. This place is amazing. They even have specials such as 1 cup of coffee and 1 chocolatine for 3$. 3$ guys. That's insane... 2.50$ if you want a croissants instead of the chocolatine. [Insert spam of heart emojis]\n\nIn my white girl friends' words: \"I can't even... like O-M-G, I JUST CAN'T EVEN. I can't. Oooooh my god.\"\n\nI'm a University student that was born in a ghetto of Eastern Europe. That means I'll keep searching for the best bang-for-my-buck until I give out my last breath. This here, is an amazing place. They don't have the variety other coffee shops do but they excel at what they do.\n\nP.S. This review is to describes Desserts ETC and not \"Don Taco\", a Mexican food establishment with whom they physically share the space. I have a separate review for them.\n\nP.P.S. There is WiFi. You need to ask for the password though.
