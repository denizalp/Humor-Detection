Well, it just doesn't get better.  And I really really wish it would.\n\nThe best things about this place are the views, the pasta dishes, and Adam.\n\nOtherwise, service is debatable\n\n\nWalked in at 1pm.  Wanted to sit covered outside.  No problem waiting.   Outside bar closed (too bad because it is 80 and beautiful outside).  Went to main bar.  Stood there 5 minutes while the bartenders chatted amongst themselves.   Finally got drinks\n\nWalked outside and sat at outside bar.  For 20 minutes, watched two tables sit empty.   Went to front reception and was told my name was crossed off \"by accident\".  \n\nAsked for the other vacant table.  Had a better view.  Was told it was being held.  \n\nWaited a long time.  Food was average.  I got up and went to restroom while husband waited to pay.  He's still waiting while I write this.  \n\nOh, vacant table we requested is still vacant.  Good job Port City.    Won't be back. \n\n\n\nP.S.   Last time I ordered the lamb chops and they were terribly overcooked and weirdly sauced.  Avoid.
