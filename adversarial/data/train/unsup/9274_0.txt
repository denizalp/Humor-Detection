There isn't anything bad that can be said about this hotel. It's freaking gorg and the service is top notch. I will do a separate review on the buffet that may be the only somewhat negative point. We stayed on fifty some floor, almost the very top. Honestly, it's in my opinion one of the best hotels on the strip if not the best. Though I do enjoy touring other hotels because they each have a theme and I enjoy that. What sets this hotel apart from it's little sister Encore, is the room set up. Other than that, really the 2 hotels are quite similar. But I will tell you that the room set up does matter. You have 2 main options in the Encore. You can either have a double bed not facing the window view or you can have a king bed facing the window with these large pillars that partially block the outside view. They separate the living room and bedroom. Even though Encore is a slightly bigger room at 750 Sq ft versus 700 at Wynn, it feels smaller because of the layout when you either have a 2nd bed you don't need or have that dang pillar. At Wynn you get the king bed facing the strip, without a pillar, perfect! Also at Encore on the 30 some floor there was some locked machine room that made noise all night long, that's the reason for switching to the lovely Wynn. Another reason Encore left a bad taste in our mouth. I do like that both Wynn & Encore offer such huge windows, the Trumps aren't small by any means, but there is definitely something at Trumps that blocks them a bit, I think the pillar is thicker and bottom is covered by the couch.
