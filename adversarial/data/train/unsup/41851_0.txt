Customer Care\/Service means everything to me\nwhen it comes to salon services.\n\nMy experience with Waxing the City and my aesthetician\nCourtney have been nothing but exceptional. In fact, all staff have been really attentive and pleasant.\n\nCourtney is extremely attention to detail and never rushes \n\nNo a high pressure sales pitch at the front counter and they offer Black Book packages \n\nI highly recommend Courtney and the \"Mint to Be\" sugar scrub
