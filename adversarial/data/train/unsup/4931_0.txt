This neat little sandwich shop is tucked in the corner of PH's casino. \n\nThey have breakfast items until 11 am and other times have great selections of sandwiches,  multiple choices of soup,  and fresh salads. \n\nThe employees are super patient and friendly. Their ordering system is nice in that you pay for your order and get a buzzer and grab a seat until you are notified that your order is ready. \n\nWe really enjoyed our sandwiches and soups so much do that we came twice during our 4 night stay. \n\nBe sure to sign up for their rewards club and get a free sub on your birthday!
