My family had a Christmas party this past week and the food was incredible. The amount of food that we received allowed us to have lunch for the following day. The atmosphere is inviting and our servers Mary and Janette were amazing. So friendly and helpful and lots of smiles. We will definitely be back again. The owner was seen walking around saying hi to people which is rare now a days. It was nice to see someone taking pride in their business. Keep up the great work.
