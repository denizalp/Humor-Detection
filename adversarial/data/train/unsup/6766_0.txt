\"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.\" What a bunch of crock. You should see money in my wallet as that surely didn't stay there. I came here for a bachelor party was pretty damn impressed by the talent and the night it entailed.\n\n--WHAT SHOULD I ORDER--\n\n1) If you're coming to a strip club, I hope you're not ordering food as that is not their specialty.\n\n2) I will have to say, there are some very good looking girls here at this place. \n\n3) The drinks are about $20 a piece for liquor and the dances are about $20 a song.\n\n--HOW IS THE SERVICE--\n\nWell, I mean, it was packed at midnight to about 4AM when I left, and there was never a shortage of talent to pick from.\n\n--WHAT IS THE PRICE--\n\nBring some $1's and make it rain.\n\nSource: I came here for a bachelor party.
