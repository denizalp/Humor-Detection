Not worth it. Food taste nasty and service sucks! Crawfish was hard to peel out  flamin crab banh canh didn't have any crab maybe one shrimp, after half way eating then they brought out the vegetables, no bib or gloves til we were half way done eating as well. Long as wait and it's their grand opening week and it's not even busy at all... we got cream cheese jelly with our milk tea and it was only TWO piece in my drink, haha funny right?
