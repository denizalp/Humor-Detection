Short and sweet wedding with a metrosexual Elvis.\n\nI went here for a friend's wedding.  It was my first ever Vegas wedding chapel experience.  It's on Las Vegas Blvd.... along the stretch around Charleston where all the quickie chapels are located.  The Elvis who did the wedding had spent some serious time in the tanning bed, and clearly shaves himself.  He was also a good singer, and did a heartfelt rendition of \"Love Me Tender\" during the ceremony.  Instead of walking down the aisle, the couple rolled in with the help of a pink cadillac convertible.  Afterwards, the chapel puts the couple's names up on the marquee.  Who doesn't like that in Vegas?\n\nI don't have a reference point considering this is my only chapel experience, but it was fun.
