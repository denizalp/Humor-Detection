This is my new go-to place for bubble tea. I think that the value for the price and quality is better than most places here in Vegas. I've been here a few times and while it hasn't been consistent most of the time, this is the place where I would frequently visit for my boba needs.\n\nIt's a fairly new spot that's been open for a few months. I've gotten turned in this place by the recommendation of some yelper buddies. It's located on spring mountain next to lees sandwiches.\n\nPopcorn chicken - a Taiwanese speciality, the one at fat dumpling is nice and crispy on the outside, and moist and juicy in the center with an interesting seasoning. They give you an OK amount for the price, but I think they should give more.\n\nSmoothies - order the jumbo size. It's the best deal in town. It's the Big Gulp of bubble teas. All of the fruit they use are real. The tea also has good flavor as well. I've never found boba quality as high as Half & Half tea house in LA, but... It's good here. Sometimes a lil bit too soft, but better than a lot of places in Vegas. My total for a jumbo smoothie with boba was 5.14, not too sha-bay!\n\nWhat's also great is that they are open later than most places. While most of them close between 8:30 to 10pm on the weekdays, this place closes at midnight. The same time the werewolves come out...
