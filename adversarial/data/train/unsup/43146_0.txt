Went for lunch. Lunch is 11-3 and used a coupon from Las Vegas advisor two for one. They had a carving station with ham, turkey and beef tenderloin - so juicy, Italian with pizza and pasta, breakfast items, Mexican with guacamole and fish and latin with mussels, shrimp and clams in tomato sauce. American with okra and quinoa and chicken, sushi - not so good, chine with fried rice and eggplant and chowmein, fried wontons, salad station with fresh salami, salmon and cheese, broad desserts with cakes and donuts and frozen yogurt. Unlimited house wine and beer. Great value!!!!
