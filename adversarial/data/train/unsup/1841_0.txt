My hiking partner strikes again, as during our 2nd descent down Piestewa today, she asked some guys around us for a hamburger restaurant rico.  \"Ingo's\" they shot back!\n\nIt's a round, quaint little place, slightly reminiscent of the old Woolworth lunch counter style dining.  If there's a free seat, take it, or stand on top of the printed footsteps located behind each position at the counter\n\nWe had a waitress in training, and both she and her trainer were pleasant and charming, full of recommendations and suggestions.  The Paris, Texas burger caught my fancy, and I requested it with the BBQ sauce on the side, topped with a fried egg.  It arrived with a darling heart tipped toothpick which held the condiments in place.\n\nThe burger was delicious and juicy, with a light and airy bun, crisp bacon, and this amazing fermented jalapeno sauce.  I actually tossed back a shooter of one.  And the \"potato chips\" were thin cut, french fried potato rings, crispy on the outside, creamy inside.\n\nAnd when customers were all paid up, they hit the \"cookie jar\" before bouncing, as there were fresh made cookies, free for the taking.  I can imagine this place gets crazy busy, as the food is so good I tried to talk Yuko into splitting another burger with me... its worth the wait!
