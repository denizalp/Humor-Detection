OMG - I hope this is what heaven tastes like ;-)\n\nI'm a big frosting nut, and Tammy's cupcakes are do DIE for! I almost needed a fork...almost, as I shoved every part of it in my face.\n\nOur work treated us to these for our annual meeting, and I swear, I think they must love us ;-) So why 4 stars? Would I pay $5 for a cupcake? - No. But are they sugar-fantabulous and the ultimate frosting smackdown - oh yeah!
