The food here is delicious, carefully crafted, beautifully presented, paired well with wines...it was a great dining experience overall.  The restaurant was recommended by our Canadian host.  The staff was extremely nice and helpful, and our waiter suggested a salmon appetizer and veal sweetbread entree.  The sweetbread was one of the best dishes I've ever eaten.  I can't say enough positives about the dining experience here.  Highly recommended.
