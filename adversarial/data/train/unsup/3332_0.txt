Hobak Korean BBQ's rise in popularity in such a short timespan is well deserved.  I brought my family here during Hobak's opening weekend last month and we were not disappointed.   From the amicable and helpful staff, the retro-polished look of the restaurant, and the delicious assortment of BBQ, I would highly recommend this place.   \n\nUpon arrival, the wait for a table was minuscule and we were offered one of two slushie type drinks while we waited.  This place is not an all-you-can-eat spot but you get a hefty portion of meat for the price you do pay.   Different combinations on the menu and various pricing will land your table meats which may include beef, pork, chicken, etc.   We did the mixed beef and pork option for two people and it was a carnivore's dream.\n\nThe accompanying side dishes were fairly good.  The kimchee was delicious as was the steamed egg.  We did have to ask for rice (which ended up being free of charge) as it was not initially served to us.  \n\nThe servers cook all your food right at your table in an encircled grill.  This was reminiscent to the NYC Korean BBQ spots I've tried though I do miss being able to cook the meat ourselves.  Like in NYC, I did see Yukhoe (seasoned raw beef with raw egg) offered and I'll have to order it next time to compare!  As far as I know, it's the only Korean place I know that serves this.\n\nDessert was included in the food option we chose which was ice cream sandwiched between rice popcorn-type rice cakes. It was great.\n\nOne more \"above and beyond\" service provided can be found in their bathrooms.  Mouthwash, packaged toothbrush and toothpaste, and mints can be found for those fighting the war on bad breath and cavities.  \n\nOverall, Hobak is a great and welcome addition to the sea of Korean bbq spots opening all over the Vegas valley.  Unlike many others, though, Hobak is making a convincing argument of who really is the best Korean bbq spot in town.\n\nYelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 25\/100
