Ok, this is one of the hotels that I went \"holy crap\" when I first walked in.  I was in vegas for a tradeshow and I was able to be in the hotel b\/c of it.  I got there the day the tradeshow started so I went to their convention center first.  On the way there I just saw rooms after rooms size of football fields all very nicely decorated.  The actual convention center felt like it was like 15-20 football fields together?  I might be slightly wrong but I just know it's huge.  I know I wasn't able to walk every isle and see every single booth in a single day.  \n\nNow the front entrance to lobby\/casino....look up when you get there.  The ceiling all had paintings on them and looked breathtaking.  I think I stood there for a little bit the first time I walked in.  Also, go upstairs the casino where the shops are.  I really enjoyed that place, they created somewhat a small breeze in there and have it design with buildings that looks like it's from italy.  They have performers there singing at certain time of the day and there's the artificial river with boat and the guy that sings while you're on it.\n\nThe room, I was in was a suite and it was one of the nicer suites I been in.  We had two people in the suite but it could've easily fitted few more with the room we got.  I'm not sure how much it cost b\/c it was offered to me so I didn't have to pay for it but I'm guessing it would've been pricey.  The service was pretty quick, I pretty much went straight up to the suite without any wait.\n\nProbably one of my favorite hotels at vegas so far.\n\none more note:  if you seen the michael jackson special done by ABC a few years, you might remember MJ going to one of the crazy stores.  Well Im not sure if it's still there but last time I was there I went in and that store is insane b\/c of what they're selling and the price tag.
