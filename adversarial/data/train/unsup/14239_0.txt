Spending another Saturday night in alone? Don't feel like sitting in the tub with a bottle of wine and crying about your life again? Too many happy perfect couples on Facebook bringing you down? Then get yourself over to Danny Boy's and order the mac & cheese pizza and add grilled buffalo chicken to it! This pie is so good you'll be in a carb induced euphoria not giving a care in the world that it's the third night in a row you've been on the couch in your bathrobe. \n\nSeriously, this pizza is 100x more satisfying than that Greg guy with the sloppy kisses or that weirdo Dan. After you eat this pizza, sure you'll need some time to deflate, but once you do you'll find yourself in the bathroom mirror giving yourself a pep talk and you might just even shave your legs this week. *So satisfying it's life changing*\n\nBonus, a \"small\" is more than you can handle, but that just means it will still be there in the morning when you wake up wanting more. Treat yourself!!\n\n\n\nI mean, just don't forget to order a side salad with it to balance things out, you still have to be able to fit into your jeans (whenever you decide to put them on again).
