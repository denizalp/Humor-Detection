First time at a Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers: I was impressed by the very friendly staff.  One of my favorite servers is here awwwww awesome!!  Jordan takes care of me with the sweetest smile!!  Elaine was great as well. I received some great recommendations for today & future visits by Justin, GM. \n\nTried a few samples & decided on Golden Road Get Up Offa That Brown (Brown Ale): very smooth. \n\nArizona Burger: 1\/2lb burger served w chips(sub a side $2), pepper jack, tomatillo salsa, pico de Gallo, green Chile w sub sweet tots (sweet potato). Delicious, juicy & perfectly cooked the way I wanted. Sweet tots was delish too (kind of like a warm dessert to my mouth). \n\nWill try the Jucy Lucy-fer Burger next as recommended on the Pretzel Bun (highly recommended for extra juicy burger like this one to be on Pretzel buns). \n\nGreat atmosphere with lots & lots of TVs for sport buffs!!  Great specials available for different days & can be locational as well. Tuesday is $3 cantastic all cans & wine down 1\/2 bottles of wine.  Great happy hour Weekdays 3-6pm specials. Weekend breakfast until noon. \n\nAll first responders & active military receive 10% off your total bill (must show valid ID, not to be combined w any other offer, discount, promotion or happy hour as a THANK YOU. \n\nJust check the little stand on your table for specials (also attached pics).
