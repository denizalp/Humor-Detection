My fiance and I stopped by here while in Las Vegas over Thanksgiving and loved it! The smoothies were nutritious and delicious (my fiance got the Ms Olympia and I got Chris' Special) and they were more than happy to allow us to customize them to meet our nutritional needs. They have an excellent selection of quality supplements at good prices, as well as samples of many of their supplements. They also have a great selection of women's workout clothes imported from Brazil (I got an amazing pair of Wonder Woman leggings for my fiance) as well as other high quality pieces of workout clothes and gear for men and women. They also have prepared healthy meals from the Protein Source restaurant that are perfect for the fitness buff on the go. While we were there, we got to meet one of the owners 10 time Ms. Olympia Iris Kyle; she was warm, friendly, and had some great advice for both of us as competitors, and she takes great pride in her business and in their supplement selection. She also signed the limited edition Women's Pre-Contest Bible that we picked up there with a special message for my fiance. I wish every gym had a Bodi cafe in it, he experience was wonderful and I highly recommend stopping by for any bodybuilder, athlete or fitness enthusiast that is in Vegas!
