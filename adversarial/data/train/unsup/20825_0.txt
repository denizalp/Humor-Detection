Beautiful park with an amazing view of the mountains! The tennis courts seem like they get crowded, so we ended up just sticking to the basketball courts. Your ball can go really far down along the hill if you let it go, but a lot of folks were rebounding for each other. Parking was easy enough, but it did take a lot of navigating to finally find the place (but that's more commentary on my fiance's navigational skills, as opposed to the park).
