This movie theater should win an award for being clean and quiet! People like watching movies here because it's like an oasis away from the craziness of the casino.\n\nWord of advice: Buy tickets online, skip the box office. Dealing with humans is lame. Only kidding. But it does save you time! \n\nSeats are not comfortable; I always consider bringing a butt pillow. Like today, watching Noah, my butt was getting numb sitting on that rock of a chair! But I guess that's not really what you're paying for haha! It's a great place to take your kids to see a movie! They also have IMAX 3D, which is fun..you know, when you're willing to spend that kind of money!! \n\nThis is my go-to theater when I'm too lazy to drive somewhere else. By the way, if you're planning to go to the premiere of an extremely popular movie that ever shows here, arrive 2-3 hours in advance because it gets crazyyyyy!!!
