I LOVE this place! It is a small bar owned by a guy named Brad. The best part is, it is a Vikings bar! Go Vikes! I first experienced this place when I lived in Ahwatukee. My friends and I were looking for a good bar to eat at and watch a baseball game. \nBrad's has a huge menu that can be overwhelming but I always enjoy having a lot of options. I remember ordering the Grilled Cheeseburger. It was two grilled cheese sandwiched with a burger in the middle. It was to die for. I have been back a few more times since then and every time, I have had a pleasant experience. I will recommend this place to people new in the area because I like it so much. \nI attended the Football UYE this past Sunday and, unfortunately, watch the Vikings lose but had a great time anyway because the bartender\/server was great and kept our refills coming. I ordered the biscuits and gravy meal that comes with eggs and breakfast potatoes. It was delicious. Another person ordered the Pork Loin sandwich and it was bigger than the bun. I will continue coming here when I have the chance.\nHeads up, it is hidden in the Safeway parking lot on Elliott and 48th Street so make sure you are on the lookout because it is a small place.
