Cool little Science Museum here in Phoenix Arizona.\n\nWe went for the Yelp event. Pretty good venue for having events. Restrooms are clean. Outside design and layout of the place is pretty cool as well. Three floors we explored.\n\nPlayed around with some of the activities on the second floor, which were fun. \nAlso had some interesting areas and Exhibits.\n\nWorth checking out if you have time.
