I must say that Dim Sum in Vegas is definitely an adventure. One has to find a balance between good quality and value. The best authentic dim sum place? I would definitely say Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine. The problem? Its pricey. The worst? I would say Harbor Palace. I would not ever go back there again. The middle ground? Orchid's Garden. \n\nDont get me wrong. This place is definitely not a five star kinda place... but it gets the job done. If I'm going, I always (and I mean ALWAYS) go on a Saturday morning around 11-Noon. I think the food is the freshest and the wait staff is most tolerable. On Sundays, I feel the food is recycled from the day before and the workers try to rush you in and out like cattle.\n\nThey have the normal dim sum fare. Nothing too spectacular. The food is pretty consistent and I know what I'm in store for. The cart pushing ladies are pretty nice to me now since I'm a familiar face. What I mean by that is now they dont try to force dishes on my table or recommend stuff that is catered towards the novice.\n\nIf I had friends in town, I would most likely bring them someplace nicer. If its just me and my buddies, this place is fine. Why go to Changs and pay up to double for a slightly higher quality when you can go to Orchids Garden and possibly taste a few extra dishes instead?\n\nTo put it in layman's terms, Changs is like a Wynn\/Bellagio Buffet while Orchid's Garden would be a Planet Hollywood\/Mirage Buffet. Easy enough?
