This hole-in-wall spot gets five stars from me because they're tasty, affordable, and  give you a hefty portion of food for a great price. Mainly, I'm talking about their lunch menu. Not only is your main course gargantuas but you get soup and an egg roll too! Hellz yes!  I'm that easy to be won over but the added bonuses aren't all that I love from this place. Comparing Kohmol's lunch menu to anywhere else, these guys provide you with a wide selection for vegetarians and the normal carnivore eater.  \n\nService is some times slow but always genuine and friendly. I've had the pangang tofu and spicy eggplant dishes. Both were excellent and flavorful. As far as prices, deliciousness, and portions are concerned, this is the place that has me at lunch specials.
