I ate here during Restaurant Week and it was acceptable. The setting is lovely, without question. The decor is impeccable! But, the food was just OK. If it wasn't Restaurant Week pricing, I think I would've been disappointed. I had the rock shrimp ceviche which was topped with too much mediocre guacamole. The swordfish was simple and cooked very well. Simple is a good thing with fish, in my opinion. It had good flavor. I really enjoyed the tomatoes that accompanied it.  The fingerling potatoes were acceptable (though, they could have used a bit more seasoning). My dessert, Baba au Rhum, was OK. I notice none of these items, except the fingerlings, are on the regular menu but it seems you'd put your best foot forward during Restaurant Week, when you can count on some new customers who have been looking for an excuse to try your restaurant to seize the moment. In this case, they didn't create a new regular.
