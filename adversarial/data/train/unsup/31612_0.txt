I placed a delivery order at 8pm- they advised it would be delivered within 30-40 minutes as I was only a couple of miles away. At 8.50pm I called to follow up and they must have shut because no one was answering the phone. Food never came. Hungry!!!! Will never attempt\nTo go back or order again. Their loss!!
