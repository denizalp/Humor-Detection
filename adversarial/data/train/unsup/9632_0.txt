Recently had lunch with friends here and ordered a Margherita Flatbread, $12.  The flatbread is really a Pizza....I don't know why restaurants name Pizza different things, just call it what it is!\n\nAnyway, the Pizza was very good.  It had a nice Garlicky kick to it and the Sauce was very light.....delish!\n\nI had an Iced Tea to wash it down and it was very refreshing....I must have drank 5 or 6 glasses.  The service was great too, nice place to grab some lunch.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%
