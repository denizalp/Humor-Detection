This airport blows. Why?\n\n- The car rental place is too far away - and it's a complete shitshow. \n- There are no ATM machines once you get past security. \n- Security is insane. The lines are way too long, the workers are way too cranky. It reminded me of the security lines at Vegas - except  without the benefit of just coming from a weekend filled with gambling, drugs and hookers (well, for most people anyway, for me it was EXACTLY like coming back from a weekend in Vegas). \n\nThe not-too-bad parts?\n\n- Free Wi-Fi\n- If you're waiting to meet friends, there are decent eating\/drinking choices outside of security
