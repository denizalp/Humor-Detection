My daughter, grand daughter and I was out shopping and I heard about Nancy B's  chocolate chip cookies so we decided to look for the place. We had a hard time finding it bc it,s a small place. Once we walked into the bakery, you can smell the cookies being baked. Nancy gave us a free oatmeal raisin cookie and my grand daughter a free M\/M sugar cookie. These cookies were out of this world. And they will ship these cookies anywhere. It was worth the time searching for the place. I just checked out their website and found out that they have a variety of cookies and pies. Don't wait....try these chocolate chip cookies now. Thank you Nancy B.  they are delicious and will be back for more.
