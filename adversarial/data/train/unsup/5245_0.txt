We came into ABZ Auto Care based on other yelp reviews. The air conditioning in our car was not working properly, and Shlomi was able to diagnose the problem and get it fixed all within the same day! We appreciated the fact that he wanted to make sure that he not only fixed the problem, but fixed it right. We are confident that our AC will be in tip top shape! After picking up our car, Shlomi even checked in to make sure everything was working properly. We are so appreciative of an honest and reliable mechanic here in Las Vegas. We will be back to ABZ in the future for any of our maintenance needs. Thanks again, Shlomi!
