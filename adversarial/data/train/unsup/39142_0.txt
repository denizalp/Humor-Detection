I cannot praise Cora enough for her stunning work on my bridal gown. Her attention to detail and passion for her craft shined through at each one of my fittings (I had five in total). She also took time out of her weekend to be AT my wedding to ensure I was bustled to perfection before our grand entrance -- this was super beneficial as we had a small incident and tore my train while out taking photo, she was able to get me all fixed up and I had no issues the rest of the night! I would highly recommend anyone needing bridal alterations to reach out to Cora.
