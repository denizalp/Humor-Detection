Yuck.   Onion rings were so greasy you needed to wring them out.   Chicken wings are on the menu but they don't actually serve them anymore.  The chicken tenders were burnt.   I would have sent them back but I had already waited so long I didn't have time to give them a second chance.  \n\nOur food came out in three stages...I find this strange for a \"to go\" order.  I ordered a grilled chicken salad.  I asked what the house dressing was like.  The server said she had no idea because she had never had it.  The chicken was dry.\n\nThe kids liked the cheeseburger and chocolate shakes.
