I have been on the search for a gourmet pizza place in Charlotte that wont break the bank and this is it! I dont think that they could make a pizza that I wouldn't like. They also offer a honey bourbon sauce with your pizza. It is amazing to dip your crust in this! It is located in 7th Street market which is so convenient. Plus, they validate parking which is quite nifty!
