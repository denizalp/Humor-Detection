Tried this Aspinwall spot after a recommendation  from friends.  Searched Yelp reviews that were mostly mixed.  What we got was a restaurant with a comfortable atmosphere and a friendly and efficient wait staff. The menu wasn't overly ambitious but had something to suit everyone's taste.  My wife and I had dinner salads which were quite good and had decent portions. The other two diners with us had sandwiches which they liked.  We plan on returning in the near future.  We like to eat in the bar and  the Cornerstones looked warm and inviting.
