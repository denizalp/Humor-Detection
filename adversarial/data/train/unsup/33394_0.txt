Went here for a friend's birthday last night, was really great! Soft shell crab pad thai was very flavourful and a massive meal for the price ($23), definitely good for leftovers. My friends had the chicken pad thai and khao soi and loved them both, prices were also very reasonable. Service is attentive and friendly, we even got some free little coconut cream tapioca desserts at the end of our meal which was a nice touch. My only suggestion is regarding the spice levels. I ordered my pad thai \"spicy\", and i didn't find it very spicy at all... so if you're wanting *real* spice, I would suggest going for the \"Thai spicy\" option or the \"extremely spicy\" option for an extra dollar. Would recommend!
