First off let me say I agree with 'Megan W' when she says don't go to the strip club if you're not in the right state of mind.  You'll just spend a lot of money and be irritated about it, probably making your friends time less fun while you're at it (or afterwards with your negative comments). They wanna have a good time, don't whine\/complain and ruin it for everyone else... 'eewww, there were guys up in my face\/rubbing all over me...' DUH! You're in a strip club, they chat you up and dance like that because that's typically what girls want when they go there.  I hate it when girls bitch at strip clubs (girl or guy).  If you're gonna bitch and complain, just don't go.  If you can't be cool chill chick, go to a show while the guys go to the club.\n\nI used to live in Vegas and loved to go to Olympic Garden occassionally to see my sexy Vietnamese dancer (Tiki) who worked upstairs. :)  I love ASIAN MEN!!  He has such a sexy body and some fly dance moves... but isn't too dirty, just sexy and sensual.  Or maybe he wasn't dirty just with me cause he could tell it wasn't necessary - might be with other girls. *shrug*  I miss him now... gonna have to make a trip to Vegas pretty soon. \n\nI'll post some pics of the club, just cause I'm that bored. LoL\n\nOther than that, the downstairs girls are alright.  I'm pretty picky about girls but could usually find one or two to dance for me and my boyfriend.
