My comments go as follows:\n\n1.  Say, WHAT?  Mexican food and Chinese?\n\n2. It's not really Mexican, nor Chinese.  It's its own thing.  Don't expect anything in particular.  \n\n3.  It's unique and good.  The black beans are DELISH.\n\n4.  As a vegetarian, there aren't so many options - there is the veggie egg foo young (which is good) and the veggie salad (which is not).  I end up getting a cheese quessadilla and egg foo young -- all in all, very tasty.\n\n5.  The snickerdoodle may be the best part.
