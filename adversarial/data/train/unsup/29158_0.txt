I tend to stick with the basics, and the Americana is perfect! Hot, as coffee is meant to be enjoyed, with a simple flavor shot or two.  \n\nSometimes I feel as though proper customer service gets overlooked if the product is great. Not here! They're always accommodating, polite, and conversational. \n\nThe baked goods are yummy, but would love to see some gluten-free options in the future.\n\nRemember: support local businesses!
