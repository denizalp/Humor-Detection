Don't live here. I'm a very reasonable, low-maintenance tenant. I understand that old water pipes break as this is an old, remodeled complex-things happen! However, they seldom told the tenants what was going on, we'd figure it out usually in the mornings or late night before and after work. Imagine trying to shower after a long day of work and the water doesn't come out. (Unfortunately, that was a normal occurrence). When I first moved in to my place there was broken fridge glass all over the kitchen floor and nails sticking out of the carpet-not an exaggeration. Make sure it's actually move in ready if you move here, mine wasn't. If the apartment has a 'European washer\/dryer,' they're useless in that they wash\/dry 4 items at a time (takes 3 hours, too). I ended up using their laundromats on site the whole year costing $1.50 per wash & $1.50 per dry while paying more for rent. I felt like it was a scam even saying these were washer\/dryer apartments. Last thing is if you move out at the end of the year, be prepared for fraudulent charges towards you-even if you're a neat person, professionally clean your apartment when you leave, and do everything they say to complete before you leave. I got charged over $200 for several random, made up things.  I emailed the manager ReAnna but she didn't email me back. She's a very unprofessional property manager. I would never recommend this apartment to any decent person! The Mark Taylor name means nothing in regards to this specific complex.
