This used to be one of my favorite buffets. Not that it was close to - or anywhere close to - being perfect BUT because I felt like it was one of few buffets in Vegas that felt worth a visit without poking a hole in the wallet.\n\nBut the prime rib is now similar to leather, the au jus is watery bland, the mussels have a weird texture to them (even as a new batch), most of the food taste dry as if left out in the sun...and their crème brûlée is no longer crème de la crème... =(\n\nI guess if anything, I'll just be back for the champagne brunch on the weekends. At least that's something considered the Vegas way.
