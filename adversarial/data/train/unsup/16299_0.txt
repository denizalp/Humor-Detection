You get the same thing as any JC Penney here in terms of good sales, coupons, and generally affordable clothing. It's probably closer to a 2.5, though, because it's desperately in need of an update. Everything seems kind of stark and understocked. Our last visit was understaffed with few registers open. The person who did check us out was pleasant and apologetic about having to delay our transaction to help the people who checked out ahead of us with a last-minute question. The store serves its purpose but I'd probably spend more time and money there if it was a more inviting atmosphere.
