I have used Loft several times in the Phoenix area in the past two months. Had only one bad experience for which I was given credit when I reported it. Overall experience has been very good. They show up quickly (except my on dc bad experiece) and considerably cheaper than a cab.\nThey have clean cars, water and snacks, encourage you to sit in front passenger seat and have a personality.  I will continue to use them. I have not used their competition (uber).
