Beautiful bar, very classy and modern with an industrial feel. Bunch cocktails are amazing and they have an awesome Panini & a Bottle special on Mondays and Tuesdays (2 paninis and your choice of wine bottle for only $20) perfect for a girls wine night. Also have an awesome Sunday brunch special (bottle or pitcher & breakfast entree for only $30). Perfect place any day of the week for girl time! My favorite thing to eat there is the Short Rip Hash, so much flavor!
