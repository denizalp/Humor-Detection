I've never had to visit a chiropractor in my life(knock on wood), nor have I ever had an adjustment before, but I've seen wifey go through a couple of sessions. Thanks to fellow yelper Julie K., We were in the area and I remembered Julie's talk thread post\nso we decided to drop by for a visit.\n\nLove the modern vibe the moment you step inside. It doesn't have that doctor's office feel to it . Julie had us fill out some info and I met Dr.Lovaas and he took me behind to \"where all the magic happens.\" Dr. Lovaas also took the time out to explain what The Joint was all about, the benefits of being adjusted, and what to expect during my session. After a \"flexibility survey\"- Look up, down, side-to-side, bend over reach for your toes, bend as far back as I can, etc. I first lay face down and Dr. Lovass goes to work, first getting an overall feel of my entire spine, concluding that he noticed tension in my lower spinal and neck region, which is due to the fact of  constant heavy lifting at work.\n\nDr. Lovaas gives you a \"heads up\" on what's gonna happen... as he is easing the tension off my spine....first, my lower back area,\"you're gonna feel a pop here\" sounding like a hundred knucles cracking simultaneously...CRRRACK!, Then, face up, crossing my arms giving myself a hug, turned my shoulders one way, my neck the opposite way,\"I'm gonna give slight pressure here\" and CRRRRACK!\nFinally adjusting both sides and three different adjustments during my time there, I felt great, thanked Dr. Lovaas and Julie for a great session and looking forward to returning  for sure!  ALOHA!!!
