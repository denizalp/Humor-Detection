Delicious, healthy lunch spot in the city. The location on Forbes near Market Square is more of a grab and go. They have tons of premade salads ready to take (made daily). Fresh soups, various sandwiches on fresh breads and baguettes, and premade sides like broccoli quinoa salad or a roasted potato salad. Each mouth they feature a special sandwich and salad as well. All the options are quite healthy and everything is so fresh. Very vegan and vegetarian friendly too. Do not leave without a sweet treat--their vegan chocolate chip cookie is to die for. Friendly staff, prices are kind of high, though. The second location on Stanwix is much bigger inside with tables, however they offer a much smaller menu than the original Forbes location.
