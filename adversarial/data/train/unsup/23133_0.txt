Summertime is just around the corner so thought I'd pick up some Betty's paletas (Mexican fruit Popsicles) and very glad I did. I had only eaten the grocery store pops or from the ice cream mans cart, but let me tell you, these fresh homemade pops totally blew those out of the water. \n\n The Popsicles are jam packed with fruit and flavor. The strawberry cream was like heaven in my mouth, and the coconut was unreal. They cost around $3 a pop, but it's a small price to pay for the quality and the taste of these yummy pops.\n\nTip- I like to sprinkle tejin chili powder or some of the pops for a little extra kick
