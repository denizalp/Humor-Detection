My boyfriend took me here to celebrate my college graduation. It was a really fun and special night. I opted to have the tuna tartare and gnocchi apps instead of a full meal and I was not disappointed. We also split a burrata and had a house cordial. They also make their own alcohol which is so fun! We dined on the romantic patio that was lined with bushes and twinkle lights. The waiter was friendly and made great suggestions, even bringing us some samples. Fun night and I will be back again soon!
