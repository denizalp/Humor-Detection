OMG. The HAM. So delicious!!! I'm always torn between the ham eggs Benny or the croque Madame. \n\nBrunch has been getting boring for me recently - especially with all the beer halls now trying to do brunch (such a waste of time- more on that later). But this place has a great menu - out with the boring eggs Benny. Mushrooms or pulled ham you just can't go wrong. And I love the vibe, can go in super hungover or dressed up ready for mimosas with the girls. It's a really cute and chic restaurant. \n\nMy favourite has to be the eggs that they use - must be farm fresh. \n\nOh, and another thing that is absolutely  vital to my Sunday brunch? A coffee cup that's is never empty!!!! I hate when places ignore that - relieved that Blonde's keeps my cup full.
