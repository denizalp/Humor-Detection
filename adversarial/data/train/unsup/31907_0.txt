Coming from NJ, it has been trial and error in finding a barbershop here in AZ. This place is the One. We have used 2 different barbers here and were satisfied with both. They are very skilled and can do a proper cut without fear of screwing up your hairline. Lol. My boyfriend and both of our sons have gone here for haircuts and they look good each time. Each of them also has a different texture hair; my boyfriend's being more coarse, older son has thick waves, and our youngest has thin hair so they can work with any hair type. The atmosphere is also very welcoming. The people all have the classic barbershop banter going on and the kids are all playing together waiting for their turn in the chair. I highly recommend if you are looking for a barber.
