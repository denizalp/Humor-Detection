The hottest new night club in Vegas. Seems to be going strong and building momentum. This place is expensive, like EXPENSIVE. It makes being a guy in vegas extremely tough. Because if you're broke, you should probably turn back even before you get into their outrageous line because GA is $50. \n\nBottle service is great, beautiful model-type waitresses pouring your drinks...Great, until you see the bill anyway =P. Which can range from a mortgage payment to a small down payment on a nice exotic car.
