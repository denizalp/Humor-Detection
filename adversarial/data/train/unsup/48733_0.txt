Golden Dragon is another place that I always go whenever I am home in Akron. Their old location was awesome- they were a little further down the street, right by my old ballet studio. That location was divided into two sides- Japanese and Chinese. On the Japanese side you could sit on the floor, which of course my family always opted to do. The new location isn't as fun, but they have the same people working there and it's always nice to see a familiar face.\n\nThe food is pretty standard American Chinese food. The sushi is pretty good for Akron :) and they have a pretty good lunch buffet on the weekends. It's a family favorite, and was always a place that we went when I was growing up. The service is friendly and good, the food is consistently tasty, and even without the on-the-floor seating, the ambiance is very nice.
