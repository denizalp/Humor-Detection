Oh my.\n\nThis place it STRANGE!\n\nOn the plus side, it is (surprisingly!) a relatively clean establishment once you step inside. I would say the pluses probably end there.\n\nThe audience that this place attracts on a Friday night is a bizarre hodgepodge of rocker dudes, senior citizens, cougars and 20 somethings. All there to do one thing and one thing only:\nDrink.\n\nWhen I was there, a bar brawl nearly broke out, but the heated tempers were quickly quelled by the middle aged man wearing the \"security\" hat.\n\nI can not imagine ever coming back to this place. With it's centre street location residing north of McKnight, there is no possible way I would ever go out of my way to stop by this place.
