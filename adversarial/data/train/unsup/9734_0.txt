Very disappointed with the service and some of the food. The soup was lukewarm at best and the tofu dish was cool. They were busy and couldn't handle it, service was very slow. The black bean dish was bland. We had reservations but got stuck at one of the bar height tables with a very uncomfortable wood chair by the freezing cold window. Not likely that we'll be back anytime soon.
