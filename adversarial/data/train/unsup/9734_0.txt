OK, this place has a LOT of frozen Gluten Free stuff! Corn dogs! Doughnuts! Pizza! It's a little spread out, it isn't in one aisle but it's there.\n The store is clean, they don't let the lines get too long before they call for back up. It's a relief from Walmart where the \"interesting\" factor is something to experience. Here it's mostly Moms with kids, and younger single peeps getting foods and nonfoods. \n They have a decent produce department, with no little gnats, and no spilled pyramids of fruit rollaways. Nothing like walking into Produce and seeing a vast wasteland of crap people didn't bother to put back up when it fell.\n The meat is ok. I don't have too high of meat standards, according to my girlfriend. She's a meat snob sometimes. We've gone to four stores looking for Filet that meats her approval. If I don't see a Filet I like I'm fine with a Delmonico cut. Again, she says I should care deeply.I think she's nuts. It keeps it interesting.\n They have my Moms Starbucks coffee drinks, daughters waters, sons energy drinks, I only very occasionally drink anything like those so I guess I am the laidback one. LOL
