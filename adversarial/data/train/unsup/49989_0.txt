Just got my first tattoo here.  Walked in a Sunday morning not sure what to ask for, met Cassie.  The next day walked out with an awesome calf long ink for way less then I expected to pay for something that size and perfect instructions for after care.  Can't wait to get back and add to it, awesome shop!
