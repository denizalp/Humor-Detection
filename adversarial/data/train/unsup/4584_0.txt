Being a member of the coastal elite, I've managed to accidentally avoid Culver's my whole life - who knew this Great Lakes region fast food standard had made it to my new home court in the Southwest?\n\nYou gotta respect the Wisconsin-ness of doubling down on the dairy products and literally adding them to everything. You like burgers? How 'bout the BUTTER burger!  You usually get fries with that? Replace them with fried CHEESE CURDS! And why have ice cream when you could add EGGS and have a frozen custard!  Gotta be honest, it works, and it establishes Culver's as unique compared to BK or McDs. \n\nCulver's is bound to go full KFC Double Down and release a butter burger with a layer of cheese curds and a fried egg - its in their DNA, and you know you'd try it!  Release it for football season and call it the Cheesehead for the Packers fans, or give a nod to the health downfalls of fast food, add bacon, and call it Culver's Last Stand. Msg me for more US History and NFL themed burger ideas, Culver!
