They weren't kidding when they said do Vegas differently. I was a little unsure about the whole no casino thing and not directly on the strip thing, but since I flew in to Vegas for EDC, I knew I wasn't going to be spending much time in my room anyway since my friends and I were a bit ambitious with the pool parties, clubs, and actual event at the speedway. It was SO NICE to have a relaxing setting without all the cigarette smoke you would find in your usual casino resort. It's not too far off the strip and you can always take the tram to aria\/crystals\/Monte Carlo. \n\nThe breakfast is pretty delicious for room service food. The dinner menu ok. It looks kind of unappetizing but it tastes all right if you're too lazy to go out or have some comps available. \n\nYou can charge everything to your room which is cool. \n\nHousekeeping is awesome. They reorganized our messy stuff on the tables\/bathroom (in a good way) and clean the shower each day for you so it's like your in a new room each time you come back. The staff are super nice too. Hands down the best experience I've had in a Vegas hotel. I realized how bad my MGM experience was last year while on this stay lol.
