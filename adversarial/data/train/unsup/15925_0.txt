My best friend and I call this our \"rich lady\" escape. For a reasonable price, you get to feel like a movie star for three hours. A waft of eucalyptus hits you as you walk in and are greeted by the always-lovely staff (well, almost always... The woman at the counter yesterday was stressed and brusque, but I won't penalize Body Blitz for someone's bad day).\nThe water circuit is truly luxurious, alternating between hot and cold. The spa itself is classic Toronto beauty: exposed brick, hanging lantern lighting, and cozy chaise loungers.\nPro-tip: order a nourishing rooibos iced tea. They will deliver it halfway through your visit and you will pat yourself on the back for being so smart.
