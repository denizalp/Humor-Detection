First of all this hotel doesn't even deserve 1 star! it should have -5 stars!!\n\nWhen I checked into my room I noticed the moldy smell from the carpet I just thought it's not a big deal since i'm only staying for a night, then I start checking the bed making sure there is no bed bug then found out underneath my bed there are towels full of blood and dirty laundry even in the closet there are bloody towel as if i'm sleeping in a crime scene, I immediately contacted front desk and the night shift receptionist told me he can't do anything for me except sending security up to the room to remove the bloody towel. Just then I thought things can't get any worse I start hearing people banging doors none stop around 3-4am and I look outside seeing 4 hookers knocking the door beside mine and yelling...\n\nAnyways I waited until morning to talk to the manager Patti after explaining the whole situation and she only gave me 2 breakfast buffet when we check in with 3 people WTF? and told me because I didn't book through them so she can't refund me the money, so after talking to her I contacted EASYTRAVEL and they called the hotel in regards of the situation and hotel refuse to refund the money after this tragic incident so they can only refund 18% of my hotel fee!!! this is the MOST disgusting hotel ever and DON'T EVER GO THERE!! unless you wanna sleep in some crime scene and deal with rude customer service people who clearly doesn't care about their customers!!\nand the picture that's posted online is probably taken YEARS ago!! because it looks like a rundown motel once you go in! and they shouldn't even call them-self CASINO when they only got freaking 5 slot machines!!!\n\nP.S. EVERY room here is smoking room so it smells really bad!!
