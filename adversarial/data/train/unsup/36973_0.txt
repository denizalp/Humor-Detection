We ordered the turkey pastrami sandwich, a cheese burger and fries.  The sandwiches and fries were well prepared and presented, the flavors good but not outstanding. Non of the dishes were 'the best we've ever had'.  Some of the disappointment may have stemmed from the slow and careless service we received.  We came in for a late lunch on a holiday.  There were plentiful wait staff and kitchen staff present but from the hostess to the waiter every part of the process seemed to be in slow motion. When the food did arrive the side dish and the sandwich toppings were not as ordered.  They did correct the side dish order but again in relative slow motion.  I would only come back here if I was looking for a pleasant place to idyll away 2 hours in downtown Phoenix.  I never saw the butcher and can't say if he really is arrogant.
