One of my favorite places!\n\nI have a confession though... I'm a trivia addict.  So any restaurant or bar that has the Buzztime trivia automatically gets an extra start in my book... but for some reason this is where I like to play more than anywhere else.  I usually hang out in the bar\/off track betting area, playing trivia and once in a while betting on the horses or dogs (with miserable results, I hate to add.)\n\nOne of my favorite sandwiches in the Valley is here - I love their Buffalo Chicken.  It's huge and covered in a pretty hot yet flavorful buffalo sauce. Unlike most places where it's not hot enough... oh and they let me choose the heat level.  Wings are really great here as well.\n\nNow I'm wanting to get back over there for a beer, buffalo chicken and gave of trivia... Too bad it's only Thursday.  \n\nCons: If you are a young single man looking to go out and meet someone, avoid this place at all costs. Also only a few microbrews, and not a lot of choice of beers on tap.
