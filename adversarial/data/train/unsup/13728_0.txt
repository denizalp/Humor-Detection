I ordered some catering dished for a pool party I had recently. Everyone loves some Filipino food, so I was excited to try out this joint. \n\nWe ordered:\n\nSisig\nLumpia\nPancit Bihon\nChicken on stick\n\nEverything was super good. The only thing people didn't like as much was the pancit. I make it pretty often and they said that it didn't taste as fresh or as \"fishy sauce\" as they like it. I thoroughly enjoyed it though. Especially because I didn't have to cook it! We didn't even have leftovers for about 15 people. We spent roughly $180 for the 4 dishes. Which is really not too bad. \n\nOverall, we'll definitely be going back to this place. I want to try out some more stuff to compare it to my family's cooking. :) Also, I need more sinigang in my life.
