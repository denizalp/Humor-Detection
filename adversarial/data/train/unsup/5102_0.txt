My girlfriend and I recently had the pleasure of staying at the renowned Trump International Las Vegas hotel, and we were delighted with the entire experience. \n\nWe arrived just after the 3PM check-in time one recent Sunday afternoon and were greeted at the front by a kind valet who arranged for a bellhop. We stepped inside the beautiful lobby and were happy to receive a complimentary upgrade to a strip-view suite on the 35th floor (3500). \n\nUpon entering our room, we found ourselves in the finest hotel room either of us had ever stayed at. Even the basic rooms at the Trump International are loaded with amenities, such as a kitchenette with cook surface, refrigerator, and microwave, as well as a humongous Jacuzzi spa that could fit 3 to 5 average sized adults and at least 2 very fat people, or one massively obese man and two slender women.\n\nOverall, we had a wonderful experience and I can't wait to stay here again.
