I worked with FPE at the Eglinton Grand for a gala. Their input was great on ideas how to change the layout and their set up time was a lot shorter than expected. Throughout the event the team was very aware and helpfully in keeping on schedule. It was my first time working with them and will definitely keep them on our preferred list. Trustworthy and very organized.
