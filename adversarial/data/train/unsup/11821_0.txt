Man, got the yelp deal and fed me and my gal for the entire meal!  Poor cows!  Got the meat samplers and it was good portions.  We had enough for lunch sandwiches the next day.  The meat was grilled perfectly, tasty, meat came off the bones and had a little grill mark to add that grill flavor.  So why the 3 stars?   The problem is the barbeque sauce.     The barbeque sauce ... tasted like watered down ketchup, and not much of a secret tangy barbeque sauce passed down through generations of southern family home grandma cookin'.\n\nComon guys, get with it!  Improve the barbeque formula!  I'd probably give you a much higher rating.  Service was good.
