I lived year for a few years a while back. I lived in the caseiana model with a garage. I absolutely loved the open floor plan. Anytime we had a maintenance issue (not often) they were there right away. After our lease is up at Veer Towers we are actually thinking of moving back here. The pool is beautiful too. Overall a great experience here!
