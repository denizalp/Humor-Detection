This was not my first visit to the offices of Ford and Caserta and no, it was NOT the first time there was surly staff. They are nice enough on the phone but in person, not so much. I too arrived at 7:45 for an 8 a.m. appointment. The receptionist did not look at me. She just handed me a clipboard and asked for my insurance card.  I dutifully filled out the papers and returned them to her and then my wait began. She was rude to other patients too. They really need a new receptionist who is empathetic or at least smiles. I didn't want to be there at 7:45 either! \n\nAt 8:20 she notified me that my doctor called in and was running a half hour late. Are you kidding me? By the time of his expected arrival, I would have been waiting an hour. My time is valuable too! I understand emergencies, but if that was the case, then I think I would have been informed of that.  I didn't wait. I have responsibilities too. \n\nI made another appointment but probably won't keep it. I'm still annoyed by this and don't think my insurance or I should have to pay for sub par service.  Sorry, docs. Get your act together and maybe your patients will be content.
