This place is horrible with the worst service ever!  The sales reps were very attentive when I came in to buy my car. After that, every time I came in for service was a nightmare. I made an appointment for service just this afternoon, and I came in at 2 pm, then I've been waiting for more than 2 hours for the service to be completed! I was told that they would arrange a shuttle service to get me home, and I've been sitting in the lobby waiting forever ! Then the last time I checked with them, they told me that where I live, which is Bloor and Dufferin, which is practically still downtown, is too far, so they can't drive me home,\nbut they can drop me off at a subway station. Then the guy promised me to drop me off at Young and Bloor, and told me their driver was outside and would be back in 5 mins, then I continued to wait, for another 45 mins until my car's ready, and I drove home. I am extremely unsatisfied with the service, because of that, I need to re-arrange my plans for the afternoon. The guy at the desk was like \" It's been crazy today. There's nothing we can do\". If you are considering getting an Audi, I strongly recommend you getting your car at other dealers. The service here was unacceptable. I also came in once because I noticed the drive's side mirror didn't change angles when I back up, and it supposed to. I had to explain it over and over again, but they failed to fix it for the first 2 times. Overall, I am so disappointed with the service, now that my warranty is expired, I don't think I'll ever come back.
