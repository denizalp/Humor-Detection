I can't put in words how amazing this place is. I have always been nervous coming into the dentist for any reason. I was recommended to Smile Concepts by a family member, and have no desire to go anywhere else. All staff members have gone above and beyond to make sure I can come in and see them when needed despite being so popular and busy. Blown away by this place and will be a customer for life!
