This place is hit and miss. Overall, I'd describe the quality of food as mediocre, and the quality of service below average. In my opinion, there are several better choices for this type of food in about a 200m radius of this place.\n\nOn the plus side, the place is large, the wait times are low, and they're very quick in preparing food when you order for takeout.
