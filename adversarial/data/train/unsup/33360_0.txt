They did such a great job! I wish I got a before picture because my carpet was so dirty--I thought I would need to replace it! I included the after, which makes it look like new!\n\nI wrote Adolfo the day before on Yelp asking him for a quote. He responded RIGHT AWAY and his prices were very reasonable (better than the other quotes), so I asked if he could come the next afternoon and he was able to do it...they were so nice and treated the furniture so well! Though their company is based in Henderson, they came to N Las Vegas to clean the carpet.\n\nHe texted me when he was coming (he showed up on time) and gave me booties to wear on the wet carpet since I was not wearing shoes. I DEFINITELY recommend!!!
