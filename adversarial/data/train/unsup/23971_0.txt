Come to this ER to die!!!  The wait is long. The process is long. The people working the front have no idea what's going on!  You will wait get seen. You'll wait to get a bed. You'll wait to pay. Then, you'll wait another hour for your discharge papers!  Expect to wait at least a minimum of 5 hours!  Come here if you want to die!  You will!
