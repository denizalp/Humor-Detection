Happened to pop by Madras Caf√© on Saturday and there was a lunch buffet for only $11.95 plus GST.  This lunch buffet was a simple one but it had papadums, pieces of roti paratha, different condiments for the dosa like sambar, a vege soup, a chicken chetiinadu curry, a cauliflower cooked with spices, 2 kinds of basmati rice: white and a chettinadu rice.  The Chettinadu rice was spicy with slices of green chili.  Delicious and spicy hot!  What was also neat was that the potato dosa was also included in the buffet!  They are fair-sized ones too, bigger than your usual dinner plate.  Eat your dosa with the coconut condiment and the different hot condiments from the buffet like the sambar.  It was so yummy!  Raita was also provided as an add-on to your food.  Dessert was Coconut halwah, not too sweet.  \n\nWe decided to also take home a mutton biryani and an egg curry - both were stupendous!   \n\nThe lunch buffet is for Sat & Sun only.  Loads of free parking outside the restaurant in the strip mall.  \n\nThis South Indian restaurant impressed us.  Will be back, as I told the staffer there!
