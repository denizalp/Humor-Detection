Ok.... A new place at Town Square... There have been so many hit and misses, its always good to check them out.  They offered free drinks and apps with movie ticket so, we went.  It will be our last visit.\nSo many Nightclub owners want to have a restaurant to front for their night clubs. Restaurants arent easy to run. Good restaurants make it look easy, but its not. We came in and the hostess told us it would be a couple of minutes wait. No biggie. There were 20 people at the bar and at least 20 empty tables. Not a good start. Then, we got seated and the table was as wobbly as a see-saw. On a good note, the hostess noticed a few minutes later and offered to move us. So many of the staff were running around aimlessly. This is a sign of lack of training. Our server was very cute, and very sweet. She messed the order up, but hey, she was nice to look at. I know that is what the \"nightclub\/restaurant\" owners think when they hire the staff, but people still want good service and knowledgable wait staff.  We ordered a tortilla soup, and 4 tacos. Neither was memorable. Soup was more like a tomato soup ( bland) and tacos also lacked pizzazz. My Margarita was pretty good, even though the server forgot the salt. I waited to tell her, but she was in conversation with other employees and didnt check back with us until we were nearly done.  I dont blame her, I do blame the managers for lack of training and preparation. \"We dont have a specialty cocktail list yet\" she told me. Yet, there is an extensive cocktail list on their website. What gives?? Anyways, another epic fail at Mexican food here in Las Vegas. Stick to the nightclubs, Lolitas.
