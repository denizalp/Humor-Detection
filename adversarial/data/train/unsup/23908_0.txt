Yum! Fruit land is in a big island near the food court in the South outlets. They sell dried fruit products and nuts. You can sample as much of the dried fruit as you want. My favorite were the tangerine wedges and the natural dried pineapple, but the hibiscus is really interesting. I'll have to read up on the nutritional value of it. They are $7.99 a box, and there's a check-in offer for buy 5 boxes and get 1 free. The woman told me they have a shelf life of, like, 2 years. I'll be back every time I'm in the outlets!
