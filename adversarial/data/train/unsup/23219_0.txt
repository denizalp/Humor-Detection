Looking for a blast from the past, or at least want to dress like one? You've found the right place!\n\nAntique Sugar is nestled inside another antique \/ furniture store. All of their clothes are vintage, which is a fancy word for \"awesome from about 30 or 40 years ago\". While nothing in here was exactly what I was looking for, i know where to shop now for those bell bottoms, purple tuxedo tops, or orange striped pants if I ever need one. \n\nPrices here don't compare to thrift stores, so expect to pay about 50 - 80% of equivalent retail prices. $10 - 20 for shirts, $50 - 75 for suits \/ jackets, etc.\n\nHappy Shopping my friends!
