Parasol Up\/Parasol Down, although normally sold as one in the same, a distinction should be made, as in reality each parasol (or umbrella as Rihanna is so fond of parading about) is a different venue. For years, this upscale upper bar has won countless of awards on account of its pricy and, above all, cultured menu.\n\nIf you can buy and sell a third world country before you've finished your morning breakfast, than Parasol Up\/Parasol Down is your sort of happening location. This is the place where the obscenely wealthy come to mingle. \n\nNice chic decor based around the self explanatory parasol; the type of place The Penguin would approve. A structure that decided to negate all modern conventions of what a bar should look like and owned up to the fact that Las Vegas has more sunlight than most regions in the world; no dingy atmosphere, but bright window panes and massive sky domes. What more, aside from elegant cousine and smashing drinks, does this little dive have to offer? How about well mannered waiters and a techinicolor waterfall show, primarily based on the usage of projections and lasers, that has slowly become a benchmark in what is considered Vegas high-society... Good enough?
