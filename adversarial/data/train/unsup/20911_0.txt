Stopped by today (Friday) at 3:45pm and the front door was locked. Website and front door says open Friday from noon -2am??\n\nEither they are closed or they don't know what day it is. \n\nVery confused.\n\nCame back after 4pm and the door was open, so glad we came back. \nThe interior is just dark enough to be romantic and the wood is warm and inviting. Our bartender recommended an old fashioned for me and the French 75 for my wife, both executed perfectly.\nGreat place for drinks and\/or dinner. \n\nWe will definitely return!
