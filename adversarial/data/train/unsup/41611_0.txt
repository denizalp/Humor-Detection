I've tried every steak place in Calgary, been to various places in US and Canada.  Have to say Vintage is still my number one place when it comes to their Rib Eye (I cannot bring myself to order anything else).  My opentable profile would awe anyone on how many times I've dined at this great steakhouse!\n\nThe staff has always been good and the ambiance is exactly what I look for, fits the bill with dining with friends in the  lounge bar side, and having dinner with the wife or family on the other..great ambiance, and did I mention the Rib Eye (med rare)...actual perfection!
