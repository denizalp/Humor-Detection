What a crazy show! I thought it was going to be louder than it was. But the loudest part was before the show even started when all of the kids were banging on the pots and pans. I loved the \"totally random cookie time\". My cousin's kids had a blast and so did the adults! The theater was a little old, but the show made up for it.
