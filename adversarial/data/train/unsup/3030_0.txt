This place reminds me of mom-and-pop sandwich shops from the East Coast.  The place is filled with character.  You can see your sandwich being made right behind the counter, and the cookies (double peanut butter) were amazing.  I wish this place was open on Sundays and a little later in the day though as I can't get there during the week, so that only leaves me Saturday as an option.
