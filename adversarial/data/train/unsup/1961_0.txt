I remember seeing this place on the Food Network and thought it would be pretty cool to go there. When I actually finally got to try it, I was disappointed. \n\nWhen you first go in, they put you in a scrub and it's mandatory. It was a little annoying because I had layers on because it was like 40 degrees outside and adding the scrub on top of my clothes was going to be restricting when I eat. I didn't even want to take my jacket off because I'd still be freezing. Plus it's a little annoying in general because it's so tedious and all you really wanna do is eat. \n\nLet me remind you that this is a themed restaurant. A medical\/ hospital themed where the employees have a nurse uniform and a doctor uniform. And the setting of the place was new and interesting which is why gave it 2 stars. This place is more of an experience than it's food. \n\nNow the food.. The food was bland. Bland. Bland. It was not that great. I've had better burgers than that. The onion rings were the only flavorful thing they had. Though I did like their mango dreamsicle. They are pretty strict with their menu but the way it was setup was cool. You can't have this, you can't have that, we don't have this, we don't have that. Like my aunt asked for hot water because it helps with her stomach and our server was like, \"Nope! We have this water bottle.\" I don't really know. I felt like our server was kinda rude anyways. I feel like the people work there think there think they're hot shit but I mean whatever I guess. Oh yeah. If you don't finish your food, you get spanked.\n\nOverall experience was okay. Ambiance was the only thing that gave this rating 2 stars. Like I said, food was bland. Workers were kinda annoying. And it's cash only. I felt like they did too much with this concept. It's not as great as it seems to be. I personally wouldn't want to eat here again unless I have people out of town coming here that wants to try it.
