I had a facial\/massage thanks to living social. Enjoyed my experience from the beginning to end. Staff was friendly and courteous. Divine Spa is a cute clean boutique. My facial was with Samantha who was very knowledgeable. They use SkinScript products which were new to me. They smell great and worked well for hydrating my skin. My massage was with Michael who is just the man you want to see for a deep tissue massage. I believe he could break me with his hands:) I just wished I lived closer so that I could be a regular!
