Never again! I enjoy Fatburger as a chain but the one on the strip (not so much) as it does not have the same values as the ones in LA. The customer service is horrible and the wait time is unrealistic. The burger was not good, the credit card machine didn't work and the food again taste more like they cooked it and had it waiting for prep only. My review is only based on this one location in Vegas not the chain, I am a Raving Fan and will contine to enjoy Fat Burgers in LA.
