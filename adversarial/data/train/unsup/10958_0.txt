Ohhh mannnnnn so spice, so good. My mouth was a hot bed of tingle after leaving Chinese Halal Restaurant.\n\nWe came here on a thursday night. The restaurant was close to empty, which I always get nervous about. We stood at the front waiting for perhaps a hostess to invite us in or anyone. After waiting a while we kinda just invited ourselves to the middle of the restaurant and waved at the waitress working and she pointed at a table and we sat down. The ordering style is write-it-down-yourself-and-hand-it-back-to-them. We ordered lamb skewers, kidney skewers (don't hate, I love these), bbq buns (which we thought were bbq pork buns... they're not), xianjang noodles with chicken, and black bean chicken.\n\nThe skewers are smallish and kinda pricey but so good. Definitely hits the craving for skewers.\n\nThe kidney skewers are also smallish, but good. Well seasoned.\n\nBBQ buns which we THOUGHT were bbq pork buns, were good despite lacking the meat we were expecting. They are season in cumin and chilli flakes and very addicting. \n\nXianjang noodles with chicken were good but very spicy and oily. Delicious hand made noodles were nice and chewy.\n\nBlack bean chicken was the crowd pleaser that day. Unbelievably tender and juicy, it came sizzling hot on a cast iron plate.\n\nService was poor, any time we need anything, menus, drinks, orders, etc it took a lifetime to wave the waitress down, considering the restaurant was so empty it should have been easy to get some attention but nope. A little frustrating and at times we wondered if she even understood us.\n\nHowever even with the poor service, the food was very good and very well priced.
