Dinner last night so delicious!  Four of us enjoyed sizzling rice seafood soup, the most savory garlic string beans, tender cashew chicken, beef with black bean sauce and mixed vegetables!  We look forward to trekking back from Mesa soon!  One downside: wait staff were inattentive and careless with serving \"over\" their guests!
