Imagine a Hong Kong born girl, having only stayed at the states for about a year, watch her first Cirque Show not knowing to expect at all - except that the whole concept was supposed to be about a dream (from its literal translation from french) One of my aunts just happened to have an extra ticket for the show and took me along with her in 2009. \n\nThe theatre was artsy fartsy to say the least, there was a bed at the centre of their circular stage which sparked my curiousity the moment I entered. Despite the amazing acrobatics and deep diving, I wasn't as impressed with the storyline as I would've thought. Like any real dream in REM, it was a little jumbled up in my opinion...there was a lot of colors, aquatics, stunts going on that I couldn't really follow the whole plot of the show (if there actually was one) At times it felt trippy (which isn't a bad thing at all) and the music was out of this world.\n\nIf you happen to be visiting Vegas, I'd recommend you try out other cirque shows (e.g. KA and a beatles fan, LOVE) but if you're a local feeling adventurous with some extra cash to spend on a show, by no means try it out :)
