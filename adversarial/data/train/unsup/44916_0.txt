You would think that Starbucks would get 5 stars no matter what the location.  This one doesnt.  No drive thru, so you must go in, it's cramped in there, there are very few chairs to sit and enjoy your beverage and there is almost always a line in there!  The drinks are pretty consistent, and its 4 blocks from home , so those are the only things that keep me going there.
