This is the kindest staff of any store ever. They're always laughing, having fun and pushing wine samples on you. They have dog treats and don't charge you for bags. They're just the best. Five Stars for the staff.\n\nFour stars for their sweet location. Anything attached to Honest Ed's gets automatic street cred, even if this is a bit of a blah corner otherwise. \n\nTwo stars for their selection. I know they have to be all Canadian grapes. But I've never enjoyed a wine from here and would never, ever gift someone a wine from here. \n\nPEPPER POINTS for staying open late. Sometimes a girl just needs a bottle of wine at 10:55pm.
