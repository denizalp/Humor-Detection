We picked up our car in Phoenix and had a flat tire by the time we arrived in Page (which is beautiful, but FAR from Budget, or pretty much anything.)  I called the roadside assistance number and was told that it would be hours before anyone could get out there to help us.  I told the roadside assistance guy that there is a Walmart in Page, and they do tires.  Walmart normally won't touch a rental car, but I got the \"okay\" from Budget to get it fixed there.  It was fixed by 8am the next morning (before my kids even woke up) and we were on our way!  When I returned it to Budget I had to speak to a manager about the issue.  Walmart needed to replace the tire, not just patch it, because there was a big nail in it.  The Budget manager was very pleasant (I'm sorry I didn't get your name).  He credited the amount of the repair back to my credit card with no hassle.  \n\nHaving a tire lose air on a 4-1\/2 hour drive in an unfamiliar area is stressful.  Budget really handled it well, first, by letting me take care of it quickly at Walmart, and second, by being pleasant, and reimbursing me for it.
