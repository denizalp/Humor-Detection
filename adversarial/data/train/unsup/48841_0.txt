Excellent service for our first visit. From the moment we arrived the bouncer checking ID helped us choose a table and noticed our seat of choice needed a bit of cleaning. He didn't wait for someone else he took the initiative to clean it himself.\n\nOur waitress was equally attentive providing solid recommendations. We had the dozen wings (typical bar food that tasted just fine) \/ cheese steak egg rolls (first time I has them anywhere and loved it. It has a nice balance of cheese and meat wrapped by the standard egg roll wrap) \/ Ribs were amazing! Our waitress described it as a specialty since the chefs used to own a BBQ place. I can see why she called it out.\n\nI will certainly come back again.
