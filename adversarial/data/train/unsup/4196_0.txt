I'm a sucker for cute, small, easy things.  And the Wicked Spoon plays into my weakness for detail, great customer service and small portions.  There was practically no wait for the buffet when we showed up on Saturday at 11:30AM.    \n\nI'm a small person with a small appetite so the prepared portions actually work out for me. With the exception of the shrimp cocktail. I LOVE shrimp cocktail and it is prepared 2 shrimp to a small serving cup at the Wicked Spoon. I ate 8. Don't judge me.\n\nOther than shrimp, I was able to enjoy the mac n cheese, the creamy cheese polenta, the smoked salmon, the gelato (salted peanut flavor), various salads, homemade jam on sesame rolls, macarons, chocolate covered crab apples, chocolate covered strawberries, lime tarts, etc.  All were delicious and prepared in cutesy ways (servings of fried chicken are presented in mini friers, if you ask for coffee, your cream comes in a mini, metal milk carton).  \n\nFor the price of weekend brunch ($28 w\/o unlimited champagne\/mimosa\/bloody mary), it's great quality compared to the other buffets on the Strip.  We were staying at the Mirage and they were charging the same price for buffet but I'm confident you're not going to find the same type of food and same quality of food elsewhere.\n\nWe were able to chat up the breakfast sous chef who described how strictly the kitchen is run.  Our conversation made me feel confident that not only was the food we were were eating tasty, but it was fresh too!\n\nOfficially my favorite buffet in Vegas.  Can't wait to come back for dinner.
