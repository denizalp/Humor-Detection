EXPENSIVE! This is a new restaurant in town so I guess they do deserve the buzz? The decor is nice and modern. They served modern Italian food with smaller portions and bigger price tags than some of the other restaurants. \n\nThe food was good but not sure if they are worth the price tags. They do try to convince you to order at least 3 courses (4 with desserts) because they are tapas styles and meant to be shared. \n\n$15 for table side Caesar salad - it was good and can be served with anchovies and fried capers.\n\nRavioli was $15 and it came in 5-6 small pieces. \n\nBlack squid pasta $18 - one of the better dishes they have. \n\n6 oz filet $45 was served with potato side dish. The cheapest meat on the menu. They have another cut of meat for $110! \n\nScallops $35 and it came with 4 pieces. Not worth it in my personal opinion. I had way better scallops in other restaurants.\n\nTiramisu $8 - it was a small sliver of tiramisu. Decent but nothing spectacular. \n\nAnyways, prepare to spend at least $100\/person.
