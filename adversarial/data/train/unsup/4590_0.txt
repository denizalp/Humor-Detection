So I played golf,  worked out for two hours, and practiced two hours on my lousy sand play.  After burning thousands of calories, and getting nowhere on my sand shots, I figured I owed myself a treat.  So I stopped by Sweet Republic on my way home, and tasted almost every ice cream they had - and they were all delicious.\n\nI finally settled on their Salted Butter Caramel Swirl, and  loved it.  Always health conscious, I limited myself to two scoops.  But I am now at home calculating how many calories I will have to burn off to justify another trip to Sweet Republic. And this time to go for three or more scoops!!
