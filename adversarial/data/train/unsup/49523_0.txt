Great coffee here! After being thoroughly disappointed with Barriques downtown, I was delighted with the coffee served at their Middleton location. \n\nI stopped in here by chance to meet someone from Craigslist and decided to give them another shot, and I'm glad that I did. \n\nThe shop is beautiful and the coffee gear is kept shining clean. The brewed coffee that I drank was delicious, properly strong, and a little smokey. It tasted freshly roasted and freshly brewed. \n\n5 stars to the Barriques in Middleton! Not downtown ;)\n\nAbout me: I've roasted coffee at home for the last 7 years and own two professional espresso machines along with two pro grinders and a lot of other equipment, so it's rare that I find cafes that can prepare coffee on par with what I make at home. Barriques in MIddleton is one of them!
