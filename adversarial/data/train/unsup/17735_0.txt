Yep, this is quite authentic Chinese food but the Americanized looks fine too. The only thing that would have made this better would have been eating with someone and being able to share and try some more food.\n\nI chose the Spicy Chicken with Chilis and yes, it was a little spicy but if you stayed away from the peppers, it was really just a lot of flavor and texture. Do people really eat those hot chili peppers? They just seem dry to me. Plenty of chicken and it was tasty.\n\nService was good and the food was excellent. I'll need to meet up with some of you Yelpers here so we can get a few things for the table and SHARE!\n\n(My 100th review of 2018!)
