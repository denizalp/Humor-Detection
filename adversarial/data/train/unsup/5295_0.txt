LOVE LOVE LOVE \n\n\"There's nothing you can do that can't be done. \nNothing you can sing that can't be sung. \nNothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game \nIt's easy.\" \n\nI grew up on the Beatles and I haven't heard them in years. Cirque is like walking into a dream with the soundtrack of the Beatles, Legendary songs, like, \"Because\", \"Get Back\", and \"Something in the way\". I cried. 8 times. It was beautiful. \n\nOf course, if you're a Beatles fan, you have a vision of what the show should be, but you have to let the artist in you go and watch the show as Cirque interprets it. \n\nThe theater entrance is a fabulous splash of technicolor LED floors and blares Beatles music. People are dancing outside the theater before and after the show.  I did. *blush* \n\nThey even have speakers behind every seat! If you go for any show, I always recommend getting the best seats that you can. For this show it is defiantly worth it. I sat in the second row and could almost touch and feel the expressions on the casts faces. This is the way the show should be experienced! \n\nAt one point of the show, a bed with children on it roll out into the center of stage, and starts to elevate into the sky while the children pulling out the white sheets from the bed.  The covers start coming towards you, until the entire audience is under a white canopy with psychedelics and visuals shining through it! We become a part of the dream.... \n\nLoved it. \n\n\"All you need is love, all you need is love, \nAll you need is love, love, love is all you need. \nAll you need is love (all together now) \nAll you need is love (everybody) \nAll you need is love, love, love is all you need.\" \n\nThe Beatles and Cirque? HELL YEAH!!!!! \nStanding Ovation! \nOne of the best shows in Vegas right now!\nBravo!
