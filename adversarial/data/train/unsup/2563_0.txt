tacos for dinner\ntoday more tacos for lunch\ntacos forever\n\nOutstanding. The \"Loretta\"salad was perfect. Loved the chipotle\/honey vinaigrette and the prefectly fresh ingredients.  I'll have another today.  We tried 7 different tacos.  The tortillas are made fresh in house. I expected at least one to be \"meh\", but nooooooo....    ....all were delicious.  I'm so glad we have a Bakersfield. So glad.\n\nCarry on, and eat tacos.
