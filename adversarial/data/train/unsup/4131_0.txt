Happy Hour Mon-Sat 3-7pm & 10pm-Close, Sun 3pm to Close\n\nCame in for late night Happy Hour with Ambi D.  They have tons of Happy Hour food and drink specials.  Everything is under $10 with most being in the $5-$8 range.  We sat at the bar and started with a Fuzzy Momo Bellini and Milk & Cookies Cocktail.  For food we ordered Lobster Spring Rolls, Pineapple Cheese Wontons, Scallop Dynamite Roll, Kaarage Chicken and Shrimp Lettuce Wraps.  Food was excellent.  The Lobster Spring Rolls and Pineapple Cheese Wontons tasted almost identical.  Both have cream cheese and fruit (mango and pineapple) so while they were good I wouldn't order them together again.  We had a great bartender who made sure we were taken care of.  Drinks were super strong, to strong for me to be honest.  I'm not a quitter so I finished them, but it was a struggle.
