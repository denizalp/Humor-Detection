Their website is a little dingy, so I called in order to get information on cake prices & such. The first time I called, they were extremely busy and asked me to call back in 20 minutes. I was slightly frustrated, but I know that it is a fantastic bakery and understand why they had asked me to call back in a bit.\nOnce I called back, the customer service was amazing! The woman on the phone was extremely nice & we completely my order in no time. (:
