Sort of nervous eating someplace with such a low rating, but since the terminal A doesn't have many options (at all), I gave it a shot.\n\nThe bar is set up with iPads for easy ordering, but only if you're paying with card. The iPad's also serve as entertainment while you wait for your flight. I didn't use them much, only to order, because I kept thinking of the 1,000's of fingers on this before mine. Buzzkill, I know.\n\nI ordered a chicken sandwich, fries and a coke. Came to around $22 CAD which for airports isn't that bad. It came within ten minutes, probably less.\n\nThe chicken was piping hot. Burn your mouth hot. The fries were good. Nicely seasoned. The glass they give you for the coke is rather small and there is no indication that refills are free so I didn't ask.\n\nYou can also do takeout and they have a small kiosk on the side for pop, snacks and other sandwiches.\n\nBeing honest, the sandwich tasted like a Wendy's chicken sandwich and honestly I love those. It had a more gourmet taste if that even makes sense, but based on reviews of this place it wasn't that bad!
