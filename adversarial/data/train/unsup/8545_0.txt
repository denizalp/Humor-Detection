This place is kind of a savior in vegas. You can walk in (without waiting in line), and sit at a *table* for *free*....WHOA. Get over the strip people...unless you really want to wait in a line for 2 hours and bring 20 girls and $2k to get into a sweet lounge.\n\nSmooth ambient dj, awesome wait staff, and reasonably priced drinks. Not to mention, super close to some amazingly divey yet kick ass lucky (at least for me) casinos on fremont street. Make sure to try the rhubarb refresher when you are there. Yes...a whiskey and rhubarb drink. Seriously...could life-iness be any better??\n\nBeware of the mirrored bathrooms there if you are tanked (like I was). Some of those urinals are actually reflections of urinals in mirrors. The pee does not flush when you are done (thankfully, I noticed this juuuust before I started going, but after I bumped my head on the wall).\n\nAlso beware of the exit door if you are tanked (like I was). The door part is the *solid* side, not the glass side. Anyone remember the movie birdie? Yeah I pretty much did the same thing - full sprint into a glass wall. Thankfully, I did not break my neck, but I did have the biggest bruise ever on my right kneecap for a week. Ah the cost of my stupidity.
