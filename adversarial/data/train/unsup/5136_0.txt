Since there are so many great reviews on this place and I'm half asleep, I'm gonna (try to) keep this one short and sweet.\n\nLikes:\n- Saag poutine. My first bite & I heard David Cassidy singing \"I think I love you\". Yes, it's that good..and yes, I do sometimes hear random people singing when I eat\n- Delicious meat. You can always tell a well-seasoned piece of meat and my organic burger was that. I couldn't talk for awhile, it was so good.\n- Excellent mixed drinks. Tequila & I have a very close relationship and I was disappointed in the Cosno drink I had last night.\n\nDislikes:\n- The bun. It was a little bigger than I would've liked and felt like my burger was lost in it. First two bites was just bread which I don't like. But the meat was worth the wait.\n- Lighting. Felt like I was in one of those hideaway restaurants that you take someone you're too ashamed to date in public.\n\nHeard it was a bit more daunting for the large Decemburger kick-off but the waitress was pretty okay for our little group of Kat F., Susan C., Vivek S. and I. Would definitely go back again to sample some other burger choices--but maybe in the daytime :)
