National stone did a great job overall. They have good inventory of granite slabs on reasonable prices. They were helpful when selecting the material and even let me and my fiancé pick the specific slabs to be used for our kitchen.\nI would give 4 stars for installation only because they tried to use less wood to support the granite at one area but after my fiancé inquired about it they fixed it right away. The best part was that the installation was done in one day.\nThank you @NationalStone
