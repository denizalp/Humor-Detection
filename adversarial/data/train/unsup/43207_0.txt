I got the lamb pita on whole wheat, I asked for it to be cooked medium well. It was well done.  The sandwich lacked flavour and was dry.  \nThe perogies & falafel were good. The falafel didn't taste like traditional falafel. The ingredients are definitely different. \nMy sister got the chicken pita the chicken has a strange taste. The spice they use is not that tasty to us. \nI don't think I would return but the staff is friendly and it looked fairly clean.
