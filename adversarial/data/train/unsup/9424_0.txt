So this place has a pretty cool concept and looks awesome. Buffet, multiple themed dining rooms, private party rooms, games, rides, and prizes... The facility itself is nice... \n\nBUT... \nCame here for a party on a Sunday afternoon, and it was CRAZY busy. As in, watch your step or you'll probably trip over someone. \n\nWhen we first got here, seems like they were able to keep the food up with the crowd... But by the time we were about ready to leave a couple hours later, there were lots of ppl waiting around empty food displays.. And, only one ice cream dispenser was working at first, by the time we left, that one wasn't working either. Otherwise, I kinda like their buffet, especially for a kid party. But they have a decent salad bar with the lettuce looking clean and crisp.. And I like their Alfredo pizza, garlicky! \n\nThe play area is huge, geared mostly for grade school kids, but there's also a few games and a play area for the younger ones... A noticed several games \"out of order\", which is kinda surprising given that this place is relatively new... \n\nSo I think this place is a decent place to bring your kids, on a not so busy day (if that exists in this town). They may still need to work on how to handle the crowd.. \n\nAnd some tips for you PARENTS... \n\nTeach your kids to share! If they see a line of kids waiting to play a game, don't sit there playing it OVER & over... Play it once (or maybe even twice) then get back at the end of the line! \n\nAnd... \n\nJust because you are \"all together\" in a group, doesn't give the 5 of you the right to cut in front of the long line of waiting KIDS, because you decided to join the ONE lady and kid actually waiting in line (in front of me). So yea, the passive me spoke up, and yea, I didn't let you cut. That's just rude! I swear my earrings were about to come off, hold my purse! Haha totally jk. \n\nYeaaah, for a much better experience, come here midweek or something.
