Drais nightclub is a racist venue that profiles the same black people that they attempt to cater to and profit off of. I was profiled while using the bathroom by their security under claims of using marijuana in the bathroom and unrightfully forced to leave even after the claims of me having marijuana by the security officer was confirmed to be false by both the security team and police at the venue and was denied re entry to the event. It is ridiculous that even though I was staying as a guest at the Cromwell hotel where Drais is located and have spent thousands with the establishment, I still was not able to enjoy my night, let alone use the restroom in peace. The management is unprofessional and even after meeting with the head of security Chris Spanuzzi he was unwilling to assist me, refund the absorbent cover charge paid to attend the party or even apologize for the wrongs done by his staff. As I also had a horrible stay at the hotel, I will NEVER spend money with the drais club or the Cromwell hotel again.
