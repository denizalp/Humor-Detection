Tucked behind a towering crystal staircase in the downtown Pittsburgh Fairmont, this place is more of a bar that sells some wine, than a wine bar. Noise reflects easily off the polished floors and the back-lit bar. We popped in on a Thursday night for a drink and there was a live jazz band playing. Tall blue plush seats, swivel by the windows and 4 tops cradle the lobby allowing for 360 views of clients sipping cocktails and enjoying the music. What was missing was a good list of wines. The sole cardboard menu on the table showcased their wines by the glass, to which we were told were alllll of their wines, and a bottle just costs 4 times that price? We opted for a Malbec, that was drier than normal, much darker and tannic.....odd choice for the representative bottle on your list. Either way, if you want a classy cocktail or are staying in the Fairmont, this local is a sleek stashed away oasis for a quick cocktail. I might hit up one of the near by $$$ Italian restaurants for a better wine selection.
