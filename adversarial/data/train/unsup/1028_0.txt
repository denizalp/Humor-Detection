Lots of fun to go up. Had some time before my flight so went up. Was there at the opening and there was no line for the security or to go up. Also took the package to the second level. Was worth it. \nThe view is good but I would not say that you can see to Niagara Falls or Rochester. You can see far but not that far. \nWorth going up once every 25 years bilateral not too often.
