No better place for a Saturday morning baked goods ritual. Go early, because there is usually a line-up and they sometimes sell out of what you want (at least they did at the old place).\n\nAfter these croissants, you really can't eat another croissant from anywhere else again, because these are just that good. They are selling so fast, they're usually warm. They're buttery and so so moist, even seem to be the teeny-tiniest little bit underdone, given them this amazingly light, airy, chewy texture, which is THE BEST. I'm talking about the \"croissant nature,\" the plain jane. \n\nBUT DON'T STOP THERE!\n\nGet the \"croissant au fromage\" as well, basically same as above (though a bit bigger), and  with some cheese laced through it and crusted on top.\n\nDON'T STOP THERE!\n\nBe sure to get a piece (I repeat, a piece, \"un morceau\") of Kouign-Amann. This is the namesake of the place, a wedge from the round, golden, glistening pizza shaped thing in the glass case. Very hard to describe, but the closest I can get is it's kind of like yorkshire pudding dough in thin layers upon layers, with a sweet, crunchy top and bottom. This thing is amazing. Apparently, you can order the entire disc in advance (would be perfect for a big brunch or party).\n\nPrices are amazing, too. 2 X the 3 items above (6 things) is $12.50 or so, all in. \n\nThe service is friendly and attentive.
