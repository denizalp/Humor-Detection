This farmers' market is a sizeable mix of cheap and expensive, local and imported, fresh foods and some delish, niche cuisine. In no particular order, my favourite things are:\nThe face painter when the kids are with me\nThe balloon animal dude (not always there)\nHot dogs from Franks & Mabel's \nSmoothies from Magarita's\nBack bacon and chicken by the 10lb box from Spraggs meat shop\nThe sweet kale salad from the Cherry pit\nThe non-alcoholic fruit wines from Souto farms\nVarieties of honey and hot sauce from Beeland\nDim Sum from Shanghai fine foods\nPlain butter crepe from La Creperie\nPeppers and tomatoes from Gull Valley greenhouses \nMaple syrup and maple butter from Taste of Quebec \nLoose leaf tea from Totalitea\nAND Silkroad spices are here too\n\nDespite this long list of favorites, there's a longer list of good stores I haven't tried out yet. There's a lot to see, buy and do in this little corner of Calgary. I hate myself when I come here hungry because I stuff my face with all the foods and desserts on display\n\nTip1: not everyone takes cards so have some cash on hand or hit the ATM\nTip2: stop screaming kids (yours not other people's) by stuffing their mouths with the generous fruit samples at Souto farms and Cherry pit\nTip3: for a small fee, Cherry Pit will prepare you vegetables and fruits for you \nTip4: Shop just before the market closes for the week on Sunday and you could score some discounts on the perishables \nTip5: shop on Thursday and Friday to get the fave items before they're sold out\nTip6: follow them on social media to get updates on special events\n\nBest time to be in the market? Late spring when all the BC fruit and veggie harvests start coming in. It's like near delirium for the kid in me. \n\nBonus points for clean restrooms and lovely hand wash
