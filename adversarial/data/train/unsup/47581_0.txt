It's unusual to find good food in a gas station, but Tom Thumb has good food.\n\nThe problem is that the prices totally defeat the purpose of trying to find good food in a gas station. You may as well go eat the food at a restaurant. Great food, with corresponding prices, therefor you get what you give.
