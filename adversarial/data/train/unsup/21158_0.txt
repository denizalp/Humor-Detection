Bubba's 33 has a fan in me. I have been here twice so far and each time has produced good service, nice atmosphere and most importantly, great eats. For drinks, the trash can punch is bomb. Do I wish it was a little bigger, yes, but darn tasty it is. As for the grub, I have not found a dish here I have not enjoyed. The fried pickles and garlic knots appetizers are money. For entrees, the aloha burger and aloha chicken are great. So far, I found nothing to complain about. I look forward to many more visits when in the Arrowhead area.
