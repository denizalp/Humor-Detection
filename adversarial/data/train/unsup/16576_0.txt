I'm giving such low stars because of the service. \nThere's a women that works here who did my hair (I had gotten a wash and style and apparently she is the owners sister) was unfriendly from the beginning. She got mad that I came in with my natural curly hair and asked me to detangle it myself and gave me a tiny comb. After detangling, she washed and condition but in the middle of blow drying my hair she walked away without saying anything. I could see her in the back drinking her orange soda talking and laughing with other stylist..\n\n She was gone so long the stylist working in the chair to me said \"where is she??\" And \"why did she just leave her client there?\" to another stylist. \n\nshe finally came back, after I had complained and was seconds from leaving but my friend was also getting her hair down, she came back, no apology, when she asked when was the last time I had a trim I said a few months ago (it was really only 3 weeks ago and I have absolutely no slip tends, period.) she started insisted I needed a trim and my ends were bad for extra money, it was then I told her I just had a trim and they were fine then she said they weren't that bad. So be careful they WILL LIE ABOUT THE CONDITION OF YOUR HAIR FOR EXTRA MONEY. My hair turned out decent regular flat iron, however I will never return. My friend in the picture, also hated her hair.\nAvoid... There is plenty of much better salons in south Euclid
