This Starbucks is literally 20 steps away from a Tim Horton's and they have a much more of a diverse selection of items for breakfast and to be honest.... better coffee since Tim Horton's in general changed coffee distributor a decade or so ago.\n\nLine-up was a little long which was understandable but I was served in about half the time it took my wife to get her coffee at Tim Horton's with a similar line length of clients. Staff is busy but work hard here. Got my Americano in about 5 minutes which is very fair for the amount of people in line. They were organized which was quite different compared to Tim Horton's next door.\n\nI opted for a strawberry scone as well and it was quite tasty!\n\nPrice-tag is a bit high but it's Starbucks and until someone can compete.... this is where I'll go back to.
