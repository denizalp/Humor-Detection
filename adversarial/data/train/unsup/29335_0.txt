I'm basically on the same boat at Mel.  I was hoping that this place would compare to Pieology or even Blaze but they both exceed this place in terms of the taste.\n\nThe price, is reasonable. The pizza looked good during the line prep. Unfortunately, the pizza was horrible.  The bacon was so hard, I almost broke my teeth!  Staff wasn't as friendly as I would have expected- especially since they just opened. The chicken was also hard.  \n\nI won't return here. I'll be returning to Pieology where I've gone to several times already.
