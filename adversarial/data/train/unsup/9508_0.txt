Be warned its very loud, I felt as I was shouting the entire meal.  Saturday night and I don't have reservations but I tried to get a seat at the bar based on recommendations. Was told 1 1\/2hr wait even though there were multiple empty tables.  I think I ended up waiting 10-15 min for a spot at the bar. \n\nFood was muh. Nothing special \nDrinks\/cocktails great, Highly recommendable!\nMusic in background was a good mix of oldies and contemporary. \nIt's seemed to me the younger hip crowd who got reservations vs at the bar was filled with \"Myers park couples\" type \nDress on a Saturday night was far from casual.  In loafers, button down and jeans I felt slightly under dressed. Why do 23 yr guys feel the need to wear a sports coat! \nHowever there were a few others sitting at the bar wearing leggings\/uggs but girls get away with that shit.  \nIt's strange that restaurant of this shorts is in a shopping complex such as Park Road.
