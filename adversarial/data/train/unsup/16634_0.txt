I have to thankÂ chef Patrick Kriss and front of the house Amanda Bradley for bringing World Class fine dining experience to Toronto!\n\nAs someone that \"travel to eat\", I had been planning most of my oversea trips around Michelin starred restaurants: Osaka, Hong Kong, Macau, Chicago, New York... Toronto as one of the major cities in Canada had also been lagging behind Montreal and Vancouver for Higher End, Michelin's worthy dining establishment.\n\nUntil Alo opens its doors back in July 2015.\n\nPlanning - Reservation\n\nReservation can a challenge but worth your effort. Plan accordingly as Opentable reservation is available 90 days out. I was planning to visit Alo as a solo diner but one of my friends was kind enough to join me so I can have the opportunity to try out every offerings on Alo's Tasting Menu.\n\nTasting Menu\n\nEverything is seasonal. I recommend visiting in different seasons to appreciate what Alo's team offers. For 2 people, I would suggest ordering one each \"appetizers\", \"main\" and \"dessert\".\nPresentation was top notch! Pleasing for the eyes and so colourful too! Every dish was a piece of art.  And of course, we all let our cameras eat first and took some photos!\n\nWe ordered some tea to go with our desserts. 9 different kinds of Solane Tea is served here! You can even smell them before ordering!\n\nOVERALL IMPRESSION\n\nA combination of interesting taste profile and texture. The whole meal did take almost 3 hours so hopefully you like your dinner mate. Service here is top notch. The hospitality team (front of the house) is just amazing! Attentive and polite: a 5 star dinner service!\n\nWill I be back?! Yes, in a heartbeat!\n\nMy meal at Alo Restaurant is one of the most memorable meals I had in Toronto.\n\nPRO TIP\n\nIf you want to have a taste of Alo Restaurant without making a reservation, the best is drop by their bar area for a drink and a snack. The bar at Alo Restaurant has this relax and chill vibe which is great for pre or after dinner drink!
