I don't know why this place has such a low rating... I thought it was amazing! The cool decor drew me in to try it out and the super looking menu made me stay and have lunch. I had the Krispy Kreme burger because... How could I not?? It was amazing!! Definitely best burger I have ever had. My friend had the general Tao burger and was equally as impressed. The fries that came with the burger were tasty and came with a yummy mayo in a cute shot glass. The sangria we had was equally as tasty and went down very quickly :) They had tons of friendly staff who helped out whenever they could. I will definitely return on my next shopping trip to see what else they have on that interesting menu of theirs...
