Finally a tapas spot in Mississauga that is worth going to. Came here on opening night and loved the atmosphere. We tried everything on the menu and honestly loved everything. What dish surprised me the most was the tofu. I didnt realize what it was when they brought it out because it looked so unique the way it was presented. But hands down the best dish was the duck fried rice. Loved how they mixed it up for us. With the said the service was phenomenal. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family . Mississauga definitely needed a place like this.
