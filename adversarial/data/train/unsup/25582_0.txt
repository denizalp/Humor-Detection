Holy Carpet Cleaner Batman!!! Tim and Ray Odom With AZ Hydro Pro came and save our carpet (again)! Chris Tousley was absolutely getting new carpet this week as it is terribly embarrassing to have this in our home. LOOK what happened. Tim also said we have really good carpet and it will last another 5-6 years with their care. Go for it! I dare you to save me a few thousand dollars. -- feeling wonderful.
