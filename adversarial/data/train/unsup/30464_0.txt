In a town that has Pomo and Bianco it is hard for the second tier players to get the attention of the Valley's pizza lovers.  After months of neglecting this place I gave it a shot. Although it shares the same techniques that distinguish the Neapolitan craft the pizza comes off with a slightly distinct flair.  It is unique enough to stand out and merit a visit every now and again.
