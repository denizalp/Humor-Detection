Service sucks.  Get there 8 minutes to close which is 5:30 on a weekday and got told you have 3 minutes to find your tree and they didn't even help us find our tree.  What's funny is about 4 separate people showed up at the same exact time and they basically tried to turn everyone away. The two white guys obviously don't care about the business cause they were just rude to us. Jose however was awesome and very helpful so if your gonna go, ask for him.  Didn't find our tree and probably won't go back due to the bad service.  I might go back to offer Jose a job though.
