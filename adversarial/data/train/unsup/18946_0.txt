Great place to soak up some suds before getting in the car and driving. This restaurant is rather small and the decor is somewhat tacky. But who cares when you need to eat something and you do not want to spend an arm and a leg.\n\nThe medium sized menu here has most of the familiar items and favorites that you would see in your typical restaurants. They have different specials that change on occasion.\n\nUsually stop here with other Yelpers after seeing one of the tribute bands. Miss Jolly M. and her man Heath are one of our favorite dining guest and we always have a blast. Last time we all played KENO at the table and had a good 20-30 minutes of laughter and excitement. My number 8 popped up at least 4-5 times. Hmmm?\n\nUsually get the SW Burger and have them bring out Hot Sauce and some Atomic Horseradish. The Reuben is also a favorite and taste really good. Others have ordered the Steak and Eggs with Hashbrowns and Toast or the Chicken Salad Sandwich on a Croissant with Fries.\n\nFood is decent and the prices are out of this world cheap. Just take you time and kick back. You always want to make sure to let the suds soak in good before getting behind the wheel. See you there next time. BEEP BEEP!\n\n3.75 STARS
