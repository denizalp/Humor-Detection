I like ShowerTea as well because you end up all sticky from the tea as it explodes all over you. OK that sounded bad.\n\nSureTea is also good because you can be sure you'll like it.\n\nWhat to get: Okinawa Milk Tea, Whole Lemon Tea.\n\nI've been to 4 Shareteas in Toronto now (there are more, probably like 10 all opened within 6 months), and some of them I've been to multiple times. Of all those 4, every single location had wonderful service, which is a credit to the hiring policies, and to the friendliness of Toronto. This lovely, sweet, ridiculously friendly and gracious girl might be the nicest of the bunch of them. This location made me a wonderful cold Okinawa Pearl Milk Tea (with Brown Sugar) and it was heavenly as expected. Couldn't have loved it much more.\n\nGet this from any location you go to. Their Whole Lemon Tea is also pretty special. And the hot versions of their milk teas are heaven. And make sure you say hi to that sweet girl!
