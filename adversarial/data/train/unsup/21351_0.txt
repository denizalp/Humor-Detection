so let's just say i wish we had a store like this here in the bay area. yeah, we have lots of international markets, but not one big one like this.\n\nwhile visiting the boyfriend's parents, his mom needed to go to the international marketplace to pick up some seafood, etc. when we got to the parking lot, i remembered i had driven past this place before and wanted to visit it. walking in, i was astonished at how big the store was and how much stuff they carried. like many others mentioned, it's like a costco of international foods. they had everything from european, middle eastern, etc. etc. etc. with half of the store consisting of asian foods. this place is awesome because of the variety of items they carry. im not very familiar with other cultures of foods, but as far as the asian and chinese foods, i found so many things that i had never seen before or cannot find in the states. \n\none of my favorite sections was the area with all of the sauces, condiments, oils, and etc. i have NEVER seen anywhere with literally an aisle and wall just for these items... yum! (i am a lover for condiments and sauces).\n\ni didn't end up buying anything since i was in vegas on vacation, and didn't want the hassle of bringing things back with me. but wow, i really wish we had a marketplace like this here in the bay.\n\ndefinitely check out the international marketplace if you like food! especially international foods.
