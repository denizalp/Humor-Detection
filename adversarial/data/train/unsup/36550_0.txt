My husband and I went here for Brunch and IT.Was.AMAZING. The food was delicious, I had the Veggie Benedict with bottomless mimosas. My husband had a custom omelet and the beer flight, which was a generous serving of 4 beers of your choice. We sat outside, where the view was great and the atmosphere was fun! When we were ready to leave, the server gave me a Mimosa to-go, which was awesome! Fantastic place, I'd recommend to everyone!
