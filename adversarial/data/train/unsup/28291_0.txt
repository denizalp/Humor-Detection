I used the online order option. It was easy to use, and didn't have to register. I made my own salad. I was surprised all the toppings were listed. My order was ready when I got there. I actually liked my salad more to go than eating there. Everything was fresh. I didn't order any meat on it, but the veggies were tasty. I had the sweet potatoes as one of the toppings. Great flavor!
