For us, we are such regulars that it is like going to someone we know or family for lunch, seriously.\n\nThe middle-aged lady (server) in particular is one of the nicest people in the entire world.  Just radiates a positive and kind vibe.\n\nThe food:\n\nFoong jow - fall off the bone, soft like butter, the BBQ sauce was perfect and these had steamed for a long time.  Just totally luscious.  (We should have ordered a steamer basket each, seriously)\nNor muy guy - perfectly clinging rice, nice pieces of char siu in there with some finely cut king mushroom in my all-time favourite brown sauce type gravy which is so popular in original and authentic Cantonese fare ... ahhhhhh;\nThe steamed mushroom dumplings were good, not my favourite but spouse loves these, relatively thin wrappers;\nFish balls with special sauce - the actual fish balls are as good as the ones I have had in Shilin Market in Taipei.  VERY well done!\nChar-sieu chong fan - silky, smooth, char sieu a little fattier than usual but still noms extraordinaire.  Ah, this place - so close to my heart.  Just love.  Love the food, love the owners and staff and a nice clientele who frequent this marvellous place (I will not call this a gem as this is the most overused word on Yelp).  (BTW, for anyone wondering, I do not own stock or shares in this operation - LOL).
