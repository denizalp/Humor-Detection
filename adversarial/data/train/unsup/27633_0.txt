We heard about this place from some friends when we showed up to their place, and there it was- Heaven in a box. \n\nWe had it delivered again last night, and it was still damn good. \n\nThe chicken alfredo pizza is amazing. It has just the right amount of everything- moist chicken, alfredo sauce, spinach, parmesan- and nothing is overwhelming or too rich. \n\nThe Queen Margherita was a hit too- basil, tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella- wow. I could have eaten the entire pie myself. \n\nThe prices are on par with what you'd expect to pay at Z Pizza, and it's worth it. The crust isn't greasy at all- it's perfect. \n\nThey have other things- sandwiches and salads, etc. but I haven't ventured beyond the pizza section of the menu yet. \n\nThey do deliver, but sadly for me I live two blocks south of the cut off point. Boo hoo.
