The Clifton Wine Bar intertwined the art of a great, chill environment with the worst wait staff you'll have ever seen.  \n\nMyself and two other friends decided to go here.  We ended up seating ourselves after the hostess kept telling us she was to busy to do so herself for 10 minutes.  Once we sat down and she brought us some waters, no one acknowledged our table for another 30 minutes.  I asked a busser for our server and he said she'd be right out.  Well another 10 minutes still nothing.  I asked to speak with a manager who immediately apologized and said the first bottle of wine would be on them.  \n\nI greatly appreciated this gesture however even after speaking with him, we waited another 15 minutes for it to arrive at our table. \n\nWhen we explained to the waitress we wanted to order food as well, she quickly said the kitchen was closing to which we immediately fired back that we had already waited over an hour.  \n\nThe food was excellent however we had to deal with a waitress who kept delivering our food to other tables and blaming the hostess for supposedly writing down the wrong table and kept complaining about how much she hated her.\n\nPass on this place.
