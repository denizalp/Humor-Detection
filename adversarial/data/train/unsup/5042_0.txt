I managed to scoop up two humongazoid pork chops from their booth at the Downtown Phoenix Market. I also got to sample the smoked pull pork. The pork was awesome, perfectly smoked and moist. I took the chops home to grill up and man was I a happy camper. The chops were bone-in, and just perfect. You could taste the quality in the pork, I'll be buying these chops again. Way to go Pork on a fork, you got skills
