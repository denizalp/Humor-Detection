The night we went, our server informed us that they were particularly busy and that it would take some extra time for the food to come out. We didn't mind waiting, so this was fine with us. We weren't too crazy about the entrees (especially since a quarter of them weren't available that night...), so we shared three appetizers (crab dip, apple sausage, and the duck cannoli) and one entree (chicken pot pie). Nothing about the food was spectacular: the crab dip was just crab dip, the apple sausage was a bit too heavy for me, the duck in the cannoli was very dry, and I found the chicken pot pie too sweet. However, the deep-fried gnocchi that the table next to us got looked good. The tables were kinda cool, but I thought the theme of the restaurant was poorly executed everywhere else. This was not worth going off Butler for. \n\nTaste | 2\nAtmosphere | 2\nPresentation | 3\nService | 3\nOVERALL | 2.5
