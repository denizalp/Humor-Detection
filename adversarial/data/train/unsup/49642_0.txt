What a shame in customer service in this store!!! I went to pick up my equipment for my WiFi service in this location cause is only 4 miles from my apartment.big mistake I always go to the location in rancho were is the main location they are outstanding in customer service!!! Even one of the managers named johnSewell knows me by name cause I stop there sometimes to pay my bills, so lets go back to the main issue, at 9:05 I arrive there an was a skinny kid in a bad mood and grumpy like he just woke up an needs his breakfast not even a salute or a smile but terrible rude , not even a lil of info in my equipment just few words and end it in HAVE A GOOD DAY!! in a terrible tone of voice like get that f@&$ of  here!!!!! People just avoid this place and go the main store in RANCHO. If you don't want to ruin your day.
