We came here for ceiling fans, and were more than impressed.  They have plenty of selection, and the purchase price comes with free installation (which for those not mechanically inclined like me is a great perk).  The customer service provided by them is second to none as well.  They helped us with fans for a new-build home we purchased, and the experience with them was so great I went back to them for fans for a rental property.  I highly recommend paying them a visit.
