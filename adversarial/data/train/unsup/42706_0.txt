It sucks to say but the waitress were not welcoming. I kept feeling like someone was staring and I would look around they would be staring, but not a friendly stare like \"can I refill your drink\".. a rude stare. The food did come in huge portions that can definitely be shared between two people. I had a breakfast dish and waffles. The flavors were not anything special from other places that sell breakfast.
