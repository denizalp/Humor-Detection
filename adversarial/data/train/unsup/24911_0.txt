Holy PooPoo Platter Batman!  This place really sucks!  After waiting 2.5 hours for my food (and several calls to the establishment asking where it is) it finally arrived.\n\nIt was crushed, leaking out of the containers and was so mixed up I wasn't even sure if it was what I really ordered.  Half of the order was already cold.\n\nTrying to make the best of the situation I sampled something that looked like the closest thing to what I ordered.  YECH!  It was either F.U.B.A.R. when it left the kitchen or became contaminated by something else in the bag en route.  That food was Naz-TEE!\n\nMy family is now starving and we have been told by the restaurant that in order to receive credit for the food, the driver has to come back out and pick it up. Peachy by me...  My trashcan is too good for this crap.  We looked at the food and would rather go hungry anyway.  I just hope they don't \"re-gift\" that little gem into someone else's order.  Hell, for all I know that's what they did to us.\n\nPoor food quality.\nPoor service.\nPoor delivery.\nAnd a little pricey for all of that.\n\nYunan needs to take a long walk off a short pier. NEVER GOING BACK!
