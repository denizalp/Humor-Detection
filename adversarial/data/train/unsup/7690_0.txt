Back and better than ever! \nHow do you take an already solid place and make it more remarkable?\nA new sleek space. \nNew furniture! \nNew paint!\nStunning... I'm talking stunning stainless steel!\nA really cool storefront that's a bajillion times better than the old. \n\nBut what hasn't changed? \n\nStill (in my opinion) the most authentic Mexican joint we have in Madison. It's meat on a corn tortilla. With some pico and cilantro. That's what I ate for 7 years, I'm thrilled to keep the tradition alive, and I haven't found anything better in the 608. (People try though... why does everyone want to convince me to keep looking?)
