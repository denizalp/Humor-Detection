I actually had a different idea of what the kensington pub would look like, my silly imagination mistakenly deduced that everyone that frequented the Kensington Pub wore suits\/ties\/argyle socks\/coach briefcases and spoke words like \"synergy\/syntax\/metacorp\/datagrouping\"\n\nBut to my surprise it was actually a laid back tavern. The outside has a particular charm to it that made me feel like I just came back from an arduous quest.\n\nAnyways, I had the poutine which was huge and plentiful. I was fighting back a brewing stomach flu and was unable to consume anything that day, but the poutine hit the spot. Later on I learned that I wasn't actually supposed to eat stuff like this but it was delicious! I also had the onion soup which was rich and delicious as well. The service was also quick and prompt.\n\nI came here for a Yelpaholics anonymous meeting with fellow yelpers. We really didn't get anything done nor was the issue of Yelp addiction addressed. In fact things are much much worse now :S. My hands are trembling in euphoria as each of my fingers dance to key in every letter for this review.
