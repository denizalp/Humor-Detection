On a fun-filled Saturday during my own personal burger weekend, my friend and I decided  that we had time to check out Bubba's for possible takeout after drooling over the menu (even though we had already hit up two other burger hot spots earlier in the day).  \n\nThe location in a strip mall is odd.  Which kind of goes with the decor.  The bar makes sense, but there is no buffer between the bar and the tables in the dining area.  It seems a bit awkward and random.  \n\nSince we decided on takeout, we sat at the bar to enjoy a beer while we waited.  Our bartender was very attentive and was eager to explain the menu.  They really hype the freshness here and pride themselves on not having a freezer.  I decided on the Bubba Burgher with fries, my friend on the Fresh Burgher with grilled zucchini.  \n\nI agree with many reviewers about the buns.  Bubba's is serving up some gourmet meat on some cheap buns that just aren't up to the task of containing these delicious burgers.  It seems a shame.  I ended up discarding most of the bun and just eating my Bubba Burgher with a knife and fork.  I did enjoy my mix of fries but that grilled zucchini my friend got was amazing.  Both of these items seem to be of some debate with other reviewers, but ours, even eaten later as takeout, were still good.\n\nI'm currently giving Bubba's a solid 3 stars.  It was a tough decision on what to order the first time which only means I'll have to go back to try something else.  I'm hoping I'll be able to improve my rating with a return visit.
