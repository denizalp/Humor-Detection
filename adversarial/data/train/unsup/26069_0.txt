Place is horrible\nCold rice, ordered everything medium-hot it was sweet\nPaid additional $3 for shrimp there were 4 shrimp total in the pad Thai...\nThe catfish came as little chunks \nThe salad was wilted\nPaid $70 and am completely upset\nIf it weren't for my girlfriend picking this up out of the goodness of her heart I'd take it back but I just had surgery\n\nWHO POSSIBLY RATED THIS PLACE 4 STARS\nwish I cooked it myself their chefs are an embarrassment to Thai food
