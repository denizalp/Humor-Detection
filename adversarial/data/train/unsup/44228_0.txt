Cute neighborhood coffeehouse with flare! We had a dark chocolate mocha and a cold brew toddy...both were amazingly good and tasted like they were handcrafted. I'd give this a 4 stars if the food was a little better. We had the yummy yummy, croissant sandwich, NM burrito and an egg Sammy. All were good, but lack a ton of flavor. The eggs were really thick and pretty bland. Reminded me of sheet tray eggs from a buffet. There was also not a lot of bacon in the sandwiches. We will be back, but most likely just for drinks and a pastry. Cool coffeehouse!
