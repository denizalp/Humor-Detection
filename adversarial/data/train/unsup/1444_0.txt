Walked out ! Never in my life have I ever done that. The staff, especially the head maitre d' where extremely rude.  We brought a very nice bottle of wine with us and were informed we could not open it. Mind you we were seated with water poured. They did not allow it and no one did on the strip.......um we paid corkage the past three nights at high end places no problem. We had a show to go to and did not have enough time to take the bottle back to our hotel. The lack of costumer service and extreme arrogance for such a high respected place was astonishing. On the web site nothing was stated that you could not bring wine in. Went over to the Old Homestead Steakhouse and they were more than happy to open our wine, had the best prime rib there!\n\nWould have given 0 stars but program would not allow.
