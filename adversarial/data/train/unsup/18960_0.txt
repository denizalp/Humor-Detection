Yeah some people from my hometown in sac ask, \" Dude, you live in Vegas go to a real buffet.\" This is a real buffet. I am tired of the casino, Gordons fishstick buffets. The one thing that really amazed me, is included in the cost of the buffet $12 you can order Thai Iced Tea Complete with Boba... The food is awesome, the service was fast friendly and the food was Great and did not taste like boxed frozen Oscar Myer Corndogs.
