Trying to save money in Vegas saw a groupon  for this place and decided to check it out. It is further inside Harrahs and on the second floor. Our party of 3 was seated quickly but took a while for us to get drinks and have our order taken. The drinks come in large mason jars which justifies the price they charge. Sampled their appetizers of quesadillas, chicken strips and whisky girl wings with bread pudding for dessert. A fan of the strips and wings and the bread pudding was tasty but too sweet with the sauce and whipped cream. The wings were huge and had just enough of sauce and heat. The breading on the strips made the dish and the chicken was nice and moist. Will return here for more appies in the future.
