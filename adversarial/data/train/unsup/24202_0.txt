The Capastrami was amazing. Probably the best submarine I had ever eaten in my life. Seriously. I came back the next day & got the Boobie. Not impressed with that one. Too much dry stuffing. They should use mashed potatoes & gravy instead of stuffing. \n  Lil side story. The chick taking the order starts flirting from the second I walk in. She tells me shes getting off in 5min & she'll b at the bar next door. I tell her I got a show to go to but got her #. She wanted to \"hang\", but had to find a baby sitter. She was way older than me & looked like an alchy. Lol \"They're all whores\"!
