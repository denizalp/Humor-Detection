So exciting to be able to try yardbird without going to Miami! I tried brunch and everything on the menu looked really good. We started with the delicious deviled eggs and they were amazing! I could eat a dozen myself. For my entree I had the banana chocolate chip pancakes and they were just alright. They were the perfect texture, nice and fluffy, and huge, but there were barely any chocolate chips and there were only four slices of bananas. I could detect any peanut butter. The burning syrup was great though! I think this was just one not so great dish, because everyone else in my party liked their meal. The service was also really good and the restaurant was cool. I'd go back and just try another main dish.
