The first time I've had fried Japanese skewers.... Totally different, if you think frying everything to make it taste good is okay, this is the place for you..., I loved the fried Brie cheese with my salmon roe bowl which complimented each other I think...\nOne warning.... You might be carried away and the tab adds up quickly... It's definitely worth a try....
