As much as I want to update this review with a 1-star rating, I'm not petty like that. I just wanted to give a heads up to anyone who may give them a 3-star review that they will be refused future service. \n\nSometimes I like to come back to places I've visited in the past which allows me to update my experiences and keep my reviews current.\n\nUnfortunately, this place doesn't seem to take criticism too well and doesn't like 3 stars, even though in the Yelp world, it means neither good or bad. It's neutral, it's average.\n\nToday in the middle of making an appointment with the receptionist, another lady comes on the phone and turned me away, saying that they are not able to suit my needs and that there was a problem last time. Yes, that happened.\n\nI go to many wax studios and honestly had to revisit my old review. It turns out I actually had a good wax session with my esthetician, but I compared the ambiance to what I knew about other waxing places. I also made the observation that many 5-star reviews were from reviewers w\/ only 1 or 2 reviews under their belt, which looks like it still holds true.\n\nIf this was the problem, it just shows you how this business is run. People are entitled to their own opinion, but heaven forbid you write them less than 5 stars, they'll turn you away.
