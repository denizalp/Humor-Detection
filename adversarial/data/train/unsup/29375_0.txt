Leeeeeegit fried chicken & sides! \n\nWent here on a Monday night. Place was pretty busy even at 9:30p which was a good sign. The atmosphere is cool, chill, casual... rustic farmhouse style, but not a casual\/cheap price tag. Dinner for two was $80 without cocktails. Our waitress wasn't the best; she was slow, tired, and not very attentive but was nice. \n\nOrdered 1\/2 fried chicken, cucumber salad, mac & cheese, and chicken biscuits. ALL were AMAZING! And their homemade sweet hot sauce is the bomb! The fried chicken was especially the best part. \n\nAll in all, good experience. Would recommend this to anyone on a date, w friends\/family, or alone who want legit southern style comfort food in a casual setting.
