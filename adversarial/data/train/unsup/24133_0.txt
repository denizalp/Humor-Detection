Such a disaster. Came here on a week night for dessert. It was past 11 pm so the whole restaurant was empty. We asked the server if we were able to sit outside after making such a hassle and throwing a fit she finally said yes. Then she took our order. Like I said we just came for dessert. Got a couple of shakes which literally took an hour to come. 8 don't understand what could of possibly took that long. It's not like we ordered steak. Where were they getting the ice cream from?... Alaska? Didn't even taste good.
