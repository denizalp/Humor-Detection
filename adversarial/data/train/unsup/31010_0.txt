Must Try: Mango Sago with Pommels, Shaved Ice with Fruit, Steamed Egg, Black Sesame with Glutinous balls \n\n||\n\nRating: (8\/10) Food, (8\/10) Service, (8\/10) Value, (8\/10) Ambience, (8\/10) Presentation, (9\/10) Cleanliness\n\nMy Experience:  \n\nGreat HK style dessert house, that shares the same name (but different franchise) with the famous Hong Kong spot known for their mango dishes. \n\nAlthough they serve clay pot rice and other late night meals, I've always been a fan of desserts here. The shaved ice is a great blend with fresh fruit (really legitimately fresh!). Their steamed desserts are great as well, along with the traditional HK desserts, such as black sesame and almond. \n\nIf you're feeling for HK desserts, this is the place to be!
