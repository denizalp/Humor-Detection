We had a lovely and relaxing family dinner on the patio, delicious food thoughtfully prepared and served with charm. As we were leaving we decided to ask Joe to cater a holiday event in a few days, which he agreed to. He came in specially to do it; it was hot and fresh and on time, adhered to our family's crazy dietary needs, and our guests - literally - ate it up. (The ribs especially!) Our whole experience with this chef and his restaurant was top notch.
