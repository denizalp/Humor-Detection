\"Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication\"\n~Leonardo da Vinci\n\nDear Chef Chang:\n\nI am so confused. \nDid you invent the pork belly? No.\nDid you invent the Bao? No.\nYet you have built an empire on taking the simplest of ingredients, creating and banging out honest to goodness amazing food! What the Momofuku is next? A Fried Chicken dish with Caviar or something? \nOh wait?!...\nCherished and loved is the food you've rendered for us to consume viciously but with sophistication. Thank you! \n\nEver Faithfully yours,\nJon H.\n\nMomofuku, pronounced MoMoFuku, is a definite must go-to place when in Vegas. Don't walk, Run! But do it in grand style with panache like our friends Joyce W. and Michael W. They were so accommodating in joining us last minute as my meeting got cancelled. Thank you both! \nThe night was young as the sun was still out. We knew drink-wise, driving was out of the question especially since we didn't have cars. So we all Uber'ed in to Momofuku and rolled out gracefully a few hours later. \nHere's the skinny on the Pork Fat we devoured:\n\n~Pork Belly Bao; A Bao bun so fluffy and soft as a pillow, tucked with the best Pork Belly this side of the Milky Way Galaxy. It's truly outta this World! Comes with Cucumber, Hoisin, and Scallion and I added extra sauce which sent ripples thru my mouth! A MUST have. (Please see photo) My theory of the cute little flag with a peach placed on each Belly Bao, is Chef Chang's explanation that Momofuku means \"Lucky Peach\". Just a guess.\n\n~Bo Ssäm; Tender? What's beyond tender? The most succulent slow roasted pork shoulder you can imagine, then take that thought to the power of 10! So beautiful, it glistened. No kidding! Also, It came with a symphony of Kimchi, Lettuce, Oysters!, Rice and 3 extraordinary sauces. It was pure poetry in motion. \n\n~Chilled Spicy Noodles; Insane marriage of great Sausage, candied cashews, and Thai basil topped with jalapeño peppers for a good kick in the pants! The noodles were perfectly cooked adding to the delightful texture of the dish (Please See Photo) \nMan\/Woman that was delicious! Next time I'm ordering one just for myself. (Only child syndrome) \n\nWe plowed it all down with wonderful alcohol and had such a beautiful dinner experience. The service was ever-present without being obtrusive. Difficult to accomplish but enjoyable and admirable when achieved.  From the moment we entered until our sad departure, Momofuku was a culinary dream. Can't wait to go back!
