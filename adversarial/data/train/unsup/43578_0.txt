I got 5 plates of food so I think I make enough rounds to judge the place.  \n\nNow first off, where the hell is the pasta station?  I remember there being a pasta station before.  Maybe that was at another place.  Disappointing.\n\nThe seafood was really good. As was the prime rib, crab, duck, quail, and crab.  Fresh made spicy tuna rolls were proper.\n\nI recommend this place but I was expecting more.  In particular the lamb was NOT properly marinated.
