This place does what we need them to do most of the time.  The employees are generally very friendly and helpful.  My only complaint is that when we needed a new pool cleaner, the salesperson suggested a Zodiac.  It was a huge waste of money.  We replaced the \"brain\" twice and the smallest twig would render it useless.  About 8 months later we ended up throwing it away and buying a Hayward from Leslie's.  A&M is great for chemicals, but don't trust them for equipment.
