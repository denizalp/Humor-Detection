Bought the ticket on line and sent it to my phone...great feature....then couldn't find in my text message as I had too many text messages before I got there...\n\nIt's a nice theatre but not updated with the reclining seats or food service but definitely a good selection of movies all in one place...very conveniently located in a great shopping center with Pita Jungle as a main attraction...\n\nSaw \"A Star Is Born\"...good movie and Lady Gaga is terrific...since it is the 2nd week of the movie it was pretty full in the theatre...been going to this theatre for a while since it is such a great location with so many movie choices.
