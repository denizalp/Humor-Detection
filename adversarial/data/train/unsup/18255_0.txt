Lame name.  Not so lame sandwiches.  \n\nI like it spicy.  Interpret that as you wish, but when it comes down to it -- it takes a lot more than spicy pickles to impress me - say gigantic and decadent choco chip cookies. Don't let the gimmicky name fool you, however, these are some serious sandwiches at Spicy Pickle, a franchise with only one location in the Valley in Chandler.  I found the quality of food and scope of sandwiches offered to be comparable to Dilly's Deli. \n\nI had a lunch earlier this week catered from this place, and since they catered half-sized portions I was able to try two: the Santa Cruz sub and wiseguy sub.\n\nI found the wiseguy (with italian meats and cheeses) sub to be pretty tasty, but I prefer my subs to not swim in oil and vinegar.  The Santa Cruz sub was pretty good though (and my favorite of the two) - with its ingredients of Mesquite turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, corn relish, cheddar and chipotle mayo.\n\nThe highlight of the lunch were these large thick discs that looked and tasted like chocolate chip cookies.  Crispy on the edges and moist and soft in the middle.  Seriously, one of the better cookies I have had in a long time.\n\nBTW, the pickles are sprinkled with some kind of chili powder and are ok, perhaps they're awesome -- I don't know, I'm not a big pickle fan.
