WOW.. so pretty during the night. This hot spot in the Encore hotel is a beauty!\n\nEven though the pool takes up a good 80% of the club, there is still a lot of space for everyone to dance, mingle, and gamble. We had to ask one of the bouncers if anyone has fallen in... and surprisingly no one has.. hahahah \n\nThe colors of the lights, the fountain, and the pool was truly majestic. \n\nThe music was your typical house base bumping music so the crowd was hyped the whole night! \n\nThe drings were delicious.. can't comment on the price since I was taken cared of ;) \n\nThe one thing that stood out was the gambling area on the other side. You can dance the night away, drink a cocktail, and play blackjack all at the same time.\n\nThe energy was through the roof.. too bad there isn't one! \n\nLOVED IT!
