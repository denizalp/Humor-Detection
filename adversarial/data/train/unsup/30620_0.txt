Menu is diverse but you will need an open mind.  Food is tasty and prepared to order.  Decor leaves a little to be desired but that's ok.\n\nThe offer kids simple chicken and rice just in case.\n\nPricing is fair but it can be overwhelming to pick something that you may not actually end up loving.\n\nBest advice:  Go with friends and get a few things to share.  That way everyone gets to sample several dishes.
