Heard through the grapevine that this place is better than Sam Woo and restaurants alike back at home. The restaurant was packed at 11 AM with a line of people waiting for their to go orders. Noticed the hanging pork belly was midway through and knew it was a sign. \n\nFor people ordering to-go, head straight to the counter and place your order with the cashier. If you're hungry, order the one option with rice\/noodle. If you have a bigger than typical appetite or want to have leftovers for later, get the two options with rice\/noodle. Either options come with a small portion of Chinese broccoli.\n\nThe crispy pork belly had perfectly crispy skin with tender pieces of meat underneath. Easily one of the best I've ever had. While the roasted duck was just your average duck, the bbq pork stood out to be one of the better ones. It was not overly sweet nor smothered in sauce and while it had relatively no fat, it was still tender.\n\nIt's a cash only establishment so come prepared.
