Interesting concept and a hidden gem in Las Vegas Chinatown.\n\nFood: We weren't particularly too hungry this day so we ordered the Garlic Serrano Wings and Steak and Eggs. I've been to a restaurant in the past where they served a dish similar to the steak and eggs so I was pretty excited about this dish. Although all around it was good, it wasn't noteworthy. The beef was a little bit on the tough side, but the flavor made up for that. As for the rice that came alongside it, it definitely lacked some flavor. The Garlic Serrano wings were also subpar. These little wings didnt much meat clinging to the bones and the flavor was lacking as well. The flavors sounded really good on paper, but to be honest I probably won't order this again. I really wanted to try their famous Lobster Pho, but that will have to be ordered during my next visit. \n\nEnvironment\/ambiance: The restaurant itself is placed in the middle of what looks like an old school Asian plaza. The decor is new and different, almost screaming that it's modern next to its neighbors. On a sunny day you can't miss it---it shines in the sun. Indoors it looks like it used to be a Boiling Crab. They do a good job of representing their seafood theme. It's cozy, a little musty, and the only thing missing is nearby seawater. There's booths along the walls and a few tables for large groups in the middle. \n\nService: We came early during the lunch hour so we were seated right away. We were also attended to right away by our server, but he didn't do much talking. It would've been helpful if he explained the menu more (although I already had in mind what I wanted to order so no explanation needed).\n\nTips: This is definitely a place to eat, drink, watch a game, and hang out with friends. It got pretty busy as it got later during the lunch rush. They have different menu items than other restaurants so give it a try!
