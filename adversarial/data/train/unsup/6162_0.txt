My co-worker and I came here for lunch today. I ordered the mercado sandwich with no bacon plus avocado on focaccia. The sandwich was in a word- perfection! That and an old-fashion style root-beer ran me $7 - well worth it! \n\nThe sandwich was huge - but it was so tasty I tried to eat my second half ( although I was not successful!).\n\n The place is small but we didn't run into any crowds at noon. The service was fairly fast and friendly! There was not a place to eat the sandwich (my reason for 4 stars not 5)...who wants to eat at work ? ...They also close at 3pm so beware if you're craving a late afternoon Laurel Market snack. \n\nI will absolutely be back again very soon!
