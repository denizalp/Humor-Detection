Nice airport.  Picking up checked in luggage didn't take too long, about 15-20 minutes.  The luggage pickup carousels use large, color, flat TVs that display flight info and even, the weather!  Although, the only options you'll see are: Hot, Daym Hot, and Even Hell Would Be Jealous. \n\nThe car rental facility is off site.  However, there are plenty of shuttle buses so you hardly have to wait at all for a ride.  The shuttle bus pickup point is outside the main entrance on the ground floor but you do have to cross the street to get there.\n\nIf you get confused or lost, they have customer service greeters at key areas who are more than happy to offer directions or help.\n\nThe shuttle bus ride to the car rental center took about 8-10 minutes.  It's one of the largest and most modern car rental centers I've seen.  It looks fairly new and well organized.  It has its own bathrooms and you can even check in your luggage, if it's at least 90min before your flight and only available for certain airlines.  That's a very nice, convenient service.  And, we received our luggage just fine when we got home.
