I've been wanting to go to the Corner Alley literally for years. Now I'm kicking myself that it took me so long to get here because this is by far the best bowling alley I've ever been to! \n\nThe local bowling alleys that I go to are normally super dark, old and not very welcoming. I didn't know bowling could be any different until I went to The Corner Alley! This is a super modern and hip place that offers more than just the sport, although the bowling aspect was also really great! On a side note, the bowling balls even looked like pool balls (can you say cute photo op?)! After a couple games, I checked out their really cool bar that serves all kinds of fun drinks. The craft beer I got was in a tower so big that I had to split it with three other people! I went to the Corner Alley initially for a networking event, so they had all kinds of little appetizers to try. I had the hummus with veggies and the vegetable flatbread​ pizza, both were a welcomed treat from the normal greasy foods that you get at typical bowling alleys. I love that guests can also play their own music over the Corner Alley speakers through an app on their phone! It definitely​ helps everyone to get in the \"bowling zone,\" if that's a thing. \n\nI had an amazing experience at The Corner Alley! I came for the bowling, but stayed for the modern bar, groovy music, tasty food and overall fun atmosphere that really helped to redefine bowling for​ me. I'll definitely​ be coming back here soon!
