Toppers makes some fantastic pizzas and they usually have some great deals.  We stopped in to get one of their phenomenal Loaded Tot-zza's that's got tons of cheese and Tater Tots!  Love it.  \n\nJust by chance they had a 2 Large Pizzas for $9.99 deal so we got their Toppers Classic with Mushrooms, Pepperoni, and Green Peppers.  Another keeper.  Not only are the pizzas a great value, you get to choose the type of crust and they throw in a dipping sauce: Nice.\n\nI love Pizza and Toppers is a great choice when you can make the trek to a high-end sit down Italian Pizza joint.  The only negative is I can't eat there and the waiting area isn't all that comfortable when you're waiting.  \n\nGreta little joint and nice polite staff.
