Nice Saturday meal!  Great Pastrami and the special of ribs and chicken was super tasty.  We came by since we first heard of them at Taste of Surprise.  Not too many people in there for a Saturday night which makes me hope they can stick around.  Service was excellent, great variety on the jukebox and the decor was charming.
