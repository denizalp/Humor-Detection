This place ticks off the usual Instagram checklist: \n- Instagrammable neon sign \n- Funky \"artistic\" mural  \n- Hipster light fixtures  \n- That one dish with dry ice  \n- Tropical themed bathroom wallpaper  \n\nThat aside, the food here is really mediocre. We ordered the hot and sour squid balls, fish hot pot, jellyfish, and lobster soup 3 ways. Literally everything tasted like it was flavoured with an instant noodle packet. \n\nService was also bizarre as they kept coming by to take away our dishes even when there was food was still on it?? \n\nDo yourself a solid and don't come here, the Instagrammable pics just aren't worth it.
