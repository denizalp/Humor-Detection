went to Pomodoro after visiting the jean talon market . The food and service were fine. Actually I would have given the food 4-stars as the pizza and pasta were pretty good . I found it odd that an Italian restaurant did not serve bread with the meal, so I asked for bread. They brought out a basket full of bread that were dinner rolls , each in a cellophane wrapping  ? Picture what you would receive on an airplane with your tray meal!  I was stunned!   I thought that maybe I was being \"punked\" or a joke was being played and a hidden camera was filming my reaction!  Because of this I had to drop 2 star's . THE KEY TO EVERY GREAT MEAL STARTS WITH THE QUALITY OF THE BREAD!
