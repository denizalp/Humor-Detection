DIY fro-yo is so 2009.\n\nEnter the west coast's newest frozen novelty: Snoh! Based off the Taiwanese shaved ice treat, baobing, Snoh has it all... A light, fluffy, customizable frozen dessert without those icky \"live and active cultures,\" now with the added appeal of Asian persuasion in flavors like green tea, Thai tea, black sesame, and mango.\n\nDon't worry, there's still plenty of opportunity for terrible combinations of toppings and cups that not only permit, but encourage, spillover onto the table. It's everything you loved about froyo, only the texture is like thick locks of ice cream hair. \n\nSnoh? More like Syes.
