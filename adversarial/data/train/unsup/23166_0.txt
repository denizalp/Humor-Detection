Oh yea.  \n\n-Good burgers.  Small, but good.\n-$4 lola fries.  $5 O-rings have bigger portion.  Both were great.  \n-No wait for lunch.  Stop going to a new restaurant at 6pm and complaining about the hour long wait, idiots.  \n-Great, fast service.  Loved the portable computer the servers bring to the table.  That way, you know your order is in as soon as you say it.  (As a server, this would be very convenient and eliminate those forgotten orders...)  They even swipe your credit card at your table.  \n-Limited menu, so substitutions.  Suck it, it's good.
