This place plays my type of music and I'm a fan of OVO's Dj Charlie B, but the joint is a bit douchie (for douchebags). The bouncer outside were pretty nice guys,  but you can see they treat and hand pick their clients in a way. Thank god my friends are famous, or I would still be standing outside trying to get in. Inside the staff is a bit pretentious.
