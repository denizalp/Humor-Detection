It's like whatever. Like water. It has no taste, this bar, no flavor. It's everything it doesn't pretend not to be or be. If you were in a coma and the fun nurses took you there you wouldn't likely remember it when you came to... \n\nBut I kind of like it for two reasons and they both happened last night. There was karaoke. The worst singers I've ever heard, honestly. But the roommate of my friend, unbeknownst to me, hid the crazy karaoke host's blue taped mic in the bathroom (we found out later) and he flipped the fuck out. Shut down karaoke. And the only person who cared was some dude who had a song up next. On some level I felt bad for crazy karaoke dude because he was visibly disturbed by the turn of events but he was being such a non-relaxed doucher about it I wanted to smack him in a father-trying-to-get-a-hold-of-his-son way. \"No one stole the mic, Holmes!\" \"We'll find it. Chillax.\"\n\nEvent number two: As I was staring at her boobs, which were lovely, I asked my friend's friend how she got that burn on her chest. She was shit faced. D.R.U.N.K. So she lifts up her shirt and shows me her left breast. I think to show me the contrast between burned and non-burned skin. I thought about doing a Jim Carey, Liar Liar, elevator scene move but reconsidered after deciding that would be poor form since I was planning to sleep with her friend. But I have no doubt she would have let me. Which is hot just to think about.
