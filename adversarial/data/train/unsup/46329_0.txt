The Venetian was ok. Beautiful building. Housekeeping was HORRIBLE! They left a pizza box next to one of the beds and dirty pillow cases in the corner. \n\nI'm confused on how they missed those items.\n\nDuring the stay housekeeping knocked on the door at 7AM and immediately entered without announcing themselves or waiting for a reply. Then did it again at 8 despite me saying we don't need them as we were sleeping in. The last day of my 4 day stay they didn't even knock!! They just walked in! \n\nIt was irritating because vacation is supposed to be relaxing.
