Kinda overhyped ice cream imo. $8.50 for a large bday cake soft serve that wasn't even really vanilla flavoured. The location is small, with about 8 seats or so and it wasn't air conditioned when I visited. In fact, we actually left the store after we got our ice cream because it was a lot cooler outside vs in store. \nBday cake soft serve just had a typical ice cream swirled into the cup, with lines of cream cheese frosting drawn on, and covered with bday cake bits along with sprinkles. Nothing too special. Didn't taste spectacular either.\nProbably wouldn't come back again. Also the large size is more than enough for 2 people, I'd probably get the kids size next time!
