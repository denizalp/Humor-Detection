I sent in a request for a design for an iconic shirt from an 80's movie but all I could find was a half-decent and small image of what needed to be printed on it. I sent it in and hoped for the best and, instead, the company emailed me back and not only had my shirt ready for me earlier than expected (three days before Christmas no less) but they had also found me a better image of the design to print on my shirt. It came out exactly like Jack Burton's in Big Trouble in Little China and made for a funny and memorable gift. Super impressed with the customer service and product and will absolutely do business again.
