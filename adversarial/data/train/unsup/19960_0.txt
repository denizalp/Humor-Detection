Presiding judge Cecil Ash is a Mormon who voted for Trump, he is a gambler, decides cases with the roll of a dice. Why even bother looking at the evidence or what the law says, just roll the dice and done! Was recently investigated by The Arizona Commission on Judicial Conduct for failing to conduct formal courtroom proceedings and using a dice to decide cases instead of the evidence and the law.The Judge Cecil Ash started the \"trial\" with \"...with me you are rolling the dice\". \n\nThe evidence doesn't really matter but what matters is who he wants to believe as he said in the ruling. \n\nHe first awarded me damages with court costs and declared at the end of the trial that I was the prevailing party in the lawsuit. THEN.. he prompted the defendant's attorney if he wanted to object to it, of course the attorney objected after the judge prompted him to do so and then Judge Cecil the gambler reversed himself and his ruling. He makes decisions without any regards for order of the court of law. \n\nIs this the Joe Arpaio of the East Valley? Deut. 28:19 \"Cursed is anyone who withholds justice from the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow.\"
