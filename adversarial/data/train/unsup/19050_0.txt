This place is disgusting went in and got a wrap and the guy just started putting whatever he wanted in it and when I said no hot sauce he said \"what your not women enough\" rude. I then ordered a small potato and he was going to put a white sauce on it and I asked for it on the side and he said \"why you can't handle this either\" again rude I go to pay and he charged me $1.50 for this white sauce that he offered me to start so I told I don't want it then he said \"you trouble making you have to take or I have to through away\" this place is disgusting with gross food and nasty rude employee..... good luck to anyone that goes here
