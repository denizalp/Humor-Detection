First time at Ricky's, what you can expect here are the regular dishes like, pulled pork, ribs, prime rib sandwich etc. done right. serving au jus with the prime rib was a plus but i inhaled the sandwich. our server was nice. They don't give straw with water unless you ask for them. \nWashrooms were clean, thats a good sign.
