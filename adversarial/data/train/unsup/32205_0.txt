We had a post supper chocolate mousse souffle since we had a little bit of hotel restaurant credit left on our bill. It was super sweet, but super excellent. Light and fluffy and very rich - melts in your mouth kind of Las Vegas experience. I highly recommnend dealing with the wait (about 20 mins.) for the souffle.\n\nWe also had a simple fruit drink that wasn't bad at $4.95.
