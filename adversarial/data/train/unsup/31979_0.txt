Famous Dave's lives up to their advertisement on their meats. Tastes pretty good, & the meats just fall off the bone. In addition, their sides are tasty. I recommend their jalape√±o macaroni & cornbread. The place itself was built & decorated very cute! It all plays well with the theme. I wish I saw it get more busy because when I went, it was super slow. Yet the service was still nice. Make sure you go ahead & try all their interesting BBQ sauces on the table. It can enhance your BBQ greatly. Also, if your names Dave or like David, you get a deal. Aren't you guys lucky?!
