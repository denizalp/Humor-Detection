My 3 year old had was screaming in pain of course on a Saturday evening. I was freaked out and called a few urgent cares,   some were closed and others had super long waits. When I arrived here is was able to get him checked in and in a room without even waiting. \nAll the staff were very kind and good with my sick baby. I'm so glad my baby was able to get relief so quickly!
