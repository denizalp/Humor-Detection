I'm sure this place would have been tasty if they hadn't cancelled my reservation!!\n\nMy mother placed a 7pm reservation a few days ago and we showed up to find out thay they had \"called\" and since we did not respond earlier today they cancelled our reservation.\n\nThe owner then became extremely unpleasant and began yelling at my mother and grandmother. We ended up heading to the Double Wide Grill. I have not been so angry with an owner in a really long time.
