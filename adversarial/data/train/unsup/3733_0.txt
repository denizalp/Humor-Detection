I'm sorry to say I had to drop the star-rating a bit due to some issues I've run into with Ferris Deli recently...\n\n1) Hours--I'm constantly doing what I can to update hours on Yelp listings, mostly because I know that seasons in NEO can be a good reason to adjust daily hours. But there is no excuse for a business leaving hours on their website and other online profiles that are incorrect. The only reason I found out they weren't open was because I was repeatedly calling them around lunch time for days to try to place an order. No answer, dark windows, no automated answering system to confirm hours, nothing. \n\n2) Another time I called they said they weren't delivering. Don't brag about your delivery services and then not follow through.
