Okay, so I read through the reviews and didn't see any other issues like mine mentioned here... So I may be on my own with this one... But anyway. I recently moved to this side of town and this is the most convenient sb for me.. But I've noticed that their machines here demagnetize my cards. The first time it happened, I thought my card was just old. But it's happened a second time. No matter how new or old my card is, when they try to swipe it always rejects it.. So they try multiple times. After a few visits, my card is completely useless and won't work anywhere. I've never had this happen from one single establishment before so I'm thinking maybe they need a new machine? Idk, but it's very inconvenient for me to either switch my sb or be prepared to go through multiple cards. I also want to mention that if your card is demagnetized and you didn't know it, the staff cannot type in the numbers of your card and process it manually.. So that was an awkward trip.\n\nBut, in regard to taste and service, I see no issues!
