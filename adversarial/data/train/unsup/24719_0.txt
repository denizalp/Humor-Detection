I ventured in to buy a full-sized cake for someone's birthday and bearing the location in mind and the vast number of bakeries the area houses, I didn't bother preordering. \n\nWhen I went in there were a few others in the store, and I agree with another Yelper's comment about the poor service. Several customers were failing as they were trying to get the employee's attention for a few minutes. \n\nWhen I inquired about the cakes (the display case had a couple with names already on them and many macarons) she told me there were several in the back but they needed to be defrosted for a few hours. This pretty much turned me off the cakes, though I know they take a while to make -there is just something about a fresh cake that can't be substituted, even if it's an amazing frozen one.\n\nIf I wanted a frozen cake, I'd go to the frozen dessert section and get some Deep 'n Nasty. \nNo thanks.
