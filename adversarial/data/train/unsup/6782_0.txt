On a scale from 1 to 10, this place is a 2.  I eat a lot of pizza.......and I can honestly say it's downright awful.  It tastes like cardboard with canned sauce on it.  I don't own a pizza place & I have no reason not to be objective.  With all of the choices we have in PHX, I wouldn't recommend this place.\n\nYou're probably wondering why others voted this 5 stars and now you're reading a 1 star.  The only thing I can think of is that some of the reviewers: 1) either don't eat good pizza or 2) they know the owners.  I can't understand, for the life of me, understand how people are voting this 5 stars.
