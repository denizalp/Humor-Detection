The view from the Tower at night of the strip is majestic. The strip is so beautiful when it's lit up. Once you get up to the top, you can walk around the Tower in a 360 degree circle to see most of the strip. Plus, it's right across the street from the Bellagio Fountains, so you can catch the show from the top view. It's a different experience than watching it at ground level.\n\nWe got a good deal to go to the Tower. It's usually $19 per person at night. We also planned on going on the High Roller Wheel, which is $36.95 per person at night. We paid $33 for both attractions per person. You can buy the tickets at the Paris Hotel gift shop. If you're coming in from the strip, the gift shop is all the way to your left. The escalator that leads you to Tower will be to the right of the gift shop.\n\nYou get on the escalator that leads you to this walkway where they take your pics that you can purchase when you get down, basically the souvenir pics that all attractions do. Then, you get to the elevator that takes you up to the top. On the way up, I was getting a little nervous because I'm scared of heights. Once I was at the top I was fine, and couldn't take my eyes off the splendid scenery.
