Like the concept... however, when I visited... I was the only one in the restaurant.  Could have been a fluke, but there were more employees than customers.\n\nWas greeted very nicely upon entering and I wasn't familiar with the way things worked here but the nice young lady that was cleaning off tables walked me through the menu and took my order up at the counter.\n\n1:  Pick your meat 2:  Pick  your bread 3: Add your toppings  4:  Choose any sides.  Simple enough.  I tried a turkey burger on a wheat bun with fries.  They cooked it fresh and it was brought out to me... probably if the place were busier, I would have had to retrieve the burger from the pass, but the manager brought it to me.  I think what was comical was when I put my order in, there were about four employees watching the one employee make my burger on the flattop.\n\nThe dining room, while empty, was casual and relaxed... clean tables with some modern metal cow-themed decorations on the wall.  Looks like this is a national franchise and this is the first location (maybe trying to test out the NC market).\n\nI'd say this place is trying to be a Five Guys with a bit of Shake Shack, but hopefully their business picks up, otherwise, I don't see them lasting very long.
