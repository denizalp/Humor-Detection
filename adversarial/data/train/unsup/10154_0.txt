My husband and I went to Las Vegas to celebrate one of my past birthdays. \nFor my birthday dinner, we made a reservation here.\n\nBrand Steakhouse is located within the Monte Carlo hotel and on the same floor as the casino. I know what  you're thinking.. a restaurant surrounded by the casino?\n\nThe restaurant itself is 5,000 sq ft with a nice sleek and modern design. The chairs are so comfy! The restaurant setting is elegant and perfect setting for a nice dinner.\n\nWe ordered:\nClassic Caesar Salad ($14)\n8 oz Filet Mignon ($44)\n24 oz Anton's Tomahawk Rib Eye ($53)\n\nThe bread they give you is so amazing. Delish!\n\nDesserts are $10 and they offer things like chocolate cake, key lime pie, toffee bread pudding, creme burlee, Doughnut \"Munchkin\" holes.\n\nI highly enjoyed my dinner here and would definitely return if we're in Vegas again.\n\n87\/100 Reviews for 2014
