Food is below mediocre. Very disappointed. I saw a lot of good reviews I had high hopes. \nSo here it goes\nA. French  onion  soup had very little guryere  cheese  on it and overly  salty. \nB. Calamari was soggy and small portion for price they charge.\nC.  Nachos were dry and the pork meat was dry and chewy.  I hardly saw any cheese on it. Came with small scoop of  generic guacamole(defiantly not fresh) on top of nachos.\nD. Bottle of beer was almost $9.\nE. Poutine was bad. It was rather cold when it got to table.\nF.  Burger was OK. French fries came with burger was good(Big one piece curly fries, very different )\nG.  Shrimp skewers were overly salty. But the grits and the Mexican shaved corns came with entrees were good.\nH.  Clam chowder soup was good. Very thick and hearty.\nG.  No wine menu.  Just white or red  house wine.\nOver all experience  was I probably won't  come back. All the food came to table warm not hot. \nOutdoor seating is awesome with looking at Las Vegas Blvd. But the music they play is rap and it's not PG rated.
