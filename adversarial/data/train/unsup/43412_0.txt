This was an amazing dining experience. I ordered the red snapper (prepared with capers) which were flown in from Portugal. The handcrafted cocktails were delicious and one of a kind.  The family style sides were created from Greek recipes. I highly recommend Milos! I can't wait to go back next time I'm staying at the Cosmopolitan.
