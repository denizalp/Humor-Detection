I'm loving the whole dress up thing. The whole concept is pretty neat. I had fun! It's great to experience the Heart Attack Grill while you're visiting Vegas and happen to be on Fremont street, but I doubt any locals eat there. \n\nTheir menu's simple. There's a bypass burger in a few different sizes and fries that's fried in lard. That's pretty much the only options, which is a bummer. I also notice they had mayonnaise sitting out and was wondering if they had refrigerate it over the nights. I didn't bother to touch the mayo(being cautious) and already acknowledging that their food is already very unhealthy. They also have milkshakes that are served with butter on top(yuck!) and they offer a buttermilk milkshake. The thought of that kind of grosses me out. This place is very unhealthy and anyone over 350 pounds get to eat free. Enjoy!
