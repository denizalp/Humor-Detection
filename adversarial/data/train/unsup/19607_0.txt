The Sassy Lizard (SL) is a tiny gift shop tucked away in Old Town Scottsdale (OTS). They have your usual assortment of fun, desert-inspired tchotchkes, souvenirs, ornaments and foods. I came in on a mission looking for Prickly Pear Honey, and while he didn't have it, he was the only store in OTS to have the large Bear-shaped bottles of Desert Honey. The owner was super-nice and welcoming to us, and went out of his way to try and help me find what I needed. Even though I didn't find what I wanted, I did end up buying a shirt for the boy, and a pen with a bug(!!) on top. \n\nSL is a smaller shop, but it's packed full of quality merchandise and run by a swell guy. Also, their prices are slightly-below the median on most items--and that's always a plus. Check 'em out while you're shopping in OTS.
