Came here after finishing 2 bottles of Belvedere at Hakkasan because we wanted to see Nicky Romero this past LDW.. so by the time we got here we were feeling pretty good! He was doing an afterhours set so we got in line at about 2:45ish. Thanks to my host, Tiffany Tay, who put us on her guest list, we were able to get in at no cost.. The line moved quickly and when it was our turn the bouncers nicely asked us to finish eating our drunkchies LOL.. I showed them my confirmation text from my host and in in in we went! I don't remember much but I do know I liked what I saw.. The dance floor was packed as Nicky Romero was spinning so I didn't dare try to get into that so we just enjoyed afar from the bar.. I really liked all of the lights and the Cirque performers! Definitely will come back again when I'm less intoxicated to write an update :]]] \n\nHOT TIP: park in the self parking garage!!! It is RIGHT by the entrance so you don't have to walk far! I believe Light used to be Rum Jungle.. right???
