The Pleasure Bar has been in Pittsburgh forever.  My dad wanted to come here one day because he remembered coming here years ago, and we have returned a few times since.\n\nI could not believe the prices on the menu the first trip.  This place is CHEAP.  We started out with the bruschetta, which was ok.  Not my favorite, but I think it was four huge slices of bread and covered in garlic and tomatoes.  It was a bit greasy for my tastes but still yummy.  Then, we split the stuffed shells ($8.50) and gnocchi ($9).  Both were fantastic, I'm guessing homemade.  Other trips we have tried manicotti, deep-fried zucchini, and all sorts of other things.  The portions are a good size, and you might even have a very small portion of leftovers.\n\nThe service is slow considering we are often the only people on a Saturday at lunch time, but who cares?  We are there to talk and hang out.  This place is great, and I'll come back soon.
