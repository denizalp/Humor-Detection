First time going to dine in as opposed to Fuku Food Truck.   11pm on Saturday ,4\/23 few people playing  beer pong, extremely welcoming and friendly girl at the counter, asked if I had any questions or needed suggestions.  Nope, my eyes were set on the Chicken sandwich combo with garlic fries.  She asked for a funny name to be called when order was ready . I said Joe.  She said come on, I need a funny name.  I replied okay , Joe Momma. I like the fun chill atmosphere there. They have peer pong and some other board games you can play and a happy hour on Asahi Beer but I didn't get the details. When they called Joe Momma I retrieved my meal and it was delicious . Panko crusted chicken probably 8 oz with a cabbage and sauce topping.  Garlic fries  needs more garlic just my preference . $12 for the combo & soda ..well worth it. Will return and recommend
