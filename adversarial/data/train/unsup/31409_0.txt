Two flights very late. Last one was 5 hrs late. We were notified at 5am that the 5pm flight was delayed by 2'hrs. Then flight delayed again another 1 1\/2 hrs. Minutes before new scheduled time.   Then after loading flight was delayed another 45 mins yet again because paperwork had 'expired'. \n\nCrew and company knew flight was delayed and paperwork would expire but did not perform in a manner that get new paperwork before flight was delayed for the 3rd time. \n\nCompany performance shows lack of regard for its customers.
