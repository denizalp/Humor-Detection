I came here for dinner. Their sushi is very good, up to par with most high quality Japanese restaurants. I had a Mahi Mahi entre special. It was pan seared to perfection and the quinoa salad it came with was spectacular. The salad had onions and shiitake mushrooms. I used to have a shiitake mushroom farm in my apartament and I always enjoyed them by themselves, sometimes raw. The mix in the salad was very different, my brain kept telling me the flavors don't go together, but my tastebuds kept firing with the perfect mix of flavors, tangy, salty, and something else. It went great with the seared Mahi Mahi.
