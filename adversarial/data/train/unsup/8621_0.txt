Order the burger!!\n\nThe hubby and I decided to stop by for lunch.\n\nWe sat outside with a great view of the lake.  Quiet and peaceful.\n\nService and ambiance upscale and fabulous.\n\nGumbo is delicious, I could lick the bowl!!!  \n\nBread basket yummy!\n\nMy hamburger was the best burger I've had in a long long long time. Complete with avocado and a toasted bun that you could eat by itself. I've been dreaming of that burger ever since.\n\nDon't miss! I can't wait to come back!
