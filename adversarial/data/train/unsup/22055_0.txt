After visiting a customer the boss and I were in the mood for lunch and being a perfect day in the Valley of the Sun we were looking for a place with outdoor seating and Yelp guided us here. It was noon and the dining room was virtually empty which made for easy seating and quick service. Order at the counter, get a number and they bring your entree when it is ready. Ordered a slice of the Taste of Italy Pizza (Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushroom, Green Bell Pepper, Red Onion), side salad and a soda for $8.95 plus tip. The salad was very carrot heavy. The pizza crust wasn't cracker style but more had the mouthfeel of stale and the sauce didn't bring much tomato flavor. The slice was small and had the look and taste of struggle. A war was waged against the proteins by the veggies and cheese and they had advanced and pushed my proteins to one side. I was left with my proteins straddled to one side and a veggie pizza for the most part. In my world the veggies enhance the proteins they can't be the star. The final blow was as we were getting ready to leave I noticed a lunch deal on the back of the menu touting two slices and a drink for $5.50. Shame on me for not knowing the menu front to back on my first visit but I would like to think the server might have mentioned it since it would have saved me a few bucks and netted me a second slice. On second thought scratch that.
