These may be the best crepes I've ever had. I use the crepes here to compare to other crepe places.   They are worth the price!\n\nThe sauce is excellent, and high quality..and so is the fruit.  Whipped cream is good.. The crepe itself is nice..Thick and good.\n\nThe crepes at the buffet aren't as big, but they're all you can eat... awesome!
