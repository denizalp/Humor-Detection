This beautiful, spacious park is perfect for any age group. My kids and their fiends range from 3-14 and there is something for all of them to do...  There is a big dino water park,  tennis, volleyball,\nand bocce courts, soccer fields, horseshoe pits, several picnic\nsites, and an amphitheater. During the Summer they have different types of concerts and festivals... My kids love this park... If you are looking for a perfect picnic or birthday site this is the place...
