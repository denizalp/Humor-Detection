This was my second time seeing the Beatles Love show. This first one blew my mind and was very uplifting. I couldn't wait to take my niece and my best friend. However I was incredibly disappointed. The show had more of a Pink Floyd (which I love but is more dark) feel from the creepy masks, to the war scenes and fighting. I certainly didn't feel the love and my 10 year old niece even found it a little scary and covered hear ears a lot. The dancing, the props, the theatre are all still amazing but if your wanting an uplifting show where you feel the love, this isn't it! Change the name and maybe I wouldn't have been disappointed. Almost felt like it had a political agenda...
