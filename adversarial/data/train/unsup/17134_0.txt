Staying there was a bad experience for us overall. In the shower i had to wait for the warm water and suddenly waters temperature would go high that i couldn't bear it at all! \nI dont know what was it but our body got itchy after sleeping. My husbands leg were swollen and my skin in my back was red. \nThe prices was super high! A simple egg sandwich was $8! \nThe pool was small and there was no steam room. \n\nDont go to this hotel! We came back and we are still sick!
