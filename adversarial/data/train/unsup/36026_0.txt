Disclaimer: if you don't have kids, grandkids or nieces\/nephews stop reading here.\n\nMy kids love this place. It's air conditioned and full of inflatables. Slides, obstacle courses, bouncy houses. Seems like they rotate or get new ones in now and then. Pretty decent place to have a birthday party. It seems pretty clean - the inflatables and the place as a whole. Avoid the snack bar unless you want to wait 20 minutes for an overcooked\/burnt pretzel (probably okay for popcorn and soda though). I recommend you just bring your own snacks.  Wednesdays are half price but now everyone's catching on.... Anyway a good place to let kids run around and burn off some excess energy.
