Unfortunately my initial opinion of this dealership has changed entirely. I loved coming here because I was taken care of by the service dept. They've been honest and have never tried to force me into services I didn't need. But now I don't think I'll be returning to this dealership. The parts dept came after me and made me provide proof that I paid for a $20.00 transaction because of a screw up on their end. I bought a new gas cap because mine broke and somehow although I paid for it with my debit card (got a receipt and everything) it never posted on their end. I had to come in with my bank statement to prove I purchased a stupid $20 item. Can't imagine what they would do if you had a more costly invoice... absolutely ridiculous and a waste of time.
