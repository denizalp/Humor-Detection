Parking is easy, huge garage behind the place. Little to no line on a Friday night. Staff was pretty nice. Decor was modern. Loud music, top 40s stuff. Small dancing area, normal-sized bar area, places to sit and chill. Across the street from a CVS, awesome. Didn't stay too long, but what I saw, I liked.
