\"Overhype anything and you'll make a double double from In-n-out taste like a JBC from Wendy's\" \n\n- Charles C., Twitter 2017\n\nThe same with Libretto. I spent a month eating great Neapolitan pizza in Italy where stone fired pies were 4â‚¬. And they tasted the EXACTLY THE SAME as Libretto. It's amazingly simple. The dough, marinara, buffalo mozzarella, basil, olive oil. All come together in a great thin concoction that can be fired up in 2 mins. \n\nMargerhita (cheese) - $15 was amazing. \nDiavola (Italian pepperoni\/salami) - $18 can be skipped. Too much going on in this pizza - keep it simple!\n\nThe frugal Charles does not approve of libretto. It pains me to write a non-80% review about a great pizza place, but the prices should be lowered by a good $5 across the board for the food served. \n\nMaybe the ovens were a large million dollar investment?
