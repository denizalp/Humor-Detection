WALLET BE WARNED! Went here with my 12 year old daughter and walked out $145.00 lighter!!!! NOT IMPRESSED. They nickel and dimed everything! It was ridiculous.  Mani\/pedi NOT EVEN GEL and brow wax for a child was $65!! My back fill and BASIC pedicure -again not gel or french- was $75. Which I wanted french on toes but the girl never asked and when I tried to correct her she \"couldnt understand me\". Im angry about paying Day spa prices for less than quality service in a place nothing even close to a spa. No one talked to us or offered water just over charged and sent us on our way with half-assed nails. NEVER AGAIN!
