The slaw. The slaw. Ya gotta get the slaw. \n\nThis was the predominant piece of advice I gleaned from reading Yelp reviews about Lee. Everyone agreed the slaw was a 'must get'.\n\nAnd sure enough, after settling in at this beautiful upscale dining room on a trendy stretch of King, plates piled high with Susur Lee's Signature Singaporean-Style Slaw continually streamed out of the kitchen. And guess what: the slaw--a vegetarian mix of soft and crispy noodles with other yummies and a peanut-y sauce--was awesome.\n\nAs were some of the other dishes we sampled, including a crab tempura special and the tuna sashimi \/ spicy tartar duo. However, the tomatillo\/jalapeno guacamole (which sounded so promising) just wasn't my cup of tea.\n\nThe cocktail du jour was sangria, ceremoniously mixed tableside, and containing some insane amount of ingredients (did she say 72? That seems a bit high). And it rocked!\n\nAlso, the night we were there, Drake sat two tables over. He and his lady companion ordered cheeseburger spring rolls, which I definitely need to try next time. They also ordered TWO rounds of slaw! Meanwhile, Drake's bodyguard, who sat three tables over, also ordered the slaw!\n\nHuzzah for slaw!
