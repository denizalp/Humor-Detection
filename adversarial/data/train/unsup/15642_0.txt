I don't know how this restaurant earned 4.5 stars. When we first walked in, it felt like we were in a sauna. The food was not fresh as they advertised on their front glass window. The food appeared and tasted like it was cooked earlier today and was kept warmed until served. We ordered the carne asada torta, grilled shrimp plate and the chicken quesadilla combo. The lady at the counter had stated the torta had guacamole and it didn't. The grilled shrimp were not deveined and were overcooked to the point you can barely peel the skin off. Also, we asked for the chicken to be on the side, not inside of the quesadilla and the chicken appeared grey and reheated. The only reason I giving them one star is because the horchata was good. I will not be dining in this restaurant again unless they serve fresh food as they say they do.
