I'm a big tea drinker, and I usually source my teas from china or Japan directly. So I was always a bit skeptical about places like David's tea. Anyways, I moved recently and I decided to give it a shot. This particular store have a super friendly and excited staff. They were super friendly and did their best to help me. I super recommend for that, as for the tea, I'm gonna try it and see if it can stand au pair with their customer service :)
