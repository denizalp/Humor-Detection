I think this place is a joke. We ordered 3 different kinds of mini hot pot were thinking that we could share. We ordered pork bone, tomato & veggie and chicken hot pots. When they came on the table, they are almost the same. The only different were one has 2 pieces of pork bones, one has a few wedges of tomato and one has nothing...Beef and beef tongue skewers were way too dry and not worth the price. Nothing special with the dumplings.\n\nMy girlfriends and I said we will never go back again...
