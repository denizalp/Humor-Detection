Guu Guu Guu.. my yelper's friends all excited at the new opening of Guu SakaBar. \n\nWe walked by and expected a lineup.. but no lines at Tuesday 9:00 pm so we decided to give this new talk of the town place a try! \n\nDrinks: Ramune Sour ($6) and Ume Mojito ($6.50) \n- Drinks were a little disappointing.. a little weak.. if my face not turning after half a drink.. they are definitely not strong enough! \n\nSince my dinnermate is a vegetarian, so most of the dishes we ordered are vegetarian friendly \nGomaae ($3.80) - Spinach with sesame dressing A-OK \nCarbonara Udon ($8.30) without bacon - yummy! good Asian Fusion twist! I was surprised that it tasted so good.. oh so creamy and with a sprinkle of seaweed \nBrie Cheese ($5.20) - yummy! \nRankon ($1.90) - deep fried lotus root kebab! Awesome especially the spicy mayo dipping! \n\nThe only meat dish I ordered: \nButa Shabu Salad ($6) - sliced pork with half boiled egg  with sesame dressing! The worst dish of the night! The pork was dried and tasteless and salad are packaged quality - SKIP!!!! \n(I suppose to have a Seared Tuna that is on the daily special menu which never never ever come!!) \n\nDessert: \nSake Tiramisu ($5) - Now I know where all the boozes went! This dessert has such strong taste of Sake!! \nGoma Zukushi ($5) - Sesame Ice cream with Sesame Rice Cake and Sesame crackers - Oh I am in love!! Sesame Heaven! \n\nI think there is a conspiracy going on for this particular Guu experience! My friend's veggie dishes all arrived before mine and my meat dishes either tasted MEH or missing in action! This Guu eat out trying to convert me! \n\nServices here was so so slow! It took forever for the food to arrive! But I understand since it has opened only for 2 days and there are definitely room for improvement! \n\nThe wait staffs are super nice and really apologetic of everything... nice and energetic vibe just like the other Guu! \n\nI think I will not wait 2 hours to eat here! But if no wait, I don't mind coming again to try out other items on the menu!
