What can you really say about the RTA? First off, this is no California. It's also no NY, DC, Seattle, and so on. You're in Cleveland--and it's gritty. The airport train is a good deal and it takes you all the way to Tower City if you want to go that far. Also, if you do go that far, you can transfer to a green or blue line train to take you out to the east side. \n\nAs for the bus service, it's hit or miss. I've had great bus drivers who are funny and kind and helpful. I've also had mean ones who have insulted my intelligence. But back to the great drivers--one of my best experiences was when a driver let me \"interview\" her at Tower City and then accompany her on her route. It was pretty cool.
