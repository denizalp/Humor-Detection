I wanted so badly to try their Famous Nutella Tiramisu- well it's just my luck that  it wasn't available on the day I went. They had regular and Mexican Tiramisu instead.... I wasn't really into those flavors as I already had my tastebuds ready for the Nutella one. However, I did get to sample the regular Tiramisu and that was OK- I'm not really a big fan of Tiramisu itself but I am a fan of Nutella... I was surprised to see that they also have a Strawberry Tiramisu  - I'd come back to try a slice of that one.\n\n*** Everything could be a bit cheaper if you ask me***\n\nI did notice that they had one Apricot Custard Croissant left- I claimed it and my daughter got the chocolate croissant. I have to say that the Apricot Croissant was hellah yummy....I loved that the Apricot was a bit tangy and the custard was so creamy but more like a pudding than a cream. The croissant itself was delish!!! The Apricot Croissant is a winner in my book....\n\nAfter eating the Apricot Croissant - the Chocolate croissant was Bleh to me, it didn't compare. I think it lacked Chocolate....\nI had a Mango\/Green Tea Smothie with Whipped Cream and that drink was sugar overload. WAY TOO SWEET!!!! and I love sweets but damn...\nI do want to come back when it's cooler and try their hot chocolate, the cashier said that when the hot chocolate is at room temperature it becomesmore like a pudding, that's how chocolatety it is... Can't wait!!!\nThis was my first time in here so I had alot of questions and the guy behind the counter tried his best to answer them however the young lady who took over  made me feel like I was holding her up from doing other stuff. I didn't like that at all and they lose a star for service....
