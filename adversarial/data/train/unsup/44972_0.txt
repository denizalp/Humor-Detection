First time I went here was for the gold medal hockey game in February. Little weird to have a pint of Canadian at seven in the morning but Go Canada Go!  Owner gave everyone champagne after Canada won!!  Service has been good and the wings are awesome every time I have gone since (once or twice a month). Lots of TVs all over the place so there is always something on. Even though I have moved from the area I still make an effort to go here even though there are other locations closer. Come on Tuesdays for the 1.5 lbs for 1 lbs deal.
