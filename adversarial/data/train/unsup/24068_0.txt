Lauren is awesome. She stayed late with us tonight when we rudely showed up at 5:58 p.m., two minutes before closing, to sign some papers. Five stars.\n\nThe employees at this branch are very friendly and helpful. Generally young and energetic. The member focused, non profit, orientation of the credit union really shines through here. Five stars.\n\nThe only negative? No drive thru at this branch. One star. There is, however, an ATM out front you can use if you don't mind getting out of your car.\n\nIf you're not familiar with credit unions in general, they can be a good alternative to big banks for individual consumers. They will make you open a $25 minimum savings account to become a member, kind of silly, but it's something the regulators require. They're non profit, but they still have to cover the cost of salaries, rent, computers... Still, there's a chance they may offer better deposit and loan rates than the big banks. Sometimes they're not as efficient, or lag in adoption of technology, but they usually make up for it with friendlier, less adversarial service. Not a bad trade off.
