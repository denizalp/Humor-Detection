In general LA Fitness at this location is not bad. I typically only go to run and for a few of the classes. My absolute favorite for a total body workout is BodyWorks with Kimberely! She's got great music and keeps you working the whole class. I've also recently gotten into the Latin Heat classes. Unfortunately, the previous instructor, Danielle, has since stopped running the classes at the Scottsdale location and the class is suffering! I'm sure the new instructor is a good teacher, but Danielle was by far the best! Very upbeat, great dance moves, kept us moving and made us work! The class I went to last night was far from that. \n\nAs far as when to work out, I would say mornings and early afternoons. Anytime after that the Scottsdalians come out and it's filled to the brim with women working out in makeup and guys who just walk around, chat with each other and stare at themselves in the mirrors. If you can deal with it, go for it!
