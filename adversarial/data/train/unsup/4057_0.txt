The food is great at this place, but it's not the food that would make me want to fly back and visit as soon as I can... it's the people.\n\nWe went in last week and we ordered the Count, the Doctor and the kid's (classic) Mac and Cheese. Everything was fantastic, the food was served hot and tasted delicious, the curly fries were cooked just to crispy, the onion rings were huge and fantastic and the mac and cheese was really REALLY good.\n\nThe best part though, was that Dad was there. He had the karaoke machine fired up and his daughter sang us a few songs, we were invited to 'sing for our supper'-with a score of 95 or better on the automatic scoring machine-but since I have never tried sober karaoke, I wasn't about to try it when I was being graded.\n\nIt was super fun, the people, the food, the atmosphere, it all really worked and we would love it if Dad want's to come and open one here in Seattle, we'll be the first regulars!
