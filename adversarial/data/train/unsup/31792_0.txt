My husband and I come to this location regularly and I have NEVER had unfriendly service or a bad drink. The entire staff is so polite!! My husband went in this morning to get our coffee and he dropped mine on his way back to the car. He went in to buy another and the woman who made it the first time asked him if he forgot something. He said no and told her he needed another coffee due to dropping the first and she made him a new one free of charge! \n\nI cannot say enough good things about this location!
