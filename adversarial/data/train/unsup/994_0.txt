I can't believe this place has such good reviews.  I went here for my bachelorette party and had to deal with the most scumbag of a waiter and the most incompetent manager ever.  If I could give this place no stars I would.\n\nI told the waiter that it was my bachelorette party and asked if he had any suggestions.  He said he didn't. Even though we found out later that they had a tasting menu.  This would be nice to offer a bachelorette party.  We asked him what was on the boat and he couldn't really tell us and said he would check with the chef.  He came back about 10minutes later and told us he couldn't understand what the sushi chefs were saying because they didn't speak English very well.  Are you kidding me???  You should NOT be working in a Japanese restaurant if you cannot communicate with the sushi chefs.  Telling a bunch of Asians that your chef cannot speak English is bordering on being racist.  Why don't you try a little harder next time since this IS your job.\n\nHe was barely present through out our whole meal and I was so upset that I called the manager over.  The manager was useless.  He did not see what the waiter did wrong (maybe he was racist as well) and did not offer to do anything extra for us.  \n\nWhen the bill came, I tried to paid it with my credit card.  The scumbag waiter came back and told me that my card was declined.  How embarrassed did  he make me feel.  I found out later when I called my credit card that it was NEVER declined.  What a scumbag.  He was doing it out of spite.\n\nThis is the worse restaurant I have ever dined at.  The food doesn't even matter because the service was so horrible.  If Shibuya was in NYC, it would not stand a chance because New Yorkers will not put up with this type of subpar service at a fine dining establishment.  There are tons of restaurants in Vegas and this one is not worth your aggrevation.
