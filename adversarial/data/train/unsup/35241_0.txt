My podiatrist is around the corner so anytime I make an appointment I take out from Fredericks. It's always busy with Asian S Asian customers which to me is a good sign. Waiters are driven and busy but in my opinion OK. My husband and I love their food, but we are not Hakka so we cannot be the best judge. Sinfully delicious food is great from time to time.
