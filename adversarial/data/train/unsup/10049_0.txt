Let me preface this review by saying I am enormous Burger fan, I love them. I eat at least 2-3 a week, no problem and it is absolutely safe to say that I would choose a cheesebuger as my last meal on earth.. I once called In & Out my true love, but last night my friends, I met someone new and have fallen hard... his name is Delux, and he is amazing.\n\nI arrived here really late to meet up with friends, so I didn't spend too much time inside.. and I never actually saw a menu, but from what I gather, the place is totally popular based off the amount of people and the wait I was told about, also that they have a great beer list (also a full bar) and some wonderful orange special sauce that you definitely need to dip your french fries (and whatever else) in. The interior reminded me of something the wonderful Chef Barbara Lynch would do. The Butcher Shop in Boston is very similar, aesthetically anyway. Since I was late and it was packed, I didnt get to order, so I just want to extend an enormous thank you to the wonderful Georgie S. for sharing with me the most amazing burger I have ever had. In my life. Hands down. I was in meat heaven last night, and the fries were freakin' awesome too, served in a miniature shopping cart no less. Top that off with a Makers on the rocks, and you have one, very happy Nikki.\n\nIn & Out... I would like to apologize for cheating. I still love you Animal Style #2, but it was worth it, I am in love and I now have a new favorite.
