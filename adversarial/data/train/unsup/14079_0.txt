I honestly want to give it one star but I'm trying to be nice. So this place is expensive and the results don't match with how much you pay. $650 for Botox? $750 for fillers?? And only last 2-3 months. Then they have the audacity to try and up sell you and some freakin creams that are $200-300 and on ounce, do you now how small an ounce is?? Um no. No no no. I do not recommend this place.
