This is one of my favourite sandwich places ever. There are a bunch of locations each a tiny bit different (at least the sauce is). They serve italian paninis and small pasta dishes as well. If you haven't had an italian panini from california sandwiches, prepare to be amazed. \n\nIt's funny because my girlfriend always teased me about how much meat and filling I put in sandwiches when she would only put something like 2 slices of meat. California sandwiches is not that place. Expect a giant panini filled with a fried cutlet of either veal or chicken (there may be other options but those two are the only ones I ever order). The cutlets dwarf the panini (perfect), are smothered with homemade tomato sauce and topped with you choice of mushrooms, provolone, an onions if you so choose.  A word of caution, depending on the location you go to the severity of the sauce's hotness will varie. I remember getting the sauce \"hot\" at the little Italy location and it was not messing around. \n\nOut of both the veal and the chicken cutlets I actually prefer the chicken. I usually have it topped with cheese and mushrooms ontop and find it perfect. I've had it with sauce on the side but actually prefer how the sauce seeps into the breading making it softer (and messier).\n\nYou must visit this place. MUST!  However be warned not to bring your business suit or fancy shirt, your sandwich may end up on it. And dates? Forget about it, unless you want to look like a person mauling their food with sauce up to your wrists.  Or is it just me?  Nah I'm awesome.  Maybe I'll use a knife and fork next time, or is that frowned upon like the chocolate bar?
