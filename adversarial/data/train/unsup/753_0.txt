Strolled in at 10 on a particularly wild night. Had the oysters, foie gras, steak, lobster spaghetti, and an embarrassing amount of wine and champagne. Loud and drunk, yes we were Those people. Despite that, the service was great. Our bill was horrendous, and my memory is foggy from that night but from what I can remember the food was amazing.
