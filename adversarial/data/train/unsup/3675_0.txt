This was definitely hard to find... It's in the plaza with the Pizza Pizza, and it's all the way at the end called fish store or something lame. But yes it's a Big Al's.\n\nIt's huge here. Love the large selection of marine fish. Walking through the fish isles of any Big Al's is always a ton of fun (to me anyway, I love colours tehe) but this location just seem bigger! They have more coral tanks (the Oakville Big Al's used to be great for corals too but it's closed down now).\n\nChris is the marine expert there, you can even phone and ask for him for whatever marine questions you have. He's a fun guy, down to earth, and he knows everything about saltwater stuff.\n\nI actually really like this location for its size and the many coral tanks! But their selection of corals for sale doesn't have as many as the Missisauga location... yet  sometimes nicer though. Yes I've been to a few :p\n\nP.S. it's actually a fun place for a date. I know, a fish store.. I must be crazy.. But if you love going to zoos and museums, go to Big Al's too! There's enough in there to make you roam around and stay. Ask to touch a snake.\n\nOh and they open on most holidays too. I remember going there on Victoria Day, Canada Day, Civic...
