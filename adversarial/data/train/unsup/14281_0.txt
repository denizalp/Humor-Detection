First, I hate any kind of scamming. This is a bar where a lot of locals know one another. I play a lot of music in the juke box and I've been here to specifically play their great juke box and the fact they carry my beer, MGD 64. The happy hour prices are decent, $2.50 a bottle. The staff is friendly. They have 99 cent sliders on Tuesdays and Thursdays, otherwise, they don't have any reduced priced appetizers. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, between 5:00-7:00, the bottles are suppose to be $1.75. I've been in here about 10 times.  10 times I was over charged for either food and\/or drinks. These were blatent over charges. I had a coupon for 35 cent wings. I ordered 10 wings. Total should be $3.50. It's not difficult to order 10 wings at 35 cents a piece. They charged me $5.75. I brought this up to the bartender and she kept debating with me that 10 wings at 35 cents each were  $5.75.  35 cents x 10= 5.75?  They follow a chart that's taped to their cash register. She kept saying I was the only person in 3 years to ever complain about the pricing of the wings!!! I said then maybe I'm the only person in 3 years to see that you're overcharging everyone. It was eventually fixed after others in the bar started hearing the conversation, but they didn't agree with me that 35cents x 10= 3.50. The last time I went in a couple weeks ago, I specifically went for the $1.75 beers between 5-7. They charged me for full price happy hour even though I was there on the \"special 1.75 day\". I've had buy 1 get one free coupons for here, and the free meal was never taken off. I've had to correct this many times. So, I like the atmosphere. It's very casual, decent drink specials, really no food specials, and a great juke box. They do have a very small free buffet with 2 things on it, but it's always gone and not re-filled. As long as you watch your bill and prices closely, it's a decent place to go. I would've rated them a 3 1\/2  if it weren't for every bill being wrong.
