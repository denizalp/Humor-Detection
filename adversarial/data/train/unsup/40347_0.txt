I came here to buy two new tires for my 2007 Prius. All together, the bill was $215. I didn't feel like I was getting ripped off. The people who work there were quite polite and efficient. They also pointed out that I didn't have an inspection sticker (required by the state), so I'm going back on Monday to have those tests done.
