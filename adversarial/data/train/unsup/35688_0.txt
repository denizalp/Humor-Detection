The company who built our pool used a shoddy contractor for the pebble-tec. We've already had to have several other areas repaired, but those were under warranty. Needless to say, those repairs weren't much better than the original so were left with more pebble-tec to repair. \n\nSince we were no longer under warranty (thank goodness!), we got to pick our own company. I was shocked by how different the quotes and recommendations were, ranging from repairs isolated to the damaged areas all the way to resurfacing the entire pool! That made us nervous because we really didn't know how much work the pool actually needed.\n\nWe felt good about Steve's analysis and the price was very fair, so we rolled the dice and hoped his solution was the right one. So far, it sure looks like it was! Plus, he was professional, friendly, and easy to work with.\n\nI really hope we're done dealing with pool repairs, but at least if we aren't, I won't have to waste time hunting down a good contractor. Steve's the man!
