I struggled as to whether to give it 4 stars. I like the hotel a lot. The new lobby is modern and comfortable with inviting spaces. Even a fire pit outside to sit at and talk. The front desk staff was great. The room I was in was one of the refreshed rooms and so everything was newer with standard Marriott comfort. The evening snacks at in the concierge lounge was very good and much more than what some Marriott hotels put out. Breakfast in the concierge lounge was an issue. The pastries were very old and stale and I found mold on the white bread (which almost pushed me down to 2 stars, but hey, everyone makes mistakes.) My biggest problem...NO HD TV. Granted they have things posted saying that they are upgrading in the near future...but it is 2014. I NEVER expected to show up at a Marriott in 2014 to find that they didn't have HD TV. I actually only stayed one night instead of my scheduled stay because of small low def TV's.
