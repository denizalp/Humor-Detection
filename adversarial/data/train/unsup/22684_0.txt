Some things a diva should never share, but I can not keep this place a secret. I was in dire need of a mowing in the worse way. I was looking like Buck Wheat from the Lil' Rascals down below. I could not take it anymore. I found Pretty Kitty with the help of Yelp. It was a small commute from my neighborhood to the shop. They are soon opening a new spot in Summerlin. Yay! \n\nThe waxing was quick as I doubted it could be done in 15 minutes as bad as my lawn looked. Well I be damn in 15 minutes I indeed had a very Pretty Kitty. I gave them kudos for a job well done. Did it hurt? Of course it did in some sensitive places, but it was so quick the pain quickly subsided. I purchased the recommended after care products, and left a nice tip for my sweet lady who made my first Brazillian a breeze.
