The Pinball Hall of Fame has a lot of pinball machines. Is that obvious? Well it's true and you can play all of them! There always seems to be a good amount of people here which is nice to see in a world full of technology and video games. I personally don't like pinball very much because I'm not very good at it but they have an aisle dedicated to arcade games which I do love. They have all the classics like Tetris, donkey kong, frogger, simpsons, pacman, you get the idea. This aisle seems pretty popular so you may have to wait for a turn but not for very long. $5 seriously can last you for 30-45 minutes here. It's fun to just walk around and look at all the machines, especially the older ones. Some of these machines have little tags on them with the history of how it was acquired or the unique gameplay it offers or who invented it. I highly suggest taking the time to read as many as possible. They also have an area where people are fixing machines so you can see the inner workings of some of them. \n\nThis might sound bad but I think a small bar inside or nearby would do well. They have vending machines and I think popcorn but seems like kids and adults alike want something more substantial to eat or drink here to spend even more time. I guess they don't want food in the machines and drunk people breaking stuff so that makes sense. Oh well it's good clean fun!
