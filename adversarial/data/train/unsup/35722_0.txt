When we go in to eat its like seeing an old family member. Tottie and her staff always makes you feel welcome. \nBun Tom is one of my favorites --Charbroiled pork, shrimp and Tottie rolls with fresh lettuce, fresh mint, peanuts and rice vermicelli. Pho Tai is great. Spring rolls are awesome. Depending on time of year she makes the most incredible avocado ice cream. Trust me, its perfection.
