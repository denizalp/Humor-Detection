Why are the Filipino buffets not good? Have we just settled and accepted that this is the best we will get? I want to give every Filipino establishment an amazing rating but I know I wouldn't eat this at home so why am I paying for it? \n\nThe entire buffet either was swimming in oil, fried items that were drier than the desert, or they are not keeping up with the buffet that the items dry out.\n\nIt's really disappointing because Filipino food is so good and I wish someone would just care enough to show that.
