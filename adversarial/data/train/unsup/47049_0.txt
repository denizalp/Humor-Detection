First off. The food was very good, worth 4-5 stars for price and quality.  The service was 3 stars. The low grade is for the cleanliness. No table had been wiped and many were covered in spilled food. The kitchens were very messy. There were empty boxes, used rubber gloves, food, paper towels all over the floor. The counters were a mess as well. The restaurant wasn't so busy or overwhelmed either.  The place was a little over half full. They really need to clean up.
