About five years ago I had a filling the size of Rhode Island fall out of my mouth.  It was a temporary filling that should have lasted three years, ended up living rent-free in my mouth for nearly 25 years.\n\nI hate dentists.  I hate the shots, the gagging, the \"hold stills\" and that dreaded drill. Alas, borrowed time was over and I needed help.  Luckily The P(rincess) has a great dentist who was willing to fix up a five year old going on 50.\n\nDr. Baker has been terrific these last five years.  I get my teeth cleaned three times a year  with Brittany and actually haven't been in his chair for any serious problems since that first visit.  He recently replaced one of my silver fillings and I have to say, it was indeed painless and fun to visit with him and Israel (who is filling in for the talented Barb).\n\nThere are some nefarious dentists out there that will look in your mouth for dollar signs.  Yes, if you look hard enough, you'll always find something to fix.  Dr. Baker is completely a stand up professional.  He's a straight shooter and will only do the work needed, drilling in your mouth and not your wallet.\n\nI really can't say enough about this Doctor and his practice.  They've completely cured me of my dentist-anxiety and it's a joy to have the peace of mind that my dental health is up to date.\n\nNow, if I could only find someone to cure me of my fear of Trolls
