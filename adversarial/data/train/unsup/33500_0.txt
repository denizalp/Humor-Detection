Poor customer service but really good hair cuts. Both my teenage boys got really good hair cuts. The customer service is poor and even if you make an appointment you will have to wait a considerable amount of time in most cases. A sign in sheet for appointments and walk ins would be a great form of comfort customers to know where they stand in line ect...
