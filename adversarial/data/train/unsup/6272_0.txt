We came here looking for quality food with a relaxing atmosphere. I wanted a variety so I ordered 2 appetizers instead of one entree.\n\nMy first choice was the New York Asparagus. This is thinly cut black angus beef wrapped around asparagus with provolone and  topped with marsala mushroom sauce. It was very good but the sauce reminded me of Salisbury steak sauce which kind of threw me off. It is pretty small so don't order it if you are really hungry.  \n\nI also ordered the pesto garlic bread. It was made with french bread and had tomato,  garlic, pesto on it. There was a generous amount of mozzarella on top! It was really tasty!\n\nWe had the chocolate cake for dessert which made me glad that I ate a light meal! I know that garlic bread isn't considered \"light\" but I shared so in my book its considered a tapa.
