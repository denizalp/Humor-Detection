It's nice to have a Chinese restaurant that's close to home and not deal with Spring Mtn road. I usually come here with my parents a few times a month for dinner. We've ordered various dishes including pork with Peking sauce, clams with black bean sauce, various vegetables such as saut√©ed green beans, and ong choy with fermented beans. We've also tried lobster cooked different styles. My favorite has to be the clams cooked in black bean sauce. I think the flavor is on point every time we get it. The restaurant is clean and I like the service here better than some of the other Chinese restaurants. Overall, I will continue to come back here because I do like the food and it's nice that it's close to where I live :)
