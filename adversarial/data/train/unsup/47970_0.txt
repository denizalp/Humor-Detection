This is a great breakfast spot filled with all the locals. It's small, so make sure to get in early. I had the Basic Breakfast: 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, sausage and hash browns for $8.99. Not a bad deal for all that food. The portions are large, so make sure to bring your appetite. \n\nTheir only downfall: the coffee isn't very good.
