Don't ever expect too much when you come to an IHOP except for lots of pancake fun. It's location is tucked inside a hotel parking lot. Never very busy at the times I have gone.   Love their all you can eat pancake specials when they have them.  Last time I tried the banana caramel pancake that they had on special and it was sinfully fabulous.  \nBecause the place wasn't very packed the wait staff was not very attentive to needs. Water glasses were refilled regularly.  Also they have a problem with splitting the bill and it doesn't matter what time of day or night that it is.
