My first review at Subaru of LV was about there awesome sales team when i purchased my car from them last December, and after a year of having work done with there service department I have to say that Steve and Ken in service are absolutely second to none in this city.  They have done an amazing job for covering maintenance and warranty fix's, all in a timely manor, with an extremely positive manor towards me as a customer.   The experience I have had with them has insured that I will be a life time customer at Subaru of Las Vegas.
