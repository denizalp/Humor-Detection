Had an amazing time HOWEVER ended my day terribly. Out of curiosity walked into Cop Copine shop and experienced the most disrespectful, distasteful, rudeness from a worker. He is male with long hair, And would just like to warn anyone who plans on visiting to avoid this shop because it definitely ruined my day.
