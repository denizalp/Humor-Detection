A PEPPER PLAY:\nEW: My computer IS connected to my printer! *Taps fingers anxiously.*\nEW: My printer IS turned on!\" *Clenches hands into fists.*\nEW: I WILL KILL YOU! *Slams laptop shut, shoves it in bag and runs out door without brushing hair towards FedEx\/Kinkos.*\n\n- - - \n\nThe above was my morning. I sincerely hope yours was better.\n\nThank heavens for this FedEx\/Kinkos location. You go in, you go right to a computer and stick your credit card in and use their goods for 20 cents a minute. You don't even need to speak to anyone! And today, honestly, lucky for them.\n\nHead here when your printer decides to take a sick day to open up that bastardly PDF that you need print to sign (and then take a photo of and then email back*...)\n\n*Adobe Echosign is a God among men... err... programs. Everyone should embrace it.
