classy room just as expected. i would give it a 5 star, but 1 star is deducted due to service. so the facet to the bathtub was broken, the valve for the hot water wouldnt shut off. even when we turn the knob off, the water was still running. we called up for the service to get it fix. it took them SOOOO long.. i would have to say 1hr at least. and note: that this was at 12am. we were ready to go to sleep, but we had to wait for the guy to fix the darn facet. \n\nbeside that problem, the room was elegant w\/o a doubt. they were also nice enough to send me complimentary chocolates since it was my birthday. Although i was expecting more than just chocolates from Wynn. I mean i got a champagne at the Mirage one time. but at brand spanking new encore? chocolates?  okay i sound greedy...shouldnt complain....i was thankful.. but i just thought coming from wynn, i guess i was expecting something more grand than chocolates, u know?\n\ncasino is nice. very RED. but i like it!  i believe the casino is smaller than Wynn's. i'm not sure. but it looks like it in my opinion. i may be wrong. Their free cocktails are tastier and stronger than other casinos.
