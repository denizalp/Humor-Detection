This JC Penny's is located inside the Arizona Mills Mall.\nNot the average Penny's. It is like a lot of left overs from the other stores.\nHowever, lots on sale here,and if you look long enough and hard enough you just might find what you are looking for!\nIt is pretty organized which is good, however I always seem to find things I really do not need but, I think I must buy because, of the price.\nThere is always a lot of people here and a lot of screaming children running around. However, maybe that is just the time of day that I am going in.\nPrices are good, I can't always find what I want , but It is like a high end Big lots.
