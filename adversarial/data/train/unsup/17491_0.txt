Giant sticky menus, refrigerated counters of chocolates, a happy crowd of people laughing and quite possibly eating chocolate marshmallow pizza for dinner without judgement because why the hell not, super friendly chill service, in general it's hard to not be a fan of this place when you're in the right mood for it. I went with my family after a dinner in the area, there was no line when we arrived and we laughed and were dazzled by the indulgent menu but ended up sharing two ice cream parfaits, one with this delicious caramelized coconut topping and both with brownies, and it was good times.
