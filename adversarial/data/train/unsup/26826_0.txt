I was very excited to finally try In-N-Out burger after hearing about it for so long. We drove here from the strip, about 10 mins away. There wasn't any line when we got in which was nice. Ordered the double-double and side of animal fries. \n The burger was good. Soft buns with a good portion of meat. I got onion on mine which was a little thick and overpowering. The animal fries were stale with slices of cheese on top with grilled onions and thousand island sauce. I didn't feel like they were anything special. But i guess for the price you do get a lot.
