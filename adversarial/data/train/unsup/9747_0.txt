They lie. Told me I could get into the car I wanted for 1500 down. I said ok. Then they said we need at least 2k. I said I'm tired of the games so I'll put 3k down and let's sign. He leaves and comes back saying they can't do the deal bec they need 5k down. LOL buy cash guys. If you don't have that luxury, then READ YOUR PAPERS. Everything they charge well MOST of what they charge is OPTIONAL. Don't ever tell them a monthly payment. Bec if you say $300 a month, but you're eligible to pay $200 a month, they will tack on fees to make up the difference. Why? Bec you said $300. They're crooks.
