Ugh. DMV residents can't even get away from Jose Andres in Las Vegas.  But oh well - we decided to give it a try.  We were most definitely not going to eat at Jaleo since you can throw a rock out the Washington Monument and hit one.  China Poblano was to be our JA experience at the Cosmopolitan.  \n\nThe restaurant is on the small side, but, as all of JA's restaurants, colorfully decorated.  We got When Pigs Fly, which are the more traditional steam Chinese buns and not the type of buns you would expect from a ramen house, for example.  Vietnamese also eat these type of buns - ban bao - usually filled with an egg and meat.  These buns were just ok, but not what i wanted or expected.  I got the fish tacos, which were just seared fish with marinated onions.  They left something to be desired.  The BF got the Queso Fundido, which was the best thing we had.  It was melted Menonita cheese, tequila and he added chorizo.  The tortillas were warm and tasted oh so gooey and ooey once we tore the tortillas up and dug into the melted yummy-ness.  \n\nChina Poblano was good, but like a typical Jose Andres restaurant, a mixture of Spanish and Asian spices and tastes, where some of the dishes are a standout and the rest are just fillers. There are just so many other places to go on the Strip, might as well skip this one unless you are staying in the Cosmo and need a quick bite.
