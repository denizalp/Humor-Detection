My 91 year old mother was taken to this hotel when hurricane Mathew hit her condo in SC . The people at this hotel were wonderful ! My mother is not very mobile , had a number of special request . The staff was more than responsive and caring . Every one of her needs were looked after by the Aloft staff . I want to say thank you . Special thanks to Ewan - housekeeping manager
