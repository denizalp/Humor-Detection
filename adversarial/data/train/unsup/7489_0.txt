I'm not sure how this business was able to muster a four star reputation when 75% of the staff is rude, incompetent, and has a \"why are you bothering me, condescending attitude\". Now, I will give the apparel department five stars because the seamstress and several of the other gals over there have been awesome. But my experience with parts and rentals was nothing more than rancid. I hate writing 1-star reviews, but when you continue to drop the ball and show no regard for poor customer service, you really have it coming. \n\nFor the parts department: expect to never get a call back when your parts are in. It took me 30 days to get a simple issue fixed with a short in one of my running lights because allegedly they ordered a European part, then on the second appointment the mechanic went home sick, delayed another few days, third appointment misquoted on pick up time and delayed the entire rest of the day. \n\nFor the rentals department: a friend of mine came in from out of town to visit and wanted to rent a Harley so we could ride and take in some views. We found the rental guy smoking a cig on the bench outside with a very unwelcoming look. As he showed us around and informed us that nearly every bike my friend wanted to rent either wasn't available for rent or they didn't have at this location, it became clear that we weren't going to get very far. Mid sentence the guy actually rushed off to help other customers without even saying he would be back or apologizing for just jetting. How rude. After giving these guys multiple chances, it's over for me. \n\nCome here if you like rude staff and terrible experiences, again and again.
