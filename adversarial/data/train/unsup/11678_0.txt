I came with my family (6) on a tuesday evening ordering dim sum which was about 120. \n\n- Rip off. For those that has ever eaten dim sum in orange county, sgv, or even rowland heights, you'd spend about half the price SERIOUSLY (seafood cove as an honorable mention)!\n- Wimpy dim sum. shrimp balls are so so tiny! its laughable. shrimp noodle (one of my faves. its the clear wrapper around shrimp where you put sauce on top) only had one piece of shrimp and the noodle was not fresh. seemed old and not soft how it should be.\n- Small portion combination fried rice. oily and gross chinese after flavor. quite possibly microwaved.  \n- I can go on and on about each individual plate, but if you are a local, there is better dim sum out there...just not here..sadly..\n- We came here bc TFC runs their commercials constantly. advertising win.\n- Oh yes, one star for quick service and pretty sinks in the bathroom :)
