Mother India = Gandhi Roti on weekends. \n\nI don't know why Gandhi doesn't post a sign on their door on Friday nights when they close for the weekend directing traffic to their sister restaurant in Parkdale. I suggested it to our server and he seemed uninterested by the idea. \n\nSame owners, same menu, except instead of standing in a line ten people deep and muttering under your breath about how long it's taking, you can sit in a quiet, virtually empty restaurant with plenty of seating and ventilation.
