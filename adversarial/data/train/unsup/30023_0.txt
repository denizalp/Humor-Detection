The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because of the facility itself.  Outdated, hot and disgraceful when compared to other imaging facilities.  Having said that, the customer service was so outstanding, I'd go into a pup tent with this staff.  Every single person was personality plus.  I had a procedure that was supposed to be painful, where they inject iodine into your knee, and then you have an mri.  Naturally, I was nervous.  Justin, who was a trainee under supervision, was delightful.  He set the tone.  Then came Dr Sanders, who explained everything in detail.  Every facet of the procedure was explained up front, and then while he was doing it, he would again explain.  It barely hurt, but even if it did, I would praise Dr Sanders for his attention to not only my physical condition, but my psychological needs.  The mri technician was the same, even explaining to me what I needed to do to alleviate the swelling and pain from the iodine.
