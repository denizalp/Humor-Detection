i had brunch here with my girlfriend and two other  friends, who had suggested this place.  i knew it wasn't like reddstone, which i had frequented and enjoyed.\n\nour server was nice, very helpful, but way too chatty for my liking.  we started with appetizers of wings, which were good, and then crab cake...which was possibly the worst crab cake ive ever had.  i mentioned to my friends that it smelled like mothballs.  im not sure what they used to make it but it was a huge disappointment.\n\nour entrees came, and we waited almost 5 minutes for silverware until we asked the server for some more, which was another put-off for me.  whether the busser forgot or not, just a bad look.  i had the burrito, which was really good...except it had black beans which were really hard and it took away from the overall consistency of the rest of the plate.  this bothered my friend so much that the server actually switched that out for another choice.  my girlfriend had the meatloaf which was very good on her end.\n\ni was just so bothered by the food and the lack of attention of the busser that upon paying, i told my server how i felt.  to his credit he took care of my bill, but kind of went overboard with explaining how the transaction would be voided...and i got 8 notifications that my card was declined, which i found odd and unsettling.  i provided another card to use to pay for my girlfriend's part, and he came back saying that was declined as well; this i found strange because there was plenty of money there.    as a result i didn't pay for anything, but i didn't feel right being told \"my card was declined\" when the funds were there.\n\noverall, im glad they took care of me, but the food really wasn't that great.  can't really recommend it to others.
