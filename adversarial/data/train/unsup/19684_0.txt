I'm always in for to go orders. Today I walked in. No waitress. I had to go into the bar to ask if I could order something to go. I was sent back into the restaurant by the bartender working. Still no waitress. When she finally came out she did not greet me. She had a bad attitude. I could hear her complain about her personal problems to everyone in the restaurant. When she took my order she seemed very rushed. Was not polite at all. Continue to complain about her personal problems to everyone else sitting in the restaurant. The manager or owner needs to get rid of this girl who has no customer service skills or work ethic.
