I scrolled through a good amount of reviews while waiting for my food, and it seems like only one user named Ali M. noticed it too - the people who work here don't use gloves, at an open kitchen with the cashier machines right in front, and the door facing all the food. I would understand if chefs use their bare hands in an enclosed, sanitized kitchen, but this was just disgusting. The guy working here had 1 glove on one of his hands and didnt use that hand. LOL. The lady sneezed, while facing the stove..so wasn't sure if my short ribs were contaminated - couldnt see if she covered her face since she was facing away from me.\n\nI couldn't really decide what to order since the menu was fairly large for a korean takeout place. The two people that work here suggested us to get the lunch box. I asked what comes with the short ribs lunch box and the lady said \"you won't be disappointed\" with a very impatient tone. Well it would be really nice to know what is inside since there a lot of things I don't like in the Korean cuisine - almost anything that is pickled (which is most of their sides).\n\nFood took a while to come but I was fine with it since they cooked the meat on the spot (instead of some pre cooked stuff).\n\nOnto the actual food, it was honestly hard for me to eat, knowing how they touched my food and potentially touching their face, a dirty bag, an unclean table, the cash machine, the fridge door....... The short ribs were tough, I didnt touch any of the pickled stuff, the glass noodles were decent, the soup was meh.\n\nFor $12, Id rather go to an actual restaurant and have my food served to my table with actual service and hygeine.
