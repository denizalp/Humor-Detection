Delish! But new friend Lisa couldn't finish her sweet one!\n\nI stopped in here with my (then) boyfriend when we visited Vegas back in ought-six. The crepes were so memorable that I knew I'd be back the next time I was in town. It took me six years, but I made it, the crepes were still wonderful and the prices were still reasonable. (In my opinion. If you are looking to stuff yourself silly for a few dollars more, there is a buffet across the hallway.)\n\nThis little place is in the mall portion of the Paris LasVegas Hotel & Casino. Walk up to order, and grab a table in the seating area off to the side. The ingredients are simple, delicious and filling. I was alone this time, and made friends\/shared a table with another solo diner in the seating area.
