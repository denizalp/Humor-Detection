Let's be clear here - this is the nightclub by which to judge all other nightclubs.  Hakkasan is la creme de la creme, and if you like to party in Vegas, it's just an absolute must.\n\nFor all the negative reviews here:\n\n1. Yes there may be a long ass line - buy tickets in advance or get in contact with a promoter before you get there.  I have no sympathy for freeloaders who complain about waiting.\n\n2.  It's crowded as F*CK - is this honestly a surprise to you?!  If you hate crowds go somewhere no one likes, or spring for the table and have your own roped off section.\n\n3.  I'm sorry you don't like house music? OK your review is irrelevant to me - have fun at 1OAK.\n\nOK - on to the good stuff:\n\nHakkasan is B.E.A.UTIFUL!  The lights are amazing and I really love the hanging logos.  The layout is perfection, especially if you have a table.  There's no bad place to be in the club.  Yes it gets crowded, but the dance floor is so much bigger than places like Marquee or XS which is awesome.  \n\nIf you want to see the worlds' top DJ's while you're in Vegas, Hakkasan is the place to do it.  Seriously, follow Tiesto on Snapchat - he loves Hakkasan!  I think it's also Aoki's favorite place to cake his fans.  Hakkasan is like a personal playground to these guys.  My goal is to see Above & Beyond there before the year's end.\n\nOK time to go book my next flight to Vegas...see you soon Dave N!
