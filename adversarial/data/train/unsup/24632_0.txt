Wow this Milestones has gone downhill since the last time I've been here. I came here tonight for a colleague's farewell drinks and dinner. First things first, the waiter did not have any personality for his job. Sorry but I know you were over our table after we sent back COLD AND SOGGY calamari but your personality does not fit the role. He seemed tired of us. He did check up time to time but for being there 3 hours (some friends for 4 hours), time to time is not acceptable. We had to flag him or some other servers down. Anyways, our drinks were super slow. No one cared to update us or anything. I was also SO disappointed. $13.75 for 2 measly lettuce wraps!!!!! Joeys probably costs the same but they give you a little more. It was salty AF but because we already returned a dish and I was super hungry, I just ate it and ordered another fish taco to satisfy my hunger.\n\nDefinitely disappointed about this place. It was busy being in dundas square but again, just not a good experience at all. I will not consider milestones for dinner going forward. Overpriced and terrible service.
