They slipped a flyer under our door too.  We tried it, but as it was nearby, we went in to the restaurant.  The food was fantastic! I had the philly cheese steak and my wife had the double cheese burger. Both came with fries, hot and crispy as we like them.  The service was fast and friendly and the food delicious, portions ample.  We enjoyed talking with the owner and plan on going back for more before we leave Las Vegas.
