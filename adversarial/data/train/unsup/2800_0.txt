I don't want no Scrubs...or any mediocre karaoke place bringing me down! Though this place isn't that bad, it isn't the shining star of karaoke spots. \n\nI've been here a few times now and my most recent visit may have been my most confusing ( but still fun). I organized a party for 14 of us to go eat Korean food and then boogie on down to sing some top notch karaoke. We weren't in the place more than 10 min. and the hostess came down to tell us we had to move rooms. It wasn't the best but we managed to move everyone into a VERY small room. We went from being able to dance around to hardly being able to move. But hey that's what the cheap beers are for right? \n\nFor song selection it actually was pretty okay. We didn't end up using the books at all and instead we just searched everything from the controller which was fine.\n\nOver all we had fun and by the end of it we forgot how small the room was and just focused on how some of our friends may or may not be tone deaf.
