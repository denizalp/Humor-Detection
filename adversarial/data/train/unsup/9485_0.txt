Every other concert venue in Toronto, eat your heart out! \n\nDanforth music hall is truly a gem, absolutely gorgeous venue that has many perks to heighten your concert experience. Walking into this venue it is quite modern and very aesthetically pleasing. The first thing you notice is the sloped floor, this is totally key! The sloped floor allows everybody to get a good, clear view of the stage (is there a 7ft tall giant in front of you? Easy fix, take a few steps back!). The concert hall has beautiful high ceilings and the room is quite open, making the venue seem larger than it probably is. The second floor is a seated balcony for those who prefer not to stand. I always prefer to stand and get as close as possible so I opted to stay on the main level. \n\nThe venue itself is not the only impressive thing; the sound quality during the concert was absolutely impeccable (second in Toronto only to the Queen Elizabeth Theatre IMO). The band I was here to see decided to go unplugged for 1 song and we had no problem hearing them, proving the acoustics in this venue are top notch. \n\nThe venue had a pretty standard bar (only in the lobby, I don't think they had a bar set up in the concert hall), and was also serving fresh popcorn! (Big plus, the smell was intoxicating). It is easy to get to this venue, and since it's located on the Danforth you have a slew of pre\/post concert food and drinks options. I absolutely fell in love with this venue and cannot wait to return!
