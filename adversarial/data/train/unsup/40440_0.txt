Not a bad store location. Because it is located in a vast shopping complex there are significantly fewer patrons clogging the Geniuses time ;-) There inventory is not as robust as some of the other stores but I guess that is because this locale is smaller than most. \nThe staff are always ready to assist and very professional! Thank you!
