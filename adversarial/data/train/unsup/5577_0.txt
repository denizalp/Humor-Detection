We had our family portraits done by Stuart recently and had a great experience.  He took the time to make our daughter feel comfortable and interact with the camera.  We felt comfortable with him and I liked the location that we choose (Pan Pacific Park near The Grove) and that little area seemed to offer a lot of options!  The booking process was very easy and everyone was on time even though the parking lot was quite busy!  I can't wait to see our pictures!
