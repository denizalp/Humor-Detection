**3.5 stars**\n\nI really, REALLY wanted to give this restaurant a 4 star.  But...\n\nI was Introduced and brought here by another sushi lover on a Saturday evening, so of course I had SOME sort of expectations.  But as usual, i kept an open mind for any errors.  We walked into a clean, dimly lit restaurant with ambient music playing in the background, creating a trendy atmosphere.  We were politely greeted, then brought into the bar\/lounge area (possibly because the dining room seemed rather full).\n\nWe were approached by the server within reasonable time, and we ordered our drinks right away.  I have to mention they have a pretty extensive wine list that consisted of a lot of wines i liked, so I was definitely impressed!! Even more impressive was that it's one of the few restaurants that still serves wine by half litres, so even though their cocktail menu looked pretty good, this was quite an obvious choice for me.  I'd save the cocktail experience for next time.\n\nThey offer an a la carte menu, but we opted for the $27.99pp ayce menu (..duhhrr!).  Overall, the food was GOOD!!  I don't usually dine in the Mississauga, and by 'usually' I mean never.  But I can say this place set the bar quite high for all the other places I've yet to try.  There are a few dishes that I can still recall enough to give a fair review:\n\nCurry Pumpkin Soup: 4\/5 stars\nA little offering of Autumn infused with Asian influence, served hot in a perfect appetizing portion! Mmmm...\n\nSashimi: 4.5\/5 stars\nSuper fresh and good size pieces! I have to stress that it was ah-mazingly fresh for an ayce restaurant.  However, they were only served in 5 or 8 piece portions.\n\nGreen Curry Chicken: 3\/5 stars\nWe really ordered beef, but it came out to be chicken.  I liked it. Nothing amazing, but good. I personally would've enjoyed a little more spice and coconut flavour.  It was a pretty big portion, just as anything else \"From the Wok\".\n\nBangkok Street Style Pad Thai: 4\/5 stars\nVery bold and tangy tastes!! It was delicious and very flavourful.  I probably would have enjoyed it more if I wasn't already full when we ordered this.\n\nSmoked Duck Salad: 3\/5 stars\nExactly like it sounds.  Garden greens with (balsamic?) dressing and a few good-sized pieces of smoked duck. Pretty big salad for an ayce menu though, but still yummy!\n\nGyoza: 1.5\/5 stars\nPerfectly sized (...BIG) dumplings fried to an eye-appealing golden brown that will have you salivating at the sight of them.  Then you take your first bite and expect a juicy bold flavour, a traditional meaty texture, and maybe a little crunch. But you will very soon be baffled by a bland mushy filling and a wash of disappointment.\n\nService: 2\/5\nPolite, genuine, but not professional. It might've been just this one server, and maybe he was new and not fully trained (still inexcusable), but my dinner date assured me that they're usually much better.  My first criticism is that he didn't know the wine that I ordered by half litre... like dude, it's a pretty typical wine that is offered by the glass as well. Second, I respect all servers that take orders without writing them down.  I  am guilty of that myself. But you have to be sure you can remember them all!!  Well he didn't.  It took 2 reminders and about 20 minutes later for our salad to come out. A couple other dishes needed reminders too.  Our last orders were ridiculous! A couple hot dishes took about half an hour... all the while we had NO food on the table.  It's not just the service of our server, but the execution of the food in the kitchen too, it just took way too long!  Had the server been more professional, the least you can do is come by and check on us and apologize or explain why it's taking so long. Furthermore, there were also mistakes made such as chicken instead of beef, or just dishes arriving that we did not order.  This the main reason behind dropping jj's rating by 0.5 star...I am tempted to make it a full star!\n\nOverall, a very good and tasty experience.  I am so glad a place like this exist, and maybe Mississauga isn't so bad after all.  The food and atmosphere was great! I am definitely coming back... hopefully with better service next time.
