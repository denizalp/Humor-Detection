Today was the first time I had food at this place. I was craving hamburger. First we ordered drinks. It turns out they only have drinks from one company ( once again choices are being taken away from us ) we asked for medium well done meat. They came completely pink, no dressing, no lettuce, no tomatoes, no pickles. It was about 21:00$. When we asked about that the server said I can bring you those as side order. Which we did ask for them. As soon as we ate the burgers, our stomachs started growling and immediately we had to run to the bathrooms. We had ordered two different type of hamburgers. My wife's was about 17:00 $ the jalape√±o burger. None of us had breakfast nor lunch today and since we were hungry and had waited 30 minutes to be seated , we had finished more than 1\/2 our burgers so, we paid for them and left. \n\n I felt that for the first time I should write a review for a restaurant and let others know and not to waste their time and money for this place or if you still want to go, please lower your expectations way, way down so you won't be so disappointed.
