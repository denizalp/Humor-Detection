Since they don't deliver as far as Beechview and offer no dine-in option, Kay and I picked up a small pizza and two \"Untouchable\" sandwiches this evening for dinner and are not disgruntled over doing so. \n\nThe Pizza Company is a small-scale local chain that exists primarily in the South Hills of the city. This particular location has been here for so long I forget when it opened. Look for a humble structure of stone with the franchise's trademark: a diminutive green neon sign.\n\nTheir pizza, which we had with feta and black olives, possessed a crust that somewhat parallels toasted Italian bread  and features convex edges. The mozzarella had a bit of zing to it (a la string cheese) as did the red sauce. I wouldn't call it \"ho-hum\" at all. Pizza Co. makes a perfectly competent and edible pie. \n\nThe \"Untouchable\" sandwich is one of multiple Primanti Brothers forgeries found throughout Western Pennsylvania, and as far as I can taste, it's a very good one. Instead of slices of Italian bread, the meats (steak, ham, salami, capicola, bacon, meatballs, and turkey are your choices, and I'm not kidding about the last three), provolone cheese, vinaigrette slaw, and french fries are placed inside of a velutinous yet stout hoagie roll. My sandwich included the steak, and I found it to be as succulent and savory as gyro meat. The fries were done steak-style and were as starchy as one would expect. The slaw could have kicked a little more ass, however, but no matter, this was what Ben Reilly was to Peter Parker; a worthy clone. \n\nThe Pizza Company is welcome company, anytime.
