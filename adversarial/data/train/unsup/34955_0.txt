As I noted, if I returned I would update.  Here is that update.  Honestly, the only reason I went back was because I was invited for a birthday celebration - so I basically went for the people and not the restaurant.\n\nAfter my initial review, I was asked to email the company.  After hesitating a couple weeks I finally sent an email to see what they had to say.  To this day I have not received a reply.\n\nThis visit occurred on an \"All You Can Eat Wings\" Tuesday.  I made the decision to go with the wing special.  The wings are so-so and the flavors are boring. To me it just seems overpriced, especially since they don't include fries anymore - but instead allow you to munch on a sad nacho bar which is never restocked. All of the food just seems pricey at QSL in general.\n\nKnowing that this location and the Concord location are owned by the same company I expected a lot more out of them.  Even though the service and food in Concord is so-so.\n\nThe previous businesses in that location, for some reason, have just failed to succeed.  Hopefully they continue to make it.  \n\nI don't feel the need to return.  You can make your own decisions.\n\nThis is just an honest from-the-heart review (update) from a paying customer.
