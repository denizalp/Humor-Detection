We were very excited to go to the festival. Just moved to Arizona and heard nothing but good things about it. So I went online and paid in advance for our tickets because it was supposed to be quicker then buying them there. Because they were doing wrist bands you have to stand in a line to get them. There was only one person working the line giving the wristbands out to ticket holders. It took almost 2 hours for us to get through the line and about every ten people he would leave to go get more bands. A friend went with us who didn't have a ticket so he went through a different line. He was able to get in within about 15 minutes. Once we got in, there wasn't very many places to get out of the sun and sit down. For how many people were there and how much open space there was available they could have more. The whole thing seemed very disorganized. Having to stand inline that long to get in made it not enjoyable.
