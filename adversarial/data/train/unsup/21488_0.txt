The way I'm drawn to corndogs is magnetic. Is this a good thing? A bad thing? Perhaps just a thing? I don't know, but since I think a corn dog is just a hot dog wrapped in a delicious sweater it makes me happy.\n\nBig Hurt's happens to sell corndogs very late into the evening, which is good for late night munchies. They also sell fries that are too salty, unless you really like a lot of salt in which case they might just be good. And, wait for it, cheeseburgers on donuts instead of buns. So, in case all the gambling and drinking doesn't kill you, they've got you covered.
