Who knew there was bona fide dive bar located a mere 50 yards from the strip?  How shocking, yet utterly enticing.  The Stage Door bar is a hop, skip and jump from the Cromwell Hotel & Casino.  Even though the Stage Door is strip close, it might as well be on another planet.\n\nWhen we went to the bar, it was prime time on a Friday night.  The place was packed with a mash-up of tourists and gritty locals.  There were two time-tested female bartenders who were busy trying to keep up with near non-stop drink orders, while bantering with customers.  It was noisy and there wasn't any place to sit except at a slot machine, which made quick work of my $50.  If I had to describe the vibe of the bar, in a word, I'd call it \"Drunky.\"  \n\nGo to the Stage Door for a cheap stiff drink or two.  It provides a nice jumping off spot for the night and offers a stark contrast to what's offered on the strip.  When you've had your fill, you can easily make your way back to the bright lights and sparkle of the Cromwell and the greater strip.
