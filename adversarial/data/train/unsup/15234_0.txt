I remember the days when I used to come to the penguin and you couldn't ever get a table. The food was great and the atmosphere was even better. When I recently went there everything about the restaurant was off putting.  The whole restaurant was dark and empty. I walked in no one greeted me. The covers on the windows were all peeling off and the whole building seems like an eerie shell of what it once was. I can't even review the food this time .... Couldn't stay long enough to eat.
