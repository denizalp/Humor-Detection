The ROOF! If anyone is visiting from out of town, I make sure to take them to dinner and drinks here. I would recommend a mini drink and appetizer bar crawl (you don't even have to walk outside!) starting with Mezzo and ending on the 3rd floor roof top bar. Definitely recommend making a reservation though, it's always busy.
