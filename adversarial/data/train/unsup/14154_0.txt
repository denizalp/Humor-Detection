I have driven by NYPD pizza for years. My parents said it is their favorite pizza place, so we decided to give it a try. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised when I walked in! It's a fun ambience, nice bar area, and plenty of seating. \n\nJustin was our server and the last star is for him! He made excellent recommendations and brought a few samples. He was attentive and professional.\n\nWe ordered the SoHo salad which was to die for! It was fresh, right amount of dressing, served over a pizza crust. Mmmm good! My daughter had the lasagna which was also extremely good! It's a huge portion so you could split or have for lunch the next day. I ordered the Bruschetta pizza and I loved it! A nice mix of mozzarella and ricotta cheese and topped with the bruschetta. Simply delish!  \n\nI will be looking forward to visiting next time I'm in town.
