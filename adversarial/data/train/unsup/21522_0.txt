Commercials sound great. Can't even tell you whether they live up to their service standards because I couldn't get anyone to show up! Made an appointment and took time off work to be here. They never showed. When it got close to end of appointment window, I called and got an answering service who couldn't find any record and proceeded to ask me 3000 questions as if I had never spoken to anyone before...do you have a home warranty? etc etc. She said someone would call me back. They didn't. I gave them one more shot the following week and left my phone number for someone to call me back to reschedule. They didn't.  Don't fall for the friendly Duncan Goodrich ads...your customer service stinks, Duncan. You can keep the flashlight!
