My OH MY....\n\nThis was my first time having Korean Fried Chicken and definitely not the last. I came in with a few friends on a Friday night and it was surprisingly full. After ordering, we got two pickled sides and some popcorn. \n\nThe first dish we ordered was the Spicy Rice Cakes. Although this was a bit spicy for my liking, I continued eating it because it tasted delicious. There was a little sweetness that made it more manageable. The rice cakes themselves were also very chewy.\n\n* 40 Minutes Later*\n\nOur Half & Half Chicken dishes finally arrived (also after we asked the servers where our chicken was...). Apparently there was a mix-up in the kitchen. However, I was very impressed when everything arrived. The chicken was crispy and well-seasoned. When I bit into the chicken, I liked how the crispy skin did not just fall off in big chunks but rather stuck to the chicken. The flavours we got were a cheese one and a sweet and spicy one. \nTip: we kept the Spicy Rice Cake sauce and occasionally dipped some of the cheesey crispy chicken pieces into the bowl...yum. \n\nBesides the wait time for the food, everything else, including service was great.
