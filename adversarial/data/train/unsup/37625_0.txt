We had visited Red Robin once before in Summerlin and had a relatively good time there with friends. This time we decided to try the red Robin near us after a shopping outting. We were famished when we arrived and we were sat at a table in a timely fashion and we had a waitress take our order within the first 10 minutes. After waiting 30 minutes the waitress came back apologize for the slowness of the food, filled up our drinks and told us that it wouldn't be much longer for our burgers. Despite this we waited almost another 25 minutes before our burgers came out and we could finally start eating. My burger was not very hot when it arrived and the fries were soggy. My friend's burger was dry and the meat was over cooked. She told the waitress this when she came back to check on us and the only compensation she would offer is to make her  another burger. This was after we had waited over an hour for our food and were so hungry by the time the food finally arrived. Quite disappointed with the service and the quality of food this time for the prices we paid. I am not sure would dine there again.
