In the spirit of Independence Day (which was yesterday), I'm writing this review about my new favorite good ol' American restaurant in the Valley...\n\nI've been to this hidden gem twice so far and despite it being a tad bit out of my normal 2 mile radius, I'm sure I'll head back again soon.  I love that Bootleggers offers a very diverse menu.  When I went for lunch, I was wanting to be healthy and I ordered a kale salad with salmon.  The portion was huge, filling, and delicious.  The salmon was cooked to perfection.  In addition, there's a secret crunchy ingredient in it which I love - you'll have to go try it for yourself to see what it is!  \n\nThe next time I went was a few nights ago... it was date night and my husband and I decided to splurge and order from the not so healthy options on the menu: chicken wings (we went spicy on the wings, but there are several flavors to choose from), brisket nachos, and a burger.  We ran into some friends there that joined us and wanted to share, so we added two kale salads and a side of asparagus to get our veggies in!  It was all so good that we ate almost every last morsel between the four of us.  We washed it all down with a few beers.\n\nI like the recently renovated prohibition ambiance.  (Ask about the wood used throughout the restaurant and the windows on the wall, which have quite a bit of history behind them).  Bootleggers also has friendly service from the hostesses and the wait staff. (Alex was my server both visits).  It was a tad bit slower when we were in for dinner, but it was also packed that night.  And finally, while I'm not a moonshine drinker, those that are will be happy to know that there is plenty of it to choose from!
