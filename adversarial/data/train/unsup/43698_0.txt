It was 10:30pm and I have been here less than a week. As I'm wandering down roads with no direction, all I see is the usual fast food joints, but finally I eyed a hole in the wall and after two U-turns I made my way into the drive-thru via a narrow alleyway very similiar to a joint in Vegas that also had good Mexican fare. I ordered through the usual garbled audio system at the drive through and asked for double rice to replace my side of beans - no problem. The two beef tacos were really tasty - the taco shells were as crisp as possible, but did not break apart when you bit into the tender shredded beef that was inside. Simply adorned with cheese and lettuce, the green sauce took these tacos to a new level. It wasn't spicy, but had a great taste that kicked up the tacos flavor (jalapeno probably). Will be back for breakfast, but if your sick of the usual fast food, try to make your way here for some good real tacos.
