What shall  I tell you first?\nAnother great strip mall non descript place hidden in an industrial area. I do have to say they did a great job making the restauarant look clean , inviting and very functional for a very small space. \nI definitely will be back ...love the smoky flavor of the meat, sweet and throughly washing the meat with flavor  and the sweet pink ring  that makes the meat  and you know its the real  smoky deal. they have lots of choices of sauces but it was juicy and flavorful enough that I could have eaten it without sauce. The flavors were great  all around even my daughter's waffle fries was really tasty. We loved the smoky sweet white BBQ beans. Our friends Paul and Paula ( see Paul I mentioned you ...now write your own darn review)  had brisket and a tasty smoked sausage which looked great and the bites I had were delicious.  \nPrices are very reasonable and the service was perfect. \n\n\nLook for them at local farmers markets , Friday night dinners (prime and ribs mmm)  and hopefully a bigger site s I can bring my friends.
