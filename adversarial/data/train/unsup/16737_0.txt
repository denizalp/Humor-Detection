This place is a labyrinth. \n\nSomething like 370 different towers for rooms.\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nLine to check in is just shy of 4 hours.\nDon't mind if I do.\n\nGambling problems?\nThey can help.\n\nThere are a couple redeeming features of this hotel.\n-The pool is an oasis with chair service so you don't have to get up.\n-The buffet is worth the money. I ate 15lbs of stone crabs claws for breakfast and washed it down with some candied bacon and caviar. Just because I could.\n-There is a mysterious Noodle House hidden amongst the slot machines. Aside from my breakfast at the buffet, I ate every other meal here. Those hand pulled noodles still have me drooling.\n\nAll in all, when I am forced to attend a conference in Vegas, I may opt for this place as it is extremely accommodating from a gluttonous POV.
