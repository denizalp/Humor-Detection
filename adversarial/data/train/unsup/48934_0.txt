Due to a bad car accident, I met Larry. Larry is very knowledgeable and took my case perfectly. I lost my car because of that but his hard work and dedecation for a long period of time paid off. I needed to go to the doctor but I was able to get good treatments. He kept me updated and felt good about the status of my case. Highly recommended!!!
