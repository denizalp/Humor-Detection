My friend took me here so that we could study together, and I'm honestly so confident that this place...once the school year picks up...business will be booming!\n\nThe interior design is not only beautiful but so efficient too! Somehow a garage became an INSTA-WORTHY environment. The light fixtures and simplistic design  ultimately create the perfect spot for studying, catching up with an old friend, or relaxing on your own.\n\nUnlike most cafes, this place has PLENTY of seating! Not only that, but there are booths in which you can adjust the lighting and have your own personal outlets!\n\nAnother bonus? FREE WI-FI! The password is posted where the trash cans, napkins, sugar and cream are.\n\nHow is the food?\nThe menu is perfect! Not too overwhelming nor is it limiting. The Banh Mi sandwiches are made with care and taste super fresh! You can choose among 4 types!\n\nAnd the drinks?\nHonestly the coffee is so good! It definitely tastes fresh and authentic, which means a lot coming from me because I'm super picky with my coffee! I got the Iced Vanilla Latte (as I was craving something sweet). You can ask for skim or whole milk. They even sell Vietnamese Drip Coffee! And they grind their beans to order! I have yet to try the bubble tea, but I have no doubt that it will be of quality as I've seen so many customers order the green tea!\n\nThe bathrooms are clean and the service is so friendly! The guy who owns the place so evidently cares for the customers and puts his heart into his work! He talks to customers to see how he can improve the experience for everyone.\n\nI'm MOST DEFINITELY coming back! I low-key (selfishly) want to keep this place to myself, but I already know that I can't stop the buzz! And I wish the workers and the owner the best, though I'm confident they don't need luck with the overall quality of this business.
