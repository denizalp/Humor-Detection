This place is everything! They were the only store to have a large supply of red bean buns! Which came in all different types... donut form, original form, smooth texture red bean filling or chunky. Honestly this place made my day. I go to Crown Bakery at least once a week now to stock up on those delicious red bean buns. Got to love variety!
