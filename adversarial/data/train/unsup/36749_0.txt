Worse place ever out of all our rentals. So many hidden fees. No choice of if you want to pay for trash valet. They'll still add no matter what. No sympathy to a persons health if they missed the 60 day move out notice by a week, and they offer a 30 day notice but they still overcharged us. We paid over 2 grand to move out! Hidden fees they gave us different prices on moving out and portal showed over two grand. NEVER had this experience with other apartment complex. They even took all our deposit on top of having the nerve to charge us extra $400! We cleaned and left the apartment clean. And they charge so much for little things like carpet cleaning???!! Other apartments replace carpets! And they never overcharged us. So this place doesn't replace carpets. On top of charging us for little paint touch ups?! As much as the paint were peeling everywhere you'd think they would repaint the whole place but charged for paint touch ups? So that shows how cheap they do it, but overcharge. Other apartments never charged us for that. This place will charge for the tiniest things. No microwave. Towel holders will pop off and it appears never installed correctly. So disappointed. Very upsetting as how nice it looks outside but they suck you of your money.
