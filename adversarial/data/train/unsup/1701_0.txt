It was the last meet up for the Breakfast Club UYE for the year and Oink Caf√© was the place that was picked!\n\nI'm not a big pork eating fool, but I love me some BACON!!! How can you not love BACON! It's the best thing on the planet! So I was pretty stoked to be headed to Oink.\n\nI do have to say they make a mean up cup of coffee, I drink my coffee black unless its whack then I doc it up, but Oink's was perfectly great straight up black! \n\nI ordered the bacon stuffed pancake with a side of bacon, I had been picturing thick slices of apple wood smoked bacon ( I don't know why it was apple wood smoked in my head, but it just was) and I couldn't wait to get my teeth into it! What I got was a slice on the thin side, it was cooked the way like, not too crispy, not too soft, just wasn't what I was expecting. But the bacon stuffed pancakes OOOMMMMGGGG!!! Every bite was loaded with bacon, it was SWEET BLISS!! Maple syrup drenched pancakes loaded with salty pieces of bacon; it was heaven, pure heaven! All pancakes should be that way! haha  I also ordered a dozen bacon donut holes for my son, who is a bacon lovin fool too.\n\nI enjoyed my breakfast and look forward to coming back for some more of them bacon stuffed pancakes!
