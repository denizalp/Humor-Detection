Another mediocre shawarma restaurant in Mississauga, but wait - with a twist.\n\nPro: great location\n\nCon:  1) B- to C+ for quality of food. 2)  D+ for extraordinary poor service\n\nExplanation: \n\nI went there for lunch today while taking a break from bicycling.  I saw the posted student menu so I asked for an item on it.  He flatly refused simply saying \"it is for school people.\"  I take classes in UTM and had my ID with me but he was so adamant and foreboding, I quickly gave up and ordered off the regular menu.\n  \nThe proprietor looks like Marlon Brando after a night of alcohol binge, and too many midnight snacks, simply refused when I kindly asked for a cup of water with my meal. But the best part of his response was - get this - he rolls his eyes and sighs when I asked him for a cup of water and says, \"I don't have any cups.\"   It was a surreal experience.  I looked around the restaurant, and there was one other patron - a lone hobo who was barely coherent.  And I looked at myself.  I drove there in a $3000 bicycle and dressed better than the the hobo patron at the restaurant, so I just don't get it.   \n\nVerdict:  If you want mediocre shawarma at cheap prices with less than cordial attitude, go to On-Z-Rock.  I for one prefer to eat at places that have higher standards in food quality and customer service.   As consumers, we don't expect restaurant workers to bend backwards to cater to us, but at least we expect to be treated with minimum standard of human civility.\n\nBillybob L.
