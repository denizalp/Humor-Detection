I was in today and was cut by the callous removal tool on my ankle during a pedicure. It bled and stung and was not pretty. I was compensated by a 10% discount.(?) This is not how I would do business if I wanted to retain a brand new customer whom I just cut a chunk of skin off their ankle. Ouch! good thing i didnt have an event tonight and had to wear heels. Horrible service!
