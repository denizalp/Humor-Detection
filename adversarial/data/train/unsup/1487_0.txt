On my recent trip to Las Vegas in September, I can assure you the breakfast buffet is fantastic! Well worth it. Great assortment. Go in between the Breakfast and Lunch time hours to get both breakfast and lunch time fare--We noticed that they start putting out the crab legs and more for the lunchtime crowd as early as 10:30am. :-) \n\nPrice: It was about $21US per person.
