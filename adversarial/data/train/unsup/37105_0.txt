One of my favorite spots to grab a quick breakfast or lunch while I'm working downtown.  The options are endless- changing soups, salads, and sides based on seasonal availability- so you never get tired of the food.  I've never had anything here that I don't like!  A recent favorite is their breakfast fried egg sandwich on pretzel...still drooling over it days later.  Be sure to try their coffee as well!
