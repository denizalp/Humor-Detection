Good for a quick lunch. It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to order with so many good options; walk up to order restaurants are not my favorite to be a first timer. I went with the chicken sandwich with pickle and coleslaw, onion rings and an orangeade; came to $9 with change. The sandwich was on a hot dog bun - two chicken fingers, 1\/4 pickle and a heaping amount of coleslaw. A mess to eat but still good. The onion rings were thin and crisp. A friend of mine got the nachos which I ate most of. Whoops. I will order them next time because the chips were thick and a perfect mix of crisp and chewy. Sometimes you just want nacho cheese, can't be eating clean all the time. I have to mention the orangeade was fantastic! It tasted like a better version of Snapple orangeade from my 90s childhood. I would go back for this drink alone!
