Is it possible to feel old and have fun at the same place? Well that's how I felt last night at Whisky River. The part that made me feel old - The 20 something year olds sporting tight clothing and bumping and grinding on the dance floor. I became that gal who points at the drunken dance fools and laughs (only that used to be me just 5 years ago!). Also the DJ was schizophrenic and went from 90's hard rock to country w\/o transition. OK. But every now and then there was a good song from the mid 90's that they'd play and we couldn't help ourselves but dance (part of feeling old and having fun). Plus the plastic bull ride in the middle of night club type of space is just plain hilarious and can only crack you up. So yeah, Whisky River had its good points and not so good points (don't miss having a 20 year old's butt hit my purse!). Still I'd rather do karaoke and that will be my next move on a night out in Charlotte!
