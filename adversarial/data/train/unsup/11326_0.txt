I had made an appointment ahead of time at 4:30 to get a gel manicure. When I walked in, I was completely overwhelmed by the amount of people as well as the noise level of the entire place. It was packed!\nBut to my surprise, the hostess took care of me right away and I was seated in a massage chair for my service. The technician was really quiet, but he did a good job cleaning my nails and doing my requested design. He seemed to like the challenge I gave him. All in all, aside from the initial bustle, I would recommend coming during an off peak hour for the convenient location and quality service.
