I have known Dr. Perez professionally for several years but a couple years ago we switched from our previous PCP to Dr. Perez, hoping for better customer service and patient care. Cut to the chase - we love Dr. Perez, his staff and his aesthetician Stacey. They are the best! We get professional, caring and prompt attention and just minutes from our home. We are thrilled that he has opened his own practice and has expanded his services to include aesthetics and more! He's the best!
