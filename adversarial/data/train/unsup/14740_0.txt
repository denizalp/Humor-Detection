BF works nearby, found through the Yelp app to order delivery- arrived in a timely manner, ordered the fish cakes and tom kha soup, $22 with delivery fee.\n\nFishcakes were fine, might even say good.\nTom kha was watery instead of creamy. Soup tasted like spicy water.\n\nAfterward, got sick. I'll assume it was the \"soup\". \nNot going to bother giving this place another try, too many other Thai places in Vegas.
