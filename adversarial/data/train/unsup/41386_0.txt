We were looking(me and my friend) for another sushi restaurant in the area when we came across this restaurant, and we decided to check it out. The restaurant is nice and clean and surprisingly quiet. The menu has variety of options and selections to choose from and the food is good and decent for the price you're paying. \n\nHowever, the service level here is very bad at this restaurant and definitely needs improvement. \n\nThe waiter, was very short with us when we wanted to order and brought the soup and salad after a long time. As soon as we started with the appetizers, he brought the main food and took the appetizers away without asking us, it happened so sudden that we didn't even get to question it..we said it's fine the main dish is here anyways. \nThen he forgot to bring us our deserts and we had to ask him twice to get it...and finally when we asked for the bill, he disappeared. So we had to go directly to the counter and get the bill and pay right at the counter. \n\nI'm not sure what was going on with the waiter but that was not a good service. \n\nThe food overall was good so I might go back again but the waiters definitely need to improve their level of customer service.
