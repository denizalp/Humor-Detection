REALITY CHECK!!! Sorry People.\n\nAnother over rated chef owned restaurant in Phoenix, and another example of this not being a foodie town. \nAmbience is well done, not original, think a lower budget Chelsea Kitchen. Nice beamed ceiling, nice bar, nice community bar table, oh those LGO lamps in the windows. Nice but not original. \nFood was OK. Nothing that I tried was great, just good. I had the salmon, good not great. My friend had the burger. If you as a chef driven restaurant cannot figure out how to do a great burger, then do not put one on the menu. Hint, add fat to the meat. A dry burger on a basic bun, with frozen fries from a bag just will not cut it. \n\nThe menu reads well but in my opinion and on a first visit not what I would expect in quality.  All the 4 and 5 star reviews on here I would expect though in this Phoenix market. \n\nService was friendly. \n\nNote. If you are going to do an open kitchen then everything should be presentable, including the staff. Allowing the dishwasher to wrap himself in hefty trash bags so he does not get his clothes wet during his shift, and looking like some sort of space age homeless person is a bit odd visually.
