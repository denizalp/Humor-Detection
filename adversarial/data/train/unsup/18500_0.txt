At this rate with a Menchie's opening up in every neighbourhood, it feels a little silly to post yet another review. Like reviewing a Starbucks, this one is 65% about the shameless FTR grab. Yeah, you know it. \n\nAn excellent location, this Menchie's is directly across a Yoga studio and in the midst of coffee shops and bistros. Though not a single froyo shop is within walking distance. The closest one is Yogurty's located at Lawrence and Ave Rd. \n\nThis one is infested with children and kids in high school. I don't know what it is about Menchie's but it's definitely favoured by children. They had about 10 flavours of froyo; Green Tea, Peanut Butter, Frozen Hot Chocolate and Red Velvet amongst others. I wish they'd have some unsweetened options other than the Tart flavour (my favourite). The toppings at Menchie's are better than those of many other Froyos in the city. \n\nI was pretty surprised to overhear a cashier mention a loyalty card, as I've been to Menchie's many times but have yet to be offered one. I'd be here again when the kids aren't everywhere.
