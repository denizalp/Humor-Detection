I'm not sure this place should rightly be called a courthouse. \nIts more like an abortion clinic where justice gets rapidly miscarried on the daily.\nI've come here to pay traffic tickets, I've come here to witness people get sentenced. \nRecently I had to come here to testify\/answer questions because that car thief was finally arrested. I had to sit through a bunch of court cases. I was both amused and disgusted at how people got off for serious crimes.  People can get in trouble over the stupidest things. Yet, pretty much its a revolving door. \nYou commit fraud. well they will just give you a fine and send you on your way.\nNearly everyone gets the bare minimum punishment it seems. \nThe judge was way way way too lenient and dealt out some serious hardcore HORSE.DOOKIE. \n\nI saw a lot of sexism.\n\nA women beat her husband into a coma and she got 30 days in jail and anger management class. \n\nA man gave his wife a black eye and a swollen jaw and he got 1 year.\n\nIts unsettled me to see how the judge spoke kindly to some people and harshly to others. Some girl in handcuffs cracks a joke and the judge,marshals and legal representatives laugh. Some guy who was a minute late gets scolded by everyone.\n\nIf you believe the system works. I want to know what planet you live on.\n\nbut, okay okay. the tower has an awesome view of the city, they pay for parking, its sorta efficient, its pretty clean. I got paid for my time.  All in all its better to have a courthouse that sorta does its job then to have no courthouse at all.\nThey pay for parking which is nice. Eh, I can't hate them too much.\nOh Nevada you so krazy.
