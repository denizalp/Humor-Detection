This review is based soley from my happy hour experience there, not a dining experience.\n\nA friend and I went a few Friday's ago to try them out for happy hour. I was excited about the specials ($5 cocktails, $4 glasses of wine, $5 tapas), especially for a fancy place like this in the heart of the cultural district. \n\nLet me tell you: the pear sangria was life changing. The atmosphere was elegant, and the place is beautifully decorated. The staff was very friendly, upbeat, and knowledgable about all aspects of the menu. The bartenders had a good rapor with their regulars while also being warm and inviting to newcomers, which is always a plus in my book.\n\nOne thing that took me by surprise is that it wasn't more crowded. When we left around 6:30 the restaurant maybe had 8-10 tables sat, and there was plenty of empty spots at the bar. For me that's not a bad thing--I don't like to be standing shoulder to shoulder with 40 year old brogrammers talking their heads off about the latest Pirates game--but I'm concerned that this place won't be around too much longer if there isn't a steady flow of patronage. \n\nEither way, this place is added to my list of favorite deal spots.
