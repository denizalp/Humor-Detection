4 shredded beef tacos with cheese. That's my son's standard order every Taco Tuesday night. This Zaba's is right in our 'hood, so the staff already knows what to make as soon as they see my son.  I like the tasty brown rice as a side dish and will usually have 2 or 3 chicken tacos on corn tortillas with pico de gallo and the corn salsa.  I've had the veggie burrito a couple of times and that thing is huge!  The food is always fresh and made to your specifications.  Delicioso!
