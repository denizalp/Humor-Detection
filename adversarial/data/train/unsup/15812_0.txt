Tried them for a second time after a bad customer service experience 2 years ago. got mis-served by the very same passive aggressive repair guy...talking to his his back as he walks away, I'm too busy! he says, telling me I'm not welcome in the store and he has more important things to do. Why am I \ntalking to your back, I say to his back..he turns and now aggressive, says \"I remember you from 2 years ago...Jerald!\"\nYes I didn't get what I paid for then either, which is, common politeness, such as, can I get back to you in 5? you know, something reasonable like that.\nSo now, after being publicly shamed as a put off for my assertion of my right to get what I pay for, I am probably not coming back, I mean it was in front of the entire store, staff customers, all looking on...and I paid good money for this experience......still not sure why.....but twice burned is enough for me.
