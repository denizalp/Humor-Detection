This is my first time staying at a hotel in Las Vegas in years.  I usually stay at a Timeshare.  However, I don't remember hotels having such poor air filtration systems. From the moment I stepped foot into this hotel, all I could smell was smoke.  So if you suffer with asthma and sinus problems, and are allergic to mold, and house dust, don't stay here.  \n\nI attended a convention that was hosted by the hotel so I was busy from the time I arrived. I wanted to complain, but I had no time or energy to complain when I was steady on the go with 2 small kids.  When I did check out of the hotel, the front desk clerks were not the happiest, most approachable or personable.  I didn't waste my time asking for a manager, I had a flight to catch and being bothered with that negative energy was not at the priority of my list.\n\nThe room I stayed in was old, smelly and humid in the colder month of January.  My 2 small kids were with me as well.  They are 2 and 8 years old.  I remember my daughter complaining about her nose and throat because of the smoke.  \n\nUpon our return home, I now have a sinus infection and so does my 2 year old daughter.  So now one week after my stay at the hotel with poor air quality, I am still paying for it with our doctor visits and prescription medicine.
