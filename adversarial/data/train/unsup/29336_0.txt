Best tour company,  we got picked up at our designated hotel on time which took us to baileys where we changed buses.  The bus was clean and snacks provided.  We did the south rim tour and stopped at the Hoover dam for photo. Then on to kingman for a break nd snack. Next to Williams where we had Italian buffet which was good. Then on to the canyon where we had 3 hours to explore. Next was a dinner stop and got back to hotel by 915. Great day but it is long. Also they have a tv on board and power outlet to charge you electronics.  Would def do again.  Paul was a great tour guide
