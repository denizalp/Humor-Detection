Our one year anniversary dinner! Made reservation at 8, changed to 9:30, still requested a window seat with Bellagio fountain and strip views, host girl was so nice, gave us a window seat before 9:30, great job! I had a specialty cocktail at the bar, red velvet, it was so yummy! Sweet but strong, liked it a lot. \n\nI can't even describe how amazing the views were.... I had photos of that, please check them out! Our waiter greeted us very friendly, gave us wine list first, expensive bottles of wine, red, white, sparkling, I didn't see one bottle less than $70, we ordered bottle of champagne around $100, it was so good! We took time to look through the menu while sipping on our champagne. \n\nTheir complimentary bread was a big tray, server carry it around for dining people to choose what kind of bread we want, they gave us a creamy soup as dipping sauce,  butter too. I didn't like the cold bread and soup, but it was a great dipping sauce, bread tasted so delicious with it.\n\nOur amazing food:\nTrio of American Caviar, Golden Whitefish, American Sturgeon, Salmon Roe, 28 grams each, with Creme Fraiche, Chives, Blinis and Toast: they were heavenly delicious! Beautiful presentation! We enjoyed every single bit of it very much\n\nCream of mushrooms soup, wild rice galette, crispy shallots: so delicious, soup was very flavorful\n\nMaine lobster salad, roasted butter squash, wilted kale, old cider vinaigrette: the kale was so yummy! The lobster was very tender and flavorful, loved loved it! \n\nFricasse of escargot, sweetbreads, fennel, farm raised poached egg, Pinot noir jus: the escargot was so tender, but not very flavorful, the poached egg was perfect, I still loved it cause I wanted something light as entree for that night. \n\nChar broiled filet Mignon, red wine sauce: hubby asked for extra red wine sauce, he said the filet was one of the best he has ever had for a very very long time! He absolutely loved the red wine sauce!\n\nGratinee creamed spinach and mushroom: too creamy to our liking, but still yummy\n\nWe didn't order desert, the portions were really big for French cuisine! But the restaurant gave us chocolate mousse for our anniversary! They even put chocolate \"happy anniversary\" on the plate.... Aww... It was just too sweet and beautiful! \n\nI was so happy for our memorable anniversary dinner, with beautiful views from our seat, over the top service, tasty champagne, delicious food, what more could I ask?.... It was just amazing! $350 dinner was very well worth it....\n\nA perfect restaurant for romantic dinner date or special occasions!
