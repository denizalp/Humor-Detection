Poor customer service from the service department today. Called to ask if I could bring the car and have the 'service required' reminder reset (they performed the routine maintenance a month ago and failed to reset the reminder).  Was told to come in and the reset would take about ten minutes. Was greeted at the service entrance by the greeter; she informed a service advisor I was waiting and suggested I wait in the customer lounge. After waiting 40 minutes without seeing the service advisor I asked the greeter to pull my car out so I could leave. I asked to speak to the service manager but he was also out of his office and after waiting another five minutes I expressed my disappointment with the 'deputy' service manager.\n\nBMWs need a lot of service and repair so you'll be here a lot if you own\/buy one. Be prepared to spend a lot of time waiting and dealing with people who treat you as if they are grudgingly doing you a favor while charging you $200 per hour.
