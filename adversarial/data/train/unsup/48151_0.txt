Great ribs....meaty, tender, great smoke taste and a little heavy on the sauce.  Next time I'll get them dry with sauce on the side.  The sauce is delicious bet like a lot of people I prefer to start dry and add sauce.  The French fries were hot and crispy and the baked beans okay but the ribs are the real deal.
