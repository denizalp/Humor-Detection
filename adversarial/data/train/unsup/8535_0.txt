Filipino food isn't the healthiest thing you could eat but is it good? Yes! I'm half-Filipino so, I think I have the right to be a Filipino food snob. My mom, lola (grandma), and my titas (aunties by blood or my mom's friends) were all cooking machines with an arsenal of fresh ingredients, serving Pinoy dishes at the rate of 5 dishes per minute. Their main goal in life is to feed everyone...all the time! We have family in Manila that frown upon karaoke which is why you won't hear me on the Magic Mic - not that you would want to anyway! LOL.\n\nIf I'll have heart disease\/ diabetes (which are common among Filipinos), it better be worth it. They have lechon kawali, crispy pata, kare-kare, lumpia, lumpiang Shanghai, garlic rice, adobo, halo-halo, different kinds of pancit, laing, toci\/tapsi\/longsi-log, etc. People have complained about the lack of circulation and the heat in this place - something I cannot relate to since my family gets me food to-go for me. \n\nLechon Kawali:\nFried pork belly. It's a bit confusing how they have \"tonkatsu (fried pork belly)\" on their menu - this might have been a lost in translation moment. The skin is crisp and simply delicious. I didn't like the sauce it came with which I think is made in house. I prefer Mang Tomas. 3.5\/5\n\nLumpiang Shanghai:\nFried egg roll with meat and veggies. This is one of the Filipino party staples. You dip  it in sweet and sour sauce and hear the crunch as you chomp on lumpia. Their version is not greasy at all which is an absolutely good thing. 4.5\/5\n\nChicken Adobo:\nI can only eat my mom's adobo. She's the only one who makes it the way I like it. People get butthurt when I don't like their version but oh, well...\nWe ordered this for my friend who does not eat pork. However, they gave us pork adobo. My friend was left hangry and bad times were had by all. 1\/5
