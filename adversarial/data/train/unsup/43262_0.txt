West Flamingo Animal Hospital treats my babies as if they were THEIR babies. Each time I have gone there for different things, I was NEVER disappointed.  I felt that my baby was so cared for, even though they cannot speak to tell you what is wrong, and the Doctors job is much harder because of that, they are AMAZING!
