The food tasted A-Ok but I'm not in a rush to go back. I ordered the Lamb Shank  ($21) along with the Basmati Rice and the Shirazi Salad ($5.50). \n\nI thought the lamb was decent, but it didn't make my top ten list. Pars gives you so much rice, that you can have a party of about 50 people at your house and it would be enough for 50 people. Why too much rice, more lamb please. I guess I'm not a fan of Basmati Rice. I also had the Shirazi Salad, which I thought was very tasty and the best part of my Pars experience. In fact, I make this salad at home all the time now. The salad has diced tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and is sprinkled with lemon juice and olive oil. \n\nThe total tab, which included tip for 4 people was $140.
