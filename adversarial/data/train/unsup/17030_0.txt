If you've only got two people sitting at your bar at 9pm on a Tuesday, perhaps it would behoove the bartender to be nice when two new people walk in. -Apparently that is not the business model at the Gold Mine. I usually try and find some positives to post about a place, but I cannot even come up with something nice to say beyond the fact that we didn't have to wait 20 minutes, like the other reviewer, for a skunky Heineken.
