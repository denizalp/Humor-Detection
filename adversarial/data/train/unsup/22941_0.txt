I must admit, I skimmed a few of the other reviews of this place and people just don't get it. This is NOT Mexican food; it is food with an influence from New Mexico! Mexico is a country south of our border. New Mexico is actually a U.S. state with it's own flavors going on unique to that region! Do not rate this place based on what you think Mexican food should taste like; IT'S NOT MEXICAN FOOD! Whew, okay, I had to get that off my chest.\n\nI've been here a few times, and it's always been great. Most recently I was here a couple weeks ago with my family. My mom ordered some sort of steak taco things (I'm pretty sure they're not called that though) and they were delicious. The quality of the beef was apparent in every bite. Very flavorful. [And yes, I took multiple bites from her plate. And, no, I'm not the guy you want to sit next to at dinner.] My dad & I ordered the same thing: this green chile stew from the appetizer menu. Very delicious! It's hearty enough to be a meal...which we did. My sis won the lottery though; she ordered the mac & cheese. Wow! That was delicious! There was some sort of southwestern twist to it, I forget, but it was SO DARN GOOD!! Extremely smooth and creamy and decadent. I will order that next time for sure.\n\nOverall, don't hesitate to stop by this place. Great food.Good service. Interesting building with great outdoor seating. You really can't go wrong here.
