Dosa Heaven\n\nArun gave me a heads up on this place. Italians need the code to get in and I was given the secret knock, knock knock....wait then knock\n\nFamily owned by a brother and sister who work hard to please their customers and with a serious Dosa\n\nThey offer over 50 of them......\n\nBut wait....wallllyooooo....whats is that?\n\nA Dosa is a rice batter based crepe like pancake served with various toppings like Sambhar or coconut chutneys.\n\nIts a vegetarian offering for those that do not eat mutton\n\nDo not waste your effort on the measly plain dishes but go full taste bud alert for these offerngs from the Dosa gods...\n\nPaneer Masala Dosa...good but boring\n\nChile garlic Marsala Dosa.........the tongue will sing for you\n\nVada Sambhar Dosa .....\n\nKaraikudi Masal Dosa.....whew it is the hottest of them all....wipe your face 7 times after this one.....you do need a towel\n\nOrder the Mango lassi to wash the heat away\n\nBest to just ask Shiva for a sampler and go with a gang so you can munch on several types and maybe take a proper approach mild to wild...with over 50 to choose from the Dosa lover cannot ever go wrong at this place!
