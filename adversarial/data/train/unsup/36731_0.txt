This is simply the most enjoyable place in Phoenix. The wine selection is good and unusual, the ambiance is unmatched   wity the beautiful outdoor patio and the service is outstanding, Tim is a delight as a waiter and is a major reason we have been repeat customers. The bruschetta is fresh and original. Everyone said you have to go to Postino's, which we did, but it was very second rate to Bombero's in all areas, service (particularly), wine selection, and definitely ambiance. Bombero's gets my vote every time. Make sure you request Tim as a server. He makes the experience unforgettable,
