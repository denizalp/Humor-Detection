Eden's Grill is, without question, home to some delicious, homemade Middle Eastern food. Not since going to the houses of friends of my father many years ago have I tasted food like this. \n\nI should clarify...\n\nThere are great Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix, but a lot of the places have food that tastes like restaurant\/deli food. This is not bad at all...restaurant food can be very delicious. But, then there are places that serve food the way \"Mom\" makes it. It's that special little bit of love that I'm talking about. In the case of Eden's Grill, \"Mom\" IS making the food. Well, not my mom, but the mom of the great waitress that served my table today (So sorry I didn't catch her name.). \n\nFor our lunch, Bobby T and I went for a side of hummus and baba, a gyro plate and a beef kebab sultani plate. The hummus and baba were solid, loaded with garlic and topped generously with olive oil. The gyro plate was also solid, the meat wasn't too dry and the veggies were definitely fresh. Above the previous two menu items stood the beef kebab sultani. Each bite had the two of us smiling because it was so good. The kebab meat had flavor infused into the core of each piece...never did I chew a bite and not get the flavor of the marinade. It was awesome. We also got to taste some of their hot dolma. I have only been served hot dolma at three restaurants, and each time they have been great; definitely worth trying if you're a dolma fan.\n\nThere is one last thing that we tried that everyone needs to come to Eden's Grill for though, and that is the rice - basmati w\/ golden raisins and chopped almonds. The rice especially tasted like it was made with love and not just by a chef. I still crave it as I write this (good thing there was plenty left over). \n\nI'm excited about this \"new\" find for me, and I think other Yelpers should be as well.
