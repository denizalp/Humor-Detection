You want a dive bar?  This is definitely a dive bar specializing in cheap drinks and second hand smoke.\n\nThe first time I came here I thought \"OK- this is a nice old school Vegas experience\"  but the next time I started to notice some of the same things:\n\n- Creepy people always try and talk to you here\n- Your clothes will STENCH of smoke\n- Do they ever clean any of the surfaces?  Seriously a wet rag would go a long way.\n\nYes they have cheap drinks and dollar hot dogs, but I know another place that has that too... Costco.  And the only people who talk to you there might be a soccer mom in line asking what aisle you found the giant bad of dried mango.
