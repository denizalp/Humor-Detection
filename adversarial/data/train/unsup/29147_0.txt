Favorite pizza place in Tempe since 1998. They have great specialty pizzas.  Some of my favorites: chicken parm, cheese & tomato, and plain cheese.  Many of my friends love the baked potato but I haven't tried that one.  There's also bbq chicken, taco, and more. The guys who opened this place are from Boston and it's a true East coast pizza place. I try to get there every time I'm in Tempe.
