This place is so great I had to post my very first yelp review ever! The croissants are little pieces of art and are the best I have ever had!! The baked pies are just the right size and packed with filling! I walked in with my two little boys who wanted to try the colorful cosmic croissant ever since I brought home the ad. Once we walked in, however, they both quickly spotted the double chocolate chip cookies and went with that. I was a tad disappointed because I wanted that colorful croissant too. Everything is baked to order including the cookies. As we waited for our sandwiches and cookies a very sweet man came out of the kitchen with a cosmic croissant fresh from the oven. He had overhead our conversation about it being the draw to come in and he wanted us to try one on the house! That's customer service people! Great food, great staff and smiles on my little ones faces! We will be loyal customers for sure!
