I came here with a regular over the weekend and really enjoyed it.  Granted, I wasn't sober when I arrived and surely didn't remain sober while there.  But, on a Saturday, when the work is done - there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nThe bartender, who was fantastic, recommended the Cuban sandwich - which was on special.  My buddy swore up and down that the bacon bleu cheese burger was spot on.  So, like any respectable men would do, we shared half and half.  The only negative on the burger was that the bun wasn't worthy of every other ingredient.  Some times the meat and cheese are so perfect, that an ordinary bun takes away from the delish factor.  The Cuban, while good, was very messy.  When sandwiches are finished in a press, I expect there to be minimal mess.  That said, the pork inside was roasted to perfection and the pickles were tasty.\n\nAdd to this a couple of delicious micro-brews and it was a very nice surprise.  I will be back, and would recommend trying this joint to anyone in the area!
