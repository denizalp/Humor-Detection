While staying at the Venetian, my bachelorette crew came here for brunch. There was some confusion about getting a table at the beginning. The hostesses were saying that if we sat down in the lounge and ordered food, we wouldn't be able to move due to some policy?\n\nEither way, we got seated in their private room behind the wine case and had a very pleasant experience. We don't remember the server's name, but to the wonderful lady who served us on July 9, 2016, you are awesome!\n\nWe started off the meal with coffees and Maple-Glazed Bacon Donuts. A complementary combo. I also got myself a mimosa, which had more champagne than juice, but it was sweeter, so it worked.\n\nThe Fried Green Tomato BLT is open-faced and unique. The flavor is subtle, fresh, and savory. We also got the special, which was Biscuits & Gravy with fried chicken, bacon, and egg on top. While the biscuits & gravy aren't anything to write home about, the fried chicken is juicy and the over-easy egg perfectly runny. The whole combination is filling and comforting.\n\nWe also got the Iceberg Wedge because it seemed refreshing. Although the iceberg lettuce itself is nice and cool, everything else is fairly heavy. It didn't matter though, as I still polished off the plate after it made its rounds. The house-made buttermilk ranch should be a guilty pleasure.\n\nOverall, ask the servers for recommendations. The bachelor crew was also here at another table and didn't care for the Deviled Eggs for example.\n\nWhat an entirely satisfying meal to quash the hangovers we all obtained the previous night!
