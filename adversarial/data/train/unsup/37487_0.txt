out with hubby and not really hungry but with time to kill... and stumbled upon this gem in chinatown! we both luvd it! ordered their chicken wings with their supreme sauce and for me it's just the perfect combo of sweet and spicy! just what i missed\nabout \"bonchon\"... a little disappointed with their sweet potato fries though, it's not what you'd expect as the typical american sweet potato fries, but not bad enough to ruin the night, just wont order it again. this will definitely be another place i'd be craving for :) another plus is that their interior design is cozy and our server Woong was nice and friendly even if it's almost midnight :)
