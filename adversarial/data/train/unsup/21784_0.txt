Let me begin by saying that the food is good, but I had a creepy, unsettling experience today at the lunch buffet.  \nI entered and was given a seat.  As I went to the buffet, one of the employees got behind me in line and watched me like a hawk.  When he realized that I noticed what he was doing, he pretended to fuss with a drawer in the buffet stand.  \nWhen I went back for seconds, he didn't even pretend to hide the fact that he was stalking me at close range. He rushed up and got close behind  me in line again until I was done. \n\nThere is nothing to steal from the buffet, so I don't understand the whole thing.  The only thing I could think of is that I was the only non-Indian in the place, and he mistrusted me for that reason. I paid my bill, and promised myself that I wouldn't come back.
