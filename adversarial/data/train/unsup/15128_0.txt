The only reason this place gets a 2 is because they booked one good band for the one day I happened to be there.  Last time I was there it felt like a meat market that judges by eye and not a scale. Sure you have some reference point despite the loud music but not a good one. I felt a rather odd tapping at my shoulder when I was there. I'd turn around expecting to see a friend, but no one was there. The taping continued, each time with more urgency. Still no one there. Finally amidst the pool of 21 year olds I noticed a girl across the room was motioning for me to come to her. Was it her tapping on my shoulder? Must be my soulmate right? Amazing how all these realizations could occur despite 20 feet between us and all that music. I figure if she didn't have the guts to actually talk to me instead of running away each time she either wasn't right for me, or simply lacked any depth whatsoever. To tequila ranch may you continue to offer me the conceptual space to put words to what's wrong with society!
