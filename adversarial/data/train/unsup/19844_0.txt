Smells like heaven, priced like hell.  Still, for a special treat, a birthday cake, an elegant gift, or a stocking stuffer, get thy butt over to Pusateri's.  It's claustrophobic, and you may faint at the price of the organic mangoes, but it's... nice.  Really nice.  I love going in.  \nNB: avoid for 24 hrs. before any long weekend, when the Muskoka-bound cottagers descend and pick the store's carcass clean.
