Very slow service. I'm sure they must be short staffed. Waited 2 hours to pick up glasses when was told they were going to be done the day before. Took 2.5 hours to order them the first time. While here, they lost someone else's glasses and couldn't find another's. They need to have bathroom cleaned. Glasses are cheap and faster than getting them elsewhere though. You are buying the glasses off the wall- so if the paint is coming off the frame, that's what you get.
