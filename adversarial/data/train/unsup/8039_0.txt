I had one task. To purchase a Raiders hoodie for my +1. Unbeknownst to me, I chose one that I thought he'd like until the sales lady pointed out that the style was for a female. Wah wahhh! My bad!! Shhh. Don't tell him!!\n\nAnyway, 5 stars for the service and the merchandise at the Raider Image! If I were a Raiders fan, I'd purchase that first hoodie for myself. Ha! So, I asked. What is the most popular hoodie for men? She pointed out a few things, then finally showed me the new releases. Bam! Found a winner winner for a chicken dinner.\n\nSo, ladies and gents. Once you enter the store, the left side is merch for the females and right side for the males. The store itself isn't huge, but there's a nice selection of jerseys, hats, shirts, jackets, accessories and more. I'm sure it's all eye-candy for them Raiders fans!\n\nThey didn't have any special wrapping or gift bag for my purchase, but they did offer the reusable tote for a small fee of $2.99. Perfect!\n\nBe sure to check out the Raiders Preview Center first and then gear up for 2020 by picking up some Silver and Black merchandise! There's something for the entire family here at Town Square!
