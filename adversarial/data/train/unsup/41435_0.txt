Went with a group of 9 of us. They said if we all sit together there would be an 18% gratuity added even though it was 4 different checks. So we sat at 2 separate tables. The food was average at best. The steak was very tough and gristly. Then the server came over whilst we were eating and started demanding to see all of our receipts for the food. As we were not all at the same table the receipts did not match the number of people at the table and she would not leave it alone. I was just about to ask for the manager then she went away. Not fun.
