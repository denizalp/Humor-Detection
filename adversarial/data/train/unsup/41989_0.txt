Gah I hate this place. Such cute clothes, shoes, and purses. We went in about an hour before they closed today and were treated warmly and with respect. They grabbed the stuff we were carrying a set up a room for us, which I really appreciate. The ladies in the women's department and the teen's department were all very friendly and helpful. I would give them five stars but I didn't enjoy how I was treated in the handbag department. I felt like all they wanted was to get me to buy something instead of genuinely wanting to help me. Besides that I was happy with this location overall, and I look forward to spending huge amounts of cash here in the future. My apologies in advance to my wallet.
