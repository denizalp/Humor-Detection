Hmm...am I just as much a lemming as the rest who are enchanted by this place? Perhaps. I had planned to give three stars...but that didn't seem right. After all, Cleveland owes Melt a bit of gratitude, as it's placing our culinary corridor more prominently on the map. \n\nWhy? I'm not sure. I've never been a fan of grilled cheese. Apparently thousands of folks are though...some enough to permanently display advertisement of the joint on their flesh...at a price lower than magnet-ed ads on motor vehicles. But on to the review-\n\nThe wait? What wait? We walked in, made a reservation for 6, were told 1 1\/2 hours, turned around and immediately sat down at the bar. Where you can order food.\n\nI had to leave early, so that's exactly what I did. You'd have to be nuts to order a steaming grilled cheese sandwich in the summer, so I went with the peanut butter & banana with cream cheese. It was pretty good! It had a fruit preserve dipping sauce that cooled it down a bit. Add that to frosty fountain soda, and it was a pretty good meal. \n\nIt'd take me AT LEAST 15-20 minutes to re-create that in my kitchen, so I was impressed.\n\nThey have a ton of beers, and seems like a nice place to hang out. The bartenders were fun...however, the staff at the front desk didn't appear to care whether we were there or not. Which, I guess after hearing \"two HOURS?? Are you CRAZY??\" 100 times a day, you might see that effect.\n\nSo, everything was fine. I was happy to go and check out another Cleveland institution. But, not spectacular. Though reasonably priced. My friend who stayed said the five of them ate for under $50 (not including the bar tab they settled before hitting the table).\n\nBut, not because of the wait. It's because...well...it's grilled cheese people. Chill.
