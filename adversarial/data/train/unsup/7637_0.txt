This show was horrible!  First they placed us at a random table with people we didn't know and our back to the stage, it was so awkward.  We got up and moved even though the server said we couldn't.  The food was not great and drinks were not even included in the ridiculous price for the tickets.  I had read the YELP reviews and was excited to see this show, but it was gawd awful!  The singers were horrible and the lady singer needed to eat badly. I wanted to offer her my dinner since she looked like she hadn't eating in a month.   The show was just plain boring and we ended up leaving half way through the show because i could listed to the horrible Elvis singer another second. I was supper annoyed that I had just paid so much money for this lame excuse of a show and mediocre dinner.
