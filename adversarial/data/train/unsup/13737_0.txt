This is just a warning regarding Bergners 50% off coupon that they emailed to people.  It's a piece of junk.  The only thing you can use this worthless coupon on is their junk.  Like those stupid little thoughtless gifts they offer this time of year.  For example, a minature boxing ring with boxers that you push a button and they hit each other.  Who needs that???\n\nDo not waste your time, like I did, shopping at Bergners thinking you will get 50% off $100.00 purchase.  I spent 2 hours looking for anything worthwhile that the coupon would apply to and it's impossible!!!!!
