This was one of the first places I ate after moving to Phoenix, and I must say I was impressed.  Slightly overpriced, but delicious none-the-less. I've never eaten in the restaurant, only ordered take-out so I cannot comment on the service (hence 4 stars).\n\nFor all you fans out there....the map does not show the correct location for the store.  It used to be near the Wal-Mart off Elliot and I-10, but has since moved to 1805 East Elliot Road #115, off McClintock and Elliot.
