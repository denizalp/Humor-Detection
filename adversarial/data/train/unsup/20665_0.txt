This your typical Burger King fast food joint with their regular brand menu and special offerings. As an occasional junk food eater I've over the years dutifully tried everything on their menu at least once. This is one location that stands out in the general area of very good - in general.  So as to make it easy to gauge each of these eateries, when I do try them, I've devised a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being outright down and dirty nasty, and 5 being the best a fast food joint can be! I gage: cleanliness; service; product quality and consistency; convenience; accessibility; taste and the personnel's attitude and customer service level. This place scores 4.0 of 5. I may come back here and do recommend it!
