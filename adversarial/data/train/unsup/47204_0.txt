Ordered delivery for the first time. Was pleasantly surprised. The food was tasty and still hot. Got to us within 40 minutes. They were very polite when taking the order. 4 stars because the sweet and sour sauce given on the side was a little runny for my liking. .  I ordered the beef chop suey combo b. It was very good. Came with fried rice , sweet and sour chicken , egg roll and a fried shrimp.
