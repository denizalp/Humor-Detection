OMG WHAT A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! I was taking a friend their for their first time and what am embarrassment we got their right before it opened and when they did i walked to the counter we ordered two bowls (they call them sides) and the fork had a shitty attitude then it came up to$19.04 with 2med drinks I'm like wth REALLY!!! So we move over to where you get your drinks and the syrup was out on EVERYTHING, so i told the rude cashier guy he came and looked and said ok and went back to his register I'm like WTH so i told another then they got one flavor to work so I just delt with that then we went outside to eat realize the tables and chairs were filthy so we go back inside every table and chair had food on it we're like damn they open up an establishment without cleaning it first so nasty! And the food was not impressive at all either it was just a bad experience overall I won't ever go back to that one again I'll stick to the one on Sunset I give that one a 10.
