Meh. Trying wayyy too hard to be cool and copy LA. For some reason they think they have a right to charge more than every other place in phx for a drink and serve you in a plastic cup if you're hanging out in the room that has the band (by the way, this is the only room that has decent ventilation). \n\nI look forward to the next place that offers games & drinks in downtown and doesnt make you walk thru a dirty alleyway just because they want to be oh so edgy.
