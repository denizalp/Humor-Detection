I recently took my parents to Spoon for a special \"thank-you\" dinner. The chef's tasting menu was absolutely amazing. From the playful soup amuse bouche, to the rich pork and rabbit ragu and the incredibly flavorful prime strip steak with foie gras, each course impressed us. You can really tell that the chef is passionate about, and takes pride in, his craft. Drink pairings were really well thought out and well executed and service was top-notch. The whole crew really made this special dinner an amazing experience.
