If you want real Chinese food then you probably should go to China. I've eaten what we Americans consider to be \"Chinese food\" all across the country and it all pretty much has the same general flare to it. It's usually fried, comes with a side of duck sauce and gives you a stomach ache afterwords. Mandarin Gourmet technically is no different then any other Americanized version of Chinese food however the service really sets it apart.\n\nI have been going here since college and never had bad service or bad food. The staff always is very friendly and sadly they recognize me when I come in. The prices are comparable to any other sit down Chinese establishment. \n\nThe best time to go is lunch. No matter how full the building is you will be out in 30 minutes and that's if you take your time. No matter what I've ordered I get my meal in minutes. It's kind of unbelievable.\n\nAll things considered I have no reason eat Chinese anywhere else downtown. While most Chinese food is pretty much the same this place really stands out.
