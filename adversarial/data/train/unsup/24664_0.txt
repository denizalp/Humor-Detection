This was the highlight of our trip to Vegas. I love this show and always wanted to stop by the building and see where it all takes place. I was very aware what was to be, a line of fans to get in, no actual pawn stars on site and a huge tourist trap inside to sell you a ton of merchandise. Who cares, it was still freakin awesome to be in the famous store where I lay my lazy butt on the couch and watched countless of hours of the show. We bought a magnet for $8, which cost them fifty cents to make, but its ok I still had a great time looking at all the over priced goods and have good memories of finally seeing the place in person.
