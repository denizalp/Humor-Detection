Passengers Cafe is appropriately named, as it's in the Cleveland hostel! This cafe lets travelers know that the coffee scene in Cleveland is no joke! They have local food from Cleveland staples like Lucky's cafe and Cleveland Bagel Co. Sadly, I forgot to ask where their beans are roasted. But I'm sure I'll be back soon to ask the friendly owner. The BEST part is that you can enjoy an amazing view to go with your amazing coffee. Their rooftop patio is stunning.... Get energized and experience Cleveland at it's finest. \n\n*For all the yogi's out there: The owner's wife hosts yoga classes on the rooftop too!
