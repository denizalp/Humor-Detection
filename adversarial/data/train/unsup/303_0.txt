I will start out by saying you definitely get more than enough food. The portions are large. The menu items are reasonably priced and I was pleased with the quality and taste of the food.\n\nWe tried the Chicken Katsu Ramen, Miso Ramen, Sea Food Yakisoba, and Veggie Yakisoba. Everything was excellent. The service was great and the restaurant appeared to be very clean. I definitely recommend that you stop in and try this place. I will be back!
