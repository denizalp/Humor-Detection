Worst korean bbq I have ever eaten!\nEver since the new owners replaced Chingu, the place has been a mess.\nWaitress could not speak english and she did not ask her other coworkers to help translate, nor did any of the other waitresses bother to help until we finally managed to flag someone else down.\nOnly half of the grilling meats on the menu were delivered to our table. And the ones that did, you could clearly tell they were still frozen\/half frozen.\nThe chicken was mushy, the squid was still frozen solid and the pork belly was sliced badly (the thickness was like the thickness of a chocolate bar) and they were not mariniated.\nWe came here on a Saturday evening, you would think they would be prepared!!\nExtremely disappointed and would never come back.
