If I were to write an accurate review of the food and how I felt afterwards, it would look like Helen Keller's twitter account; \"UNGHHHHHHHHH CHARRRRFFFFFFF uUNNGNNGGGgggg.\"\n\nConsider that the review I really want to write, but for the sake of information, here's another review.\n\nMy 2 friends and I got the Wagyu beef prix fixe menu. This came with 3 appetizers; buffalo mozzarella with roasted red peppers and hazelnuts in a balsamic vinaigrette, hawaiian prawns, and a delicious caesar salad.\n\nThe main course - the steak - was wagyu beef served in 3 different cuts. We went with the chef's recommendation, strip steak, new york steak, and ribeye steak. The beef altogether was over 2 pounds of meat. Steak was served with shallots, and the sides were shiitaake mushrooms, hen of the woods mushrooms, and japanese white mushrooms. We also switched out the mashed potatoes for french fries, and got a roasted corn side. Delish!\n\nDessert put the whole meal over the top. We got raspberry, watermelon, peach, and cherry sorbet. Also got a peach cobbler with peach sorbet on it, a \"liquid\" chocolate cake served with cookies and cream ice cream, another interesting peach dish, and a bowl of fresh fruit.\n\nAltogether with tax and tip, the meal came to $180 per person. I definitely feel like I got my money's worth, although I'm still having trouble breathing from the amount of food that I consumed. I'm going to take a nap and then have a steak baby.\n\nFive stars, don't miss this place.
