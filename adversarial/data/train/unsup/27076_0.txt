Make sure you check, double check and triple check your contract with them regardless of what your reservation or what you verbally tell them you want. I reserved 4 days for \"$14.99\" a day. No liability, no roadside or any extra amenities. My total the first time came out just over $100. When I returned I found out they had charged me for every extra option they had and it came out to be over $340. Trying to call them, leave messages, email, etc and I got no response until the third day. I've rented a lot of cars in my life, dealt with most the companies and they've always been very accommodating. I implore you not to go through these people as they falsely advertise and try to trick you into paying 3 times the initial quoted cost. Look at their 1.5 star review, read the comments, be aware what you're getting into and know it's not as cheap as they advertise nor is it even connected to the convenience of the airport.
