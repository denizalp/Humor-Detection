I like the atmosphere that this sports bar offer. Its huge spacious area can accomodate 1500 people. The staff were friendly and accomodating. It's free access to those who want to watch the races and games. During the March Madness it is usually packed so better be here early to get a good seat. We prefer the balcony section that allows you to see the entire screen so if you are anticipating for the resulta of more than one game you have no worries. The only con though is that their deli cafe is far from the audotorium and thy have fixed menu during busy times.
