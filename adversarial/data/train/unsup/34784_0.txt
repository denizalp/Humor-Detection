Delicious, friendly, and spacious. \n\nFrom the outside this location doesn't look very large, but actually there is plenty of space further inside the Panera with dozens of tables and booths. Coming here even at lunchtime it wasn't too full.\n\nThis Panera definitely seems to suffer though during peak lunch hours. It can be impossible to find open parking spots in their Boca Park location, especially with neighboring Sambalatte\/Grimaldi's\/Cheesecake\/etc clogging up the lot. Service was also slower than at other Panera's I've been to.
