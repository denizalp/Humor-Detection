Dear Air Canada,\nI know you've got a good safety record, and odds are that you will not lose my bags but why oh why are your flight attendants so scoldy?  Especially on the long haul flights (which presumably are sought after by senior staff), these ladies and gentlemen tend to treat the passengers, i.e. paying customers, like misbehaving preschoolers.   I am fed up with their sighs, their withering looks and the \"sit down and be quiet\" attitude.\n\nI am a rule-following, go-along-to-get-along person but I leave Air Canada flights feeling chastised for asking the simplest things.\nMe: \"May I turn on my laptop?\"\nAC: \"Can't you see the seatbelt light is on??\"\n\nMe: \"Are there any seats available besides this one beside the screaming child?\"\nAC: \"I can't give up a crew seat for you.\" \n\nIt's okay to say no if you can't accommodate my request, just don't make me feel like an idiot for asking the question.\n\nAccording to my most recent (daily) spam from your airline, I've flown nearly 40,000 miles with Air Canada this year and probably double that with other airlines.  These others (Porter, Avianca, SAS, KLM, Westjet, even tiny Cape Air) offer much superior customer service.  Air Canada has left its passengers feeling so shell-shocked, that when we fly these other lines, we're embarrassingly grateful for the least little bit of kindness.\n\nStop scolding us and quit telegraphing whatever grievances you have with your employer to the passenger.  We know your job is difficult and you probably are given too few resources to do it well, but the passenger is not the enemy. \n\nSincerely, \n\nTired of the flying the grumpy skies
