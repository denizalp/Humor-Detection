I do not want to waste my time on this place, so let's make this short.\n\nThey have serious sanitation problems in their kitchen, and the food is terribly bad. The place only offers food in the takeout bag after 9pm but you can still sit there and eat nevertheless. The tables are never clean, and the garbage cans are never emptied.\n\nAvoid this place at all cost.
