Came here after a Pilates class at North Movement Studio. The instructor sampled a few of their delicious juices for us to try and I absolutely loved the kale kraze! They had a few juices pre-made and available for purchase in the fridge. So I end up purchasing a 500ml Kale kraze and 250ml green magic. Both were great. I asked for samples for a few other ones I wanted to try. The sour shower gets an honorable mention. The beets were nice but I found it a bit sour from the lemon and grapefruit. But if you don't mind slight sourness I would definitely recommend it!\n\nIf I lived in the area I would come back more often however the kind owner did say that they deliver anywhere in Toronto so that is pretty cool and id consider it next time. Ps. The juices are a little pricey but they were so good!
