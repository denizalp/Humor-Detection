I've been wanting to make a visit whenever I was in LA but finally got to check it out in Vegas! There is always a long wait but I would say its worth it! The only time I didn't see a line was like early early morning. So after waiting in that long line, we finally ordered our sandwiches, we both got the Fairfax. It was delicious and satisfying! My husband loved it and wished he had ordered more. Too bad we don't have an Egg Slut over on the east coast!
