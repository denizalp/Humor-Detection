I've been going here since I was a kid.  It's a good place to stare at trophy wives with high amounts of credit debt.  It's a great place to shop-lift from, as it has a lot of high end merchandise.  I always feel safe here, probably because i'm usually the poorest person inside the building.  To it's credit even the high end stores have some pretty good deals during the holidays.  \n\nA small note, you will get stared at trying to make purchases with a bag full of quarters.
