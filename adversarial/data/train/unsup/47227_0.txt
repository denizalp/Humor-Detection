Yes, this place is expensive but get a Restaurant.com coupon and go cuz it's good!\n\nTrust me - get the portobello mushroom entree. My friend who \"didn't like mushrooms\" was transformed with one bite. The green salsa (unlike typical green salsas) is bright and so delicious. Guacamole is great. Drinks are good. Attentive & friendly staff.
