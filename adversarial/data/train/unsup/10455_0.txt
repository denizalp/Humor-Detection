Yardhouse is one of my favorite places to go for HH. The HH menu has a variety of food but I'm a big fan of the turkey sliders and the chicken nachos. The sliders are always moist with bits of carrots in it and mozzarella topped on the meat. The chicken nachos has fake cheese, real cheese, large chunks of meat and of course the beans, sour cream and guacamole on top. It's loud enough that when you bring kids it's not a big deal either. Their menu is so huge that you can easily find something for everyone!  Also, the HH is NOT limited to the bar. That's a big plus because sometimes there is no room at the bar and it is nice that they include all patrons for this awesome deal.\n\nOverall since its a chain restaurant there is plenty of service even when it's happy hour. We've always left happy and I love that YH is that much closer.
