I had a great conversation with my brother today. He was talking about Secret's. I asked why he liked it so much, he said, \"It's great, it's the best place in the world\". I thought it was a decent place the couple of times I have been there. I was friends with a girl who worked there as a cocktail server a few years ago and got the inside scoop on a lot of the behind the scenes stories. Secret's used to have ad space in Scene, their slogan was \"We let the kitty out of the cage\". I think if they go back to that, business will double.
