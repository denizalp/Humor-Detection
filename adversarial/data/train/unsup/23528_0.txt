So much fun! This was my second time at Tanzy and my first time at iPic and it's safe to say I'll be coming back to both. The food and drinks  at Tanzy were so good! I got a prickly pear margarita and a glass of pino noir, both very good. The presentation of their drinks was awesome, they looked so pretty. Their food selection was definitely more than the anticipated \"light bites\". Delicious fresh pulled mozzarella with an array of salts (I tried a truffle one!\", yummy toasted bread, caprese bruschetta, pasta, basically a whole lot of cheese and bread which is the best thing ever. Then we headed over to ipic with another cocktail and two giant cookies waiting for us. The cookies were probably the best cookies I've ever tasted. Cheesecake with pink m&ms yum! The seats in iPic were so comfy that it was hard to stay awake. Awesome event and I can't wait to come back to these places!
