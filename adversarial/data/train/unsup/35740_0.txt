This is our third time here in a month so I think it's time to share how much we love this hidden gem! The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. The food is always fresh, hot, and delicious. Their portions are huge, so make sure you come hungry. Not to mention prices are extremely reasonable. We love the atmosphere as well. There really isn't anything to complain about with this place!
