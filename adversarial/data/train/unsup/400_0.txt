I am a fan of this supermarket as we love the meat here.  This love affair started when my old mother could no longer chew through the beef and pork sold at No Frills and Chinese stores.  We ate lots and lots of chicken as a result.  I became willing to buy more expensive meat and tried out Michael Angelos's when it had a sale on beef eye of round.  Boy, it was so tender that it seemed like it melted in my mouth.  Since then, we purchased pork and beef from here only.  My mother loves that she could eat red meat again.  We still buy our fishes and chicken from Chinese stores and No Frill.\n\nPersonal story aside, the meat is fresh and the chilling meat counter sells marinated meat ready for grill and oven.  They sell chicken that has no antibiotic and hormones (but they are not organic chicken).  I appreciate the bakery and dessert section; I am told that they bake some of the bread in store.  The produce is very high quality and is pricey, so we usually buy from the \"reduced to sell\" table, and the stuff on the table is often fresh enough.  They have a BIG organic fruit section, on top of a really big regular fruit section that I buy from.  I also buy from the coffee\/ready to eat bar when I have a serene Saturday afternoon coffee break.\n\nOther Yelpers mentioned about other goodies already: European grocery, outdoor BBQ, higher end items, etc..\n\nOther than the fact that it is more expensive than the usual grocery stores that I buy from, I have nothing bad to say about this place.  This is an upscale store, so the pricing is higher.  I still find it less expensive than Longo's across the street, especially for the ready to eat section and salad bar.  Trust me, I have done the math.
