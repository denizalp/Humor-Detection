I used to work at a Fry's a long time ago. I know a lot of things that still hold true, secrets or really the why's of most of the complaints people have about it. Basically there are things customers do to screw things up for others or there are ways to take advantage of the system. \n\nMost people see Fry's while driving into town. It is brief, but you can see the massive slot machine above the entrance if you're not fixed on the casinos like most people are.\n\nWhat I got out of Fry's is help with organization. They have filing stuff, stationary, all kinds of computer storage devices, blank cds to burn backup my drive. They have flash drives, but I'm too wary of something so small easily getting lost or \"zapped\" blank somehow. \n\nSince last fall, I've been going thru a lot of papers, filing, shredding, condensing years of crap I saved \"for later.\" Fry's has hanging folders, file boxes, shredders, even shelves and comp desks, all that stuff.\n\nThey have a lot of books, I check out the business ones. Magazines are taking a big hit, since you can get a book online for cheaper including postage. I've been reading a lot of business, marketing and advertising books lately.\n\nThey're good about marking and having rebate slips setup so you can get software for cheaper and even free. I've also been working on my photo editing skills to design some... media.\n\nThere are still dry erase boards I bought that I use to plan in each room, with a larger board for my Action Station. \n\nThere's a lot of information I have to get together in a short time, in ways I've not seen in print before. I've been picking away at it, since 1997. I get happy when I find notebooks I bough already filled out with things I forgot I already did. \n\nI love the blown up pics of old Vegas they have. I have to give props to a store that respects history that casinos won't even acknowledge with their \"new\" renovations. Some things were done better in the past. I hope it comes back because I've seen what \"new changes,\" have done. Technology was supposed to help, but clearly only a small percentage profited- obscenely.\n\nIf you get bad service or someone won't help you, remember that the store departments are based on sales commission. Why would someone who's busy making sales teach a newer employee to cut in on their action? It wasn't easy to work there, but I learned a lot and my paychecks raped the employee discount while I was there.
