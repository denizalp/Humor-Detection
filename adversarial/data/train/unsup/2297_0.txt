So glad I made it out here. It's off the beaten path for most Charlotteans but totally worth the trip!! Ferrucci's is a real live Italian deli! It serves as a market place too with some of the most incredible looking steaks, stuffed pork chops and Braccioli!!!\n\nFor my first visit, I ordered both the Muffaletta and Caprese sandwiches; they were just amazing!! The Caprese is a nice simple sandwich with Prosciutto, fresh mozzarella and chopped marinated fresh tomatoes. The Muffaletta was loaded with an assortment of primo quality meats - Mortadella (with Pistachios),Sopressata, Provolone and Olive Spread.\n\nOf course I had to have one of their NY Style Black and White Cookies and my large Cannoli was hand filled to order in front of me!! Both just outstanding!\n\nAnd...if you've never had a San Pellegrino Blood Orange soda, you've been missing out!\n\nLet's just say, if I lived near here, I would haunt this place!!\n\nPS- D-9 and Ass Clown Brewing are nearby, so make it a day trip!!!
