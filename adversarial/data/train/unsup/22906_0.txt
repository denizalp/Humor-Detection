I'll start off by saying I absolutely hate burpees. I know one of these days I'm going to face plant hard and bust my teeth out. I just know it.\n\nThat aside, this was a hell of a work out and it really felt like I was training for that one big fight. I was geared up, wrapped fists, sweat soaked, metal music pumped and feeling a tad bit like Rocky Balboa in one of those dramatic training montages. \n\nWe were a group of five and our trainer was not only funny but really engaging.  We did a variety of warm up and floor exercises and then took to the bags hard. My shoulders were on fire and my arms felt  ton heavy.  Each of us had a quick one on one with the trainer and my set was left jab, left jab, right jab, right jab, left hook, right hook. I was out of breath but I knew he could see my tiger eyes so he keep pushing me on. We ended our boxing session with cool down then stepped inside the ring for a feelzy, had our picture taken by the owner, unwrapped our fists then called it a session.\n\nI'm itching for another go at the bag. I'll be back.\n\nNote: This is a true to form boxing gym, hard and gritty so to speak....Don't expect fancy.
