This is an update:  let's face it... working at any customer service job has its challenges.  For sure.  I didn't get far enough in the process to actually use your services.  I see you have great reviews,  that's exactly why I called and was so surprised to get treated that crappy.  My review was unsolicited and 100% honest and it's so insulting to me that you would suggest otherwise.   I don't know any locksmith and dont have the time or ethics to make up reviews to hurt people.  Period.  Yelp is for the opinion of the consumer.   \n\n\n\n\nWhomever I talked to was a total asshole over phone.   I'm already stressed because the first locksmith I called didn't show up.. I waited 1.5 hours, then took uber to work.  Things calmed down.     So I call here wanting to get a quote and he was a total dick! And I was nice!
