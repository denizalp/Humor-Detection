Efficient service and a quality cleaning, DOC does the legwork in determining what's covered by insurance and what is not so that you can know what work might be up to you to pay for.\n\nI've been coming here for a while and been pleased with the work though I fortunately have not had to have anything major done. They have the solid technology like the panoramic xray doo-dad and also the one that plugs into the USB port of the computer for a low-dose bitewing. Awesome.\n\nI'll keep coming back!
