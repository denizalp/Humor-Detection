We came here a couple of weeks ago for reverse hh on a friday and sat at the bar to take advantage of the HH.   Mr h ordered the Brio burger and I ordered the margherita flatbread, both apps were below average apps. The burger was bland and the Hubster ordered med well and added saut√©ed onions. the burger was served well with charred onions.\nmy pizza seemed more like a thin flavorless cracker mess. I like thin pizza but this was way too thin and falling apart. We both ordered the mojitos & they were so disgusting we had to send those back.  the bartender took it personally but they were super bitter and nasty and we could not enjoy them.  I understand it's happy hour and its super busy on Fridays, affordable drinks & apps but if you want me to return...please serve some tasty food so I will be tempted to have dinner here in the future.  I doubt I will be returning.
