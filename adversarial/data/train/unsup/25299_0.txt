First, Jacob was our server and her was really excellent. Second, pizza was perfect for the six of us as an appetizer. Third, salads were great and plentiful. Fourth, my husbands favorite dish at other restaurants, linguini diavola, had the best scallops I have tasted in a long time. The mussels, shrimp and clams plentiful and cooked just right. We are from out of town on our way to a Styx concert and this was a great find! (Btw, I always appreciate when a manager stops by and checks on things and she was really sweet too. )
