ugh- get off me!!! \n\nthat's what i felt like saying the whole time. the sales people swarm you like moths swarm a light bulb. \n\nNO!!! IM JUST FREAKING BROWSING!!!!!!!!!! \n\nactually, i don't think their prices are all that great. actually high for the quality. especially since I can order everything they have through other vendors in the valley for a lower price. and i don't have to deal with these awful stalker employees.\n\nright when you walk in the door they want to give a monologue. and they basically chase you when you leave to see if you saw anything you like.\n\n i felt like i was in china town or mexico- \"ok OK let make a deal, berry goo price fo yuuu. wha you like?\"\n\n\nno thank you, i will use your website to browse so i can buy it somewhere else cheaper. \n\nif you decide to go- carry bug spray
