Just got my first tattoo done here today. Absolutely love this place! I couldn't find a lot of places close to me so I went with this place from all the great reviews and the 5.5 stars. I was hoping someone could do a tattoo from me as a walk in and thankfully the guy said Tami could! I had to wait about 30 minutes for her to finish up with someone but it was worth it! Tami is so so nice and made sure the spelling, font and the size was perfect! I definitely felt comfortable there and she made the experience a lot less painful! I love my tattoo so much! The price was definitely in my budget which I loved! Her work is amazing! Such a good place to get a first tattoo! Definitely am going to recommend Tami to everyone I know!
