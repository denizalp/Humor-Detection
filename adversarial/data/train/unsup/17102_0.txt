Ok, not to sound clich√©, but Ike's really is the BOMB.COM\n\nThink of any other sandwich shop you've ever been to....ok, got it? Well, Ike's is NOTHING like whatever you're thinking right now...for realzzzz!!! This place will blow your mind. They literally have HUNDREDSof hot sandwiches to chose from (go online, you will see that each location will make a specific bunch of sandwiches, but each restaurant is ready to make whatever you want, from whatever other Ike's you might want) \n\nSo, not only do you have your pick of delicious hot sandwiches, but, you even get your pick of breads! They offer like 5 different options, including gluten free. Speaking of gluten free, if you are intolerant or celiac, they will ask you because they will arrange a special sandwich making station so that there is no cross-contamination. Very caring company! They even have dozens of vegetarian and vegan options...their vegan meatball is, hands down, better than the real thing. \n\nYou will never get board here, and these puppies will definitely fill you up! Whenever we go get one, this is all my husband and I will eat all day; so filling. I have officially kissed all other sandwich restaurants goodbye!
