I came here with girl friends for Sunday lunch. I very was impressed with its chic interior. I love the big chandelier and flowers in middle of dinning room. It really brights up the whole restaurant. Price here is very reasonable! Food is pretty decent. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful. They also have lots selections of wine and beer. The lavender ice tea I ordered was very floral and not sweeten. We had seared scallop, clam linguini, jambalaya, spicy seafood pasta, beet salad. Everything was decent. There was nothing really wowed me, but I am very satisfied with the price I was paying. Sparklings offers happy hours from 5-10pm everyday with 30% off on alcohols. Will I come back? Of course, how can I miss the good deals!
