I came here for dinner solo and enjoyed myself quite a bit (I am good company!)\nThe garlic rice was delicious. Very very tasty. I would absolutely get that again.\nVery flavorful, and the rice was cooked perfectly. I also ordered the steak skewers. Eh, wasn't super impressed with them. The flavor was Ok, but I guess it was the cut of beef they used. \nService was excellent. Menu seemed a touch pricey however, l will return to try some other stuff again.
