After dinner, I stopped here to get a cold brew.  I wasn't sure if the place was still open.  Lights were on inside and there were workers, but the outside lights were all dark.\n\nThey were open and I was able to get my coffee from a pleasant barista.\n\nThis is a new outlet and it's quite large and very nice.  Since it's just off the 215, I may be stopping here more often for a caffeeine kick wehnn needed.
