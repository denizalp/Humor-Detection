Tonight was the second time we dined at Saigon Kitchen.  It will be the last time.  There were four of us; our meals came out one at a time, with several minutes between.  One of us ordered barbequed short ribs.  They were so tough, they were inedible.  When we told our server we didn't think the beef was short rib beef, he responded \"Is the meat tough?\"  One of us ordered lemongrass chicken; nowhere in the description did it say \"contains seeds,\" and yes, it did.  The place was busy and they couldn't care less than not one of the four of us will be back.
