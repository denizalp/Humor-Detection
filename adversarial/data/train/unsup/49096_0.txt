After calling over 10 restaurants to take our group of 12 on a Saturday night we thankfully, finally found Kelly's at Southbridge to accomodate us at 7:30. \n\nLocated in a part of Old town where there are over 78 bars and restaurants we found Valet parking right next door to restaurant. \n\nWhen we arrived, they had our table set up so we all took our seats. \n\nThe restaurant was dark and the crowd was mid 20s on up. \n\nThe Nay is the service kinda sucked. It took us over 10 minutes to get our drinks and another 10 minutes to order our food.  By the time our food came it was another 10 minutes we all were hungry.  Another Nay was the music (today's hits, which I loved) but, was really loud so we all were yelling to hear one another. \n\nThe Yay is the food is Dope (Young kids Slang for good)\nMy word is awesome, if you watch the Bachelor it's Amazing. \n\nEither way said, this food rocked. My girlfriend and I shared so we ordered the Brussel sprouts, so yummy made with a balsamic glaze with chunks of Pancetta. \n\nWe also had the Caprese salad. For our entre we had the slow cooked short rib. Wow was this good. (I shouldn't have worn white).  The rib was cooked in a tomato sauce. Served over mashed potato and topped off with an over easy egg. My husband asked if I ordered a local moco, which is a dish in Hawaii with rice, hamburger steak, topped off with over easy egg and brown gravy. \n\nAnyway, other delicious meals ordered were the Salmon. Seasoned perfect and cooked moist. My husband ordered the Pork chop. Cooked just right so the juice was sealed in. \n\nOverall minus the wait, I have to say a strong Yay to the quality of the food. Come try.
