This is an honorable business and they stand behind their work, which is hard to find these days. While at Scottsdale Fashion Square, I dropped off a necklace that needed to be fixed. The store manager, Matt, explained how it would be repaired and they did a superb job!   I will definitely be back for any future jewelry repairs.
