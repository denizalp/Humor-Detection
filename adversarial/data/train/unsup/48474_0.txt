Lobby looks really nice but many better options in the area.  Had to wait an HOUR for breakfast and then our keys didn't work. We understand that happens all of the time, but you shouldn't need to go to reception THREE TIMES to get keys to work to the TWO rooms you are paying to stay in for THREE NIGHTS.  Thank goodness a cleaning lady was nearby and let us in.
