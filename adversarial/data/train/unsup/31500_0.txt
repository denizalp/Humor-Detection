Went the other night for a Gelato...no complaints about the gelato itself just about the service.\nThe flavour i ordered had some fig and nuts in it...and since its the texture and crunch that appeals( and i didn't notice either the fig or nuts in my serving), i asked the girl if i could just have some with that in it...as my serving didnt have any.\nI know they are busy but the manner in which she replied \"it will have some in the middle\" was a turn off. \nBy the way it did not have\" any in the middle\" at all.What ever happened to keeping the customer happy ?
