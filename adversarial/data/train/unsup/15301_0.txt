What's not to like about a place where all the patrons inside think I am the owner of Habitat. Every few minutes I get a tap on the shoulder or a girl looking at me with a seductive smile only to be disappointed when she looks up at the stage and sees my exact double spinning on the ones and twos. \n\nWe came to Habitat last night for Sabz birthday and it was my second time back there in one night (technically inside only once) and Angelo's third time back inside there hahaha. Three times is the lucky number of tries right?\n\nThe place was fairly busy with people plastered out of their minds doing the hoedown throwdown. The music was pretty good although for me when it comes to the House genre I generally like it a little dirtier and a bit harder.\n\nIt was fairly easy to get drinks, not too big of lineups and if there was you can just squeeze yourself inbetween other people and skip the waiting part.\n\nThis place is not bad at all if you need your House fix on a weekend night. Just expect if you have a haircut like mine random girls are going to pet your hair. Weird, I know.
