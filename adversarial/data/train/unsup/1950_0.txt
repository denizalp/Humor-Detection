I've never been a fan of Goodwill until I realized how poor I am. \n\nIt's not cool vintage stuff, folks. The clothes smell like they have been in someone's closet for years, the furniture looks like dogs and kids took turns peeing on it and the people who work here are scarier than the People of Walmart.\n\nBUT with all things you buy, you just have to use good judgment. So before you put on those Goodwill panties (if you're the type to buy used undies) you might just want to wash them in a bit of acid first. And if you're buying furniture that looks like someone lost their virginity on-- you're gross. The deal with thrift store shopping is that you have to be willing to look through racks and racks of clothes, in hopes of finding gems. I have found jeans here with the tags still on, like-new popularly branded shirts and years of Halloween costumes. Check out my profile pictures to see the evidence.\n\nIts all about the thrill of the hunt for me. Oh yeah, and I only come here every other Saturday when its 50% off the entire store. I'm poor. Leave me alone!\n\nI've also donated lots of stuff too. Mostly all of the clothes I've bought from here. I think I just get really excited that I can buy a shirt for $0.50 even though its bright orange and has jack-o-lantern patch on it. When I moved, I cleaned house and got rid of a lot of shoes, knick knacks, housewares and home decor items. They gave me a coupon for 20% off too. So naturally, I was back next week and like a crazy person, I went around the store looking for all my donated items just to see how much they priced stuff and I couldn't believe the markup. Some of the items were priced more than the purchasing price.\n\nOh well, it goes to a great cause. Goodwill supposedly uses the money to help people get back to work and stuff. So support the cause and buy thrift!
