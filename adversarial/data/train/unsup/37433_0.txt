Tom's urban is a great place to have lunch, dinner, or just a drink.. Great vibe and fast service! The open space provides a lot of light and having an entrance next to the strip makes a very convenient walk in. \nThe food has always been delicious, tried a few entr√©es from the menu but my favorite has been the CountryCrispy Shrimp with the Nashville sauce \nAm definitely a huge fan of this one!!! \nOverall the place is a fantastic place for anyone and everyone. \nIf you're anywhere around NewYorkNewYork or even just on the strip, you should check this place out!
