We had been waiting for the opening of the restaurant with great anticipation and high hopes. Sadly our expectations were met with a very disappointing evening. When a restaurant presents a very limited menu with only four mains, they better be outstanding. In this case they weren't even average.\n\nThe salad that we received was quite good and the dressing was tasty. The rolls that came to the table were anything but impressive. They looked and tasted like they had come out of a plastic bag from the local Copp's grocery store.\n\nThe special of the evening was wiener schnitzel. As this is one of my favorite dishes, I quickly decided that would be my choice. Expecting to get a kitchen breaded and pan fried tender piece of meat, I was greatly disappointed when a deep fried heavily breaded chunk of crusty previously frozen entree appeared. After cutting into it, I determined that I had gotten better pork tenderloin sandwiches at a truck stop, and for a better price.\n\nMy wife ordered to pasta dish from the main menu. It basically consisted of mushrooms and noodles in a sauce. She enjoyed it, but it was certainly nothing special.\n\nThe service was ordinary and not up to the standards of a place that is billing itself as a \"special\" experience. They seemed to be way overstaffed, with two bartenders and six servers for an upper level that only has about 20 tables. \n\nThe wine and cocktail was very good - about the best thing that can be said for the place. That and the remodeling has been a vast improvement over what the old Stamm House looked like.\n\nSorry, I doubt that we will ever go back unless they get a new chef and a new menu...
