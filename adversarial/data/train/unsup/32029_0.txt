Okay, so it's not a five star restaurant but for the fare and prices The Landmark is my first choice for breakfast and late-night dining. Prices are very reasonable, food is very fresh and plentiful, and the wait staff is friendly and attentive. What more can you ask for? Maybe a bigger parking lot?
