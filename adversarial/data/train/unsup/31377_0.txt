We have been to this place every time we have come to Montreal and have never been disappointed.  This time around we came with our 11 month old daughter and the servers were curious and wonderful in preparing food that she can eat.  As to the grown ups, I highly recommend the lobster salad, the seafood crepe and the duck crepes...although we have yet to get anything we haven't enjoyed.
