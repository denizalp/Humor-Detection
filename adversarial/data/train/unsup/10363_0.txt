Just like Joanna V, I am wondering where my previous review went. This spot is close to my work so I order through the Yelp app every so often. The wor won ton soup and various shrimp dishes haven't done me wrong yet, and everything is served piping hot and super fast. At one point they used to have more Hawaiian BBQ items on the menu. The sauces tend to be hit or miss, either very sugary or a touch too thin but overall it's a convenient Chinese takeout spot and pricing is fair.
