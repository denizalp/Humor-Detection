This pharmacy is exactly what it should be! It is a national chain, so if you're on vacation and you run out of your prescription, you can pick it up at any other CVS with a quick transfer. Sure, you are not going to receive the consultation that you would receive with a community pharmacy, but all I need is a pharmacy that will get prescriptions ready whenever I need them. They does just that very well here. The staff are always very nice too, rushed, but still nice.
