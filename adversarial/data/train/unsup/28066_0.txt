Yesterday I smelled THAT smell - the one that tells you that something electrical is burning out!  Sure enough, my evap cooler motor had fried, and didn't make it through the night.  \nThis morning I took it off and schlepped it up to Indoor Comfort Supply, my go-to place for evaporative cooler parts of a higher quality than the big box store carries, plus friendly and knowledgeable advice.\nSure enough, Brian had the motor in stock.  He took pity on this Do-It-Herself on a day that is forecast to top out at 112 degrees, and put the kit together for me.  I appreciate anyone lessening my time on the roof on a day like today!  It's all done and checking in at 78 degrees - yay!\nI first found this place in the middle of winter, when my roof was being replaced and my roofer suggested that I change the rusted out cooler legs, as long as they were off anyway.  The folks here have always been helpful, and gone out their way to assist me with any questions I have about my evaporative cooler.\nYou don't need to be a rocket scientist to repair a swamp cooler, but their website is very informative and the expert advice is worth the trip for me!\nFYI, I think the hours on this listing might be a bit off - I found them open at 8 am today (Friday).
