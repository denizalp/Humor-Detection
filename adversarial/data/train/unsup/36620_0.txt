This place is much better than it appears from the outside. Gotta always look out when it comes to Chinese restaurants.\n\nWhat I like:\n- The food is decent, they got a good selection of good seafood\n- The portions are quite large\n- The food is tasty\n- They have four different kinds of dessert: sesame, almond, grass jelly and something else\n\nWhat could be improved:\n- Food was a bit salty\n\nWhat is just what it is:\n- The prices aren't cheap for dinner, but they aren't too pricey either - perhaps with exception of the $38\/lb fish that I have no idea if it's cheap\/expensive but for a fish it just sounds expensive\n- The place isn't gorgeous, but that does not bother me\n- The menus appear to be all in Chinese, especially the specials\n\nI think I gotta come back for this $4.99 lunch special. Plus they have a 10% tip option on the credit card machine.
