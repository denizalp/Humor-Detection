This is the first time I've been back to this Wendy's since last January. The food I got through the drive-thru was so bad I got back in my car and took it back for a refund. I asked the 12 year old manager to open the sandwich and look at the bacon. As you can see in my picture, it was totally burnt and inedible, and the burger was just about as bad. The arrogant kid looked at it and said \"looks like our bacon\". He amended his comment by saying maybe it was a little crisper than usual, but he'd be happy to refund my money. When he returned to the window, I told him he wasn't getting my point. I told him it was only the second time I've been there in a year, and both times it was inedible. He just got a smug smile on his face and didn't respond, so I told him not to bother apologizing since it would be too much for him. I honestly don't know how this restaurant stays open. I very rarely see cars at the drive-thru or parked to eat inside.
