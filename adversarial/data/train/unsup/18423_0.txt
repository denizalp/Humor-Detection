Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is the best borough on this big beautiful island and Vincent Sous-marin has -- ass down, face up; that's the way we like to fuck -- the single most bestest awesomenessest POUTINE ever. This is the poutine of the good hood. Come here for quality, quantity and authenticity. The patate frites are fried in premium decades-aged Hochelaga frying oil, topped with the freshest and squeakiest cheddar cheese curds with a beautiful sauce brun. Eat and be merry.
