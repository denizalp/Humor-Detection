I shot an M4 with 3 mags, a Tommy Gun with 4 mags and a 1911 with 6 mags\nCost me about $220 but I had so much fun I don't care. The reception staff was helpful as was the range staff. I'm sure this isn't the cheapest place to shoot, but it was my first time shooting a fully automatic weapon and it was hella fun.\nNot sure if anything is cheap in Vegas, but the friendly staff here makes you feel like you got your money's worth.
