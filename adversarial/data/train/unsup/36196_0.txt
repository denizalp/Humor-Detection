Finally after so many years of wondering what's behind the doors of this restaurant I went here for a dinner. \n\nThe place looks cheap on the outside (which totally doesn't fit into the King street hi end restaurants atmosphere) but wait for the moment you step inside. Inside it's a good looking restaurant with white table sheets and all that=) \n\nthe dinner prices are ok. but the portions for a thai restaurant are tiny. we had to go for desserts to fill us up. the desserts are delicious though (deep fried banana and mango sticky rice!ummm)\n\nthe waiter was very attentive and joked around with us. \n\nnice place overall=)
