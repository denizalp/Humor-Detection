We had an excellent meal with great service. Save room for desert, the three we had at our table were all outstanding. The beef tartare, duck and salmon were great. Not sure if it was a language misunderstanding but the salmon is smoked but served raw. It was delicious but not what we were expecting. The lamb was also wonderful. So tender ,served with onion rings, kale, carrots and chick peas ( not my favorite but tasty.) Enjoy the casual atmosphere and great service.
