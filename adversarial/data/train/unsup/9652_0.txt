I popped in here for Happy Hour on Friday with some girlfriends and was SO shocked at how cool their ambiance is and most importantly, their HH prices are amazing!!!! $2 tacos, $4 Guac, $5 {AMAZING} margaritas, some of the best salsa that i've ever had..... You get it, GO HERE NOW. The Cucumber\/Serrano margarita was off the charts! They also have a fab patio! I cannot wait to come back soon! (It may even be this week...shhhh, don't tell).
