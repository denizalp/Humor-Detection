This place was great. I came for a \"UYE\" however, I came a week early, lol! I decided to stay anyway and sat at the bar. I ordered the cheese fondue grilled sandwich and asked for a salad substitute as the soup it came with is made with chicken.  The owner, Elizabeth came by and asked what I got, so I told her and she suggested the quinoa salad. I was extremely pleased when my order came out with the original salad AND the quinoa salad. First of all, the quinoa, which I haven't liked before, was thee best dish. I'm getting it tomorrow when I go for the actual UYE. The flavor was amazing. Both salads were great, the grilled cheese was devine. As a treat, Elizabeth offered me a small chocolate cake. She was a pastry chef and it's clear she was damn good at it!!! Oh, and they start you off with 2 types of bread and a white bean dip. Extremely tasty! I really enjoyed my lunch and the staff was friendly. Elliot came by and asked how things were. I like when hosts do that! \nThe service was good, prices are reasonable and food was fantastic. Yay! I'm a fan!
