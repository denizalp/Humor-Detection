I have been eating here for 25 years! We used to road-trip from Red Deer back in the days when bars were closed on Sundays, so we had the day off. I have introduced so many to this place, never a negative response. My Aunt even took Ginger Beef on the plane back to Ontario, she was so impressed! Love to go with a group, so we can order many dishes. Favorites: Ginger beef, salt and pepper squid, chow mein delight, hot\/sour soup, fried dumplings.... On and on
