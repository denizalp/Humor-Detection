On my continued hunt to find the best Chinese in Charlotte, I decided to check out Baoding this past Sunday night, after not visiting for more than 10 years.\nUpon arriving we were greeted by an extremely friendly staff and saw that almost every table was full, that is a good sign!\n\nWe started with spring rolls and wonton soup. The spring rolls were light, fresh and deep fried to perfection, and served with a great dipping sauce. As for the wonton soup, one of the best of have had. The broth had an amazing flavor and came with three chicken stuffed wontons, spinach and thinly sliced eggs.\n\nAs for the entrees, we ordered the Beijing Duck, duck served with plum sauce, cucumbers, scallions and thin light pancakes, and Chicken and Shrimp with mixed vegetables in a brown sauce.\nthe Chicken and Shrimp was a large portion, allowing me to have left-overs Monday night, and was delicious. They do not skimp on the protein. As for the veggies, too many I cannot even recall, but they were cooked to perfection.\nAs for the duck, I am not a huge duck fan, but I did make one pancake and enjoyed it very much. The plum sauce gives the duck a nice flavor and the meal is definitely something I recommend checking out, especially if you like duck.\n\nThroughout the meal, the service did not disappoint.  Baoding is definitely a go to Chinese spot in my mind!
