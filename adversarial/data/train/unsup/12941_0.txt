I am British and I know my tea, so 5 stars for this English Rose gem in charming Carefree ! My girlfriends had organized an outing so I was amazed when we sat in what could have been the Queen of Englands Windsor tea room ! Deliciously girly and full of vintage British china and knick knacks all for sale at great prices. The food is traditional english high tea fare - yummy scones with cream and jam, sandwiches, soups and salads. And a great cuppa tea from a menu of over 75 flavours ! This hot spot gets busy, yet the staff were sweet and very accommodating. After eating we strolled next door to their British home decor shop - Jo London ! Packed with nostalgia, english furniture and artwork, antique British items and a witty array of cards and hostess gifts. We had a great afternoon and shall certainly return soon.
