Though a bit pricy, this is a store with quality goods. There are some things found here that I haven't seen elsewhere. \nLike for example $9 cola syrup made with cane sugar. I bought it, and it was terrible. But when my wife brought it back, explaining how it tasted off, instead of a refund or even a store credit, we were simply told it seemed fine. \nI'm cheering for independent businesses. But here's the thing: I can buy something disgusting at Costco or Loblaws or even Walmart, and return it without a receipt or even a question. You, as an independent store owner, need to take the $9 hit and make me feel good about buying the next weird thing in your shelf, and the next, and the next... Otherwise, I leave with a bad taste in my mouth.
