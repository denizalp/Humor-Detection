For my 100th review I wanted to pick a place that lived up to the honour and represented exactly the type of restaurant I love. Food that's delicious, cheap, and plentiful. Good vegetarian options. A bit of a hole in the wall. The kind of place that you get excited about when you discover and you love telling your friends about. Mother India is exactly this sort of restaurant.\n\nMother India takes your favourite Indian curries (Saag Paneer, Mutter Paneer, Butter Chicken, to name a few) and wraps them up in a delicious roti. The curries on their own would be awesome but inside the roti they're even better. My favourites are Saag Paneer and Mutter Paneer both of which are about $8 and huge. If you've never been here before ask for your roti medium. I consider myself very spice tolerant and I even find the spicy almost too much.\n\nOne of my favourite places in the city for a cheap and delicious feast.
