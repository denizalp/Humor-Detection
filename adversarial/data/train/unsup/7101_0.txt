Whoever \"HIBS\" is bought this studio suddenly and now will not refund the unused portion of my pre-paid card for classes at Yoga Unlimited. Their website explains this as \"heated to 80-85 degrees\" which they claim is necessary to warm up your body (though all my previous teachers explain that this what the ujjayi breath is for). When i told the new owner I do not like heated yoga they responded, \"this isn't heated yoga\" - So are you lying on your website or to me directly? Either way i didn't dig the vibe as she said it was just business. No Namaste here apparently. Oddly, \"HIBS\" stands for \"Holistic Integration of Body and Soul\" - My understanding from a few years of practice is that yoga inherently IS the holistic integration of body, mind and soul - so in naming this place \"HIBS\" they are essentially calling it, \"Yoga Yoga\" but without the integration of mind.  It's too bad they decided to leave the mind out of their process - they may have realized the benefit of taking care of customers of the previous studio and probably wouldn't have ended up with such a silly name.\n\nIf you like studios that use goofy marketing ploys and lie to you to get yo in the door, this is your studio.
