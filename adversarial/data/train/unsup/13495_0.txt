LIARS and SCAM artists!!! \nI was approached by them about an offer to stay at the Luxer for a week as long as I go to a timeshare presentation. To do this, I'd have to give them a $124 deposit to hold my hotel room, in which I would get back upon either canceling, or going to the presentation. I asked, \"In what scenario would I NOT get my deposit back?\" He said \"None whatsoever, you will definitely get it back.\" I then asked, \"What if I completely forget about it? I'm very forgetful so what happens if I plan to use it in a few months but forget about it. Do I lose my deposit then?\" And he said \"Nope. Once it expires the money goes right back into your account.\" \nWell, guess what??? I call to cancel and they tell me \"No. We cannot give you your $124 deposit back. And we have a receipt that says you only had 30 days to cancel with your signature on it.\"\nLIARS! DECEIVERS! MEAN BUTT MONKEYS!!!!! \nI'm going to issue a chargeback on these people. If that doesn't work, I will drive 5 hours to Vegas every single day, stand by their set-up with a sign that says \"SCAMMERS\", and warn all their victims until they give me my deposit back.
