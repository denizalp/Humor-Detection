***DO NOT COME HERE!!!!*** My husband came in for a quote and spoke to the owner about a few cars, the owner showed him a few and asked for his ID to run it in the office. My husband dropped his wallet inside the car he was being shown without him knowing it yet at that time. We didn't realize it until 10mins down the road at which time we rushed back to the car lot, the owner had gone and two men were locking up. We told them of the situation and they \"tried\" numerous times to call their boss back to the office. They refused to help him look for his wallet and said to come back Monday. There was no other place we went after this car dealership and are 100% sure his ID and wallet were left there. This place gave no assistance or cooperation to allow my husband to look for his wallet. My husband came back eqrly monday morning and was told his wallet was not in the car and the owner also did not have his ID which was in his hand because he had to run it through. These people are DISHONEST and cannot be trusted! I would not be surprised if the people there kept it for themselves. THE OWNER AND STAFF HERE CANNOT BE TRUSTED!! DO NOT BRING YOUR BUSINESS HERE!!!! Just a warning to others so you don't get ripped off by these people as well.
