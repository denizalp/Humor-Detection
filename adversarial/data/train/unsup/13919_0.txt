Awful, Awful, Awful...\n\nWe didn't dine in, but instead ordered carry out because we were in the mood for Italian, but too tired to cook. \n\nMistake. BIG mistake. HUGE. \n\nI'm not usually one to make bad reviews...but this place gave me, my son, my husband and my mother the shudders for a full two weeks afterwards. Not even exaggerating. This place left such a bad taste in all our mouths that we literally cringed. This place doesn't resemble Italian food in the least. Maybe someone who has never eaten, cooked or even SEEN Italian food might be fooled into thinking this was edible. It's not. \n\nThe chicken parm tasted like someone tossed a grilled piece of chicken (not even breaded!) in Campbells TOMATO SOUP that someone dumped canned chili in. This was not spaghetti sauce. This was flat out tomato soup (with that weird creamy orange color and no seasoning) with some crumbly lumps of undefined meat. My son got the Veal house special....let's just say...no. NO.\n\nThe only saving grace was the two orders of tiramisu, which was obviously NOT made in house, and was still frozen. We let it thaw and ate that for dinner. The rest went into the garbage can. Save yourself the trouble and the expense. It's not worth it.
