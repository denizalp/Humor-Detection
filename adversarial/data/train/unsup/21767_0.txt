The price was quite cheap, compare with the same fan restaurant in Beijing . also the Japanese waitress was pretty nice. Only the girl which lead us to our seat , was so so so impolite with her manner , the same ugly face treated us as she treated as same people those come from continent of China . I was very annoyed when she help her colleague order our neighbors the other Chinese poor guy, she was so inpatient interrupted their asking. And mentioned our orders several times! That's incredible! And very very rude! Maybe she forget her behavior in Canada that she learned back her college ! \nThe end of complain is the steak and veggies were burnt , and fried rice was not salty. \nI won't come agin as I promised to my husband!
