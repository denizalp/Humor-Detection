I am NOT having good luck with my cheapie motels this trip.  First I get a room at the Chandler Inn, which I have successfully stayed at before, that had hairs in the bathtub, a broken bed frame, and dirty female underwear stashed in the bathroom sink cabinet, then I check into the Motel 6 in Mesa that I have stayed at previously (though years ago) and the first room they assign me to has all the lights on, totally disheveled, unmade beds, trash in the wastebaskets, etc, obviously not cleaned since the previous occupants, and the room they re-assign me to has hairs all over the hardwood floors throughout, tiny hairs in and around the sink and even a few on the sheets,  though they do look washed.  \n\nYou should not put hardwood floors in a motel room if you are not going to clean them properly.  \n\nAnd what's up with all the TV remotes everywhere I go being sticky, greasy and dusty?  They should include a wipedown with a sanitizing wipe in their daily cleanup.  \n\nOn top of that the room above me sounds like it has hardwood floors as well with a family of kids running back and forth on them (I got here at 10:30pm and it's nearly midnight now).  It's a non-smoking room but still smells like smoke as if it is coming in from other rooms through the ventilation system.  I will not be staying here another night.\n\nThe only good thing was the front desk clerk was very nice.\n\nIs it that hard to find good housekeeping employees these days?  With all the unemployment you'd think they could find better.\n(5\/1\/09)
