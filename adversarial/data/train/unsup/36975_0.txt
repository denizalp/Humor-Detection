Giving it a 4 out of 5 as I ordered the Alpha male package and was told that the hand wax was not working slightly disappointed, The head and hand massage was just ok felt a little rushed also did not get the hot towel as mentioned in the website.\n\nOverall I will just a get a haircut next time. Eren is amazing did a fantastic job with my hair, i am extremely fussy when it comes to getting my haircut but i will be back because of his cut.
