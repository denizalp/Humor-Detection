Went to go try zinburger on a Sunday just before noon.\nWe thought we would have no trouble getting in as there was about a 1\/4 of the tables open. We were told that there was a 45 min wait. As a business owner this is unacceptable. That usually means bad managment. So we went to another restaurant that had 3 or 4 tables open and got right in. It may have good food but we will never know.
