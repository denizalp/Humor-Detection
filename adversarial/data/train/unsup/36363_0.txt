If you are looking for something different to do and is not afraid of actually trying to use your noggin, I would recommend Lockdown Escape rooms. For a first timer doing an escape room it got my feet wet. You get locked in for 60 minutes, find clues and solve puzzles while you are racing the clock to escape your scenario. You can book online or by phone for anyone's convenience.
