So much fun! I love getting up on stage and singing for fun! The bartenders have great voices too! The drinks are reasonably priced for downtown. I just wish this bar was non-smoking! It's really rough on us pros that go down there, and it is the only serious turn off I could think of. Other than that, it's a blast!
