Normally I stay away from anything on Boulder Hwy north of Flamingo but a co-worker told me how good these burgers were and that I had to give it a chance.\n\nGetting in and out of this location can be hell given the traffic conditions on Desert Inn & Boulder Hwy, sooooo beware depending upon what time you visit.\n\nRolled through the drive-thru and ordered up a Bacon Roadhouse Burger consisting of meat, cheese, crispy onion parts, bbq sauce and bacon.  The combo came with fries and a drink.\n\nWe pulled into a adjacent parking lot to consume at which time I found the burger to be a tad smaller than I had envisioned and the fries delicious.\n\nLater on in the day...say 15 minutes after gulping it down, that small in stature burger felt like a brick in my stomach and stuck with me until I went to sleep.
