Friendly and cool service- every staff member is your server.  Manager Tim (?)- he wears a St. Jude's Children's Hospital pin as he's a volunteer- is so friendly and sweet, that he sent Mom and me home a couple of weeks ago with a gift to celebrate our new build contract after our realtor treated all of us to a bottle of Moscato d'Asti, a bruschetta board, a Tomato Caprese, and a Butcher's Block.\n\nCame here to have another glass of the sparkling Moscato and a bruschetta board, this time at the bar, with amiable, unobtrusive, and handsome server Bobby.  \n\nHad planned to go elsewhere for pizza, but construction kept me from going there, so Postino's it was, and I'm glad I came.\n\nNote to self: Mustn't eat so much-- a gorgeous couple invited me to try their exquisite-looking Grilled cheese app, but I couldn't eat another bite!  Thank you, anyway!
