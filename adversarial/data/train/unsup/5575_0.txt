I like what they are trying to do - but I think there are a couple flaws.\n\nFirst, everything is fairly expensive for Madison. Coffee is around $4 per cup, pastries seem expensive, and coffee beans per lb. are pricey.\n\nSecond, it seems just a bit too pretentious. My roommate asked for a coffee (she's not picky) and they said \"Well, we just don't have coffee here... we make every cup to order\" in a fairly snooty tone. And they weigh the water.... This isn't Blue Bottle.\n\nBut - the positives are that I think it's a cool space with good decor and the coffee is pretty good (albeit expensive). I'll come back.
