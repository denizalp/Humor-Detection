The AGO has quite the collection in artwork and models. From the Group of Seven to interesting historical pieces representing great history of the past to the beautiful ship sculptures located in the basement of the AGO. \n\nThe AGO definitely adds a Canadian touch to the collection. I would recommend joining one of their tours because the guide is super knowledgeable and explains the meaning of each portrait, from person to person in the picture and the significance behind the drawing.\n\nI've been to many galleries around the world - though many of which are in Europe. Of course, I can't really compare the two, because the styles are rather different, and many of the European artworks have taken decades to centuries to complete!\n\nI would recommend coming here on a Wednesday night from 6pm to 9pm because admission is free!
