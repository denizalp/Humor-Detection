Falbo's is some of the best pizza, but the Verona location does not offer coupons like the Middleton and Madison locations. Sucks that we had to pay $4 more for the same pizza that the rest of Madison gets for less. What kind of business doesn't honor coupons from other locations?  This owner apparently has ZERO business sense  and doesn't care about customer retention.
