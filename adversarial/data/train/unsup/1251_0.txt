Making it a point to visit any highly regarded Doughnut Shop within driving distance when traveling, a surprisingly comprehensive number of America's \"50 Best\" sampled over the last ten years, it is largely a matter maintaining weight that prevents more frequent trips to Roberto Armanino's Pink Box Doughnuts on West Lake Mead Boulevard, the duty to collect post-game snacks for a kid's Soccer Game largely used as an excuse to pay the store a visit and pick up two-dozen, only half of them intended for the Team's enjoyment.\n\nNow in business for nearly five years, a Strip location currently in Soft Opening and business still booming in both Summerlin and Henderson, it was just past 10:30am on Saturday that the car was navigated into a surprisingly full parking lot, a line snaking out the door and team members working hard to keep up with both the guests inside as well as several phone orders, one of those the aforementioned three boxes that were handed over with a smile plus \"one more for the wait.\"\n\nStill running 24\/7, a business model similarly adopted by Crunch Donuts at its two locations that seems particularly well-suited for a three-shift town like Las Vegas, it was with an hour to spare before the gametime that fried rings were unboxed and repackaged for delivery, a tasting of both new and old favorites taking place a photos were snapped with several full and half-pastries saved for later that day.\n\nOn one hand a classic Doughnut Shop but on the other never lacking for creativity, the Brioche-style base for Yeasted rings and filled selections now completely dialed in with more substance than Krispy Kreme but far less oil than Dunkin, it was with a simple Glazed selection that the tasting got started and although many will be lured away by fancier things there is no doubt this choice justifies spending a bit more than at the local Albertson's or Von's thanks to the springy base with a good rise and plenty of air pockets. \n\nMoving through two Long Johns and a Cake Donut topped with Children's Cereal, the Cake Doughnuts still amongst the Sin City's best regardless of topping, it was once again here that Roberto and team reaffirmed beliefs that Pink Box's Buttermilk Bar also stands up to any citywide, the base toothsome before melting on the tongue with a good bit of sourness to balance the sweet.\n\nOpting for the Pecan and Orange Buttermilk Bar as a \"+1,\" the Citrus Glaze adding an extra bit of zing with toasted Pecans doing an admirable job of standing up to both Sugar and Sour it was here that Pink Box's newest creation was sampled, their signature Cocoa \"Pink Velvet\" Cake Ring decorated like a Unicorn as \"Instagram-worthy\" as the Poop-emoji predecessor and far lighter thanks to less Frosting while both seasonal Sweet Potato and a still-warm Fritter with plenty of sliced Apples both continue to fare well.\n\nContinuously impressed by the progress Pink Box's Crounts have made from day one, their $2.25 price still a bargain compared to anyone else in town with stacked layers cleanly separated and the outside just a little bit crunchy, it was actually the surprisingly naturally flavored Blueberry version that impressed most on this visit to 7531 West Lake Mead Blvd #110, though the reformulated Elvis with Peanut Butter, Honey and mashed Bananas was also well worth the financial and caloric investment.\n\nRounding out the sampling with four filled selections, none of them new but all quite good, those looking for something besides the artificial fruit \"Glaze\" used as filling elsewhere will find themselves happy to be picking seeds from their teeth after several bites of the Sugared Raspberry Jam Pocket while fans of fall should plan their order around Pumpkin Cheesecake that tastes and feels as though it is filled with the Pumpkin Pie recipe from Dream Whip.\n\n*****Dollar for dollar Pink Box Doughnuts remains a standard bearer for not only Las Vegas but Donut Shops nation-wide, the intention never to compete with the likes of SideCar or Blue Star where prices trend double or triple but to instead offer great fried treats accessible to all with plenty of really good classics alongside plenty of fun and delicious novelties.
