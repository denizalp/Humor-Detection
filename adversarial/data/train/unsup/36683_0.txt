You won't find \"more of the yella\" here   -  (Eddy, Vegas vacation)\nThis place is about the best - as compared to other vegas buffets. but....\n\nIs it perfect, no.\nDoes it cost a lot, yes.\nWill something taste bland - sure\n\nThis is the needle for restaurant pricing.  Left, go to crummier buffets.  Right, go to fine dining\n(Exception to this rule - Wynn)\n\nWhy did I give a 4 vs 3???  We had great service.  \nFrom the guy making omlets to our server.\nBellagio may not be perfect in the food department -  but....\n attention to customer service is a plus and it really shows.\n\nAnd when you find great service in vegas, tip your servers in cash.  and your egg\/omelet cook.
