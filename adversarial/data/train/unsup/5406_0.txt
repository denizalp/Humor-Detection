Awesome service and best vacuum repair on the Westside! Just took both my Hoover vacuums in and was out in about 20 minutes with both vacuums working perfectly!  They had all the parts for my Hoover windtunnel vacuums. Great service, very friendly and knowledgeable.  This is the only vacuum repair shop I have ever gone to and I will continue to keep coming back.  Thanks for all your help today!!!
