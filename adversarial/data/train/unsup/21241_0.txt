My fiance had a gift card to Outback, so we decided to use it for a date night! I don't usually gravitate towards chains, but we gave this a shot! It just so happened that we went on \"No Worries Wednesday\" AND arrived before 7 PM, just in time for Happy Hour! On No Worries Wednesdays, they have a variety of 3-course menu items for $12.99, $16.99, and $19.99. I ordered the house salad (I LOVE their ranch!), a 6oz Outback Sirloin w\/ a loaded baked potato and a mason jar of strawberry shortcake for dessert! ALL of this food was only $12.99!! The steak was super juicy, tender, and spiced to perfection. My fiance got their firecracker salmon and all of the same sides that I got, for $16.99. It was topped with mango salsa that he said was delicious! \n\nOn top of the great food, I HAVE to comment on our service. Katie was one of the best servers that I have had in months. She described everything perfectly, was super passionate about her job, and even brought us extra ranch just because we said that we loved their ranch (we didn't even ask for it!). She timed our food perfectly and made the experience a great one. In addition, the manager stopped by our table to ensure that everything was going well. It was such a nice touch! I overheard other servers and they seemed just as great! Major props to the managing team here for training their employees to be world class! \n\nAll in all, I would definitely come back. It was a super easy date night and the food was delicious, with an unbeatable price. The restaurant was also packed on a Wednesday night so you know that they are doing something right! Thank you Outback!!
