Check in was simple and quick. We got two rooms next to each other right off the elevator area. I was immediately concerned about noise from the elevators but it was not a problem during the night. However, on our last morning, a guest spent 20 minutes outside my door on a telephone call which I easily overheard.\n\nThe rooms are spacious enough. Lighting can be improved as it was still slightly dim with all the lights and lamps turned on. The TV channels available are plentiful which is great. The beds and bedding were decent. The air conditioning is a little loud but I personally did not mind as it acted as white noise for me and helped me sleep. There is a Keurig, microwave and mini fridge in the room as well. Also, charging outlets are plentiful. The alarm clock and the lamp by the beds include 3 outlets and 2 USB charging ports. I was easily able to charge all my devices through the night.\n\nThe bathroom was nice as well. The curved shower rod was a nice touch. Counter space is plentiful. I liked the neutrogena bath products as I have sensitive skin.\n\nThe hotel lobby is extremely welcoming. The lounges, dining area and bar space are aesthetically pleasing and comfortable. Vehicles can drive right up to the hotel entrance, which can be quite dangerous if you walk out quickly through the automatic doors. I saw a child run out as a car was approaching!\n\nAll in all, this hotel met my expectations. Special shout out to the front desk for helping me find the channel to watch my Yankees play.
