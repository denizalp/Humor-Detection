i met up with some friends to enjoy an outside concert by Earl Klugh.  I have listened to him through the years and to actually experience his artistry in person was such a delight.  The weather was just perfect.\n\nOur friends joined low lawn chairs and picnic blankets.  We brought some great snacks like coconut, some cookies, cheese and crackers, melons and of course shared some wine.  It was such a relaxing evening and just perfect under the stars.\n\nI have to admire the band.  The power went out throughout the entire park for a few minutes.  The audience remained calm and soon the power began to come back on in sections.  The band continued to play from where they left off in the song.  \n\nThe layout of the park lends itself to a casual experience, but graded so everyone has a good view.  There are ample sidewalks to navigate the ampitheater.  Most everyone has a good view if even from the side. This venue adds to the quality of life and It makes you proud to know Las Vegas believes in the arts and providing venues such as this.  Thanks, Clark County!\n\nSuch a beautiful evening and a beautiful experience.  I can't wait to go back!
