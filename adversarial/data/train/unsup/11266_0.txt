I have to admit, I did not like the sound of paint monkey at first. I thought, painting with strangers greeeaaattt... Imagine my surprise when I realized that:\n\n1. I didn't have to paint what everyone else was painting (I hate conformity)\n2. There is alcohol\n3. They don't stand there and Bob-Ross you the whole time\n\nI expected boring, monotone, everyone doing the same thing trying to \"put lipstick on a pig\" if you know what I mean.... I got a fun night. That being said, I got a little too tipsy and ended up painting something akin to what it feels like living inside my brain... Inspired---maybe, artistic---probably, something you want to put on your walls---let's just put it this way, I gave my painting to my mom and found it hidden under her dresser 3 weeks later :( LOL.\n\nMy advice, go here and follow directions and you will have a painting that is wall worthy. But, more importantly have fun!
