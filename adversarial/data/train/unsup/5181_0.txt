Being a Zen Buddhist, Condor is familiar with the combination of opposites: ying\/yang; black\/white; those days when Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Model Kim Alexis would not stop calling me. Which leads me to my favorite Irish Pub that serves great Mexican food: Brennan's.\n\nOn the first visit, what brought me to Brennan's was The Sport of Kings, Off Track Betting.  What brought me back was the soft chicken tacos.  What brought me home was a cab because I bet my car on the fifth at Del Mar and lost to some lucky unknown horse named Zenyatta.\n\nOn the second visit, Companion and I were back for the chicken tacos.  The flour tortilla was so fresh, Companion compared it to a soft pita. I compared a part of Companion to a soft pita and she hurled the side red sauce at me.  (Fortunately, the sauce was one of the colors of my Hawaiian print shirt, so the stain wasn't too obvious).\n\nMaking amends over her cranberry Margarita (Recipe: Margarita with a teaspoon of cranberry for color), Companion settled back in to relishing the tacos.  In her state of bliss, she didn't even hesitate when I asked to borrow $60 to bet  a horse named \"Tequila Mockingbird\". Well Boo Radley had a better chance of winning the race and, when informed  of the loss, Companion immediately hurled the side of green sauce at my Hawaiian print shirt. (Again, stain blended right in with the colors).\n\nI will be going back to Brennan's soon,  although after a trip to the Dry Cleaners.
