The Soda Shop is awesome!! Amazing array of drinks and addicting sweet treats. My fav drink is the Big Booty Judy but the popular drink definitely seems to be the Shark Attack. Will be back every day I can make it! Also helps that the owners are laid back and have seemed to have trained the staff very well. 5 stars.
