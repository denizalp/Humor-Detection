Cozy is an understatement. This adorable caf√© in Pointe-Saint-Charles is the kind of place you could spend the whole day without even noticing it pass by. In fact, it's always an added bonus if you visit while it's raining, just so that you have an excuse to stay for a while. Add to that their delicious coffee, ever changing lunch menu and fantastic weekend brunch, and it's no surprise that it drives such a loyal crowd.
