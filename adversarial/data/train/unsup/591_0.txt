I left Amantra thinking it was a [*][*][*][*][*] establishment, but then two days later tried Rick's Good Eats, so I have to grade on a curve and drop a [*]. Don't get me wrong, Amantra is still good, but RGE is on a whole 'notha level. \n\nAlso, Amantra's pricing isn't ridiculous, although the portions are small(ish) plate style. We ended up trying several menu items, because... Why not? \n\nI would recommend the following items:\n+ Butter Chicken Poutine\n\nI could take it or leave it with the following items:\n= Amantra's Spicy Chicken Burger\n= Masala Chicken Quesadilla\n\nI would not recommend the following items:\n- Indian Tacos. Not good. Like... At all.\n\nFantastic customer service. The service from entry to exit kinda carried the whole experience, to be honest.\n\nP. S. To the person who categorized this place as being $$$, you are one petty donkey. The menu is $-$$ depending on what you get.
