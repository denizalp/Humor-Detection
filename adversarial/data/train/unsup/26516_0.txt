It took long enough but I finally decided to try the latest fad: sushi burritos. (Actually, I waited so long it's probably not even a fad anymore, but I digress.)\n\nI decided to go with the Classic Salmon (\"Salmon, Kale, Avocado, Carrot, Red Onion, Sweet Corn, Tempura Bits, Tangerine, Wasabi Tobiko; Sauce: Sriracha Mayo\").\n\nI'll admit it looked very appealing when I first opened the little box it comes in. It's been cut in half and certainly seems to have been assembled with care. And indeed, the first bite was very, very tasty. Everything works; the big chunks of salmon are delicious, while the various components function well together. (Even the tangerine!)\n\nI took a second, equally tasty bite but it was all downhill after that. The integrity of the burrito began to noticeably buckle after the third mouthful and by the time I reached the fifth, it had completely fallen apart on my plate. I was stuck eating individual mouthfuls of the various components with a fork. Not too pleasant.\n\nI figured I would take a different tack with the second half by leaving it in its paper wrapping, but nope, the thing fell apart yet again (albeit not quite as quickly). And given that I paid over $15, this kind of slipshod, careless design is completely unacceptable.\n\nSo color me baffled by the ongoing success of the sushi burrito. I'll never eat another one.
