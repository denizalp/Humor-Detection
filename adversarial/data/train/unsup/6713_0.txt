Sorry Emily I would have to disagree with you. If you are going to go to a strip club you have to be prepared for what comes at you. You should have let loose and had fun with your girls. The dancers are there to entertain and stimulate all your senses. I really liked this club, me any girls went for a birthday party and it was cool. The guys are really, really, really talented if you know what I mean. Matt was really cool, call him if you want a ride to and from your hotel to the club  which makes it great if you want to get your drink on. Now let me get to the dancers. What can I say about the dancers, lets just say I was really entertained. From Batman, Silver Bullet, Slow Lover, Money, to Chocolate. They are all blessed in all areas of seductive dancing, and blessed in other places too!!!... If you want a night of clownin with your girls and you have a few dollars to spend this is your club. It was great for me because I went home and put it on my husband!!!! Thanks guys!!!! I hope to see you in August for my B-Day!!!!!
