It's worth the walk to another area in Terminal 4 to score some delicious and local Cartel Coffee. Travelers are truly spoiled now that Cartel has opened a store inside the airport. This coffee is a gem in Phoenix and I always love to both drink and buy Cartel coffee. Not only is the coffee delicious, but the packets of coffee beans make a perfect gift for the coffee lover in your life. During a recent early morning trip, I left my area of the airport and took a little walk to score a Cartel mocha with non-fat milk. It kept me awake and going for the rest of the very long day and for that I am eternally grateful to this locally shop. Now my advice to every traveler is to do your taste buds a favor and purchase a cup o' Joe from Cartel.\n\nPS - they have locations in the Valley, including one I frequent in Old Town Scottsdale so if you're an out-of-towner make sure you ask about their locations!
