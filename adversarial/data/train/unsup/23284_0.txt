What a surprising, pseudo-swanky fall-into-the-rabbit-hole coffee and dessert place. Grant L took us for a taste of Charlotte.\n\nThe coffee was pretty tasty, and I'm not a dessert eater but the Napoleon looked too decadent to pass up. It was huge, probably 5-6\" long, flaky fresh and stuffed with delicious pastry cream. I couldn't finish half of it. Heaven!\n\nThe star of the show is really the whimsical interior, with a mismatched Alice in Wonderland meets the Mad Hatter meets the Queen of Hearts and Mona Lisa at the pseudo-Versailles kind of vibe. It's bigger than it appears from the outside.\n\nReally for adults of all ages, but it's quiet, cozy, eclectic... full of collegiate and twenty-something hipsters on their laptops and iPads. I guess I fit right in!  ?!? =p
