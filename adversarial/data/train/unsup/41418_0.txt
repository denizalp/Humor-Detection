Tipp's is your average pub, but it doesn't go beyond that.\n\nFood: The food selection is typical pub fare. The preparation and presentation is decent on most items but some, like tacos leave something to be desired in both flavor and quality.\n\nBeer: Typical domestic selection. Try to hit the specials since the normal prices are on the high side: $7\/pint. That being said the specials are usually not that \"special\" either.\n\nService: Waitresses are friendly but on the slow\/inefficient side...\n\nLot's of TVs to watch the games and 2 pool tables.
