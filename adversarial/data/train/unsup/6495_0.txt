Now that was a show!  \n\nWas I a fan of the Jabbawockeez during their quick rise to fame on the show ABDC?\n\nNo.  I cannot get into that show, so don't think it's a necessity to enjoy this show.\n\nAm I a big hip hop fan?\n\nYes, but still...not a necessity.\n\nDo I like getting my money's worth?\n\nHell yes!  \n\nThat's what this show is.  SO worth it!  Entertaining from top to bottom.  \n\nThe music selection was varied, and to my surprise, was much more than just hip hop.  The Jabbawockeez are true performers and masters of their craft in that they can dance to just about anything, and dance they did.
