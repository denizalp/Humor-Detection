Redhead Tidbit: Asians and Africans do not carry the redhead gene. In fact, the only Asian redhead I know is Hwoarang from Tekken - he's not even real. \n\nWe snagged free tickets and honestly, I wasn't too thrilled about seeing this show. I had the impression that Carrot Top would be this creepy-looking, cocky, douchebaggy redhead SOB with lame jokes. Picking up the tickets and finding the theater was confusing. Not even the people that work in Luxor know where it's at. How sad. It's on the same floor as Jabbawockeez, the food court and Taco & Tequila. The box office is to the left of the big white Jabbawockeez mask and the Atrium is where Carrot Top is at. We watched videos of extreme sports and what seemed like 90's episodes of \"America's Funniest Home Videos\"...which ended with animal porn.\n\nMy soul very mistaken about Carrot Top. I was laughing 90-95% of the time. I'm just not too sure what happened on the remaining 5-10%. The show lasted 1.5 hours with an opening act. He had lots of props, cock jokes, dildos, pubes, musical references and whatever the hell is wrong with today's society (i.e. Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber), NASCAR, Chris Angel, Vegas, etc. He made fun of his self and those that made fun of him for being a redhead having cosmetic surgery. I was waiting on jokes from a paricular South Park episode but that didn't happen. It was a lot of information to take in and for him to come up with so many topics and ideas without missing a beat on stage was remarkably incredible.  He kept going on and on, joke after joke, and prop after prop. Shots of Hennessy and music parody towards the end seemed like a filler.\n\nThe only concern I had was that it was super cold in the Atrium. All the seats were taken and I was hoping other people's body heat would help but not really. So, bring a light jacket.
