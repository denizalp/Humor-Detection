Couple donuts from Duck's and sugar rush is sure to kick in !! Maple bacon donut is the bomb, chocolate coconut donut is the second bomb !!\nSuper fresh, soft, warm, sweet and delicious donuts prepared right in front of your eyes.  To be honest I didn't realize these were cake batter donuts until I read some of the reviews here.  Love the taste.  \nA small place in a strip mall, always a little bit crowd, majority of them are kids running around the shop.  They also have couple tables inside to dine in and offer coffee as well.
