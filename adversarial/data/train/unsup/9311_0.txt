A combination of rude, disinterested cocktail waitresses, terrible service, and overall lack of oversight made a late night at the Palms casino my first and last visit. \n\nStrike one came when the cocktail waitress went zooming through the aisles, calling for drinks, but leaving before you could answer. Next, we found out the hard way that, unlike almost all other casinos (especially those off Strip), the Palms charges you for drinks, even if you are playing. Which they do not tell until after you have received your drinks. Finally, all of the machines stopped reading vouchers. That includes the cash out machines. \n\nNormally, I would be fine with a technical malfunction, it happens. But the way the staff handled it was terrible. First, instead of alert in patrons, they waited unto you were obviously having issues. Then, when they arrived at your machine, instead of telling you they were having an issue, they stares blankly at you until you explained the problem. Finally you received a notification that \"oh yes, none of our machines are accepting vouchers right now\". Why didn't you start with that? \n\nThe malfunction included all of the cashier kiosks as well. The casino obviously knew there was an issue, but declined to open any extra Cashier windows, despite this being the only way anyone with vouchers could continue playing. How do you watch a line of more than 20 people start forming and ignore? How do you not respond to something like that?\n\nOverall just terrible management, and not a good casino. Take your money elsewhere.
