The Chandelier is located at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and spans about three floors. This place really looks amazing, it is beautifully designed. The ambiance is classy and luxurious.  This is the biggest chandelier I've ever seen, sparkling and gorgeous. I was admiring this place from the outside, so I took my sister and we went there for a glass of wine. Though they were not very busy when we came, the service was a little disappointing. They were very slow  and inattentive. We waited forever to be served, then I went to the bar and ordered our drinks myself. Kind of  disappointed for that kind of pricey and luxurious place. \nAnyway, I loved the atmosphere so much that will return to try their cocktails as  well. Hope the service will be improved and faster by that time.
