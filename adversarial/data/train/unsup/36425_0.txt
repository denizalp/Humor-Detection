Sadly I've lived in Chandler for almost 10 years and had yet to give Barro's a try. Ended up grabbing some dinner for my family yesterday. We ordered the 6 honey bbq wings, medium pizza (ham and pineapple), and the garlic bread. The pizza was delicious and cooked really well. There was a good amount of toppings (unlike other places where they skimp on the toppings), and the crust we all loved (especially my son who just kept asking for the crust haha). The wings sauce was good and the fry was also good however we did have a piece that seemed like it was over fried (almost too crispy and a bit dry) but 5\/6 is still good in my book. Lastly, the garlic bread was probably the lowlight of the meal. The garlic sauce was good, but the bread itself seemed like it was old and dry.\n\nOverall, I'll give Barro's a try again but will try and pray the garlic bread is fresh :).
