I wouldn't recommend coming here for business lunches.... especially if you only have an hour. It took way to long to take our order and even longer to get our food.  By the time it came, one person had to immediately get a to go box and the rest of us had 15 minutes to eat. \n\nThey were not very busy but I saw the manager busing tables. Grilled chicken was tasteless and fried peppers on my salad were stone cold.
