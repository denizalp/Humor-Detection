Im giving this a 1 star rating because there is no lower rating.\nThe Hummus had a burned taste and left a heavy aftertaste of smokiness.\nThe Tabouleh was DRY\nThe Chicken Shawarma sandwich was tasteless and sloppy.\nThe Shish Tawook Sandwich was DRY and tasteless\nThe Kibbeh was DRY\nThe Cucumber Yogurt Salad was OK\nThe Tiramisu was awful in taste and texture.\nThey were highly understaffed and it took them 45 minutes to approach us!\n\nI will never return and will immediately go back to Kabab Je for any future Mediterranean food craving.....
