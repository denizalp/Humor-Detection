I've eaten here for lunch twice since our office moved across the street.   It is very ambient, service is great and the food is even better.  The best server is Donnie-always attentive and offers assistance when you can't decide on a dish..i am diabetic so i am limited on what i can eat in one sitting-i will be coming back often and dont forget to become a loyalty member.
