It's probably not going to come as a surprise that this Federico's is quite a bit nicer than their Van Buren location.  The prices are slightly higher than Filiberto's or Julioberto's, but I think the quality is worth it, you're not going to leave hungry, and we're still talking pretty cheap for what you get.\n\n*Pro tip- I don't know if they still have it, and if it's only this location, but they used to have a binder at the counter with a list of specialty burritos- one for each state in the United States. If you don't see it- ask, because I've never seen it advertised, but it definitely exists(ed).  The Idaho burrito was awesome.
