We ate here due to the myVEGAS reward of $25 off your bill, and are glad we did. \n\nI ordered the turkey club and fries, while my boyfriend ordered the sliced beef sandwich and the spicy mule. For $14 that mule was strong and very flavorful which made us more acceptable to the price. \n\nThe restaurant was busy, but our waitress was incredibly attentive and polite. The portion sizes are large and filling, making them worth the cost.
