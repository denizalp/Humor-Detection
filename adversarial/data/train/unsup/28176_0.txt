I encountered Ron as an independent contractor in need of health insurance. Ron was knowledgeable, courteous and thorough. Even when I relocated to another state and had to change plans! He provided excellent advice, and an array of options I could choose from that fit my budget and needs. Ron had excellent follow through and customer service throughout. He was accessible by almost every method (call, fax, email) which gave me the flexibility I needed as a business owner. I think Ron's service was amazing and I'd recommend his business with every confidence. Hands down!
