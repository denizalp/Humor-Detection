I am a pig and I love practicing gluttony here. Large poutine + fish po'boy + ginger beer = heaven (oddly, I thought glutton was a sin). I usually hate coleslaw but the stuff they make is out of this world! In any case, I've tried most things on the menu and can recommend all but the mozza sticks. For the poutine, they offer Daiya and mushroom gravy to make it vegan.\n\nI don't eat here enough, but for good reasons. I am always bursting full and happy after.
