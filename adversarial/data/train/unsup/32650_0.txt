I don't like the Beatles music so don't kill me. The songs honestly put me to sleep, especially if I'm tired. Some people love the show even if they're not a fan of the Beatles, but it just doesn't apply to me.\n\nGranted, depending on how many Cirque shows you've seen, your opinion will differ. If it's a first Cirque show, or even their first acrobatics show, this'll probably blow their mind.\n\nIt's just not my thing. Each specific Beatles song has choreography made just for that song so all the action is in relation to the song and how Cirque interprets it. All the music is digitally remastered (or something along those lines - don't remember well from the backstage tour) so no one is singing live, as opposed to some of the other Cirque shows.\n\nI've watched this a total of 3 times and it's honestly not my thing, but if you're a Beatles fan, I'd recommend it. Heck, if you want this to be your first Cirque show, go for it; you'll enjoy it a lot more than I, someone who's watched all the Cirque shows in Vegas. A lot of people honestly love this show (they've watched like 8+ times).\n\nAS FAR AS BUYING TICKETS\/PRICES:\nThere are multiple avenues to buying tickets but if you need to switch your seats later or need some sort of accommodation (maybe you need a different day or you have some sort of emergency), then you'll want to buy it directly from the Mirage \/ MGM Resorts. If you're going to buy it from a third party vendor (kiosks or non-mirage websites), you're out of luck for that for the most part, even if they are cheaper. However, the counter sometimes offers discounts and it doesn't hurt to ask what the discount for the day is. Sign up for the MLIFE players card and you get discounts & points for buying tickets. Military, student, & hotel guests also get discounts. You just have to ask for it. BE NICE to the reps because they're the ones showing & giving you the seats.
