This place is super clean and offers very comfortable, generous seating. I've personally not tried any of the concessions so I can't speak on those. But there is a Hickory Tavern (pretty decent food) and a Sweet Frog (frozen yogurt) nearby that I usually go to for a meal before the movie and a snack afterwards. This theater plays current movie titles, but sometimes it can be busy during the week with mom groups and little kids for the morning\/afternoon movies. \nThe shopping center has recently reconfigured the parking to accommodate a new building being build literally in front of the movie theater, so parking can sometimes be a struggle, especially if you try to go see a movie while it's raining :-\/ \nBut overall, it's a great place to visit. Union county needed something like this and I just hope it continues to remain a great place to go, and stays safe for children and teenagers.
