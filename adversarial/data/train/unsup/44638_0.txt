Hahaha, good times here! \n\nOrdered our food, got a seat by the front windows, and promptly fell asleep for a short little nap.\n\nWhen I came to, my burger was still sitting there in tact on my tray, but my sister was still nowhere to be found. Turns out she was still in the bathroom, out of it, and having vomited. \n\nGross! \n\nwhen she recovered, we managed to eat our food slowly, and oddly enough, in peace in our seats by the entrance. \n\nNo one bothered us. We didn't have anyone rowdy being obnoxious. \n\nFood was solid -- for a burger and fries. Can't go wrong. Service was fast. Guess we came at a time when there wasn't any line.
