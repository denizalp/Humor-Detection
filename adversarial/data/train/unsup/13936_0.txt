Dim Sum at a good price depending what time you go.\n\nThe reason I came to the restaurant is b\/c I was told that it has one of the best dim sum in the Scarborough area, if not in the GTA. To a point the people who told me were partially right. Maybe in the Scaborough area but not in the GTA.\n\nConsidering alot of people had given me alot of hype about this place I was very disappointed not necessarily with the food but more so with the decor. I feel that when going to a place to eat 20% of the experience should come from what you see, decoration, colour cleanliness etc . I was expecting a very well decorated place with lots of lively colours however the colours were very bland and very depressing.  The tables and chairs were drapped with cloth but nothing that would catch you're eye. The place was clean however right down to the floors and even the bathrooms.\n\nThe staff were very friendly especially the one guy who I believe was the one in charge at that time. He was very prompt, friendly, good at making  conversation, and gave us a a tip on not to double up on the dim sum. I was curious as to why he said that but I would soon find out.\n\nThe reason he told us not to double up was b\/c the dim sum is huge! I usually double up my orders on some of my favourite dim sum items b\/c it's never enough for me and my friends and family. But just one piece of let say, shu mai, was equal to two pieces anywhere else. Which was great b\/c I was full and it didn't cost me as much! As well the filling is jam packed, lets take for instance, har gow. In most places you have a tiny filling that moves around easily if you were to shake it. At this place the filling doesnt move b\/c its that jam packed. \n\nThe best time and days to go to this place would be monday thru friday from 1430hrs - 1600hrs. The reason being is b\/c theres no one there and the dim sum prices are alot cheaper. If you go during the weekend, good luck getting a table and any service b\/c it is rammed! Mind you that's really any dim sum place in the GTA on a weekend.\n\nI would definetly come back here but only if I happen to be in the area and craving dim sum at that time.\n\nItems to definetly get\n\n- DIM SUM!
