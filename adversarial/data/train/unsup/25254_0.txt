It looks like a good idea, but horribly executed and lacking a sense of a process in general. The client portal (tool used to make reservations) is clunky and unintuitive. Details given by phone about my meet & greet with the dog sitter were different from those sent by email, so that got us off on the wrong foot. The website gave a rate, but when I was sent the invoice I discovered there was a different rate for the high season (which the website makes no mention of). Was tried to charge an extra day... then was tried to charge as if my dog was a large dog (he's a medium mix). Lastly, when I first went to pick up my dog at the agreed hour, the dogsitter was unavailable... no notice or apology given.
