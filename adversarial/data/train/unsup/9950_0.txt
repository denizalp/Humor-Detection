A group of friends and I went there around 9 p.m. on a Sunday, and it was a horrible experience.\n\nI ordered a steak quesadilla. It was just OK. But that wasn't the bad part.\n\nWe noticed a man and woman making out and inappropriately touching each other in the corner of the dining area while drinking, which was uncomfortable. Then we realized they were both wearing San Felipe's shirts and were, in fact, working at the time.\n\nThe making out got worse and turned into inexcusable, inappropriate sexual acts. They were both clothed, but it was still extremely inappropriate. The whole bar was looking away disgusted.\n\nWhen I asked a bartender if they worked there and asked to see a manager, she said nothing was wrong. In fact, her response was, \"Technically she can take her top off and it would be OK.\"\n\nShe pointed out the manager who was actually watching these gross acts and smiling.\n\nUnprofessional. I'm never going back.
