still love this place! \nlast time we visited we went just before close which is a good idea, less crowd. \n\nbut i could really linger here in the different alcoves for hours, and hours...one thing i don't care for is the tank with the rays. they obviously don't like to be touched, it seems kinda cruel :[ \n\nmy only other complaint is that you used to be able to watch \"shark tv\" in your room. now it's just one big infomercial, with a huge advertising banner, WHACK!!! we used to leave it on all the time, like our own personal aquarium and make up skits for the fishies, lol. \n\nbut i digress, it's cheap, it's soothing, it's educational...i still likey very much!
