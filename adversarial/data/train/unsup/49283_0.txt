My wife and I have eaten Lebanese food in the Middle East, in London and on the West Coast. This restaurant's food is outstanding. Their humus was absolutely delicious and the portion was very generous. The falafel was perfect and not at all greasy. We shared a gyro sandwich straight from the rotating grill. Once again, a taste treat and it proved more than sufficient for two. The meal was topped off with a piece of pistacchio baklava and a rice pudding, both delicious. The service was friendly and professional. It is a family affair and well done. Without a doubt we shall return often.
