The Madhouse brand cannot be more different when comparing the Eastern location to the Desert Inn location. BOTH are great when it comes to blended drinks, quality of food, and quality of all menu items. \nThe Eastern location is far more laid back and inviting to all types of people. I enjoy this location more when I'm just trying to relax or have a conversation! When you want to people watch, DI if far more interesting. \nMadhouse is great! Come enjoy the fun!
