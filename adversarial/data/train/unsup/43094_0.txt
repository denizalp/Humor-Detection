Loved-this-place\n\nIt was peaceful from the minute we walked in until the minute we left.  The decor is really nice right down to the color scheme.  I loved the layout of the rooms - and the rooftop pool was really fun.  It was *super windy* the day we were there so we just hung out in some lounge chairs and took in the views.  \n\nI never heard another door, guest, bump, conversation, etc the whole time I was there - it was really quiet which I value in Vegas.  I don't like the casino hotels to stay in. \n\nWe walked to dinner which was nice.  The breakfast buffet was just what we needed prior to hitting the road to our final destination - which was San Diego.  \n\nI will DEFINITELY stay in this hotel when I come back to Las Vegas.
