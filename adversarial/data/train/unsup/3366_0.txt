I now understand why their lease wasn't allowed to renew at their prior location at Harbour Front - horrid business attitudes inclusive of abusive 'customer service'.\nI was there on a Saturday at 5:30-5:45pm to buy a gift for my niece. I was worried they might be closed as most placed do on Saturdays. They were.There was another couple who were trying the door and looking for the hours. There are no hours posted so I checked Yelp which said they close at 7pm. I went back the next day right after church, so I might not have checked my watch but it must have been around 12:40. They were still closed. The hours are supposedly from 11am-5pm Sunday's. I called on Monday as I didn't want to waste a third trip and as the place was recommended by my sister who knew them when they were at Harbour Front I thought it still worth the effort. After 7 rings someone answered. I asked if they were open and got an 'of course'. I said that I wanted to be sure as they were closed the last two times. I was told they \"can't all be soldiers\". I suggested a note on the window for their customers was the least they could have done when they closed early Saturday so I didn't waste another trip. The guy started screaming that it was impossible that I was there Saturday (along with the other perplexed couple). The owner continued to scream as to how unreasonable my suggestion was.\nI suggest you do what I plan to do ; look elsewhere and do not support such bad customer practices and abhorrent behaviour. I had not once raised my voice or said anything that could possibly be construed as rude and to have a screaming fit from this person....
