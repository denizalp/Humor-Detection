Loved Hurley's.  Came for a quick drink and a bite before our flight back to Vancouver and thoroughly enjoyed the sunny patio and great atmosphere.  I had the poutine but it was quite sweet so not too impressed (I think they cooked the fries in the same oil as my friends yam fries, yuck).  The waitress was kinda pissed at me for not loving the poutine exclaiming \"but we're known for our poutine\".  Anyway, I still really enjoyed it there and will make it a definite go-to place next time I'm in town.
