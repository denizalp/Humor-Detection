On vacation in Vegas and after a long flight and a long day I went out to eat finishing up a little before 10pm, and shortly after I located this massage place that was 24 hour on yelp so I called before I drove from my hotel, and was told that they had two people available to give two massages. So, my fianc√© and myself drove 5 minutes to get there and once we arrived we rung the door bell and seen someone approach the door behind the advertisement however it was never opened so we waited two more minutes and rung the door bell again and once again we saw someone approach the door and look out at us and proceeded to walk away. I then called them back and notified them that I just called and was told that they told me they had two people available for massages and the lady told me they're busy now and i said but I just called less than 5 minutes ago they're busy that fast? And she just said yeah and hung up on my face. I feel that once they saw two African Americans they no longer wanted to provide us their services! I WISH I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS!! Customer service here sucks, even from the first time I called she just hung up in my face after I said I would be coming.
