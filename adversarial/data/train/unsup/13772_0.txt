Gordas' fish tacos are on par with Wahoos in SoCal and The Hula Grill in Waikiki.\nIf you want to taste one of the best fish tacos in all of Phoenix Metro, pack-up the kids, dog and grandma and head for Gordas.\n\nGordas delights on so many levels, I have to give it my highest Diego rating in the history of e.v.e.r. They're just that good.\n\nOn a personal note, I'd like to encourage anyone reading this to try Gordas at least once. Mainly because I know you'll be hooked on them like I was, increasing the likelihood Gordas will grow and flourish and I get to continue to enjoy the place.\n\nThe restaurant business is tough, with it's 95% failure rate.\nTo let a restaurant like Gordas succumb to these sobering stats due to a lack of customers would be an outright travesty. Especially when they're this good.\nIn short, I hope Gordas becomes the Wahoos of Phoenix, they deserve it.\n\nIf you want a taco, forget Jack-in-the-box, or any 'mexican' joint claiming a 'berto' in its suffix, there's really only one place to go.\nGordas.\n\nPS\nBy the way, your wife can come with you, grandma and the dog too, but only on the condition that she take a big healthy whiff of the fish taco before eating it. \nMaybe then she'll finally appreciate what you've gone through all these years.
