I have been involved in education in Clark County for 25 years in a variety of capacities.  This school is the most well run school that I have every experienced.  They are organized, excellent in coordinating communications with students, teachers and parents, and have above all, recruited an OUTSTANDING team of teachers who know how to individualize & inspire learning, and offer students respect and most of all, are able to honor student individuality.  \n\nMy son came from five years of magnet school, two previous charter schools wherein he was bullied by student and teachers.  He was checked out of academics and had low self esteem.  After only one semester at this school, he is re-engaged in his education, oves learning again, is student body Treasurer and is excited about his future career.  \n\nI can not say enough about this school and the professionalism, exceptional efficiency and effectiveness offered to students and families in our community.  \n\nBravo to Somerset leadership, faculty and staff!!!  After 13 years of parenting, it is a wonderful breath of fresh air!
