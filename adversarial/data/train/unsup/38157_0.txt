Gyro Pita was a disappointment. The pita was hard on the edges and did not seem fresh. The sauce was very sour.  Do not order Greek Fries...they were old and soooo bad.  They used old Oreida crinkle cut fries The table was dirty and as I was eating, a fly crawled out from under the plate. \nGo to the one by Chandler Fashion or express location on Kyrene and Warner.
