I ordered the 4 pc broasted chicken for $12.99. Comes with two sides - I chose Spicy Corn and fries - and cornbread... or so I thought. I didn't get any cornbread, instead stole half from a co-worker.\n\nIn a previous Yelper's photo, I saw there was some shredded cheese sprinkled on the cornbread. When I called to place the to-go order, I asked them to not include cheese on the cornbread, to which I was told they no longer are doing that.\n\nThe cornbread is moist yet crumbly, light honey flavor and baked golden brown. It's up there with the dangerously caloric Famous Dave's and Liliana's versions.\n\nMy broasted chicken was one large breast, two smaller wings, and a leg. All except for the leg were white meat. The menu specifically states it's a combination. The skin was fried crisp, the meat tender and flavorful. I was skeptical, but the predominant smokehouse menu know it's stuff.\n\nThe fries were skin-on potato, trumping the average run-of-the-mill steak fries at most establishments. The spicy corn is indeed spicy, not for your average mid-westerners' palate. I'd rate that a level 3 out of 5.\n\nThe group order came with their own Styrofoam container of sauces; House, Sweet & Saucy, Chipotle, and Bourbon. My favorite was the Chipotle, smokey and sassy!\n\nClearly they have some kinks that need working out. Do not fret, the food will be a saving grace methinks. I would like to go back and see what they've done with the place since it was Casa del Sol and try their brew.
