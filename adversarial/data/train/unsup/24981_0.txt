I saw the tiniest guy with the largest wang here. I mean, really... he was about 5'2\" with a 9 incher. And he snaked around the stripper pole like his life is hanging from it. I have never seen anyone do splits like him either, male or female. The U.S. Olympic gymnastics team ain't got shit on this guy. \n\nThey only had Absolut and Smirnoff on the day we went (in the vodka selections). Hell no, I ain't drinking that crap. So, I ordered water. \n\nThe other dancers were OK. But Mr. tiny man with humongous wang stole the show.
