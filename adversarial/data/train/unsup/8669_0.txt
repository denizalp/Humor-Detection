The best time to dine here is on a weeknight during happy hour when the weather is favorable for dining on the patio. Happy hour menu offers plenty of food and beverage options that are all pretty tasty. Service is quick and friendly. Outdoor fireplaces and fire pits are spaced around the patio in case you get chilly.
