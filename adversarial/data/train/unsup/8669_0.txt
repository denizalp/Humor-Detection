I had an accident on 485.  My insurance company sent this company to tow my van.  I did not see the theft but when I went to retrieve items out of my van at the assessment yard, (a different area), my rearview mirror was torn out of my van.  Hanging on my mirror were campaign buttons for Pres. Obama.  My buttons were all bent.  My son's baseball cap was missing, along with a gas card, a rewards card.  My cargo tray was missing out of the back.  I could go on and on.  At the assessment yard, there was a picture of how my van was received and it was in this condition.  Again, I did not see the actual theft but the red and blue flag I noticed at Hooked makes me wonder.  If I had not been on the highway, during rush hour, or having to find a ride home, I would have removed ALL my valuables before leaving my van.  Lesson learned.\n\nAfter receiving a note from the owner, I will add what I told him:  I will leave my vehicle on the the roadside before utilizing their service again!!!
