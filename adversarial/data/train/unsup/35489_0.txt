Food wasn't good too greasy. The seafood entree had way too much oil on felt like I was eating seafood with grease. The stake as well very greasy with butter on top and a lard or oil underneath the steak. Salad as well covered with oil and garlic (really heavy on the oil). Don't think I'll want to go back. Nice atmosphere though.
