My boyfriend and I chose this resaurant from a blog posting on Toronto.com ( http:\/\/m.toronto.com\/articles\/best-all-you-can-eat-sushi-in-toronto\/ ) we've been to quite a few AYCE restaurants over the last year, and I can honestly say that the woman who wrote that should stop reviewing sushi ASAP. \n                        \nFirst thing we noticed was the 1.5hr time limit and any uneaten food will be charged full price for, which is typical. \nWe sat down and were not offered any water or tea, which every other restaurant we've been to has had. We both ordered a pop which came in the form of an unopened can with a straw tucked under the tab ($2 each-we found out later) we still found it rather odd they did not offer water, it was even +30c out with the patio window wide open. \nWe ordered a Philadelphia\/spicy salmon\/green dragon roll to start, the rolls had so much rice we could barely fit them in our mouths. The fish\/rice ratio was so off that we figured this was their way of filling you up so you order less. We also ordered the Rock Shrimp which we had heard was good, and it was..(woo)       \nWhen we wanted to place our next order neither of the two disinterested waitresses were around, one in the kitchen and one sitting at the back on the phone. Our final order was Unagi\/fire\/volcano roll and fried scallops...as soon as this was set in front of us we were so put off by the huge amount of rice on the rolls we just wanted to leave. We asked for some water, and two glasses of lukewarm tap water were plopped down in front of us without a word, the only time they offered a refill was when we asked for the bill. Needless to say we did not add a tip. \n\n\n- Poor service- disinterested waitresses\n\n- Poor quality- found salmon fat in roll, rice ratio off\n\n- Ridiculous drink price\n\n- Price isn't worth it...no price is worth it. \n\n\nI am literally writing this as my bf lays in bed with stomach pains. This place has completely turned us off of sushi for a while.\n\n\nI recommend Sushi Kiku at hwy 7\/leslie .
