Three pieces of roasted chicken, a good size delicious Caesar salad, tasty cornbread, and a scrumptious sweet potato dish that I would shove your grandma out of the way to get to first, all for $6.79. Are you kidding me? This is the gold standard of the fast food world!\n\nIs it fine dining time at the Boston Market? Of course not, but it is pretty stellar for fast food. Me likey.
