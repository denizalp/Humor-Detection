Louis did an awesome job on my nails. This is the first time I've gotten acrylic nails in Wisconsin and I was worried that the Midwest wasn't going to have the same skills as Texas, but I was happily surprised. Also, the price wasn't bad at all! $50 for a full set. \n\nI showed Louis a picture of the shape I wanted, and he gave me exactly what I wanted. They have a huge selection of colors too. For acrylic they use a clear acrylic powder and then use gel to color them whatever you want. In the past I've had color powder, but their method seems to work just as well. The whole process took about an hour and a half. \n\nMy only criticism is that they weren't super friendly. My friend came along with me and they made her feel quite unwelcome sitting next to me and not getting her nails done. \n\nI'll definitely be back, but next time I'll wear headphones and not bring company.
