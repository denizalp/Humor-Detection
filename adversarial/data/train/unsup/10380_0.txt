Stopped in for a cocktail (or four) before heading down to the Smith Center.  Parked of the street in a lot on the south side of the building. Be sure to lock you vehicle and take our belongings   My group was the only ones in the bar.  The decor can be whatever you want to define it as, I found it to be sort of a hipstery, gothic sort of place.\n\nThe two bartenders were friendly and very knowledgable in the ages old form of mixology.  I settled in and doused my soul with several Negroni's (gin, vermouth, campari, and a slightly seared orange peel).\n\nThere other exotic and interesting drinks I tried were both different and tasty.  I look forward to going back.
