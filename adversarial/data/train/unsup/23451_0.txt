I was  a fan when they were just a food truck and im even more of a fan now. This location is great for them, its spacious, booth or table seating. You order at the counter and pay and then they ask for a silly nick name for your order. I got the #2 burger \"egg burger\". Ive never tasted anything like it, The crispy onions and eggs are what made the burger unique and delicious all at once! I got the jazz fries, Personally i LOVE them, my bf on the other hand thought the sauce was a bit too sweet. The service is great too, cashier was friendly and made suggestions on what to order when we asked. If your looking for something quick and easy at the strip there is no better place to go! Maybe just a delicious burger, still the way to go (:
