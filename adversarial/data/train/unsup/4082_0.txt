I was really excited to visit The Jester on Yonge, because it was somewhere that looked great and years ago I had passed it every morning on the way to work.  That illusion died on St. Patrick's Day.  I walked into the bar right before last call and ordered a round of beers & shots for my four com-padres at the bar.  After my tip, the bill came to $100+ dollars.  Fine, it's St. Patrick's Day, I'm happy to do it for my friends.\n\nI sit down with our last drinks of the night, do a shot, and then head to the bathroom for literally 2 minutes.  When I get back upstairs, my friend is getting kicked out because he had started to fall asleep.\n\nListen, I get it, you can't sleep at a bar, but it was a long day and we had not been there for five minutes after I had just spent over 100 dollars in this place.  Immediately, our waitress kicks up a fuss.  Now we weren't loud and the 4 other people in the bar hadn't complained.  We were just five guys, celebrating the end of the night quietly in a booth.  Nope, he was out on his ass and that also meant one of our buddies was going to have to be out too because the bar wasn't liable for a guy outside falling asleep.  Granted, he may have had a little too much, but he was quiet and wasn't causing a scene.\n\nWe quickly tried to down the rest of our beer, but that wasn't happening.  And after some protests to \"why\"? We all left the bar leaving two wounded soldiers on the battlefield (2 beers).\n\nHere's the deal - I get that it's policy, and I understand that drunken displays aren't warranted, but we're respectful guys who had a great St. Patrick's Day and just wanted to end it with one last drink.  And because we were treated like raging frat boys in a bar completely dead on St. Paddy's, I will never be going back to spend money here again.
