\"Though the truth may vary\n\"This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore\"\n\n-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------\n\nIn A Sentence™\n(A) Tropical Smoothie Café® that features a 24-hour drive thru and offers food around the clock.\n\nQuick Review™\n+   24-hours. Service in the morning is outstanding. \n\n+   Smoothies are delicious. Enough sugar to keep one awake at work or during other equivalent mundane activities.    \n\nEmployee of Excellence™ \n^ N\/A. All these ladies are all good. Except that one time they stiffed me on the Sun Chip®\/side item for a sandwich. I won't be forgetting that bag of chips anytime soon!\n\n-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------\n\nWhat are we talking about here?

Recommended as the TSC with the best service in the valley.\n\n-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------\n\nNot good for Tourists.\nGood for Kids.\nGood for Dogs.\n\nRating: Four-stars,  \"Yay!
