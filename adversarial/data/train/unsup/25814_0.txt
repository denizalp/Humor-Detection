Ok convention space located near Pearson--Toronto International Airport. The location is serviced by TTC buses, but for folks coming by public transit, it is essentially in the middle of nowhere. However, if folks are coming from the suburban GTA, it is highly accessible by car. I'm a downtown urban cyclist, so I do find that this place is rather distant. \n\nThe upside to it being out-of-the-way is that it is cheaper to rent, so show tickets are generally cheaper as well. With many hotels located within walking distance, this is a good facility for events that expect many or most attendees  to be from out-of-town.
