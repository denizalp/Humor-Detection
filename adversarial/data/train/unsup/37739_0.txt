This restaurant completely changed my view of BBQ. Coming from SoCal, I've always thought the best BBQ was in San Diego (Coup's and Phil's BBQ). Little Miss BBQ blows them out of the water and sets the bar to another level of BBQ.\n\nMy boyfriend told me he was going to take me to Little Miss BBQ and said it was \"the best BBQ,\" which was quite a claim to make. For the few times, he is right: Little Miss BBQ is the best best BBQ I've ever ever had.\n\nEven in the blistering 110 deg heat, lines started to form around the shop 20 minutes before it opened at 11AM. They gave out free cold bottle water and passed out samples of the sausages intermittently, which only teased us even more with their tasty food. All the staff here are friendly and would come out to your table to ask how your experience was and talk to people waiting in line. From the line, you can see the rows of large BBQ\/ smoke pits they use to cook their meats. Each smoker was large enough to smoke any pig, cow, or me in it. Impressive.\n\nThe line moves slowly as there is only one assembly line for food and cashier. Even though we came in 20 minutes before it opened, we were in line for a good hour at least! But believe me, it is worth the wait. When you get into the shop, you'll see the guy hand carve the meat for you. We got the sausage, brisket, pulled pork, and pork ribs. Everything is sold by the pound or per sausage. It was quite convenient as you can customize how much food you want. By far, our favorite was the brisket. It was so tender and juicy; you'll see when the carver slices through the meat like tomatoes.\n\nFor the Arizona visitors, this is a must eat spot!
