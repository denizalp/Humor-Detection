What a wonderful little place!  I emphasize, little place.  It is quite small inside, but the wonderful food makes up for it!!  \n\nWe started off with the Stuffed Banana Peppers and Calamari.  I honestly have NEVER tasted such amazing Calamari in my life!  (Maybe in Italy, but not here)  You have to try them, perfectly battered and lightly fried.  And their marinara sauce was excellent!  The Banana Peppers were very good and very hot!  \n\nNext we had decent salads with tasty dressing.  Then for our entrees Nick had Linguini with White Clam Sauce and I must say it wasn't your typical clam sauce!  I think they put some white wine in it.....it was excellent (as I had to try some).  I got the Veal Romano.  OMG, what a very different way to prepare this dish.  They didn't use eggs and the White Lemon Sauce was incredibile!!!
