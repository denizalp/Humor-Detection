So glad to have a LVAC right down the road from me.  BUT with that said, this is probably one of the worst newer LVACs in town. With it being the ONLY LVAC on this part of town, why didnt they make it bigger? Although there is a variety of equipment, its scrunched in tiny areas and with it being the only one on this side of town, its crowded as hell.... leaving you to either wait for a machine to be open or someone waiting on you to finish. For a good u interupted workout, I end up driving to the N. Rainbow LVAC. So disappointed.
