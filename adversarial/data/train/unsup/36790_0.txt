Rude and useless staff. I wanted to buy a small bouquet to bring to the restaurant for our 10th anniversary. Although I repeated the bouquet should be small not to clutter our space, they kept offering me large arrangements, potted plants, etc. When they saw they would not make an easy sale, they turned their back  on me and ignored me. I went to one of their competitors in the neighbourhood and got exactly want i wanted. I will never go back.
