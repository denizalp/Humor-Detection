To be blunt, this place sounds WAAAAY more expensive and upscale than it is.  (Hint, hint Centurion:  change your name.)\n\nI had looked at the menu (without prices) and the name and the two \"$$\" about a million times and completely doubted the truth of the two \"$$\" signs because no place with that name or that fru-fru webpage could be affordable.\n\nThen today it popped up on Yelp as the closest place to eat and I said to the hubby, \"Gosh dangit - we just have to bite the bullet and go!\"\n\nI had to give it three stars because 1.  We were broken-hearted we could not have pizza and\/or lunch menu items and 2.  My goat cheese and fig waffle was a little on the dry side.  \n\nHOWEVER... it was tasty.\n\nMy husband had the chorizo, fried egg, yada yada omelet and scarfed it all down before I could even say, \"Don't you hate fried eggs?\"\n\nIt was a beautiful day outside and our waitress was sweet.  We had a good time and look forward to having some more savory eats when the full menu is available.\n\nWith regard to price:  COMPLETELY reasonable.\n\nWith regard to the name suiting the venue?  Not.  at.  all.
