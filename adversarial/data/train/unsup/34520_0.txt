I've been here a few times, and it's always delivered. There are better steakhouses, but this place is tops for \"bang for the buck\", this is not to say it's cheap, just great value. I've had great steaks, and last time, some great Ahi Tuna, it was a perfect meal. And the atmosphere is top notch, a comfortable hip feel.
