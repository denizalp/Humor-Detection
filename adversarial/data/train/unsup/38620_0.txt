Thank you to everybody at Omni!! I used a limo service because bringing the family with me on a work trip I just wanted everything to be seamless at the airport and not have to spend energy waiting for taxis or tracking down an uber. Booking was super easy. I had a question about a car seat for our 2 year old and they responded via email at 9pm at night 15 minutes after I sent them an email. They called me the morning of to confirm everything. When we arrived we were all tired since it was a late flight. They had a name sign for us and we quickly grabbed our bags and were in our limo. The drivers were courteous both ways and asked if they could get us anything. Plus, they did not charge for the car seat. I looked at several companies and they had the best rates. Will definitely use them again next time in Vegas. One tip: Ask the driver before you leave the airport\/hotel if their credit card square machine is working so you don't have to hit the ATM at your destination. This happened to us on our way to the hotel. Fortunately I had cash so didn't have to use the hotel ATM. Outside of that,
