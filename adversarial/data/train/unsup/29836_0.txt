Traveling through Montreal and had to get a fix of poutine. What better place than this!  We decided to try two of their dozens of options and we ended up with La Général Mao (nice and spicy), and La Jacqueline (can't go wrong with bacon). There are two sizes. The small one will absolutely fill you up and then some - fortunately our waitress kept me from making the mistake of ordering two larges for the two of us! The large is really only for sharing. Fun place - would love to go back.
