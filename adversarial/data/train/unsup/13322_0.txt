Gunnar V (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/lahore-tikka-house-toronto#hrid:cZ2W_U6AOJZTkmQ5nTs0LQ) said it best. There are two types of people...those who like LTH, and those who don't. Put me in the latter camp.\n\nPros; They serve \"food\".\nCons; \n-Said food is incredibly oily. Unbelievably. I'd NEVER seen so much oil.\n-Feel like an appetizer? Hope you like samosas. (The only choice). Hope it's a weekend. (Only available then.)\n-The food IS tasty. I'll give them that. Problem is, it all tastes the same.\n-The aloo gobi on the \"Combo sizzler\" was one large piece of overcooked cauliflower, and I believe my wife got the piece of potato.\n-Presentation is horrific.\n-Mango lassis are served out of a large dispenser. Not horrible, but far from good.\n-The floor is VERY slippery. I assume it is oil tracked from the kitchen on the servers shoes. BE CAREFUL.\n-Despite NUMEROUS servers, you go to the cashier to order.\n-Plastic furniture.\n\nThe following is not just a \"con\", it's a deal breaker. All food is eaten off of disposable foam plates with plastic knives and forks. Water is offered in foam cups, lassi in disposable plastic cups. Imagine the garbage this place produces.\n\nI won't be back.
