Oh my! Ive missed you Dunk! I've been back twice since my last review! Dunkin has stepped up to the plate and made some great changes! \n1. New microphone in the drive thru that is crystal clear for ordering! Updated sign for the menu too!\n2. Great customer service and happy staff!\n3. Perfectly delicious presentation and fresh yummy donuts! \n\nI love the new outdoor tables and umbrellas and the  white lights hung for a special ambiance! \nI have to say I am impressed by the quick change and caring enough about your customers and business to make these quick but important changes! \nMy heart is yours again Dunk!
