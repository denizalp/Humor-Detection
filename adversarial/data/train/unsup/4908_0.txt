After several visits to Windy City since my initial visit, I'm still a fan. I have yet to try anything other than their deep dish pizza but I had the privilege of watching someone attempt and complete the Sears Tower Eating Challenge, which was disgusting and amazing all at once. The man was able to eat over seven pounds of Italian beef, sausage with peppers in bread with a side of fries. Someone really chose to attempt this? It was insane to watch but definitely entertaining. \n\nCan't wait to try more of their menu soon.
