Walked into the park yesterday to the sound of Native music and found a ceremony taking place. Children had gathered in a circle and a woman, dressed in traditional garb was beating a drum and chanting with those around her. Local kids were involved in the fun and many spectators peered on with curiosity. The sun was shining and dogs and their owners passed by left and right. \n\nThe subway rumbled below and the thought of thousands of people, on their urban journey, at this very moment, came to mind. \n\nWhether it is seniors doing tai chi, the homeless passed out on benches or lovers sprawled out on the vast green expanse, this park captures the city's essence. \n\nIn Christie Pits, you are truly a part of Toronto.
