I've lost all faith in online reviews and other people's recommendations. You've got a 4.9 on Google??? This has to be all your networking friends.\n\nFirst off, I'd like to say I liked the remodel of the building and the employees were very nice. \n\n I hate to be the first one to leave you a 1 star,  but your tacos were the most unauthentic tacos I've ever had. I sincerely mean that. I actually left after eating the tacos here and went to another taco stand afterwards. \n\n You buy your meat pre prepared like we all can from Food City. Your salsa tasted like El Paso; probably bought from Restaurant Depot. The tortillas... you didn't even grill the tortillas?! You served them right out of the bag at room temperature. You're obviously here for the money like some of the other Chandler restaurant owners. You should raise your prices while you're at it. I bet these dumb people would still come and be thrilled with the imitation product. I'll have to give this Ghett' Yo Tacos some serious props for their choice of location, because the locals don't know what real street tacos are.
