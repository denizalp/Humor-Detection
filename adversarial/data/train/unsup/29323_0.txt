6pm Thursday October 5, 2017.\nI dove up & one of the workers there greeted me \"Buenas tardes, ¿En que le puedo ayudar?\". \nI told him that I had a bubble on one of my front tires but did not know which one. He felt them and said \"it's on the passenger side.\" \nFor $35 I got a used tire, my problem is fixed temporarily because I see cracks near the rim. \nI was in and out in less than 10 minutes there was another car that they were working on when I got there. I have been to other places and waited 45 min to an hour and paid more for less quality. \nThey speak English as well as Spanish. \n\nLes pongo 2estrellas más si me dan una llanta nueva, como la que me pusieron hace 2 semanas. Las dos me costaron igual, a $35 dólares.
