Light dinner on an easygoing Saturday afternoon. \n\nWe popped in here when my boyfriend and I decided that there weren't any good vegetarian selections in the food court. When I looked at the menu, I realized that the prices here are better than what you'd normally get sitting in a noisy crowd in a mall.  The boyfriend got a veg bun, our friend a small rare beef pho and I ordered a curry vegetable and tofu with steamed rice ($5.95). Strangely, my dish had absolutely no curry but it was pretty yummy. The tofu pockets were marinated in soy sauce and the rice was garnished with green onions, which I love. I am not a fan of bok choy, but the veggies that I got were super fresh and cooked perfectly. \n\nThree mains and an appetizer only came to $25 after tax! Great deal and comfortable seating. Staff here is amazingly polite and will actually smile at you, especially when you make your white boyfriend close the bill in Cantonese.\n\nBONUS: Vegetarian 'fish' sauce available here and it was so yummy I poured if all over my white rice!
