Worst delivery service I've ever had! Buying the rest of my furniture online now from a website instead. I've never had to wait with no explanation why my package was over a week late and I was told it be delivered by 830 in the morning and it's 5 o'clock in the afternoon and I still haven't gotten my package and I've been waiting at my house all day long because my package was supposed to be here first thing in the morning and I keep calling them back to back to back and they won't give me a direct answer as to why they can't come deliver it to my house...Vegas is small is deliverymen are complete bullshit.
