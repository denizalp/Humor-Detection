It's a nice little patisserie\/cafe that seems like a hidden gem amongst the rest of the places at Times Square Mall.\n\nFirst time at Ruelo was just to drop in for a quick coffee with a friend. I ordered a coffee, friend got a cappuccino, and we both got a couple of different macarons each. The girl in the front told us to take a seat, and a couple minutes later she brought out our order. \nThe macarons were a nice texture -- nice crunch on the outside, good chew on the inside. Had a ganache filling which I prefer to buttercream fillings. \nWe tried the \"Ruelo\" (milk chocolate ganache with a praline center), pistachio raspberry, blueberry lemon, rose lychee raspberry macarons. Nice interesting flavour combinations, all well done. The blueberry\/lemon one was a little TOO blue...colour stuck to our teeth. \n\nSecond time at Ruelo was to use a Groupon for Afternoon Tea (62% off). Very pleasant experience with this. Had to make a reservation a couple weeks in advance. Girl on the phone was very nice over the phone, even when I had to reschedule a couple times. Cafe was nice and quiet on a weekday, although there were several customers coming in and out for take-out orders\/purchases. \nWhen we sat down at our reserved table, the girl brought us a tray of small tea tins for us to choose our tea from. Some of them smelt sooo nice. Our tea came out first, then within 10-15 minutes the girl brought out our 3-tiered afternoon set & explained what each item was. That was really nice that she did that so we knew exactly what we were about to eat. All the food was created with attention-to-detail and care, it was very good! The middle & top tier were quiet heavy on the stomach, but yummy! The only thing I didn't like in the set was the green tea sesame macaron -- too much sesame flavour and too much green food colouring. \n\nOverall, this place is quite nice & I'll definitely come back here once in a while.
