Hmm..where do I start? I've been tip toe'ing around waiting to write this review. It's not enough to say, \"Oh. My. Gawd. Amazing.\" (I felt like I'd be cheating to quickly send a few lines off like that.) \n\nThis was a *phenomenal* Yelp Elite Event held at one of the most distinguished  restaurants in the Biltmore area. Scratch that. Phoenix. Opening the doors to The Capital Grille is always a delight. More so when Lindsey and team pull off magical experiences like this. A lucky group of us were spoiled with a peak of The Generous Pour. (Caps as this is the official name for a summer wine event ending August 31st.)\n\nBefore I forget, a shout out must go to Shay Spence. Even though we caught her off guard with the number of questions we had, Shay was thorough in her responses. All of the staff encountered that evening were wonderful. Our table was just very lucky to have Shay for a longer period of time. (Love her!)\n\nOur Yelp crew was seated in a private room. (Stuffed with swag bags! Thanks Yelp for the wine charms, luggage tag and playing cards! Thanks to the powers that be at The Capital grill for the Stoli Vodka and Calamari cards. These were both sampled afterwards and very much enjoyed :) \n\nNormally the Generous Pour is $25 for seven wines\/ per person with a server on hand to pair suggestions. The pairings on our special night were delicious. My world view changed once the scallops over risotto touched my lips. So much so I ordered it after the event. (Note: This undeniably over the top item is *only* available during lunch.) The filet? The carpaccio? Everyone must try this. I have no words. Shrimp over mango? A game changer.\n\nThe Generous Pour is a great way to explore wines. One Yelper at our table \"doesn't like wine\". Then he tried the delights offered to us. Now \"He's been doing it wrong.\" (Ha!) I was wowed by everything. Fell in love with a chardonnay, which I didn't think was possible, Bryon, Santa Barbara 2012. The pinot noir, from La Crema, Willamette Valley, 2012, is bookmarked to drink more of. (But frankly, I'd drink all of the white and red wines again in a heartbeat.)\n\nOther Awesome Things to Be In The Know:\n+ Dinner after Dusk ($50 for TWO ppl!). Starts after 8pm\n+ Lunch special $18 (11am to 4pm)\n+ Locker Club offers incredible benefits ($350\/yearly membership. The Capital Grille has the buying power to procure hard to obtain wines.\n\nNow I've completely gone off the deep end with writing. This was quite the event. I'm so happy to have had the experience!
