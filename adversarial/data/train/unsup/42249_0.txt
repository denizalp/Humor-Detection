Frickin rich people have all the good stuff! A carwash in Scottsdale is better than the best restaurant in all of Peoria\/Glendale (except for Spinatos)(wich Scottsdale also has). \"The Thumb\" as it's called is a hidden gem, well at least it was until \"DDD\" showed up. I had the brisket sandwich and shoe-string fries. It was excellent!  I will definitely swing by whenever I'm on this side of town. I kind of wish I lived near this place so I could drop by all the time. Then again my waist is probably glad I don't. Anyway this place rocks!
