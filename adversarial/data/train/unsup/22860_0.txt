Chocolate pecan bears and chocolate caramel popcorn are the two things I got to try from here. I didn't even know they had this place in Vegas and so it was a nice little surprise to find out this place existed.\n\nThe chocolate caramel popcorn was sweet and crispy. It was great.\nThe chocolate pecan bears were individually wrapped and each one had some pecans and chewy caramel inside. This was a nice sweet treat too.\n\nTasty treats from this place can only make the Vegas experience even sweeter!
