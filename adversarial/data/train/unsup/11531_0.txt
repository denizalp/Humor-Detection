I'm so happy we came here!\n\nI work a very hectic schedule, 8AM-8PM everyday besides Sunday so this place especially appealed to me because of their flexible and accommodating hours. They are open 6AM-10PM every day which is so nice!\n\nI called in advance and set up an appointment for yesterday morning to bring my 6 month old kitten, Stark, in to get fixed and get his shots. They were able to schedule me in no problem. I got there around 6:30AM to drop him off and while the morning receptionists weren't very friendly, the vet was very sweet and put me at ease. She could tell I was nervous and that i was also in a rush to get to work so she gave me all the information i needed in a timely but informative manner.\n\nThey called me as soon as he woke up from surgery which I thought was very thoughtful. It made it so I wasn't worried all day about his surgery.\n\nI got there around 8PM to pick him up and the evening receptionist (had red hair, I didn't grab her name) was very sweet and friendly. Complete opposite of the morning receptionists. She charged me out for his shots and the neuter and in total it only cost me $55.00!\n\nThey took me back to a room where a nice gentleman brought in Stark and went over all the aftercare for the neuter.\n\nAll in all it was a great experience. My kitten in happy and healthy and has no pain or symptoms that he even had surgery.\n\nDon't waste your money at some Banfield where they charge you all these upfront fees plus high monthly fees to bring your pet. This place was amazing I cant imagine taking Stark anywhere else!
