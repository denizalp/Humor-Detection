I have wanted to go for many years.\nI will NEVER go again.\nI had to pay to get in then pay $9-$15 for everything I wanted to try.\n$9 for a single slice if cheese pizza?!?! It wasn't even that great!\nI paid $10 for a extra long sausage on a hot dog roll. It might look good and taste OK but not worth that price. \nI feel as though since the food vendors there are traveling along with the feast from town to town that they don't really care what the food tastes like.\nI do not recommend this to anybody I wasted $60 in just 45 minutes.
