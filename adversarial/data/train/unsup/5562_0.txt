I'm always encouraged when sushi chefs have no idea what I'm saying and when other Asians patronize the place.   So when the Tokyo Lobby sushi chef stared at me blankly when I asked a question, I thought, oh my gosh, that must mean that he's like really Japanese or something.   And when the Sun City Asian ladies rolled in for lunch - its fate was sealed.  My sushi confidence shot straight up.  Nice!\n\nFor the past 3 years I avoided this place.  Why would any respectable sushi place locate itself in an aging dumpy Walmart strip mall?  I peeked inside way back when and wasn't impressed.  But after reviews of this place, I knew I had to check it out.\n\nWow, was I wrong.  This place holds its own against any Scottsdale sushi joint, without the flash.  It moved into its new location within the strip mall last week, and it's a bit bigger, more modern, but still modest.\n\nMy second visit (today) I tried the bento box - a steal at only $7 that comes with teriyaki beef, rice, spicy tuna, california roll, salad and miso soup.   And I've been stuffed all day. \n\nThe highlights here clearly are the inventive rolls - reminds me a bit of Blue Wasabi with cutesie names like the Glendale roll and the Monkeyface roll (crab, fried mushrooms and avocados).  Mmmm.\n\nThis has definite 5 star potential, I'm just waiting for my next visit.
