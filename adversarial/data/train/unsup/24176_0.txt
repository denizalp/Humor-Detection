I am so happy this place is far away.  My clothing would not fit within a week.  We stopped by to get some cupcakes to take home.  I was supposed to take 4 cupcakes, but I must have had a weak willpower day.  I ended up with 6 cupcakes, 4 s'mores ones, a strawberry one, and an orange one.  2 nut bars, those are so yummy, worth every calorie, 2 morning glory buns, kind of a croissant\/cinnamon roll fusion 2 snicker doodle cookies, a chocolate chip cookie and an oatmeal cookie.  I was trying to save the strawberry cupcake for myself, but my little boy loved it and he dropped the half I gave him, so I ended up giving him the rest of mine, the bite I had was delicious.  I also had half of the s'mores one, oh my so yummy.
