This must be a old address, the new address is 4955 E Craig Rd. \n\nWe ordered the rib tip dinner with greens, mac and cheese with a hot link. Where do I start? The \"rib tips\" was just a bunch of chopped up rib meat, no tips, the meat was dry and some peices burnt. The greens had no flavor other then.vinagery, the mac and cheese was dry and very bland, the hot link taste like one of the red links you buy in the huge packs at the grocery store with the casing took off. Food was bad and most went in the trash..\n\nThe only reason I gave this place 2 stars is the workers was nice and.when you are walking past the aroma coming from the smoking pit outside is great..
