My wife and I were really excited to try this place as we have heard great things online. We left feeling torn about the place. The fish was fresh and tasted good but we don't think it was worth the 100 dollars for the 5 course omakase. This would equate to about $20 for each dish and I could not justify that. We dined at Brooklyn Fare in New York and had some amazing fish courses there and I was expecting the same quality but it definitely did not measure up. It was a place I really wanted to try at least once but will likely not be coming back for a second meal. I feel I could get very similar dishes at a nice Japanese sushi place without having to pay so much.
