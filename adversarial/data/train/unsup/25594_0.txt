Ryan and Denise are amazing!! We knew right away when we started planning our wedding that Simply Knot was who we wanted to go with. I have seen their previous work on Facebook and have been following their work on their blog so, I was super excited to see what they would do for us considering we were having a destination wedding to top it off. \n\nWe first met them for dinner to go over what we were looking for. I have to say Ryan and Denise are extremely professional and really took the time to get to know us. They asked us a ton of questions about our relationship and how my Husband and I met. I felt like I was out to dinner with friends having a good time. I honestly forgot we were \"trying\" to make a decision cause I knew my mind was made up, It felt so good to have the most important part of our wedding taken care of just months after getting engaged, \n\nI could go on for days about our experience but if you are reading this, you probably are serious about clients reviews above all before making a decision. We had a amazing time with Ryan and Denise and wouldn't have had changed a thing. \n\nBottom line, Simply Knot is definitely worth considering if you want a personnel fun experience and don't want to worry about a thing.
