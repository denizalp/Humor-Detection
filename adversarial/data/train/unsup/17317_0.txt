Every once and a while life hands you small miracles. Today one was handed to me by way of a friend\/fellow Cowboys fan. He invited me to catch the Sunday night game that featured our boys in blue. As a die-hard Cowboys fan living here in Vegas I am so ashamed that I did not know that there was a bar dedicated to my favorite team. Mr D's Sports-bar and Grill is a COWBOYS bar, my miracle and now my little piece of heaven here in Vegas during football season. I have never seen a place outside of Dallas that represents this well.\n\nAmidst the sea of blue and white jerseys are a wide-range of plasma screens and die hard fans that always come to party. 50 cent wings, dollar chicken fingers and a bucket of popcorn shrimp for $5 bucks! They have 5 dollar pitcher specials and buckets of beer galore. The best part of this wonderland are the free house shots after every Cowboys touchdown (God bless you Tony Romo and your 4 TD's tonight)!! Yeehaw!!  \n\nCOWBOYS FANS UNITE and come on down to Mr. D's and show some pride!! Don't worry....even if you aren't a Dallas fan, they do have NFL Sunday ticket and you can cheer on any team you like...just make sure it isn't Philly or the Giants....you will be taunted like no other....especially by me!!
