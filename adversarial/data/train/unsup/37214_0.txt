I noticed a small bulge in my bathroom baseboard and gave Julian's a call after reading the great reviews. The phone was answered on my first call and Jeff was able to squeeze me in on a busy Friday. \n\nHe arrived on time, actually a bit early, and walked me through the possible issues and solutions. The baseboard swelling was minor and after discussing the options, Jeff recommended to not do anything unless the damage escalated.\n\nI appreciate Jeff's restraint and thorough inspection. I felt he was acting in my best interests and did not jump to cutting up my walls and billing me for work that may not be necessary. \n\nNow I just wish my builder would have originally contracted my plumbing to an experienced professional, like Jeff. \n\nI will be keeping an eye on it and if it gets worse - Julian's will be my first call.
