LOVE this place! My fianc√© and I come here all the time and we can't get enough of this place. There isn't a bad taco on the menu and you have to try the different shell styles. I love a good guacamole and Diego Pops has a fantastic one. Their queso is also terrific. Great drink selection and a killer dessert bar adds to the whole experience. We love the ambiance and the feel of the interior and we love to hang on the patio on cool days. \n\nHonestly, if you love Mexican food and especially love tacos, look no further. This place should be around for a while. \n\nSpecial shout out to our server Taylor who took care of us tonight. She was great!
