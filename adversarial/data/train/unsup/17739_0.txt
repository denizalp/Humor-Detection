Hidden away on King just East of the King Edward Hotel lies a sophisticated Vodka Boutique\/Bar that was a elegant and just pretentious enough to make you feel like a somebody. Ha!\n\nI was torn as to whether to give this place a 3 or a 4 star. But for the purposes of this review know that I am awarding it a 3.5 with a a note stating that depending on your lot in life you may award them higher or lower. I encourage you to give it a try. \n\nAesthetically it is gorgeous. Being a Vodka bar the bar is the centerpiece of the entire venue with multiple varieties of vodka stocked to the ceiling. What I found impressive is that they had multiple bottles of each variety sitting in ice and snow behind the bar so that all their vodkas are served properly chilled. The bar is also backlit by blue lights and mirrors so it really is a site to behold. \n\nThe decor extends from the bar with antique looking wing back chairs and couches and gorgeous chandeliers hung in rows above. This place is certainly posh. \n\nStaff is also super attractive (kudos)!\n\nDown sides would be that aside from vodka this place falls kinda flat. I asked for an old fashioned and it was made with Canadian Club and way too much sugar. I mean how do you not have bourbon at a bar this nice. \n\nOnly beer on tap is hogtown which was easy enough to drink but at a whopping $10.25 for a pint I felt like I was getting screwed Rogers Centre\/MLSE style. I guess that decor comes at a price. \n\nMy thoughts: good place to take a date fellas. Dimly lit, swanky, higher class. Take your lady here for a drink or two before or after dinner and you'll look like a pro.
