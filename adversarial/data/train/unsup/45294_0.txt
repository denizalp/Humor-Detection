Man oh man!!!! Let's start off with Cyndi. She was our server and excellent. I really loved that most of the employees were wearing Cardinals gear. They love their team. The sweet cream waffle is absolutely delicious. The fresh squeezed (sweet) orange juice was mouth watering fantastic. My family and I had no complaints whatsoever. This restaurant has a rustic mountain town feel to it. I will be going to their location in my home state really so
