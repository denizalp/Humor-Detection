My car needed repairs and I am so nervous to take my car anywhere new. I took it to another shop close to home who quoted me $1800 plus tax. I took my car to Imperial at the recommendation of some friends and I was not disappointed. I paid around $600 less at Imperial and I was treated so well. \nCathy was amazing and was so nice to me. I felt that they really do have the customers best interest in mind. Every employee I talked to was polite and friendly which is so appreciated. At some other places you feel like a nuisance to the employees but they made me feel so welcome at Imperial. \nSo I will definitely be bringing my car back to Imperial I was impressed and I felt like I could really trust them.
