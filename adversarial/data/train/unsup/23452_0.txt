BUYERS BEWARE!\n\nDo no book a room here until the renovations are completed, and even after that I would be hesitant. My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights, and if I knew them what I know now, I wouldn't have wasted my time or money.\n\nThe casino itself is smaller than other casinos on the strip, and it's very dark. \n\nWe only ate at one restaurant at the resort, the Spice Market Buffet, and it was not worth the money. For 2 people, we spent $60 for the champagne brunch. The food was only so-so and we had to hunt down a server to get 1 mimosa. Not worth the price!\n\nThe real problem with this resort is the renovations...\n\nWe reserved a renovated Ultra Hip room for 3 nights. After a 5 and a half hour plane ride, we were given a larger but clearly older room. We are generally flexible people, and since we only planners to sleep in the room we didn't let the age of the room bother us. Aside from being a little tacky (it was decorated with Indiana Jones memorabilia) and dark, the room was clean and had a bed. \n\nNext time, I will ask for- no, DEMAND- a new room. \n\nOn April 24th, at 10 AM, construction started on the room directly above ours. We did not take time off from our jobs and spend our hard earned money to sleep in a construction zone. It's one of our pet peeves. \n\nPlease note, that while 10 AM sounds late, we had been up late the night before. In fact, I can guarantee we were not the last people to crawl into bed that night. \n\nFirst we called the front desk but could not hear them because of how loud the noise was above us. Then we went down to the desk where we were promptly reassigned to a renovated Ultra Hip room, you know, the one I originally reserved. They also waived our resort fees for the stay, but the damage was done, we were officially disgruntled guests. We refused to spend one more penny at the hotel. We gambled at New York, ate at Paris, and even got all our coffees at the Aria. \n\nI would love to know what incredible idiot at this resort thinks it's ok to reserve rooms when there is construction of adjacent floors.\n\nI am so displease with the experience I had that I feel it is my duty to not only warn future guests but to actively dissuade people from staying, playing, or dining here. There are more than enough resorts (better resorts) on the strip to choose from.
