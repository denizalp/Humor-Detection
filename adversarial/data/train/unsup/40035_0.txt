pros: \n-pancakes were perfect.\n-hash browns were amazing with cheese on top \n-drinks were great \n-service was better than any other restaurant in the strip. Waiters and manager checked on use several times. \n\nCons:\n-steak was asked to be medium and was given a well done steak. \n-duck wings were tender but REALLY salty. \n\nOverall a good restaurant. I'll probably stick to the breakfast items next time I come. The vibe of the restaurant was really calm and mellow.
