1 word: Mmmmmmmmmmm! This vegan restaurant may have the most distinct character of any other restaurant in Pittsburgh. The veggie\/vegan brunch here is legend. The antique store on your way in is epic. The food and desserts, all baked by a couple of lovely women that are friends of friends, are so tasty. The inside decor is so cute and cozy, filled with big, older tables with older furniture and cute antique-like decorations. on the walls and hanging from the ceiling above. At first I wasn't too stoked about the big table setup- particularly if you're going by yourself or just with a friend. However, a couple of times I've met some really cool people that came and set beside me or my group. The people who work here are amazing, and I love the cool, young, hip patrons that come in. For years I only had been here for their brunch, but a couple of years ago I actually had my birthday dinner here with a big group of friends- and the dinner meal was great too! Going on a weekday surely doesn't have the same craziness as a Sunday brunch, but a very good and different experience in its own right. I couldn't recommend this place more highly- even if you aren't a vegetarian!
