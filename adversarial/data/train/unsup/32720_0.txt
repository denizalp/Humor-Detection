2 summers ago I had shellac done and it held up for a whole week in Costa Rica, where playing with sand, salt water seas and pools is a frequent activity. The person doing my nails was very talented and one of the few that got the 'square oval' shape right. I've tried soo many places and I just cringe when they make a rookie mistake. The quality of service is usually dependent on the technicians themselves but the amount of qualified people here is pretty decent. Also if you're particular about how you get your nails done let them know before hand (ex: no cuticle trimming, harsh sanding of nail beds and if they're being rough when filing down your nails)\n\nThe place itself is easy to find and the inside is clean and has an open concept which doesn't make you feel claustrophobic inside (like those p-mall mini nail shops.) \n\nTop Tip: book in the mornings if you can because I went on Tuesday around 2-3 pm and every chair was full and this was in July 2017. \n\nI also do a shellac colour change with them to see their removal procedure. If the colour didn't come off after soaking then they'll rewrap that nail and try to gently scrape it off on the second try which I appreciate because if forced it may take the top nail layer off (this is why a lot of people say shellac\/gel is bad for your nails but only if done improperly)
