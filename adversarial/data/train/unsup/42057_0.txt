For my 1st time at The Coronado I had the yummy Goat Cheese and Jalape√±o Marmalade Quesadillas. Sweet & SPICY, but sooo good. I definitely needed a break between each slice because my mouth was burning but I would order again. \n\nI went at around 12pm on a Sunday and it seemed busy. The place is small and I would say there's was definitely some limited inside seating during this time. There is seating in the patio but come one, on a sunny Phoenix afternoon no one wasn't to sit outside even with the misters on. \n\nI've heard great things about the potato tacos so I would like to go back and try those
