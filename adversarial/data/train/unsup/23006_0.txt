Hailan Q has done my nails twice at BBL and I have been very impressed both times.  She is now my go to nail gal!  Her work is meticulous and she doe beautiful 3d art.  All her products are top notch and she is a perfectionist which shows in the end product.  Cleanliness is without question.\n\nThe shop itself is clean and bright and everyone I've met working there is very friendly and professional.  I'm very tempted to give a try on the lash extensions next!\n\nAlso of note, the shop is located inside\/beside the hairsalon Cutting Room Floor.  I have not had my hair done there but you can hear the gals in the shop and they always sound like they are having fun with their customers.  Too bad I'm not in the market for a new stylist.
