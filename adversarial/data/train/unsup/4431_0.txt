This buffet is probably the best I've been to in Vegas and anywhere else. It's also the most expensive, but you get what you pay for! Just make sure to come with an appetite, you definitely want to get your money's worth.\n\nThis one is located inside Caesar's Palace and wait times could take a while, the longest I've waited was about 40 minutes. But you could walk around the mall while you wait and they will text you when your table is ready.\n\nThe selection here is just unmatched by any other buffet I have been to. There are too many to list, but some of my favorites are the burger sliders, the eggs benedict, and pretty much all their pasta dishes. And their dessert station also has a lot of selection. Everything is so good, but I always end up getting the cr√®me brulee and the gelato.\n\nDefinitely recommend it if you haven't been!
