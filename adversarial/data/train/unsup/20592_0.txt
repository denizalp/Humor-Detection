Hampton Inn  Doesn't Disappoint \n\n\nA out of town  friend was scheduled for surgery and decided to stay at the Hampton Inn Phoenix Mid-Town\/Downtown location. I have to say The Hampton Inn is a great place to stay.\n\nThe Hampton Inn is a gem, the rooms are well kept, beds are comfortable, and the staff goes out of their way to make sure your stay is enjoyable . The Hampton Inn offers complimentary breakfast, free wifi, and these absolutely delicious  cookies at the front desk each afternoon. I could have easily ate a bunch of cookie (sometimes I did just that). The rooms are really quiet so  you can rest without any noise  disturbance from your neighbors and the Inn is  located near a variety of food choices within walking distance.\n\nIf you are every looking for a great place to stay in the downtown area, give Hampton Inn a try.
