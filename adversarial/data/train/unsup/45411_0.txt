We have not tried everything on Dolce's menu, but we intend to.  I have never been more satisfied with food, service and price than I have the two times I've been to Dolce with my boyfriend.  Try the mushroom appetizer, it's incredible...and if you're not trying to spend a lot or if you don't want to induce a food coma (which is fine if you do) then split an entree, more than enough for two people.  No one leaves Dolce without the feeling of simplicity, and more importantly, quality.
