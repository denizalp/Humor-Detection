I am not sure if it was the beers or the company, but I really enjoyed this place.  We are visiting different breweries with the Brews Crews and this place is a winner.  I had a lot of fun, it is a small brewery in the sense that they do small batches, but the location is fairly large.  There is not much decor, but the industrial look suits it.  They do not offer any food, however you can bring stuff in.  I brought a cheese and meats platter and some dips to enjoy with our friends.  It was a great afternoon enjoying a can of beer.
