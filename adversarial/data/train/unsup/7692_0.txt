Many, Many things to discuss here...\n\nI drive every month from South Scottsdale to BFE to come to Arrowhead Health.  And getting in with them was harder than necessary. The girls in billing became super rude with me, threatening to cancel my initial appointment because Cigna had transposed my birthdate, and although it was in the process of being fixed, that wasn't good enough for them!\n\nOnce I finally got there, it was pretty great.  Their facility is beautiful and big!  I make the drive and dealt with the attitude because I know how awesome Dr. Craig Phelps is, my mom has been a patient for a long time.\n\nI went to see Dr. Phelps because I suspected I had ADD, and he actually listened to me and had me go through the necessary channels to be correctly diagnosed.  We schedule an appointment with Dr. Brues (also uber awesome!!) and between our medical 3-some, we're all on the same page to tackling what other doctors have either a) ignored or b) tried to tell me was just depression.\n\nThe office staff is wonderful, and they're accommodating to the point where they are able to draw blood on the premises instead of sending me to wait at Sonora Quest for 2 hours!\n\nIf you live in the area, definitely check your insurance for their doctors.  Heck, even if you don't live in the area, I'd recommend Dr. Phelps. He is definitely worth the drive.
