My girlfriend and I came here last night for drinks. We sat at the bar, since we were not having dinner, just drinks. We ordered drinks and I asked for the wi-fi password. The manager came promptly to tell me the wireless was for administration only. My internal dialogue went as follows: Oh really? Why is it called panorama guests?\n\nBut I politely smiled and thanked him and told him it was not a problem. I was prepared to use my 3G to check-in when the server came to provide me the password, as another server had informed her what it was. Now she, really does her job exceptionally well.\n\nThe bar itself is small but we had a great spot, could check out the view from the top and enjoyed our drinks as we clinked glasses a few times that night.
