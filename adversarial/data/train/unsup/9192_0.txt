A bit hard to find, but well worth the hunt.  It is on the thrid floor of the cosmopolitan.  Got one cheese slice and it was just great.\n\nI haven't had an authentic new york style pizza, so I couldn't compare, but for pizza it was really good.\n\nThis place is small and if busy might be hard to find a spot to sit and eat, but pizza is pretty easy to just eat on the go.
