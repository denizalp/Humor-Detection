I have been to The Dodge twice, once to see Blondie and The New Cars, and once to see Kathy Griffin.  It's a nice venue, with a well organized seating plan.  From the outside it looks like it might have arena style seating inside, but it indeed is a theater with a balcony, floor and mezzanine called the club level.\n\nThe decor is pleasant and access in and out is a breeze.  The sound quality is top notch, but please make them seats just a bit bigger, not everyone is built like Zac Effron.  Some of us (actually most of us) regular folks need just a little bit more room.  I felt like I was flying in coach class for christ's sakes.\n\nOh, and to those bitches that talked throughout Kathy's entire performance.  You're just lucky that the girl next to me called you out.  I was ready to go get the usher to give you the boot.  I'm just sayin'.
