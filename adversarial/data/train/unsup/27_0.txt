The Kennywood Krucible: A Prologue\n\nLast weekend, Kay's employer held their first annual picnic here, giving the two of us a chance to experience Kennywood since 2010 without having to pay much for anything. \n\nIf I have a complaint, it's that the food, which has improved somewhat since our last visit, is a bit steep in price. Two orders of philly cheesesteak sandwiches with Seaside french fries and beverages should not cost over $20.\n\nI'm also a little annoyed at the redundancy of some of the rides, namely of the pendulum variety. Phase out the Pirate Ship at the very least, Kennywood. The Black Widow and Aero 360 alone have made it obsolete. And does the park need both The Log Jammer and the Pittsburgh Plunge? \n\nAdditionally, the waits for almost any ride can be excruciating. It took us an hour to board Kennywood's much-lauded new ride, The Black Widow. As a result of all the standing-in-line that we did, we ran out of time and thus didn't get the chance to ride The Racer or The Thunderbolt, two Kennywood essentials that I've thankfully boarded before.\n\nAside from those caveats, we had a ball at Kennywood, even if my stomach didn't. \n\nP.S. When we visited, the park was clean, and the employees were all pleasant despite the uncomfortably humid weather. \n\nP.P.S. Like all of my Kennywood encounters, this was a gauntlet orchestrated by the malevolent Steel Phantom. Stay tuned, True Believers for harrowing action and suspense in the Mighty Yelp Manner await thee!!\n\nP.P.P.S. Rides challenged this day included The Black Widow, The Phantom's Revenge, The Jack Rabbit, The Exterminator, Aero 360, Cosmic Chaos, Garfield's Nightmare, Ghostwood Estate, Musik Express, The Pirate Ship, and The Raging Rapids.
