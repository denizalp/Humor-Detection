Back in the day Blossom WAS the place to see a show, these days it isn't the destination that It once was. Your drive in to the venue will include being watched by police hiding in trees and bushes and the military state once you enter the parking grounds...DO NOT bring games like cornhole, horshoes, frisbees or even hackysacs because the police will be on you like a cheap suit and either force you to stop or arrest you for disorderly conduct. Oh but wait! It gets better!!! Even before entering the ampitheatre the fun gets started with what is almost a full strip search with a bonus exploratory cavity search! \nFUN!!!\nNo but really...Any hint of contraband and you can expect to be hauled off and spend the night in prison...\nAlso...The mountain of coolers there? thats because you are NOT allowed to bring ANYTHING in the show...Back in the day coolers were allowed but of course they wised up and realized that a captive audience will HAVE to pay $8-$11 for a beer if they aren't allowed out once the show started and their cooler was confiscated...\nI'm kinda an older dude and back in the day we would clammer to get to Blossom because it was SUPERB...These days I stick to the smaller BETTER venues like the Beachland, Peabodys and Brothers Lounge..And HOB on occasion...\nPoor Blossom is such a shell of it's former self...\n*sniff*
