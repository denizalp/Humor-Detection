Location: This place is next to honeybaked ham & cafe right off the 101. Arriving around lunch time, there was plenty of parking spots and service was quick (less than 10 mins) since it is their new location. The interior is very spacious with plenty of seats to lounge around. They also have board games to chill with your friends. The menu is huge. I was slightly overwhelmed, and had the friendly worker break it down with popular drinks. \n\nBoba: I had the caramel iced with pudding and grass jelly. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. I came in with very little expectation as the boba around AZ has been average for me. However, the drink I had today consisted of the perfect level of sweetness; it was not too creamy where I felt like I had to do 1 hour of intense cardio to burn it off. The only future adjustment I might request is less ice in my drink. Given that it was a hot day, it was super refreshing and a good pick-me-up. They also have fruit smoothies and fried snacks that I plan to try next time. \n\nService: The worker at the front was awesome. He started me with a stamp card, in which you can buy 8 drinks (medium or larger), and get 1 free drink. Since it was my first time there, the worker was nice enough to give me two stamps. On a side note, they do accept credit card without a minimum charge.
