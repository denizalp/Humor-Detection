For all my youngster Yelpers that like hotel parties. This is the place to throw a party. They aren't very strict. As long as you aren't too loud they will let you continue your festivities. Although, if they do come up and warn you & you don't fix the problem then they won't be too nice. Also, throwing anything out the balcony is an automatic shut down but that's like common sense. \n\nThe one room suites are the only rooms I have experienced here. It is a very spacious room. It is all connected. You will see  the room, then the bathtube, the living room, then the kitchen. The only door you will find is for the restroom. There is a big restroom and one right by the room door that everyone usually misses. There are alot of drawers and closet space. The bathroom is very cute and lighting is amazing.\n\nFor the cost of the room, it is a nice little steal. Of course it is cheaper on the weekdays per usual. \n\nAlso, they have a back elevator so you don't have to go through the main lobby if you didnt want to.
