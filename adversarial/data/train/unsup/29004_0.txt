I enjoyed my stay here.  Very large suite, nice kitchen (poor view, but hey you can't win everytime).  Elevators are fast, the place is clean and doesn't smell like cigarettes.  Full breakfast (not continental) is served in the A.M.  Breakfast could be better, but it's not bad.  Staff was very friendly.  You must go to the Lounge in the evening and say \"Hi\" to Randolph the resident bartender and magician.  Definitely makes the stay more memorable.
