the BEST apartment complex I have ever lived in, by far!!! moved out feb of '15, but trying to see if there is another available apt for me to come home to! The staff is very professional and the most friendly to their residents i've ever known. All requests i had, no matter how tough, were handled right away, always! Clean, well maintained apartments, and i would recommend this place to everyone in need of an apartment that really feels like home!
