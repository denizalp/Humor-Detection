A review on Flotation Tank only: I have not done their yoga classes but purchased my first float and here is my experience. I was able to enter a very deep state of relaxation and meditation here. Initially I got a little claustrophobic and stuffy, so I propped the door open a few inches with their towel and that remedied that instantly. A good place to practice meditations on completely letting go. I was able to really connect with my higher self in here. Couple cautions: slippery when getting in and out. And don't get the water in your mouth, salt-peroxide mixture tastes very bad. Put the earplugs in before getting in the tank to make it more pleasant. I was a bit shaky and my body wanted to sway back and forth when I got out, almost similar to being on a rocking boat. Went away within the hour. A good alternative to some quiet, Me Time. I imagine you'll either like it or hate it. Worth a shot!
