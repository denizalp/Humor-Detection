Pittsburgh Black Car provides excellent on-time service, a comfortable and clean ride, with a friendly atmosphere.  I've used Daniel for over 3 months and I am extremely pleased with the service... he's my regular transportation to the airport on an almost weekly basis. Setting up a ride, planning, and communicating are a piece of cake, even if you aren't a regular traveler. 5 stars for this amazing company and entrepreneur!
