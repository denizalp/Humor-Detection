Great atmosphere and service, but the food was disappointing. Definitely not the place to go to for authentic Mexican food. The salsa was very bland and the beans tasted canned and had a sour aftertaste to them. The rice had barely any flavor. I did order a chicken taco that wasn't bad...but not great. Over all, this is probably a great spot for happy hour on the patio, but not for dinner. What I was impressed with was the service, they were staffed properly which made our meal very pleasant and worth the sub-par food.
