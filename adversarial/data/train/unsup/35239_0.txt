Delicious!\n\nWe found this place on our way to get massages and I think we will have to visit them again the next time we come to LV.\n\nWe got Macaroons (Green Tea, Strawberry, Chocolate, and a blue one), taro custard donut, and honey cake. The cashier ( who I think is also the owner) threw in a custard bun for us at the end =D\n\nThat Taro custard donut...o.m.g. It is soooooooo good. I could eat a dozen of them.
