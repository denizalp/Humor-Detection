why didn't anyone tell me how good vodka tonic was?  thanks to caroline y, i am in love with this now.  since none of you were nice enough to share the secret, i wasn't going to write a review about my new discovery, but me being an angel (and they are rare in vegas!!!), i decided to play nice.\n\nkimchi serves pretty decent korean food for 24 hours...heavenly for those who need to seal their debauchery nights with some spicy food or wake their drunk ass bodies with hot soup.  i think the staff is used to these kinds of people because their service was wickedly fast and pleasant.  the price is about $2-3 more expensive, but the portion is HUGE.  even i couldn't finish my food.\n\np.s. - don't tell me i am a late bloomer!!!
