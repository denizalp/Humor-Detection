I stayed here with several friends who went to the EDC festival and had the worst experience with their customer service. Throughout the weekend, the security barricaded the entrance and every car was searched so that every one`s IDs matched their room. I wanted to have a friend over for drinks and it proved impossible. We tried discussing with the security yet the overly large guy who was in charge  refused any arguments and did not allow us to have any guests.\nBecause of the poor customer service, Nellis Suites deserves one star. I only make a trip to Vegas once a year and my experience should not be ruined by some rude staff member.
