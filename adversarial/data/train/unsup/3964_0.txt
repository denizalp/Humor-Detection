I think its a little scary how frequent im in this place. My bf thinks that the run rate for my  \"version\" of  uni don exceeds my budget if im making them daily. LOL \n\nLately, ive been in for the $18.88 pack of 5 uni (sea urchin roe) i then use that on my nong shim microwave rice and voila, uni don!\n\ni also eat it via guu style..wrap in season seaweed and soy sauce..uni sashimi...yummy!\n\nmy purchases vary depending on my cravings but oysters are generally the staple from this place.\n\nIm very picky about the quality of oysters and i ask them specifically what and which is creamiest each round, freshest..deliveries are usually on Thursdays and they usually shuck a few for u to taste.\n(to clarify, ive never had poor quality oysters, i just like to know which are the newest stock)\n\nSo i really dont mind the work and time it takes to shuck oysters and cleanup. I really throughly enjoy a fresh oyster and i think this is better than any restos. (Rodney's, Oyster boy, starfish etc..)\n\nif you are a beginner they always offer to show you how to shuck and tell you which are more difficult etc..\nyou can also ask for a chuck of ice, this helps keep the oysters cool as you are shucking them\n\nthere are crates of kushi, fanny bay and it available in a vast variety for those that are mindful of their wallets. these run from $20 -$80. The other ones are generally open for you to purchase in 1\/2 or dozens. I cant list the prices as they change it accordingly.\n\nmy favs are usually the black pearl and kumamoto (sp?)\nthese are tiny but taste the best!!!!! \n\nother than that, i usually pick up fresh sea urchin and cut it myself (insert to youtube for tutorial), lobster bisque  and clam chowder ($7, scallops, red stone clams, alaskan king crab legs (frozen)$$??, minila clams, smoked salmon ($20), seafood salad ($11), crab and lobsters (live and its seasonal)\n\n\nI higly recommend all of the above as i never had any problems with any of them.\n\n\ni also get my cocktail sauce and horseraddish from them =) these run at about $4!!\n\n\nhappy shucking!\n\n\nxoxo
