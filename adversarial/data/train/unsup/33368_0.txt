Came here on a friday afternoom with my family. We decided to go here while we were in the country. This place is really fun. If you are not active, do not come here! The courses will tire you out but it is well worth the $62. It took us 3 house to complete all the courses including the advanced one. But beware, it is a bit scary so if you are afraid of heights i wouldnt come. All in all it was a great experience.
