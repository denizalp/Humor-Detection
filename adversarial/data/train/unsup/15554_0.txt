Everything was OKAY (not great tho) until a server (an old woman) told me \"hey! You didn't put tip! Where is tip??\" at the door. I actually put $10 on the table for Sure but somehow they lost it. But that is NOT the point. I don't care if they lost their $10.  \n \nI felt uncomfortable that a server ask customer to put tip by compulsion. I told her I put tip on the table. Then she took me to the table and told me \"but there is no tip!\" again. Of course I didn't pay another $10 because I already paid......\n I never go this rude restaurant.
