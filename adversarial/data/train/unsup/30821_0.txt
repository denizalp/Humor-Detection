We had a great order out meal from Paco's Tacos & Tequila a few weeksMy boyfriend got the chicken chimichanga and it was delicious! I ordered the tanked up (white fish) taco and the shake down shrimp taco. Both were great. The charro beans was a nice switch up from standard black or refried beans - very good! Definitely will come back again!
