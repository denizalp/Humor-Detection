My husband wanted gelato, so we decided to check out the newly remodeled Bashas' in the same plaza.  After perusing the aisles unsuccessfully trying to decide what to have for dinner, we settled on Italian take-out, but then it turned to Oriental Garden, and somehow we ended up with BBQ.  It is Memorial Day after all.\n\nFirst time here, and for $21 we got a sampler than included 1\/2 lb each of pork, chicken, and beef with 3 sides and cornbread.  Here's the lowdown on our experience.\n\n-Chicken was very dry and I didn't care for the flavor at all.  Of course, smothered in sauce, it was better.\n-Beef was sliced thin and reminded me more of a deli-style meat than a BBQ.  It wasn't bad, just not what I wanted.\n-Pork was the best, but I've still had better.  Not smoky or flavorful enough on its own.\n-I liked both the mild and the spicy sauces luckily.\n-Cole slaw-I've never been a cole slaw fan, but I liked it.  My husband who dislikes almost any cole slaw except KFC liked it as well.\n-Potato salad-Although it needed salt, it was okay.  I liked that it was NOT sweet or swimming in mayo.  I think it would be better with the potatoes peeled, since they use a standard russet and the skins were tough.\n-Baked beans-I really liked these as they were not in some thick disgustingly sweet syrup.\n-Corn bread-Delicious with whole kernel corn and rosemary, I believe.\n\nOverall, I would go back since close to home, but I'll stick with the pork..with the sauce and a salt shaker nearby.  And next time, I won't have gelato first so I can try their cobbler if it's available!
