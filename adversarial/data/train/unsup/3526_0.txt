Hey!! Guy!! Ever had a sexual experience brought about by food?? No?? Then EF you and go to Cold Stone! NOW!! \n\nThe little sis and I came to this location after walking around Crocker Park, reminiscing about our childhood in Westlake (Go Demons!). Not going to lie....this LOCATION actually deserves 2 stars for the horrible management. There were two kids working behind the counter and the line was out the door (typical). OK, now, I am aware that these kids have to put some elbow grease in mixing pounds of ice cream for these teens whose metabolisms suck this shit up like no other. I mean, at one point, the chick mixing \"All Lovin' No Oven\" was straight up getting a great workout when the customer ordered a huge pint to take home. I felt like I should jump back there and help her in this science experiment of an ice cream mixture, but hey! Unless they're planning to give me some of their $7.00 an hour....then they're on their own. \n\nThe best part about this location is the singing. I've been to many Cold Stone locations in different states but this one actually commits to their singing! I've actually asked employees at the other Cold Stone locations I've been to about the singing and they had no clue what I was talking about. Aren't ALL CS employees supposed to sing at certain things? I know for a fact they're supposed to sing if someone puts money in their tip jar. This is literally the ONLY location where they sing! For tips, for certain flavors, for birthdays, etc. They just randomly burst out into synchronized songs. I feel bad for them as these are high school kids, forced into singing stupid CS songs they were forced to memorize when hired. But hey! Who hasn't had a job like this during their youth!\n\np.s. I didn't read this review to check any mistakes (grammar and spelling) because I'm lazy right now so excuse this if there are mistakes.
