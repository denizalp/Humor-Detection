My work colleague is a huge comic book nerd. I enjoy reading comic books too - I'm just not the afficionado that he is.\n\nHe wanted to visit a comic book shop during a work trip we had to the Cleveland area. I suggested we use Yelp to find the highest rated and closest comic book shops to our hotel - Carol & John's fit both criteria!\n\nWe visited in the evening after work. The guy working the counter was friendly, cool, and very knowledgeable. My friend bought several comic book items.\n\nI'm sure we'll be back!\n\n#CarolandJohnsComicShop
