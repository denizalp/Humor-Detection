Roof. Top. Patio.!!!\n\nDo I have your attention now? That is definitely the big selling feature here.\n\nThe menu is extensive, like novel extensive. You really have to go in with a plan of what type of meal you want if you expect to make any sort of decision.\n\nThe pastas are good, not phenomenal and although I've never tried them the burgers are another one to consider apparently. I guess you could say they do a great job at comfort food. \n\nThe roof top patio is dimly lit, the service is very relaxed and there are little nooks to tuck yourself into if you're into that sort of thing. Over all, pretty cool little local spot.
