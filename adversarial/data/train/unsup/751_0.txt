Cinemark is the absolute latest and greatest in state-of-the-art in cinema viewing. Now in Monroeville. How about that. Awesome for all and convenient to the east side and just off 22\/376.\nModern, clean and as new as it gets.\nIt has 12 auditoriums all of which have wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling screens, and its all digital sound and projection.\nSaw Thor: The Dark World in XD RealD 3D. Just awesome quality.
