I really want to like Aaron Pools. I've been with them for a long time but enough is enough. The quality of their cleaning and maintenance is shoddy and lazy in my opinion. I watched their techs stay for no more than 5 minutes. The bottom of my pool floor had visible dirt and the water was cloudy. There has been a lot of turnover in terms of their pool boys. With rare exception, most have been less than stellar. Their front office can be difficult to deal with. I can echo the experiences others have had with the manager and owner.  I cannot recommend them.
