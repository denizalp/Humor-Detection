Fresh flowers, view of the Bellagio fountains, original Picassos, and two Michelin stars, need I say more? \n\nThe atmosphere here is excellent, the service is kind and attentive. The attention to detail on each dish is remarkable. I enjoyed the vegetarian tasting menu and was impressed by their creativity with the dishes. Chef Julian Serrano has definitely left his mark in Las Vegas! \n\nTips:\n*Reservations are a must!\n*Depending on the time of year, you may be seated at the outdoor patio overlooking the Bellagio fountains to get a prime view of the watershow (but sadly no Picassos out there ;)
