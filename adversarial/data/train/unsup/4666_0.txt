I've been coming to this gym since July, and it suits my needs due to it's proximity to the light rail, grocery store, and is only 20 minutes from my home.\n\nThe gym itself really isn't anything mind blowing, but it does have a large amount of cardio equipment, and it doesn't feel like you are stuffed a sardine can in comparison with its competitors. Sometimes the gym can get a bit stuffy, but it's nothing crazy.\n\nCleanliness is average, but you do have members who'll sweat like dogs and not wipe down their equipment, which is gross. Otherwise, it's adequate for my needs.
