i used to be an everyday regular here. baristas knew me by name and had my drink memorized. service was always slow ... friendly (most of the time) but slow. but i kept coming back because they knew me. stopped by again thursday morning, hoping it had improved. it hadn't. from the time i walked in the door to the time i got my coffee, i had wasted 17 minutes of my morning on a damn latte (yes, i really did time it). screw it ... i just don't have time for this place. if i have an outrageous amount of time to waste, i happen to need coffee, and i'm in this parking lot, i may return, but probably not.
