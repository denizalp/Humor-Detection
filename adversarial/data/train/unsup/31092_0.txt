I had a great experience with this place this past week. I had purchased a Martin D2XAE from Cosmo's Music in Richmond Hill but decided to upgrade to a full wood guitar instead. I actually went back to Cosmos to buy the Martin D15M and asked them to match the price on the Steve's website. The salesman told me that he called Steve's and they told him that the website price was a mistake and that they do not sell the D15M at that price. This was 100% wrong and against their policy of matching prices. This is when I went to L&M and asked them if they could match the price. They told me that they could so I purchased the D15M from them. A few days later I was getting second thoughts about the D15M thinking I should have purchased the 00015M instead. I went back to L&M and the salesperson Brent and I evaluated the guitars once again. I decided to buy the 00015M to take it home so that my wife and I could compare them. The next day I returned the 00015M and kept the D15M. The point here is that I spent $2,000 on a guitar and felt confident about it thanks to Brent and L&M. I would highly recommend this store in particular to anyone who is not a super serious musician because the people here are not SNOBS and understand that even a casual player has the right to be discerning. Brent in particular was amazing and I will gladly buy all future instruments (for my kids) through him. I'd say that Cosmos is the opposite of this. I especially didn't like that the salesperson claimed that he couldn't match the Steve's price. That was not nice. I'm Glad I have the full Mahogany Martin and I'm glad I purchased it from L&M in Brampton.
