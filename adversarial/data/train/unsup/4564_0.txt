We have been here a few times and have enjoyed the steaks here especially the prime rib. On this visit we ordered a ribeye and prime rib sandwich. The ribeye has tremendous flavor but wasn't as tender as it had been on previous visits. The prime rib sandwich wasn't anything to write home about. The flavor was fine but not over the top. It's still one of our favorite steak houses to frequent in this price range.
