We met a big group of friends at Angry Crab recently for dinner, and it was great.  We shared the three meat Pit Master platter with pulled pork, brisket, and chicken.  The meats were succulent, tender, and mighty tasty!  We also shared a pound each of the shrimp, salmon, crawfish, lobster, and vegetables.\n\nThe service was wonderful, too.\n\nWe definitely will come back to Angry Crab.
