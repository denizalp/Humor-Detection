I really dig Chelsea's. \n\nI usually spend at least 2 hours looking through their dresses on each visit. It's THAT overwhelming. There's clothing piled high to the ceiling. It can get pretty scary and you'll probably get lost at least once. \n\nOrganized is the key word here. If you're looking for a little black dress from the 60's -- there's a rack for that. It's pretty mind blowing and helps to take that anxious \"OMFG, how am I going to find anything in here?\" feeling away. \n\nThe staff\/owners are spectacular. They know EVERYTHING. They look at you, ask you what you're looking for, and instantly point you in the right direction or pull things off racks for you. They will also offer suggestions on how to wear your items or where to get accessories if you can't find them in their store. Super cool. \n\nI love that they always have bigger sizes for curvy girls. Because of that, I never leave Chelsea's empty-handed. Yeah, that could be a bad thing too.
