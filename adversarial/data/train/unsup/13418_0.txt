Great show! Very entertaining and alive. They get the whole audience to participate so no one was safe from their antics. \n\nMusic they played added to the excitement. Florescent colors were also eye catching and colorful. The theater it was held in was full capacity. Good thing I went to the first show of the night because it allowed me to enjoy the rest of the Vegas Strip. This show was located at the Luxor. Nice resort casino. Very clean and location was easy to get to. \n\nBought my tickets online and plenty of seats available. Vegas.com was the site I used which was user friendly.\nMake your reservations now and join the fun. It'll be worth it.
