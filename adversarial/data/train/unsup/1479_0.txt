I promised a friend I wouldn't write a two page review about this, so here goes.\n\nI had high hopes for Melt Grilled Cheese, but it seems I'm spoiled by better experiences in the past.\nI've been to Melt a few times already, and I knew what to expect, but the food is just not great.  Really not great.\n\nI have big eyes and poor impulse control, so in the past I went for things like the tuna melt loaded up with jalapeno havarti, tomato corn salsa, and shredded lettuce, with a milkshake on the side, of course.  I was quite let down.\n\nMy friend suggested going for the Tuesday special, $3 for a classic grilled cheese.  As the saying goes, once bitten - twice shy; but I figured that I can't go wrong with a basic grilled cheese with no accoutrements.  The grilled cheese was passable, at least they got a decent melt, but the tomato bisque I got as a side tasted really underwhelming - definitely store bought, maybe frozen and defrosted - and the parmesan, don't get me started.  The mac and cheese side was OK, it tasted like a basic mac and cheese, pretty middle of the road, but at least not bad.\n\nOne slightly redeeming feature was the tater tots.  I don't even like potatoes, but I found these quite interesting, and that's probably why I'm not being as scathing as I'm sort of tempted to be.\n\nI kept wanting to like Melt, but I'm approaching the definition of insanity - trying the same thing over and over again, expecting different results.\n\nSave yourself the trouble, please go somewhere else.
