If anyone reads my reviews then they know that I am a huge fan of good dive bars. \n\nWhile vacationing in Vegas this weekend one of our travel partners recomends Slots of fun. This place is right next to Circus Circus so it must be a dive bar. I walk in and feel the stickiness of the old and nasty carpets. The place smells of cigarretes and booze. I order a beer and a daqarui for my finace and the price is 4 bucks total!!! Jackpot! This place is the ultimate dive casino!!\n\nLost among the giant ultra glam resorts you have this tiny casino that looks like some sort of reject bastard casino from Vegas's past. This spot seems to be popular spot once the party is over. Leaving Tryst or any other spot at 5am and they you just end up a slots o fun for some ultra cheap gambling and some cheaper booze.. 2 dollar black jack and 25 cent slot machine makes for some great fun when you are downing cheap booze.\n\nLike any dive establishment the crowd is a mixture of old people just passing time and the younger crowd who is simply looking for a pit stop after a hard nights partying... Thumbs up!
