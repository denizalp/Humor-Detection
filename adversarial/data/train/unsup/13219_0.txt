We'll usually make it to Lucille's about once every year or so and nothing is ever that memorable and nothing is ever really that bad except my beef ribs on our last visit. We made it a point on this particular visit to try some items that we've never had before. The menu consists of your regular slow, smoked meats, and also, an entire section devoted to some classic Southern specialties. Although the Southern shack themed restaurant is spacious and includes a large patio for outdoor seating, it's usually busy enough to be on a wait and a reservation is probably a good idea, especially on the weekend.\n\nThe tri tip, brisket, and both types of pork ribs are pretty good to me as long as they aren't smoked to leather status and I'll usually pick two of the meats for a combo. I gave the beef ribs a try this time and for $24.99, I got 3 bones which I think someone had gnawed some of the meat off them before they got to the table. And the meat that was on them was dry, tough, and gave my jaw muscles some extra work.\n\nLucille's brews by Golden Road Brewing Co. were also something I was always aware of, but had never tried. So I ordered Lucille's Beer Flight and for $6.95 you get nice sampling of four 3-4 oz pours. The Red Ale was my favorite and would be a nice pairing with all of the smoked meats.\n\nMy wife and daughter split the two meat combo ($29.99) with baby back ribs and the cheddar and bacon sausage. They devoured the ribs and I only got one bite of the sausage. The cheese and bacon in the sausage was as good of a combination as you'd expect it to be.\n\nService was solid for the meal and we felt comfortable in the Southern atmosphere. There's no rush, but we'll be back at some point because of the convenient location and I'll stick with my standard meats.
