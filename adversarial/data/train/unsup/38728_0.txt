I used to love to eat at this place. But it seems everyone goes there and is always packed. Not enough cooks & servers to feed the mass of people who eat there. The staff always seems rude, to wait for your food for about an hour is crazy. You don't even have to wait that long a a steak house where the food is cooked fresh, not sitting.
