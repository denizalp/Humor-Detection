Everything we ordered was delicious!  I had the cheese manicotti and my husband had the lasagna (which he described as \"amazing\").  The garlic bread melts in your mouth and even the house wine was good!  Kinda pricey, but you get what you pay for in great service, atmosphere, and quality food.  Would definitely return if I were in the area again.
