Every once in a blue moon you want to gorge yourself in greasy Chinese food. Although I drive on LVB daily, Panda Express somehow really caught my eye on my drive home the other day.\n\nPanda Express is located right in the same complex of the South Outlets on Las Vegas Blvd. The inside is surprisingly spacious, open, and clean. I walked in craving noodles and chicken and ordered just that. I was lucky to catch the cook making a fresh batch of Chow Mein and tried a few chicken pieces to figure out which chicken I wanted. I went with the grilled Teriyaki Chicken which was pretty decent!\n\nI was pleased by the friendly workers - a male who helped get my to-go bowl together and a female who assisted me at the register. They were both welcoming and engaging.\n\nThe food tasted OK - met my expectations for Panda Express. I added a few extra ingredients when I got home to give it a bit more flavor (soy sauce, black pepper, topped off with Sriracha).\n\n- 5\/5 for the service \n- 3\/5 for the food \n- Overall 3\/5 as the food is so average \n\nNot a bad location for quick Americanized Chinese food!
