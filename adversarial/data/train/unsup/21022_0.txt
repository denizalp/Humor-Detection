The girls from work decided to try this spot out for lunch and since I haven't been in several years we decided to refresh our memory of this place and again it was just ok for me some things were pretty good others just ok.  This place gets really busy around the lunch hour and parking fills up really quickly, so avoid the rush if you can.  The staff was quick to come over and take our order and the food was coming out in no time which makes this place great for lunch as they realize folk want to be in and out for lunch. I couldn't really decide on anything so I went with the side combo of Brunswick stew, green bean casserole, and collards with texas toast no complaints the sides were all pretty good.
