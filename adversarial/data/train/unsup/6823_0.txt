I don't LOVE Mesa Grill, it would be more accurate to say I am  IN LOVE with Mesa Grill. I have been 15-20 times over the last 5 years and had just about everything on the menu. Perhaps because of this the negative reviews sort of infuriate me. Mesa Grill is not Chilis- yes they both proclaim to offer great southwestern food but Mesa Grill is a big girl restaurant- they don't serve southwest egg rolls or big mouth bites. They don't have a 20 page long menu with 5,000 items on it. Food costs more than 4.99 during happy hour. These shouldn't be controversial facts but apparently they are enough to justify a negative rating. There needs to be some sort of basic restaurant literacy exam you take before you can post reviews on yelp. Wait, hold on, did negative yelp reviews just turn me into a tea party republican? Ruh roh....\n\n\nDrinks\nRegular margarita- I know a lot of people don't like to get adventerous with their drinks and if that is the case you can't go wrong with the house margarita- it is not as sweet as you may be used to with many places now putting agave nectar in their drinks but it is not face puckeringly bitter. \n\nCactus Pear - this is the best by far. Yes it is pink, that doesn't mean it isn't manly. \n\n\nAppetizers- in Order\n\nBlue Corn Lobster Tacos- Winner. These are so frigging good its ludicrous. I normally don't like relish, fennel or hananero and yet I love this relish. \n\nBlue Corn pancake- comes with tasty duck meat and a slightly spicy sauce\n\nChicken Black Bean Quesadilla- the garlic sauce that comes on this is slightly more addictive than heroin. \n\nGoat Cheese Queso- its not quite dippable queso but is also not actual gross fundido- pretty tasty. \n\n\nEntres- In order\n\nPork Tenderloin- this one is always on the restaurant week menu so I have had more than my fair share of it. it is super delicious. It comes with three different sauces on the plate (for three pieces of tenderloin) and they are all good. It also comes with a sweet potato tamale thing that is amazing.\n\nVeal Chop- I don't like horseradich so I get it without- other than that this dish is perfect. I think the tamale is cheese (goat cheese?) - I'm not really sure because I inhaled it before I could figure it out. \n\nBone in Ribeye- this is an outstanding steak for a non steak restaurant. Its like 50 bucks- less than you would pay at Carne Vino and the like. It has a really good smoky glaze on it so if you are a steak purist (only want meat taste) this is probablynot for you\n\n\nSide Dishes- In order\n\nSweet potato Gratin\nTwice baked potato\n\nDesert\nThis changes a lot- the churros and any pie I have had have all been top notch.
