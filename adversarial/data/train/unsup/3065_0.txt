Let me say this first that I've never been here except for an event so my review reflects what I observed during the event that took place at Sir Winston Churchill Pub.\n\nThere was a mobile cellphone event (CrackBerry) that was taking place and they decided to hold it at Sir Winston Churchill Pub. As mentioned, I've never been here before but since I wanted to go to the event and it was close by to where I work, I went there.\n\nThe event included a drink and food. The food was typical pub food and I had a bottled beer so I can't really say much about it. The place has free WiFi but seemed to require signing in with an e-mail address or Facebook (I forget which one). I didn't use it since my cellphone had data and I had more than enough data to worry about exceeding my monthly amount.\n\nI didn't have any issues with the included\/served pub food and found it to be good. It wasn't too crowded on the day of the event (it was a Monday evening) and we had part of the pub to ourselves. I found the seating to be good. They not only had places to sit at the bar but also regular chairs at the tables as well as \"couch-type\" seats in certain area as well.
