Great new spot in DTLV. Lots of whiskey selections but definitely have other signatures cocktails. Make no mistake, this is an American whiskey bar first! Food choices are great! Had a few of their shareable bites, Corn Pops, Mac N cheese balls, sliders and their protein salad and very delicious! This will be a regular spot for sure. Oh, and they have brunch on Sundays with $5 Bloodys and Mimosas all day!
