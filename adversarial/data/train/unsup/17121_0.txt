What's not to like about a sports bar with more TV's than a Best Buy? \nGreat \"arena\" to watch multi games.\nSports book on the lower level.\nThat's where the favorable stats end.\nI love Emeril but he missed the crawdad on this.\n\nA visitor chevking in at the door is soon given the \"you're new here\" feeling. Reservations needed on a Sunday and casual inquires two hours before game time are given the \"those damn customers\" attitude when inquiring about entry.\nPlace is too busy and doesn't need you. \n\nDespite the poor reception I returned for the afternoon games. You are told u need to spend $50 to get in to sit in \"Stadium\".... $25 for coach class. I chose coach. \n\nYou get better service on an airplane.  Way overpriced food given the portions and despite my support for Emeril this is not a place he should put his name on.\n\nBam! Take half the money you would spend here and go elsewhere for more fun.\n\nOverated more than Ryan Leaf.\n\n3 beers and wings...$39 plus tip.\n\nBooooooo.
