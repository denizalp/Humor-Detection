Just try it, it's delicious. The ordering process is daunting for me, but I'm not always the sharpest tool in the shed. You just write what you want on a piece of paper, but there is some circling involved. The food is so tasty, and you will not taste anything like it anywhere else in Phoenix. I always want to get something different, but fate leads me back to the Jade Red chicken with Rice and Black beans. And you get a free snickerdoodle. Do not believe people that say it's not clean in Chino either. It might be hold in the wall like, though it's actually quite large inside, it's very clean.
