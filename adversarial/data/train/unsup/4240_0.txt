I went here once a year or so ago for a bang trim. It was shoddiest bang trim I ever received, which is pretty bad because... it's a BANG TRIM. She cut them way too short and used a pretty weird\/ineffective cutting technique. I was so not impressed, I never went back there again. \n\nThis year, I won a basket full of local business goodies and in it was a coupon for a wash and blowout out ($45 value? Yeah right.) Rosabella. I had absolutely no interest in even going to that place for free. My mom was visiting, so I said she could have it if she wanted it. I called Rosabella to see if they could take her that day, and when the owner answered the phone she said \"Sorry, I can't talk right now. Give me your number and I'll call you whenever I have time.\"\n\nWhenever I have time???\n\nShe called back a day or two later and left a voicemail for me saying she was too busy to talk. Maybe I could let that go normally, but after my previous experience and other reviews on here, I won't. I never called her back and will give the coupon to someone I don't like very much. \n\nPeople, read the filtered reviews on here, too. I believe they are legit - this place isn't worth your time and there are definitely better salons in the area.
