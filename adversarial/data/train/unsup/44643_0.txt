This review is only for happy hour. Came on a Saturday night around 530 and we were the only customers. This place reminds me of a wanna be Blue Martini... it is a lounge and seems pretty out of place for the location. We came because they had actually had a Saturday Happy Hour - rare!! Wine was $5 or $6 per glass. They also had a small plates menu and a lot of them sounded good but we were planning on eating next door. Some were fairly priced around 5\/6$ others were $10. Our server was nice enough but they messed up the check and forgot to take off happy hour discount until we said something.
