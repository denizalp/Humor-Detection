Oh my gosh, I love these people! I submitted my request for an estimate and Jenifer was quick to respond. She is very pleasant and extremely easy to work with. She requested a picture and was quick to get back to me with a VERY reasonable price. I liked that it wasn't drawn out with having to schedule an appointment for someone to come out and give an estimate. The morning of my appointment I was a bit nervous to tell Jenifer that I had changed my mind with what I wanted done. Her response was, \"Whatever works for you.\" She asked me to let Aron know when they arrive. Aron and Berry were right on schedule and cool with the change of plans. They work well together and efficiently. They trimmed a large fig tree, removed a very overgrown cat's claw vine AND cleaned up like no other ~ all in an hour! It was so well worth the extra money! It looks so much better and I can now enjoy my backyard, again. I appreciate all three of them so much and HIGHLY recommend them! I will continue to have them maintain the fig tree. Thank you!!!
