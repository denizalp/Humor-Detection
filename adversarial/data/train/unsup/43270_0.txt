This location is pretty well maintained and easily accessible. There is a decent selection of everything from fresh veggies and meats to pet supplies and your everyday household and beauty supplies. There is also a selection of wine, beer and liquor. \n\nThe bakery department doesn't have a huge selection of goodies but what they do have showcased is absolutely delicious. I don't buy my veggies anywhere else but here. They are fresh and last a long time. I've ordered some steaks from the meat department and am very impressed by their selections. Even the deli has some awesome sandwich meats and cheeses my hubby and I love!\n\nThe workers that I have encountered have been helpful and nice for the most part but I have come across some cashiers that just seem like they don't care and will not smile.  \n\nWe really love that we can easily go across the street and pick up things when we need them.
