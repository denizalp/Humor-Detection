This is one of my new (new to me, anyway) favorite restaurants!  I went there for the first time for lunch and had the Croque Madame and it was delicious.  There was something about the bread, cheese, ham, and fried egg on top that just melted in my mouth.  The location is fantastic, just off of 17th Avenue in Mount Royal Village.  It wasn't too busy when I went so I sat on the patio and people-watched.  The decor is very European; I felt like I was in a small bistro in Paris.  I highly recommend Parc.
