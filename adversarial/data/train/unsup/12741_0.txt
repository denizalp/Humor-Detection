This resort has had it. It is old as the dickens and completely worn out. It smells stale, no elevator, and the food .\n\nI went on a writing excursion, so I wasn't there Romancing the Stone. It got the job done, but if you're looking for a bit more oomph, this ain't it. Drive a few more miles down.
