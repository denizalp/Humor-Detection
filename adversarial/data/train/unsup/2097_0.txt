What's better than watching Book of Mormon in a Frank Lloyd Wright auditorium?  Probably watching it in one with plentiful bathrooms, but that's the only thing I can think of.\n\nWe were in the nosebleeds since I'm too cheap to spend actual money on seats, and I would have expected to have difficulty seeing or hearing the production.  Somehow, though, the shape of the building funnels your vision directly to the stage, and as you're not able to see the rows of people floors below you, you feel like you have choice seats.  It's like the guy who designed this building is some genius architect or something.  The sound system was great and I never had any difficulty hearing the actors.\n\nAll in all, great experience and a killer production.  I'm looking forward to coming back for another show!
