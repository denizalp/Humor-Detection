Their fried chicken is amazing as it should be since it's what made them famous! The Mac and cheese was good but I was not as blown away as I expected. Their Brussels sprouts were yummy as first but after a couple hours, those that tasted them were still burping them up. This is one of my favorite dishes so I know it wasn't the sprouts themselves. Must have been something in the sauce but still good! Give this place a try if you like fresh hot chicken and the most amazing biscuits you will ever taste!
