The best ravioli is the cooked meat ravioli with meat sauce and cheese at the St. Lawrence market .  This shop is called \"St.Lawrence Pizza & Ice Cream\" but almost everyone there gets their fresh homemade pastas, or their takeout cooked pastas. \n\nI don't actually love their fresh ravioli you can purchase to cook at home...but somehow their cooked raviolis for takeout .... is different and soooo GOOD.  \n\nWe are regulars there and we tend to buy a large cooked meat ravioli with extra meat sauce and extra cheese.  Make sure to ask for extra and if you don't get enough...ask again.  It's not truly full if they don't have trouble putting on the lid.  \n\nUsually a large box is more then enough for lunch for both of us.  We tend to alternate Saturday lunches between ravioli and peameal bacon sandwiches at Carousel Bakery. .
