Omg - the lunch buffet is insanely amazing, every dish is delicious. I am big into Indian food- and from New York, so i know pretty much about Indian food. But this place is a blast- quality of food is 10\/10. Service by staff 10\/10. Cleanness, cutlery, variety of food- everything is amazing. Price is very decent for this kind of buffet $ 12 for lunch buffet . It's equal to pay nothing for this food. Host is amazing, very nice experienced guy, who knows the likes and dislikes of custmors. Interior decor of the place so beautiful, very decent place.\n\nStrongly recommended.
