Very nice hotel. Convenient to the airport and downtown Charlotte, NC. You do have to be mindful of your surrounding. Some break in of cars in the parking lot have being reported. Excellent breakfast everyday with a very helpful staff. All the rooms have been updated giving each room a very clean very upscale feel!
