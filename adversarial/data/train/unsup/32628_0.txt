I bought a Groupon and a Living Social for 2 different services,  I was told when I called them that only one could be used.  OK, I get it.  I asked if there were any other costs, was told that if I wanted Scotchgard on my furniture it would be an extra $40. Agreed to this, even though I could buy a few cans of Scotchgard for $10 and do it myself.  The technician Alex showed up, and stated he would charge $60 for stain remover application.  I asked how it could possibly cost $60 to merely spray a chemical on.  I needed stain removal so was forced into paying for this too.  When wet, the couches looked clean, but as soon as they dried the stains were still there.  So very unhappy with my service, will never use them again
