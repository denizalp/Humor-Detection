It's what you'd expect in this corner of Charleston & Rampart. Homey atmosphere that gives you the feel of farm fresh to the table. Pretty decor that lets you know you are about to pay for it.\nOrdered the much touted Biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. It was ok. Battered chicken breast with an overly generous slather of honey mustard atop cole slaw. Served alongside a small salad of edamame, kale, cheese, carrots, radishes, seeds with a light vinaigrette. A glamorized chicken sandwich that I don't think is worth $13.00.\nThe Tuna tartare was good, but as my daughter says, \"it's pretty hard to mess up tuna tartare\". A small portion and overpriced at $15.00.\nService was ok. This place seems to cater to a typical pretentious Summerlin crowd. Overall, nothing special and not worth the $40 lunch bill for 2 for an app and fried chicken sandwich with one soda.\nHo hum, tried it and won't be back.
