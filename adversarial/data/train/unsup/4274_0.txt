This place serves a really good burger. It can be made to order. You can choose fried pickle chips, onion rings, lettuce, beef steak tomotoes, name it, it is included. I could not have enjoyed it more.  \n\nI ordered the waffle fries, they came to the table cold and dry. I had to send them back. They still were a not so great when I got a new order.  I should have tried the cheese fries. They looked really good. The onion rings were delicious. Greasy goodness. \n\nThe waitresses were very friendly and helpful with menu selections honestly. There are so many drink specials it was hard for me to choose. The parking situation is clumsy.  Very little parking by the grill. There is parking around the corner with ominous warnings to take all of your belongings and no guarantee of safety at all. Park at your own risk. \n\nI had patio dining on a wonderful day. A breeze came along and knocked the umbrella on my head. I was stunned and a bit dazed. This was an easily preventable accident. \n\nThe base of the umbrella was not weighted. The umbrella had a flimsy zip cord keeping it attached to the railing. It was not safe. It was mere inches from my eyes l was lucky my head took most of the brunt and less of my face. I had some swelling on the right side of my face and headache that night. I was sorry to see managment was not extremely concerned by this error.\n\nMy bill was deducted by a few dollars. The price of my mediocre tasting waffle fries. In an accident of this nature it would have been better to not bill my party at all. A more litigious patron would have called their lawyer from the table. I would have loved to give more stars, however getting hit in the head  while eating dry waffle fries was a serious offense that was taken much too lightly by management.
