A group of friends and I went there recently for dinner, and we were told that they no longer served food! They only serve tapas such as olives, nuts, marinated vegetables, meat balls and Mac n'cheese. The overall set up is really nice, there are tables all over the place. The music is really cool, hip, relax, remixes, jazz, rap. The crowd seemed between the ages of 20-24. I recommend that you show up before 11pm because it gets pretty packed inside, and the line up to get it in, is quite long. I don't think I would go there again.
