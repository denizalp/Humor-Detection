I've visited this place twice now. Right in Koreatown, white brick is a hidden gem. I stumbled upon this place originally on Instagram and what caught my eye was the uhhhh-MAZING Joe fries! Sloppy joe meat with fresh cut fries topped with a fried egg and drizzled with sriracha mayo, these fries are to-die-for. My fianc√© and I also split the 4-cheese grilled cheese with tomato jam, put the ketchup away because that jam is perfect! To drink I also indulged in the beef-bacon Caesar which is spicy but none-the-less delicious and garnished with a perfectly crispy piece of beef bacon on top. \n\nMy only complaint is that I do not live next door to this place so I could indulge all the time!
