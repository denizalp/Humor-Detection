Love this sushi place! Super affordable prices and consistently quality sushi. They have a huge selection of specialty rolls and all the ones I've tried have been really good. My favorite was the sushi boat for two, which had a really good assortment of sashimi and nigiri and two rolls. For a small extra charge, you can choose the specialty rolls that you want on the boat, which was definitely worth it. This place has the most affordable, best value sushi out of any of the sushi restaurants I have tried in the Cleveland area.
