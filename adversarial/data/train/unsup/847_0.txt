ABC has become a weekly stop. We came after watching Kitchen Nightmares because although I am ashes to admit it our curiosity got the best of us. What we found was a pair of passionate owners who put their heart and soul into their restaurant and they do an amazing job. The food is fantastic, the ambiance is great and the desserts are to die for! Amy is a baking genius. Her candy bar tart is a toffee chocolaty piece of heaven in a bite. Sammy is super friendly and courteous and has welcomed us like long lost friends since our first visit. We fell in love with this place and Sammi and Amy - it is our new favorite place!
