I love Loganberry Books so much that it makes me feel like I should downgrade every review I've written because so few other places can even compare (ok, Tina's is a 5-star also). The place is just breathtaking.\n\nIf I lived on the east side, I would go here every day just to sit in a comfy chair and hang out amongst the tall shelves of books. The collection of books is wonderful and I always find several books that I need to take home.  I love the quirky cat paraphernalia at the register. They also have some amaaazing note cards - they are worthy of being framed.
