I can't believe I just paid $15 for a cold coffee, a stale muffin and a bottle of water. The quality of the products should be on point, especially when the pricing is obscenely inflated because the establishment happens to be inside a prominent hotel on the Strip. \n\nShame on you, Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf!
