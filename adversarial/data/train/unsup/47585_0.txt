melon salad needed a little salt to bring out the flavor, if you don't have salt on the table you need to get it right,  had the fish trio the portions of ahi and butter fish were very small the salmon was a bit bigger, all were cooked correctly and tasted good, the rice was served on a seperate plate which made mixing with the sauces akward, the bok choy side consisted of one leaf, must be running low.  Dessert was ok they did a great job making scratch creme brulee taste like instant and the pineapple thingy was the high light of the evening, if I was headed home from a winning time at the casino and my car broke down out front I would think about stopping in for a bite
