My buddy and I came here one afternoon to get some ice cream.  I got 3 scoops in a waffle bowl.  I got a scoop of salted butter caramel, a scoop of almond butter crunch and a scoop of peanut butter chip.  This ice cream has the same texture of Breyers.  More icy than creamy.  It was freaking delicious though and all 3 flavors were unique in their own way.  It was $6.25 I believe after the waffle bowl was thrown in there.  It was tasty.  My buddy tried the sweet corn ice cream.  I had a taste of it and it was surprisingly good.  He also picked up a bag of bacon brittle.  It was just ok...I thought it would be like crunchy toffee with bacon in it.  It was soft like caramel almost with bacon in it.  Overall it was a good stop and their ice cream flavors are a little crazy, but they all work out somehow.
