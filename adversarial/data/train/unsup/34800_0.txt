Went to Vegas for a long weekend this past Friday.  I saw Honey Salt on Yelp prior to going and decided to check it out after I landed.  Be advised you will either need a car or be prepared to take a 15-20 minute cab ride if you're staying on the Vegas strip.  I got there around 2:00 and was surprised that the restaurant was still about 75% full.  I took that as a good sign since I showed up at an off peak hour.  Since I was by myself, I sat at the bar.  The bartender was friendly and provided attentive service.  I decided to go with the Ahi Tuna Tartare Tostada.  The tuna was fresh and light and the yuzu slaw provided a nice acidic kick to the rich tuna.  \n\nThe only thing lacking was a little bit of salt.  I probably could have asked for a salt shaker, but it wasn't that big of deal so I just went with it.  All in all it was a tasty dish.  There were several other things on their menu that I would like to try, so if I'm ever in that part of Vegas again I'll be sure to stop by.
