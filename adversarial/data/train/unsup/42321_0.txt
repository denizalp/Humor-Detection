I'm torn.  My wife and I tried this place primarily because it was profiled on DDD.  We shared a pizza.  Thin crust (the way we like) and it was probably one of the tastiest pizzas we've ever had!\nBUT, when it arrived at our table it was BARELY lukewarm.  Had it been sitting around awhile before the server brought it to us?  Was it so busy in there that it took some time for the server to bring it to us?  I don't know.\nSorry, guys.  That's why I can't give you 5 stars.
