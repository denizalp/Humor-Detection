This place is so gross . I remember going to Golden Corral as a kid with the entire family and it used to be a good quality meal . Now everything seems like it's been sitting for hours , but what's really causing me to give this place a one star review is that I'm very convinced that there is something the restaurant puts in the food to make you feel fuller faster.  I had an upset stomach for hours after I ate here and felt extremely bloated ! I always eat pretty clean , and decided to go here because they have a variety of healthy choices so after feeling the way I do , this will be the last time I go here ! However if you're up for some low quality food and don't care about what you put in your body , this is a great place ;)
