Cool and quaint. Limited seating but a wide array of offerings. Just enough food to relieve the palate and form some great pairings.\n\nCool and hip offerings of bottle beers as well as some local upscale draught. Two TV'S will get the sports fan their fix. Pretty hipster with live music on Thursdays starting at 7pm.\n#vinosquared #vino2ultimate
