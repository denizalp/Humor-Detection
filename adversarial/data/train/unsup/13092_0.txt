I went to his show three or four summers ago with two of my friends before I was 21.  We were running a bit late after dinner, and literally sprinted inside!  We were rushing to our seats, and Wayne Brady teased us a bit about being late, and then told us that it was okay because we were cute.  So of COURSE I was thrilled and SO excited because I was so star struck.  I felt giddy the entire night!\n\nFrom watching Whose Line when I was I was a kid, I have alwayyyys liked him, but he does even better with his own show.  I thought he was hilaaaarious and really engaged the entire audience by having people come up and act as props \/ etc.  \n\nAfter the show ended, everyone in the first row got to stay in the lobby area with him and get a picture \/ autograph.  My friends and I weren't in the first row, but we REALLY REALLY wanted to meet him, so we waited outside the glass doors.  He motioned to the security guards to let us in, which made me SOOOO happy!!!  We got to take pictures with him, and he gave us each an autographed photo of him :)\n\nI get excited just thinking about this... hahaha.  But really -- he really cares about his audience \/ fans... even a group of stupid teenagers who can't do anything in Vegas but watch shows.
