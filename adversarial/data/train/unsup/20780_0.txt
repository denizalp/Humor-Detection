Stopped in for a beer after leaving a recent Pirates game early (it was cold!). \n\nRather nondescript place, devoid of any personality--seems like they're going for an upscale sports bar vibe--but I think they just opened the week before, so I'll allow them some growing pains. Odd scene: they had sound on for Pirates game, then, as Bucs were two batters from closing out the game, they start blasting music? After Pirates game ends (as does the one song), they put sound back on for Pens game. Inexplicably, in last two minutes of that game, they again start blasting music? Weird.\n\nAnywho, after a couple beers, my buds and I headed out into the night. Don't think I'd come back on my next trip to the 'Burgh.
