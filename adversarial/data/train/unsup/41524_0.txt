I don't quite understand the reason for the not-so-great reviews. I really enjoyed my lunch there right now. An order of Tacos Al Pastor and an Agua de Jamaica... both very good. I liked the consistency of the soft tacos a lot and found the grilled pork on the tacos very flavourful and tender. The tacos were topped with grilled (?) pineapple, which worked really well with the medium salsa and the  bottled Valentina hot sauce. Really enjoy my meal.\n\nThe restaurant now has a portable AC, which works alright. I imagine it may be a bit on the warm side on a rally hot day.
