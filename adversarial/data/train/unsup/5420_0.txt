IM A FAN!\n\nThis buffet is inside the Talking Stick Resort and Casino. If you park in the West Parking structure and walk across the breeze way your will be pretty close to the buffet entrance. \n\nI was a little hesitant to try this buffet because of their steep weekend prices (~$45\/adult; thats like a Vegas Casino Buffet!) but we tried it on the weekday because its a little bit cheaper during the weekdays. Wednesday nights are prime rib night for ~$20. In all honesty, $20 for the variety and food that is offered is a great deal!\n\nThey have 7 different sections: Salad, Asian, Meat carving, Mexican, Raw seafood, Italian, and dessert. The Asian section was actually pretty yummy. It tasted A LOT better than your regular $7 Chinese buffets. It included fried rice, noodles, stir fry with muscles and clams, chicken wings, duck, egg rolls, cream puffs, and soups. It was mostly Chinese food, so I do wish there was more of a variety. The Meat carving station included prime rib and ham. Not too shabby. Mexican and Italian sections were both small but had the usual. Wednesday night also included shrimp cocktails and raw oysters! I was surprised. The dessert had a HUGE variety. from 10+ different amazingly delicious gelato flavors to pies, cakes, mousses, tarts, brownies, and cookies. \n\nFor $20 I will come back again; but I can't imagine what else they would serve for double the price! \n\nEnvironment: 5\/5\nFood: 4\/5\nPrice: 4\/5\nService: 4\/5
