Good BBQ in Vegas has been very hard to find, especially when you're from Kansas City which is one of America's BBQ capitals. Rollin Smoke is the ONLY place in Vegas for the past 2 years now that consistently satisfies my cravings for good BBQ. If I get a bad case of homesickness, Rollin Smoke's brisket is the cure. \n\nLocation: Off the beaten path. Yeah, its hard to get to but that's why you have the Yelp app on your smartphone. \n\nParking: If it's busy it can be tight. But I've always found a place to park. \n\nSeating: If you're with someone who's claustrophobic or hates eating in close quarters around others get your food to go. It's kinda tight inside. \n\nPrice: Compared with BBQ places I've been to in the Carolinas, Memphis, Texas, and Kansas City I think the pricing is quite reasonable for the amount of food you get. You can overpay for crappy BBQ at a lot of places in Vegas, or you can pay a fair price and get quality at Rollin Smoke. It's your choice. \n\nService: It's not perfect but the staff knows how to hustle and get you in and out for lunch, or if you're trying to eat before catching a show or heading to somewhere on the Strip. And even with the speedy service you still get great BBQ!\n\nFrom brisket to ribs and their beans, I have yet to find anything here that sucks. It's just good. Really good. Overall you really can't go wrong coming here. \n\nI try and limit posting 5 Star reviews these days but Rollin Smoke has earned nothing less.
