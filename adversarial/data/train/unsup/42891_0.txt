Waiter was extremely knowledgeable about his menu. Considering the fact that I've never been to a Peruvian resto and was quite hesitant as to what to have, it was a major plus. I dont remember the name of the meal I've ordered but it was in the appetizers section. It was something like a layer of mashed potatoes , a layer of shrimps, another layer of mashed potatoes so on and so forth. Absolutely delicious. Spiced perfectly. I will definitely go again. Note that this restaurant is a little bit more on the pricey side, but its SO worth it!
