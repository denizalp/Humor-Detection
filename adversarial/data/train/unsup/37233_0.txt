Mr.monkey brains told me They do not have couch pillows, memory foam, a light sting, and my specific spay.   I briefly checked and gave Mr.monkey brains the Benefit of the doubt that the store is understocked and left to buy all my items at target even though I don't agree with targets political views. If you're a female I highly suggest going somewhere else because there is a high amount of sketchy tweaking bum beggers that are a few steps away from setting up tent city on the side of the store, even saw some employees taking a smoke break with them. Shut this embarrassment down Walmart! \n\nI guess I forgot to post this old review. Here's another one. Came here for a frezzbie came to a total of 1.02 the girl at the front couldn't spot me 2 cents. I didn't say thanks and tried to leave then security at the front told me I need a receipt. I had to go all the back and get it. She knew I needed one but didn't bother to give me just cause I didn't say thanks probably. C bag
