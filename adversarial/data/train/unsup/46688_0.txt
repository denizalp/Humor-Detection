Most useless customer service blonde chubster girl at the front desk today. Asked her to play something in the cardio cinema, and she replied \"sorry cant, i dont have the remote, it plays a movie channel only\"....which was pure bulls%^# as it was flipped to the HGTV channel. Never had someone so lazy to walk over and just play something. She should work somewhere where she doesnt have to talk to customers. Maybe as the gym janitor? #annoyed
