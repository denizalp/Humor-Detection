AMAZING!!!!!!\n\nI could leave it at that, but I won't. This is hands down the best restaurant in Brooklin!!\n\nI have eaten here several times and it has been fantastic each and every time!\nAmbiance 10+, Service 10+, and Food 11+\n\n\nFrom apps to entrees this place has nailed its quality down, the micro brews on tap are sure to please too!\n The salads are incredible, I have to say I have never had a better one anywhere... and these aren't your cheap \"chef salad\" or \"Caesar\" in fact they don't have either.\n\nWine selection is priced well, could do with a few more \"mid\" priced selections but the owners are super friendly and aim to please, so no doubt they will up the selection soon.
