If I can, I will give it a no star.they don't deserve a star.we bought nisaan altima last year from here only.this review is not about car.they gave us a voucher of car tent sale and told us if we went there for a test driving, we would get 25 dollar.we went there for one of our friend, who was Interested to buy a car.he did choose some car, did test drive but every car he choose had some problems inside engine or some thing.anywho he asked for that 25 dollar, then after half an hour they came back and told us there were no more check left, we have to go to showroom office.he went there then, and there also after made him seat for sometime they told him that they have no more check left.seriously!!! This Is not about money.we just expected honesty from this big named dealer.this is nothing but cheap cheating..
