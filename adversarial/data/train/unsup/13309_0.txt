I took the Rifle I Tactical Training Course and was completely impressed.  It was a very full 2-day course taking place on the Sewet Gun Range, a choice location where Federal gun laws apply. Ryan was the lead instructor and started us off with a ton of useful info that was made approachable by his ability to ask questions and get us talking. I figured out quickly that \"basic\" doesn't necessarily mean beginner: basic meant setting up the proper foundations for using your rifle effectively in combat situations. He and Tyler (#2 instructor both former infantry Marines) covered everything from choosing the right accessories for your rifle, to battle mindset to finding the best cover, all with a great balance of humor and seriousness. We were out there from 8:30-6:30 the first day and got in about 5 hours of shooting. They showed me the best stance for combat, explained why, and led me through adjusting the basic stance for kneeling and prone while coaching me on manipulating the rifle through transitions. Everyone had a good laugh watching me try to shoot weak side while lying down taking cover behind the wheel of a truck; apparently, I'm blind in my left eye and prone to strangling myself on slings. What made the experience fun was the attitude of the instructors and students. Everyone was supportive and was willing to laugh at themselves. As a civilian female who picked up shooting just 2 yrs ago, I was serious about learning while intent on having some fun. This MOA class had a vibe that just felt right. This was the most fun I ever had sweating, rolling in dirt and getting out of the office. It's probably the best deal in town. One warning: If you are not used to being around Marines, be sure you are comfortable with a certain amount of cussing and whatnot. Ryan and Tyler are the real deal.
