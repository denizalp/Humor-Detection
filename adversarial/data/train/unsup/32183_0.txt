I don't live near the Junction and yet I find myself returning to the Indie Ale House at least a couple of times a year. The food is always much better than you'd expect, and the beer is, perhaps unsurprisingly, delicious.\n\nThis time around I opted to try the Short Rib \"Royale\" Burger (stout braised, shredded short ribs, quarter pound \"Indie blend\" patty, gruyere cheese, crispy onions, roasted garlic & thyme aioli).\n\nIt arrived pretty quickly and I happily dove in. I will admit I was turned off by the concoction's terrible bun-to-meat ratio, as I took three bites comprised solely of bread. (The toasted, buttered bread is delicious, at least.)\n\nOnce I got to the meat, however, I was very pleasantly surprised. The braised and shredded short ribs were tender and flavorful, while the assorted toppings complemented the burger perfectly. I can't say I noticed the \"quarter pound indie blend patty,\" though. Maybe they forgot to include it?\n\nI also opted for a salad rather than fries. The kale-heavy salad is one of the few times I've been disappointed by something at the Indie Ale House, as it was just too plain and too uninspired to warrant any excitement.\n\nI should also mention I sampled the Takes Two to Mango beer, which was indeed very mango-heavy (and very tasty).
