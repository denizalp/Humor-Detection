Sorry Lulu's it's nothing personal. \n\nI've been to a lot of asian restaurants in my day and I can honestly say that the cost value of this place is by far the worst. They charge an average amount for some less than decent food.  It's a go to place for a lot of college kids but personally it does not suit my tastes. \nThe Pad thai is too sweet and is supposed to be one of their best dishes. I've tried their other noodle dishes but I've got to say I'm still not convinced.
