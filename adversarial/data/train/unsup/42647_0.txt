This might be the best Mexican food spot in all of Phoenix. It is family owned and the whole family works in the shop. The food taste just like my nana made it. Have been here a few times and had different dishes and all have been good. Bean burrito enchilada style, menudo, carna asada taco, huevos rancheros. All have been on point. \nCustomer service was also really good. Can tell it is a family spot that values return customers.
