Does Aria mean = Ahhhhhh Righ(t) huh?! Because that's probably how you'd feel = all right! (I know that was lame...... please don't shoot me for that one). \n\nVery beautiful and extravagant! \n\nI didn't stay here, but just visiting the casino - amazing architecture! Especially their city-center! Lots of shops that I can hardly afford! (hence my window shopping). But hey, this place is swanky so if you've got the $$$ check this place out!\n\nFYI = they've got a tram that connects you to Bellagio!
