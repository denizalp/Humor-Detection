Been in the area for the past two years and never visited this location.  It was hard to justify a visit when I could toss a K-cup or two...or three at my residence.  I probably saved myself several hundred dollars.  Sadly, I lacked the ability to make myself a Venti, iced, dirty, double chai, my new favorite vehicle to deliver caffeine to my weak body and wobbly mind.  Thus, I have paid this commercial powerhouse a visit or three in recent weeks.  I have yet to walk inside due to being on the move.  The service is friendly and drive-thru is very efficient, no matter the line.  This espresso syndicate provides.
