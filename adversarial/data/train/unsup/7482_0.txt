This is a very impressive Korean BBQ place rated five stars from over one hundred reviews! I couldn't resist since it's scarce in Vegas to find a good quality Korean BBQ place. The newbie on the block, Hobak made it on my list for stupendous quality of meat and service!\n\n- FREE slushies while you wait for your table\n- You walk towards your table and the entire staff \n   welcomes you\n- Table is ready with side dishes, water, and all \n   the fixins\n- Affordable prices, simple menu and three  \n   different combos to choose from\n- Charcoal and gas grill combo are used\n- Server does the grilling and the meat cutting\n- Grill is changed often\n- Quality and flavor of meats are superb!\n  (Highlight: skirt steak and spicy pork belly 2      \n   thumbs up)\n- Oral hygiene supplies are complimentary in \n   restroom areas\n\nOn a little side note.. I felt the round table was cramped for a party of four with all the dishes on the table. Although the banchan they offered were not all that bad, I prefer other options. The server does all the grilling and the cutting, but would rather do the work myself. To pull all things together, Hobak gave me a lasting impression that has persuaded me to come back for more! Hobak Korean BBQ newbie! \n\n                    You've earned my 5 stars!
