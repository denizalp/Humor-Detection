This is supposedly the largest hooters in the world or something. It's inside the Palms hotel. It's clean and easy to get to. BUT, being a Hooters you can be assured that...\n\n1. The service sucks.\n2. The food sucks.\n\nWe waited at the host stand for 10 mins before anyone even came out to greet us. The food order came wrong (always happens at ANY Hooters). And the food was borderline uneatable. \n\nThe entire point of a Hooters is for overweight middle aged men with a 500lb wife at home who would rather go play with the teenage hooters girls. No one really goes here for the food mind you.
