The rent for this place is fairly low and I have wondered why. That is until I visited this place today to collect something from a friend. The place is not well-kept. The carpet is old, very dirty, and dusty. There are multiple big (around a foot in diameter) stains on the carpets in the hallway. The place looks like it has never been properly cleaned or renovated in at least a decade. The person at desk stopped me because she recognized that I wasn't from the building. That is fair, but the desk attendant wasn't satisfied with the name of the person I was visiting and the 5 digit buzz number I provided which I later learnt had the room number as its first 3 digits! She continued to be obnoxious while I called my friend and confirmed her apartment number. After I got the apartment number, she asked me again for the name of the person I was visiting and then she tried to look it up (what was the point of asking for the apartment number then). She couldn't find the name in her records, so she claimed the person I was visiting was new in the building (not true at all) and that she didn't like people who came into the building all the time not knowing who they were visiting (clearly not true in my case). She continued looking in her registers for a while without success before allowing me up anyway after having sufficiently flexed her muscles. I would not want any visiting guests of mine to suffer such obnoxious behavior and therefore I don't think I could live in catman. It might make sense if you are an undergraduate student at CMU or UPitt and are ok with being treated like shit.
