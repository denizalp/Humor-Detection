I went off of the reviews and I had a great experience! I had both the GEL MANICURE AND PEDICURE by Amber :) I called in to set an appointment , SO IT'S A MUST to call in beforehand :) \n\n\nPedicure. \nThere was an oil massage and hot stones , but no exfoliator or scrub .  Sad ! 3\/5 \n\n\nManicure. \nGreat ! Loved how she did 3 layers and rotations with the uv light :) \n\nTotal time 2 hours ! I felt special she took her time 5\/5\nThey were welcoming :) 5\n$32.00 for gel pedicure \n$25.00 for gel manicure  \n\nWill come back :)
