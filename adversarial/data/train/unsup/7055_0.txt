It was ok. Not worth the hype or the ticket price. Great music. Very talented musicians and overall artists but the content of the show was a bit void of substance. It began to touch on the surface of some interesting ideas but it didn't really follow any of them through making it a bit of a bore. A lot of time wasted with audience participation and walking through the crowd several times throughout the 1.5hr show to pick people out. I get that they are trying to make a commentary on society but it's extremely watered down to the point where it's practically empty of any meaning. Music and special effects was the best part about it, as well as the gimmicky quick thrills used throughout to keep the audience's attention in what was an otherwise boring and uneventful show. \n\nI wonder if the NY version is the same or if this one is specifically dummed down for the people that frequent Vegas vs. the cultured NY theater goers. This same show in NY, Chicago, London or LA would be a joke. I yawned a few times. I get what they were trying to do but they didn't take it all  the way. Fail. A good time, but not worth $75-$200 per ticket.
