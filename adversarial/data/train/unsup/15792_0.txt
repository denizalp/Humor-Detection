I knew I was taking a chance when I saw how old the barbers were at this place. Maybe I came in at a bad time, but when my turn came I ended up in the chair of a retired barbershop owner from Saginaw. Nice guy, no problem, but his idea of a haircut is to just shear it all off. Hell, three weeks later and I still don't need a comb. This was a very clean shop, and maybe it's my fault for not telling him to go easy on what little hair I have left. Anyhow, I don't think I'll be going back. For those who do go to Tony's, however, my advice is to speak up about what you want before you sit yourself down in that big swivel chair. Just saying you want a \"regular cut\" won't get it at Tony's.
