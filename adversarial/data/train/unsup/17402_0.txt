Dropping your pup off at a new groomer can be difficult and heart-wrenching, so having such a pleasant welcome when dropping my munchkin off at My Dog's Hair Salon put me at ease.\n\nI walked in around 7:45am, and was surprised to see the staff already working on grooming other pets, and were extremely welcoming. Erica was the one who greeted me and took down my information. My little munchkin was shaking, but Erica again put me at ease reminding me that our little ones shake sometimes out of excitement, not necessarily because they are afraid. I could see my little guy wanted to go play with the other dogs, so I gave him to Erica, knowing he'd be in good hands. Erica let me know that he would get his nails trimmed and teeth brushed -- and told me that they have a specialist who cleans pet's teeth without anesthesia! Yay! (My pup is due so I'll be back to get that done.)\n\nErica advised that, for a first time visit, it's always better to allow at least 4 hours so the animals get familiar with the environment, etc. so they're not scared while getting their cut. Well, 4 hours later my munchkin was picked up, and I can't get over how adorably cute he is! OMGoodness I haven't been able to stop smothering him with kisses (not that I wasn't smothering him before, but now I think he's thinking I'm going overboard, haha)\n\nHis cut was perfect length and style -- I asked Erica to give him a more round\/teddy bear-like look, and she did a wonderful job! Thank you! \n\nWhat's even better is that the next day, I received a follow-up text from Erica telling me that my little guy was a VERY good boy while at the salon. ***Proud mommy moment*** So very sweet and attentive! \n\nOverall me and my pup had a great experience at this salon, and will be back.
