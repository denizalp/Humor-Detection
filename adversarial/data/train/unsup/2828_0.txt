Went here today with a friend of my. We both been shitting since we left, I couldn't even make it home had 2 find a gas station to poop at. Now I'm at work feeling like shit, running to the bathroom every five minutes, so embarrassing! Will never eat there again, if you don't want your butt to hurt you shouldn't either\nCalled the store this morning, the \"manager\" didnt care we got sick trying to say we got sick somewhere else but that's the only place we eat yesterday. He said we can't have a refund we can come for a free meal, why would I want to eat there again? I just paid 30$ to get sick, never again!
