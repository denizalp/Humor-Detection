I have to say, this place continues to impress me. At first I thought - just an attractive bar. Another visit unveiled their amazing sandwiches. Tonight I delved into the guilty pleasure of Chicken Fingers - good grief - they're actually real chicken made right here like everything else!\nBottom line: this is an excellent, clean neighborhood bar that actually serves high quality, natural food. Oh, and has excellent service.
