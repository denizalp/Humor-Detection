Walking into The Labyrinth Lounge is like walking into Narnia after stumbling through the wardrobe....I discovered The Lab while trying to find the washroom inside Futures.... shocked by the contrast in mood I asked myself: Is this real life? \n\nThe Lab typically isn't my first choice when I go out - mainly because I always find myself on the phone for 2 minutes explaining where this place is only having to go rescue my company outside of the brunswick house... or as I like to call it Mt. Doom ! \n\nEvery day of the week they have some sort of insane drink deal that my brain can't comprehend.... one day its 3 dollar Jameson... 3 dollar PBR mugs..... 3 dollar Vodka mixed drinks.... it's insane how cheap this place is!!!\n\nIf i knew about the existence of The Lab while I was in college I would've probably set up some sort of shanty behind the dumpster outback and changed my name legally to Gigglin' Gus. \n\nAlthough the drink specials are unreal, there are a few short comings to this place such as the food menu being overpriced, (for bellow par bar fare).... and at times the music being just WAY too loud for a small space...\n\nDownstairs they have sketchy couches, whatever you do...DO NOT SIT ON THEM! I've heard multiple horror stories of passion that have taken place on that thing.... taking the term \"love seat\" to a WHOLE new level. \n\nIf you've never been to this place I'd suggest giving her a try !\n\nDon't forget to swing around back to see Ollllld Gus - room for one more ;) \n(Knock twice, *giggle*)
