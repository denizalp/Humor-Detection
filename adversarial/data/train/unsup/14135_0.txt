Ted's has been around since I was a teenager, and before that.  I love the onion rings, and they give you a ton!  I was not as impressed with the all beef hot dog though.  It seemed really salty to me!  I do not remember it being that salty.  Well, it is still a cool place.  Hasn't changed much.  Love the onion rings!
