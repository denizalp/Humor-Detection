Nacho Daddy Located On  Sahara In Las Vegas NV. Receives A Easy Solid 5 Star Review!\n\n5 Star Service!! 5 Star Food!!\n\nFrom Hosts (Courtney and Guy) Working Up Front That Greeted Us With Smiles When We First Entered ; To Our Waiter Brian (OUTSTANDING SERVICE) These Members Made Our First Time At Nacho Daddy A Memorable One! A Balloon Guy Also Goes Around Making Cool Balloons For The Kids!! \n\nIf You Wanna Feel Valued As A Customer, Definitely Give This Location A Try. :)\n\nThe Service We Received Was Top Notch From Our Food Server Brian. He Was Friendly, Outgoing, Professional and Patient. He Went Over The Menu With Us and Was Super Cool Answering Any Questions We Had. He Also Recommend Some Good Dishes Based On Our Likings and It Didn't Disappoint. \n\nOur Drinks Were NEVER Empty. Service Was Prompt By The Friendly Young Lady (long brown hair) Coming From The Bar Area and All The Way Over To Our Table. She Noticed Our Drinks Were Getting Half Full and When We Thanked Her (Because It's Wonderful When You Don't Have To Flag Them Down) She Replied \"Oh No Problem!\" She Explained How It's A Pet Peeve Of Hers To See Customers With Empty Glasses!\"  Sweeeeeeeeet!! When You Live In The Desert This Is Huge Plus!! \n\nOur Nachos (Fiesta Chicken Nacho) Was Sooo Good! The Shredded Chicken Was Moist and Seasoned Perfectly, Pickled Jalape√±os Were Firm and Fresh With The Perfect Amount Of Crunch and Heat. Chips Were Good And The  Cheese Covered Every Chip Making Each Bite A Satisfying One!! The Guacamole Was Aslo Fresh :) Highly Recommend\n\nMy American Tacos On A Hard Shell Were Pretty Darn Good. As Far as The Ingredients Go ;The Seasoned Ground Beef Was Fantastic Very Flavorful and The Sourcream and Cheese Ratio Was On Point. I Personally Will Probably Go Soft Shell Next Time, As I'm Not A Huge Fan Of the Hard Shell n Shell Kinda Taco, But It Was Still Really Good.\n\nTip- Leave Room For Desert.\n\nThe Deserts Here Are Amazing!! My Husband and Family Certainly Enjoyed The Sweet Treat As A Perfect Ending To A Wonderful Meal.\n\nMy Experience Was Exactly What I Look For When We Go Dining Out. Excellent Service To Go With A Delicious Meal,  You Bet We Will Be Back!\n\nNacho Daddy Is Worth A Bookmark and A Visit. I Highly Recommend This Location. Enjoy!!
