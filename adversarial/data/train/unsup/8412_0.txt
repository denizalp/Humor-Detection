We purchased tickets for the Saturday, June 21st interleague game between the visiting Cleveland Indians versus the Los Angeles Dodgers. Had I known when we purchased the tickets that there would be a heat wave in So. Cal., I may have opted to watch the game at home, but since we had the tickets, we decided to brave the sweltering ~100 degree heat. \n\nPhoto:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/UuxH5yQpl73XJkzfLN-qdg?select=WLkV5-gXrRcBtbOIt0cusA\n \nHighlights:\n \n- Cold beer tastes excellent in this concrete desert environment.\n- Our seats were located in the shade or we would surely have died in that sun.\n- I proudly wore my Cleveland Indians ball cap (which was Made in the U.S.A.).\n- Meeting the many dedicated Cleveland Indians fans who stayed for the entire game.\n- Witnessing Cleveland's pitcher C.C. Sabathia hit a first pitch home run.\n- Watching the Cleveland Indians win in 11 Innings.\n- Knowing that I'll be watching future games at home on television.\n\nCash Expenditures: \n \n- Filling the Gas Tank                                 $75\n- Field Level seats (1\/2 off)                        $70\n- Dodger Beers                                           $50\n- Dodger Dogs                                            $20\n- Dodger Hat (for Deb)                               $16\n- Dodger Logo - Water Sprayer                $15\n- Dodger Peanuts                                       $11\n- SPF 50 Sunscreen                                   $10\n- Dodger Magazine                                      $ 5\n\nGo Tribe!\n\nBy the way, in the L.A. Dodgers review, I thanked them for:\n\n1)  Draining my wallet of cash to pay their triple A players.\n2)  Losing to my favorite ballclub, the Cleveland Indians.\n3)  Reminding me it makes more sense to watch the game at home.
