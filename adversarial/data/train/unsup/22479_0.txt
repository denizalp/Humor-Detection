Based on our service for our recent trip to San Diego and San Franciso we are most definitely going to go with another airline. I have flown with all airlines all over the world. I expect issues but not the disrespect and low work ethics of this airline. The staff at the baggage check are miserable and unhelpful. The TSA staff need to smile and be courteous. This isn't a combat zone. They treat the public poorly. The first class is very attentive but I have had better. The last straw was they erroneously left our luggage in San Francisco when we landed in Cleveland. The rep stated they just didn't have time to load it. We were stunned. So if the plane is ready to leave and the baggage that wasn't yet loaded just gets left? Unacceptable. We found out others on our flight suffered the same fate. We remained polite and calm. I never disrespect people in a public service job. I did, however,  demand compensation since there was over a thousand dollars of new items we purchased in our suitcases including my new diamond earrings.  The company shipped our luggage out and it is enroute to us as we speak. Plus they gave us $600 in spending points for a free flight. I still will not use this airline again. My fiance and I both agree their standards are not up to ours and we do not want to have to have our belongings left for someone to go through. I will have to go through both our bags and ensure everything is there.
