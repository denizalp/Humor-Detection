Ended up here last week looking for a quick place to have lunch with a friend.  we thought they weren't open but someone came out and waved us in.  trying to catch a movie in an hour we decided to try them out.  we were first disappointed to find out that they don't have chicago style thin crust.  \"They have flatbread\"  but this was remiss.\n\nlet me preface by stating I spent the first 18 years of my life growing up in Northern Illinois and I'd like to think I know a thing or two about chicago pizza, generally you have your more popular Chicago style deep with the stuffed topping and a layer of sauce on top, then the lesser known \"but still delicious\" Chicago style thin, which is thicker than NY style usually square cut with lots of cheese and some of the toppings under the cheese, usually with sweeter sauce.\n\nwell Uno doesn't have this, they have flatbread, but I'm sorry I thought I was going into an \"AUTHENTIC CHICAGO STYLE PIZZA\" place for a chicago style pizza.  After we gave up the dream of thin crust we ordered a deep dish with a few meats. a while later (remember it's deep dish) we got our pizza and although it wasn't bad it wasn't anything special and I think they should maybe tone it down on the \"CHICAGO THIS, and CHICAGO that, keep your windy city to yourself, cuz I'm not fooled\"\n\nI give them credit for getting the pizza out in a reasonable time frame, but paying $25 for a pizza that was \"alright\" didn't leave me in a good mood.  But you can be kind of a dick about pizza when you grew up eating what you believe is some of the best pizza in the world.
