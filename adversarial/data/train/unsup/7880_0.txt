The food here is a tad pricey, but I forget that most Korean places will bring out their array of side dishes (kimchi, potatoes, anchovy, seaweed?, etc.) Other than that, I'm used to my BBQ having more of a BBQ flavor. Yes, that charred, I'm going to give you cancer eventually carcinogen flavor - don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about! The flavor was still really good but not exactly 5 star quality. , \n\nPluses are that they refilled side dishes! I've never been to any other Korean place that offered. They also refill your drinks, abd the kimchi doesn't make your mouth feel like its going to burn off.  =) All in all, its a very nicely decorated mom and pop run place that makes really quality food.
