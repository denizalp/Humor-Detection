This place hit the spot. All the food was fresh, delicious, came in generous portions and the service was fast and great. We called ahead for a large party and they held our table which was very nice. By the time we left, there was a line out the door - well deserved. The xiao long bao were delicious but my favorite was the Shrimp, Pork and Vegetable Wontons with Mung Bean Noodles, Schezuan Style. The sweet egg yolk steamed bun was also delicious.
