I would give them one star but I gave them two stars only because the food is pretty good, but the lines and the parking make this place a pain to try and visit.  One time I drove all the way over there to get waved away,  the last time I got there plenty early and waited and waited for them to open and when they did the line still didn't move.  Sorry but only one cutting station and a couple hundred people in line is ridiculous. Waiting in line for that long isn't worth the time or aggravation.  Like I said the food is good but I don't feel it's worth putting up with the wait and parking.  I would try them again if they got a building that better meets the amount of people they serve, but until then I'm not going back.
