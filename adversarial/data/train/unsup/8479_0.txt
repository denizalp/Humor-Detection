2\/30\n\nAll the old ladies love ABC Country (and LL Cool J). I go to a church where 80% of the congregation is over the age of 55, and they all love coming here for special occasions. Every now and then, I'd hear, \"we're going to ABC for a special Sunday brunch.\" \"My daughter is in town and she's taking me to ABC!\" \"It's our anniversary and we're going to ABC.\"\n\nSo my nephew and I walk over one day, and are immediately greeted by a warm and friendly staff. The decor is very much out of a Country Living magazine circa 1994, but clean and inviting. He ordered a pulled pork sandwich, I got an order of yam fries and the spinach pecan salad.\n\nThe food here isn't amazing, but it is pleasant. I can see why senior citizens love it here. The coffee is surprisingly tasty for a chain restaurant! And I drink my coffee black, so there's nothing to mask the flavor. The friendliness of the staff is 100% genuine. Solid 3 stars. I've been back a few times for coffee and hangs.
