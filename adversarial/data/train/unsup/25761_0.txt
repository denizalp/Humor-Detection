We were greeted and sat immediately, server arrived a few minutes later to take our orders and drinks with an unwelcoming attitude and tone. Okay, maybe he had a bad day? 20 minutes later the server returns to tell us things are backed up and there will be a little delay with our food, okay that's fine, it's a semi busy Friday night, totally reasonable. \n\nI ordered a salad pizza which is basically flatbread with salad on top. My partner ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich. Nothing complicated here. \n\n5 full tables of 4-6 people were sat after us and received all their food within the hour and fifteen minutes we gave this place. At least 8 delivery driver orders had been carried out. During this time our server disappeared from the floor sporadically and only returned to tend to his other tables across the floor, the two managers overseeing the place making their rounds completely ignored our table and eye contact. \n\nOdd part is, our table was located in the middle of the floor and we're not exactly small guys either. So there's no way all these people couldn't see us. \n\nWe sat there patiently, giving everyone the benefit of a doubt but were left alone ignored with disappointment. Server never returned to refill drinks or update us, literally avoided our table and turned his back to tend other tables as he came within calling distance. There was no shortage of staff so I doubt he was overloaded. \n\nUnfortunately we decided to just leave after that. left a few bucks on the table for the two sodas we got. Waiting and hour and fifteen minutes for essentially salad on flat bread and breaded chicken in a bun while being ignored is unreasonable considering the place wasn't full at all.\n\nJust sucks to have a terrible experience on your couples night out at a place that has otherwise glowing reviews.
