Flavors is a great place to satisfy any appetite and features continuous live cooking stations, freshly prepared seafood, all-you-can-eat crab legs and fresh cut Prime Rib, an array of delectable side dishes, traditional comfort foods and a variety of pastries prepared to perfection.\n \nI got this from their website but it's spot on, We were in vegas for a bachlor party last weekend and this place brought us back to life after long nights! i had brunch here twice!!! It was delicious maybe just good hangover food, But damn when are you not hung over in vegas?\n\nThe weird fake looking pizza that i normally wont even try at a buffet was pretty damn good! i had to check it out after my buddy's were talking about how great it was. The shrimp was pretty decent and the veggies were even kinda fresh.\n\nMy favorite plate i had was filled with biscuits and sausage gravy that didn't just fall apart when you stabbed them with your fork, And the gravy actully had peices of sausage in it not just flavored that way, Eggs that were so so i guess can't really mess up scrambled eggs, French toast that was just delicious and crab leggs stacked to the roof... I never thought i'd eat crab legs for breakfast much less occumpanied by french toast. Maybe i was really muffed up but it was deliscious. Throw in a bunch of free beer and champagne to wake you up, with a few crazy stories from the couple next to you and now thats how to start a day in vegas! \n\nI would recommend it to anyone. Im sure there are better buffets in lv but i doubt theres anything near as good for the price, save your money for alcohal and clubs
