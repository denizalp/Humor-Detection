This looks like no big deal from the out side, but then you bite into the sandwich! I am a firm believer in not judging a book by it's cover and this is a perfect example! The food here is so good and the service is fantastic. The older daughter of the owner  and the owner are the sweetest women I've met in Arizona!\nWhen I walk in, I feel like I am always greeted so warmly and they are always so kind. \nI would highly recommend this place to anyone from the east coast looking for a bite of home, or anyone who respects and appreciates great food!! \nMy one suggestion, preorder your food. It can get super busy in there at times!
