I was very sceptical about my first visit to his office. Im here for my niece and condition, but with all the ups and downs, just not sure. To my surprise the Dr is very legit guy. He was very interested in my nieces progression and a bit more surprised. His assistant Garrett is also a great dude and solid. Great visit and good well done!
