I tried the brisket, tacos, ribs, grits, mexicorn, pulled chicken.  Now eveyrhing was great. My favorite things out of all of it was the grits and mexicorn. For me it was satisfying. The grits was rich and savory. The mexicorn was fun and flavorful. Service was great. The frontline was happy and attentive. Highly recommend this is place even though it's a gas station!!! LOL!
