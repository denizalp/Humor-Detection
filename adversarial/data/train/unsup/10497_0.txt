I wanted to buy a nice custom spring suit, but not outrageously expensive. I was a walk in customer, and they accommodated me without an appointment which was good. The \"stylists\" were friendly and seemed knowledgable. My wife and I spent about an hour looking through fabric and having my measurements taken, which overall was fun. My sone small criticism at this stage was I felt they prodded me a bit too much into upgrading from \"custom\" to \"bespoke\", despite the fact that I had already agreed to spend what I consider a lot of money. After we finalized all details, they told me it would take 6-8  weeks to make and arrive. Eeeee. That's longer than I wanted to wait...but fine, good things are often worth the wait.\n\nFour weeks later, I received a call and was told they haven't even started making the suit as they don't actually have the fabric I selected. They then (albeit gently) again suggested I upgrade to \"bespoke\" so I could get a similar fabric.\n\nI was frustrated at how long it took them to identify the issue, so I ultimately asked for a refund and they didn't fuss too much and reasonably promptly refunded my credit card today.\n\nTo give them the benefit of the doubt, they very well may have been a \"one off\" kind of mess up, but I lost patience and am now in the market for a competitor.
