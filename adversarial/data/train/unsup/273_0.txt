Bar hop is an absolutely find for Craft Beer lovers in Toronto with a superb assortment of IPA's. I went on buck a shuck night (Tuesdays) and the oysters were incredible; impeccably clean and shucked by a master. One variety, briny, sweet and served with a shallot mignon and freshly grated horseradish. Bottled horseradish will never be good enough again. The rest of the menu looks fabulous....think beef cheeks with cheddar bacon grits and rapini or a burger ground in house with brisket and chuck YES! Give this place a shot. I will be her every trip to Toronto
