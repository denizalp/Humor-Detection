alright, there are two caveats to this:  1.  i have limited to no experience with korean barbecue. and 2. they are still working off of the limited menu with the full menu coming in the new year.\nlocation, location, location.  being smack dab in the middle of noda, miyagi's offers a new flavor to the hood.  what used to be consolidated press is a nice wide open  to grab some asian fare.\nthe look of the joint reminds me a lot of creation that used to be in plaza midwood.  the seating is the modern looking leather wrapped chrome which, for the owner's sake, i hope can stand the wear and tear of daily business.\na couple of friends and i bellied up to the bar for dinner last night.  the staff was courteous and personable and informed us of the abbreviated menu.\napothic red by the glass was perfect since it is my current inexpensive favorite wine.\nwe ordered the crab rangoon for an appetizer to split between the three of us.  the presentation was not what i expected.  usually, its the crab dip inside the wonton.  this was a dish of crab dip with wonton chips that had a sweet and sour sauce lightly drizzled on them.  not too bad at all.\ni ordered the bulgogi (steak), and my buddies the pork and ribs. the food came out in decent time and was good temperature.  since we weren't at the daniel-son fly catching level of chopstick usage, some flatware was necessary to tackle some of the meal.\nwe all shared our meals, and i would say that i chose best with the steak, although i thought all three meats had similar textures with subtle flavor differences.  i mean, it's all barbecue?  mine came with a ball of white rice, some sauted squash, and small saucers of the kim chi, cucumbers, and seaweed salad.  the last of which was not my style.\nin my opinion, the tab was a little steep for what we got.  with the tip, i got out of there for just north of $45.  i will definitely go back once they expand the menu and hope that they can become another solid noda staple.
