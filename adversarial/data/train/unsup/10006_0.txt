so impressed!\n\ni've stayed all over vegas and never have i had an experience like i did at the cosmo last weekend. all of the employees that we interacted with were amazing (minus the pit boss woman who yelled at me for dropping an eff bomb at the craps table, but i guess that was somewhat justified), the casino is beautiful, clean and so fun, the room service food was delicious (esp the lamb sliders!) and our suite was perfect with amazing views. \n\nif you're like me and prefer your swimming pools sans children, hit up the marquee dayclub instead.\n\ni can't believe i'm saying this, but i actually wish i stayed an extra night in vegas...
