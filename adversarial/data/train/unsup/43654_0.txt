My wife and I had a Living Social coupon and so we decided to try the place, but when we went by, the sign on the door said they were on vacation. Bad sign -- we're not from the area and we couldn't get back until after the coupon expired. Management offered to extend it for us, however. which was great because we were then able to try this really good Mexican food. \n\nWe both had the Los Dos Flautas special, which consisted of two very large and filling flautas filled with shredded beef or chicken. The beef was absolutely delicious -- just mouth watering, juicy and not too spicy. This restaurant is famous for it's hot, spicy foods so we were happy to find an entr√© that did not have too much zip. The flautas had a great guac and some very fresh sour cream, along with rather average rice but really excellent beans. \n\nI only wish this restaurant would have a low-powered gringo version of their salsa. Neither one of us could dip their excellent chips into the offered sauce. Too hot by far!
