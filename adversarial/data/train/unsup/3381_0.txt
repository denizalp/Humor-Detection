This isn't the run down mall I grew up going to... back in the day I remember coming all the way out here when it still had a bowling alley (where the Marshall's is now).\n\nThen it got even more run down.\n\nBut since it underwent quite a bit of reno a while ago now, it's now a much more serviceable mall.  For a value oriented mall, it's got both a winners and marshall's, a Walmart, no frills, and a Dollarama.\n\nIf you're looking for Gucci or Versace, I think you made a wrong left turn somewhere.
