You never give any thought to blinds.  \n\nThey just are.  They're uncommodities.  Like pencils or bibles or bobbypins.\n\nThey magically appear and that's that.\n\nSo you never think about buying them.   But then that one day comes when you need to get blinds and you have no idea where to go.\n\nI'm not going to lie.  The only reason we ended up here is because the word \"blinds\" was in the title and we felt that it was a safe bet.   \n\nWalking in, I was making snide comments on how this was going to be hell and about how I had absolutely no interest in completing this task.   My mind wandered to daydreams about bubble paper and bikini pillow fights.\n\nWe were greeted with a friendly smile right as we walked in the door.   It's amazing how much that makes you feel like you belong in a foreign environment.\n\nLaurna was outstanding at finding out exactly what we were looking for, she walked us through the seemingly-complicated options in a smart and directed manner.    As silly as this sounds, she made us actually feel empowered to make the right decisions.\n\nWe ordered custom blinds and they were ready to be installed in two days.   Just as promised.\n\nIt was way less expensive than we had ever imagined, and it actually was rather fun.\n\nOne of the most surprisingly positive shopping experiences I have ever had.   Strongly recommended.
