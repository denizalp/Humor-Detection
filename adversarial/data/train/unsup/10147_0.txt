In here to pick up a replacement straightening doo-dad for Mrs K., we found a huge variety with prices ranging from $10 to beyond $250. We managed to avoid getting asked if we needed any help and managed to avoid buying anything else. How does that happen?\n\nLots of stuff if you're looking for gifts, too!
