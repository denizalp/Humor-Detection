Another really good hamburger place. Actually, this place is really really similar to the Chuckbox in Tempe. From the food to the environment to plates. But this is a good thing. \n\nSo I ordered the Big Hamburger with fries. After waiting for like 20 minutes (worth it), they called my name. The food smelled great. Like Chuckbox, there is the toppings bar. So I got my toppings and all that stuff. Time to eat. \n\nSo upon taking a bite into this burger, it was good. Great! Not Chuckbox great, but still better than like In-N-Out or something. The burger was juicy, the bun was soft and the fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Sounds like a commercial, right? Because it looked that good and tasted how it looked which is usually not the case for food when advertised. \n\nAnyways, this is a place that I would come back if I was in the area or visiting any of my homies from the west side. Other than that, I can get Chuckbox. But this place is worth a try at least. \n\n:)
