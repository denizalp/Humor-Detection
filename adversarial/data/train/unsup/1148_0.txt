so my hair is very long and i am verrrrry particular about it. upon deciding between two salons to go get a hair cut, i called curl up n dye where i was greeted on the phone with a monotone, bored voice  saying \"Curl up n dye...\" who was literally yawning while talking to me. nothing at all to really make me want to check this place out. the polar opposite of how i was greeted from the other salon. Chose the other place because the receptionist actually made me feel like they wanted to cut my hair.
