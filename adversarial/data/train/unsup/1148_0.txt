I fully expect my kids to take care of me until I pass, should I be lucky enough to live that long.  Realistically, they probably won't.  \n\nSo if I had to retire in Sun City, the premier senior community where it's not uncommon to see the elderly cruising around in their pimped out golf carts, I'd pick this place.\n\nChefs that received proper culinary training, filet mignon once a month, special menus on holidays, room service--you can't go wrong.
