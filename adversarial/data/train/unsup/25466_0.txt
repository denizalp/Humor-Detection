Wow wow wow wow wow! I made plans for this show as a present for my girlfriend, and went with the attitude of \"she's ok.\" Let me tell you my mind was literally blown. I absolutely believe she was NOT lip syncing, and without a doubt she is one of the most talented live performers on the planet. JLO, I love you!!! If you are in Vegas, and unsure of which show to see, you've got to see this. All seats seemed great, upgrade options are available ( I was 9 rows from the stage with an upgrade) and it was good enough that I'm planning on seeing her AGAIN!! JLO rocks. And that bass.... lol
