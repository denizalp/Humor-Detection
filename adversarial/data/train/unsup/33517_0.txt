Ok, we came here for a late lunch. Definitely need to try the b-fast instead. We had the pulled pork & the shroom burger. The pulled pork is one thing that she's known for. The flavor of it is great, but the pork itself wasn't as tender as I would have liked. I love the kick in it though. They usually serve it on a roll, but the day we had it we had it on a bun. That was dee-lish. The bread was sweet and light. Me likes :) \n\nThe shroom burger was favored by both of us. Try it! I appreciate that the server double checked with us and made sure that we knew that the shroom burger was actually just a portobello mushroom and not a hamburger w\/shrooms. We knew, but I thought it was a kind gesture. \n\nI'm determined to come back and try the breakfasts though! If it wasn't for that, I'm not sure I love it enough to come more often.
