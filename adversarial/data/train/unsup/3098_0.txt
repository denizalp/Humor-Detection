\"Open that soda pop, watch it fizz and pop.\nThe clock is tickin' and we can't stop.\nOpen that soda pop, bop-a shu-bop shu-bop.\nThe clock is tickin' and we can't stop.\"\nâ€• Britney Spears - Soda Pop\n\nDowntown Gilbert has certainly exploded in development these past few years.  One new noteworthy place is Rocket Fizz!  This place is magical.\n\nFrom a wide selection of soda to tin artwork, bundles of unique candies to little knick knacks, there's plenty to buy.  In a recent episode of Bizarre Foods, Andrew Zimmern drank a bottle of ranch dressing flavored soda.  As serendipity would have it, Rocket Fizz also carried the concoction.  We bought a bottle, shared it, and it was a fun highlight to an ordinary Friday.  It tasted like cream soda with ranch dressing.  Not exactly a tasty flavor combination but it's all in good fun.\n\nAnyways, stop by for some soda and candy!  And if you love me, get me a $10 cat bonnet.  Why?  Well, why not?  Meow!
