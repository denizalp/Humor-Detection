Wish I could give it negative stars.  I got such horrible food poisoning after eating here that I had to reschedule my flight which I was charged for, and book an extra night at the hotel because I couldn't leave the room.  Almost $700 later, plus the $100 cost of dinner makes me really regret going here.  My travel insurance won't even cover the airline change fees because I didn't see a doctor while I was there, even though I never would have made it to the hospital.
