Fun place to spend an hour, or so, if you're a pinball fan. They have a good selection of classic and updated games. The newer ones are a bit over priced...but not horribly. During peak times the place is busy, but not crowded or uncomfortable. Give it a try when wanting to get off the strip in Vegas.
