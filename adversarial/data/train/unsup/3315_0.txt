OMG, what a strange place. The decor is beyond bizarre, think LSD acid trip and time traveling. I thought clients would be older, but not senior old. The clients on a Saturday were aged 50+. It was weird watching grandmother's dancing drunk. The staff are super gorgeous... the bartender super hot, shooter girl is super hot, beer girl is super hot, and the pole dancer they hire is super hot. How can the staff be so hot and the clients are all the misfits of Mississauga. So, if you are older than 50, have lots of tattoos, you are Very out of shape, you enjoy smoking cigarettes, you enjoy getting drunk, then come here. For me I am not coming back.
