This is my 3rd great experience at Jackson's. The first was in May when I picked up my daughter's car that had been parked while she was studying abroad  for a semester. It was pretty dirty inside and out so I got it detailed. It looked so amazing afterward I could have sold her 2009 Mazda on the spot. The upholstered seats looked gorgeous and the car was finally rid of the smoke smell from the prior owner. \nA week later I called them in a panic because while I was driving through the Tonto Forrest on a very primitive dirt road I think some of the old gas must have got in the fuel line and it was not driving well.  They don't do repairs but the guys said to bring it in and they would take a look at it. I brought it in the next morning and they put a bottle of something in the gas tank and replaced my windshield wipers. They also checked my oil and said it was fine. Today was my third time and I filled up, got the oil changed and they washed my car for free (w oil change).\nThe car is really clean, smells great and is running like its new! Thank you to both Chris's, Tiny, Dominick and Monica!
