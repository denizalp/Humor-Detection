Had a great time here on a Saturday night. Service was a bit slow but the food was top notch. As it was our first time dining there the manager brought us a complimentary flatbread. It was so good my wife ordered another one. The BBQ chicken pizza was excellent, and was much more than enough for one person.\n\nBut whatever you do- if you go here save room for dessert and get the butter cake (with ice cream!). You won't be disappointed.
