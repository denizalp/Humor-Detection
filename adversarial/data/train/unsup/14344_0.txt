So I show up at the door to meet up with some friends that are already inside, the door man \"T\" some bald European guy, calls me a bitch and tells me I have to wait in the 30 minute plus line. If I could give this place zero stars I would. I'm never coming back and I will be sure to let my highway patrol neighbor know how this place allows under aged children and alcohol into the lounge. Someone needs to fire the guy at the door and hire a level headed professional door man.
