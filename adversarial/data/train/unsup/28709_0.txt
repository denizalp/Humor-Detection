I love this place so much it pains me to only be able to give it 3 stars. The food is always amazing, but the service is so spotty no matter what time of day we come. Tonight's dinner took 3 hours for 2 people to have apps, entree and share a dessert!!! Why does it always take so long for a serve to acknowledge a table once seated? And it usually just spirals from there. This night it was a missing appetizer that I had remind the server about. It finally showed up at the end of the meal. If it wasn't for the awesome pizza and BUFFALO CAULIFLOWER I would never come back. Sometimes a meal is worth sitting thru bad service for.
