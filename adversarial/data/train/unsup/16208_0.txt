Oh Firehaus. I really wish you were better, but with your normally absentminded waitresses and bartenders who on weekend nights are stuck up, how can I, really?  I think that you're tolerable on Mondays, when I can kind of hear myself think, the bartenders are the new ones and not completely jaded, and I can drink cuervo silver margaritas for $3.\n\nBut Firehaus, my experience with you is generally bad.  The lines are ridiculous, the music is overwhelmingly loud, my friend's credit card got closed out to the wrong person, and had someone else's drinks on it... and his last name is not \"Smith\" or \"Jones\" or anything common.  What You did to get on my last nerve?  Once I was there, and a seasoned bartender dipped a glass in the ice bin, and it came up broken.... which means there was glass in the ice bin.  I pointed it out, and so he got another glass... and dipped it back in the same ice bin with glass in it. Gross.  Their food is OK, but overrated. Bah. Firehaus, I will definitely not miss you when I move away.
