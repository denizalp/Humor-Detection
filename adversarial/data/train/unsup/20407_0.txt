I wish I was writing a 5 star review, but I just didnt feel it was at that level anymore.\n\nI had been planning to spend my birthday by the pool and enjoy a very relaxing day. Well, it didnt exactly go as planned.\n\nThe Tropicana holds very special memories for me as it was my very first job as a 'Showgirl\/Dancer' back in 1987 in the famous 'Les Folies Bergere'. So, I had spent many glorious days at the Trop in its most pristine days. And, even when they renovated it back in 2008 to a sexy 'Miami' theme.\n\nIts still got the 'Miami' theme, parking is free, valet is free, pool is free for locals and an extra 25% off food\/drink(for locals). But, the minute I walked into the front of the hotel the glass doors were filthy and the hotel had a very strong presence of cigarette smoke. I found my way through the casino and headed to the pool. The pool is spectacular and always has been. It truly is beautiful and very well maintained.\n\n10:30am not a single chair available by or near the pool. Not happy, so I find a chair in the back next to speaker blasting music so loud I can barely hear my phone ring. Not happy. Chair is hard and the complimentary towels smelled like bleach. Im unable to relax with the music and the people smoking pot and cigarettes near by.\n\nVery sad and disappointed. Only stayed 90 minutes.\n\nBut it sure was a spectacular hotel back in the day!
