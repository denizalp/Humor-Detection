Wow! Drove 50 minutes to give this place a try and I'll drive it again! It was 87 degrees outside and I think it was about 110 inside! We decided to order our food to go and take it to the park- plenty of them in a Lakewood. \n\nThe young woman that took our order was enthusiastic and helpful. She gave us a quick rundown of the menu and gave us suggestions. We ordered two entrees- one with pork and the other with shrimp. Both were very good. My son ordered a Cuban and loved it, along with their fries. Their dad had the fried pork Monfongo and also loved it. It definitely didn't come with a salad like all of the photos show, but it's ok. We ordered plantains which were delicious! \n\nWe had tons of food left over because their portions are huge! Our bill was $48 and included three bottles of the Mexican soda and two cans of soda. Great, great deal if I must say. \n\nWhile we waited outside for our order, another patron said they were expanding to add a bigger eating area. Good news! \n\nWe will return!
