Since I had the Chirashi, I was able to taste each of the fish slices individually. Fish quality was 5 stars - added bonus was the unexpected scallop and Toro tuna pieces that came with at that price range. All the pieces were mouth watering! Rice was excellent. I ordered Uni a la carte, and after asking, was told the Uni was 1-day old - right within the window of freshness for uni. Uni was excellent.\n\nOverall I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of fish and value. I'd recommend ND to anyone looking for a good Chirashi bowl or Sashimi dinner. ND would be one of my top picks for a non-omakase sashimi restaurant. \n\nGood job ND staff! Will visit again.
