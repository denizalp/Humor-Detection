First off let me say this is the best vet facility I've ever seen. Beautiful and very clean. They even took me on a tour after my appt. Service was very helpful and attentive. The head nurse, Rachel, was very nice and informative about BPAH services and healthcare recommendations. \n\nOnce Dr Ensign came in I was so very glad to get a Dr that took his time to get to know the animals and go over treatment and maintenance tips in thorough detail with me. Since it was my first time there he must have spend a good 30 minutes with us, which is unheard of. \n\nThanks BPAH!
