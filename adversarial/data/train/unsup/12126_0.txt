This glowing review is strictly on my amazing Aesthetician named Jackie and her ability to turn a painful, frightful experience into a pleasant one I anticipate every six weeks. Well it's almost pool season and you know what that means.... \n\nLet's talk Brazilian, shall we? Yes, they suck. They are embarrassing, painful, etc. I thought all of those things until someone referred me to Jackie at A Wild Hair. She is a hair removal goddess sent from above. \n\nThe waxing room has a peaceful massage room vibe to it. Aromatherapy going, soft music and lighting sets the mood. Then you get ready for the wax session. For me, the full Brazilian usually takes under thirty minutes in which she uses a combination of hard and soft wax. Jackie is quick, friendly and knows exactly what to say and do to make you feel comfortable about this intimate experience. \n\nI must add that I drive across the city to specifically go to A Wild Hair for Jackie. Every single person I have referred to her continues to make the drive, too. Consider this your golden ticket so go get your damn wax on and off people!!!
