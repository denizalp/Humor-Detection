This place has gone downhill. I came here in 2012 with my friend and we had a great experience. I always thought of this place as somewhere a whole party can go to and find something to eat. Fast forward, the menu has scaled down drastically to one page. The selections are not great and the prices are jacked up. They can KMA for any future visits.
