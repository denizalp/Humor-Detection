I have to say....I am becoming a huge fan of Whataburger.  Sure, its a little bit expensive for \"fast food\", but in the end its worth it.  They cook everything fresh, their burgers are always juicy and huge, their fries are always salted well, they have spicy ketchup!, and I recently found out that they have a secret weapon....its on their breakfast menu.... the Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit.  Wow!  A freshly fried crunchy chicken strip nestled inside a freshly baked buttery, soft biscuit and then they drizzle this thing with their honey butter mixture.  WOW!  Possibly the best breakfast biscuit sandwich out there (Chick Fil-A is good, but this one here is a notch above that) right now!  They are only like $2.29 too, which is not bad at all.  Everyone I have encountered at Whataburger is very friendly too!  I'm glad we have them here in AZ.  CA could sure use one!
