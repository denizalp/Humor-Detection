Car was cleaned.\n\nBut this place still deserved 1 star.\n\nHere's the 3 reasons...\n\n1. I called and said I wanted a certain part of the car cleaned and they quoted me a price. When I got there, the price was increased by $10 and the exact guy I talked to on the phone said he never remembered the phone call from 2 hours before.\n\n2. They said they were going to do a certain type of cleaning. THEY DIDN'T DO IT. I asked them why they didn't do it and only used water and some spray, and the guy said oh we don't offer the service you requested.\n\n3. Then everyone started hiding behind their Spanish language and suddenly didn't speak English and this other employee had to start translating for me. What just happened? I had questions about the situation and suddenly no one knows English.\n\nSo basically, they lied the entire time and faked the whole language barrier thing when I called them out on their deception. I should have just called INS instead and had them all deported.\n\nBASICALLY, their excuse was the \"car is clean...\" \n\nTRANSLATION: \"We misquoted you on the price, offered a service that didn't exist because we don't have that specific equipment, and lied to you the entire time with a smile. But the car is clean! Just not the way you wanted it cleaned.\"\n\nI can relate this to ordering a medium burger and the waitress comes out with a piece of charred burger and says, \"hey you got what you ordered... a burger.\"\n\nYeah just stay away from this place. You can't trust these types of people if you know what I mean.
