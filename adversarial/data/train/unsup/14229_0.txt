Do NOT shop here.  A simple question ends with the sales clerk chasing you and your family into the parking lot screaming at you.\nThis morning my parents, boyfriend and I were shopping local businesses in the Melrose district.  I thought some of the items were a little pricey.  I asked a salesperson, (who may have been the owner) if he would \"take 10 dollars\" for a plaque with a funny saying. He replied in a terse voice \"we don't haggle here.  We are firm but fair\" I said \"it was just a question\" the sales clerk replies \"you got your whole paycheck last week didn't you?  We want our whole paycheck here too\". \n I then say to my parents that I didn't need to be talked to like that and we should we leave.  I said to the clerk \"it was just a question.\"  The clerk than says \"Capital F to you.\" I take this as him saying to \"F*** you\" to me, and say it back.  I leave the store and he then yells at my 63 year old mother (who walks with a cane) \"your daughter needs to be educated\". As she is leaving the store the clerk follows us out to the parking lot shouting at us that \"Capital F means Figs and Home and Garden\".  He also accosts my boyfriend by saying that \"they didn't bargain there and how dare we presume that the place was a flea market.\"\nI have never been chased into a parking lot by a clerk screaming at my family and me.  This man (perhaps the owner) was rude and threatening.  I like to support local businesses, but this man's behavior was appalling.  DO NOT SHOP HERE.
