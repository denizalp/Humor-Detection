I went to get my pedicure and gel manicure done today at Nails Up in Huntersville, NC and had a horrible experience. The nail tech who did my pedicure did a sloppy job. She didn't do a good job with removing nail cuticles and did a sloppy job with  polishing my nails. When I told the owner, she had another tech to correct the sloppy Polish job and didn't even apologize and offer any discounts on my service or ask me what she can do make my experience better. When I complained to the manager about the sloppy pedicure job and requested for an accommodation in the form of a discount on the pedicure service, she had a long pause and said ok and walked away and didn't return. She had another nail tech (the one who corrected the sloppy polish) to act as her spokeperson and she agreed that the polish job was very sloppy.  I explained to her that the managers actions were very dismissive and unacceptable. The nail tech asked what i wanted and i told her that I had already shared what i wanted with the manager and that was a discount on my pedicure services. The nail tech then responds by saying \"well we can't do that because then we would have to do that for everyone who has a bad experience\".  Really?? This is how your treat your customers?? This is badddd customer service.. The manager understood English and  was not willing to make my experience better and had a don't care attitude. Since I wasn't happy with my pedicure, I decided to not proceed with my gel manicure and just paid for pedicure and left. Now I have to find another nail salon to do my gel manicure which is costing me time, gas, and money. I will not recommend this nail salon. Go at your own risk!
