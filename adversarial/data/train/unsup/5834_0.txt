Who knew this place even existed, not I. I thought I had written a review about it a month ago. Sorry to say I did not. But, now here it is.\nI happened to be in Saks 5th Ave. at the Biltmore. It was near the Holidays.\nThe lady there told me about the store that was now around the corner, with the throw away clothes.  I said, what do you mean throw away clothes.\nShe explained it all to me. This is a place where you can go and buy clothes that you can wear a time or two. They they may not be any good any more.\nWhy not? Because, they may not survive being washed.\nIt sounds funny yes, but they are all made in China, from very low end fabric.\nThey are fun and modern, but they may not survive a washing machine for sure.\n\nI did find a lot of fun items here. I bought about $100.00 worth. In that I had bought myself a coat for $23.00,yes that seems really hard to believe but true. The other things I gave away to my nieces and such. I really do not know how they have survived. I was glad to go in here and have a look around , get a few things.\nIf you ever needed a certain item for an event , or a school play. or a part to go with a costume. Then this is your place.\nYou will spend a little and never feel as if you wasted $$$ on something you will never use again. Perfect for all the Teen girls in your life.\nI see they only have female clothing. A lot of it is very small. They did even have some shoes as well though, and some hair items.\nQuite a surprise for the Biltmore to entertain this store, but I think it is a great idea!
