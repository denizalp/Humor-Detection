It wasn't bad, it wasn't great....  What I liked: our waitress was awesome and the manager stopped at our table when we first sat down and introduced himself.  At the end of the meal, we received complimentary shots!  Cool, I liked that.  The mechanical bull was fun to watch.  The food was okay.  I had chicken tacos and the tortillas were a little tough; I ended up having to cut them and eat it with a fork, then I just gave up and ate the filling only.  What I didn't like was it was so noisy!  You could barely hold a conversation.  We were having dinner with friends we hadn't seen in years so there was a lot of catching up to do.  Probably our fault for not choosing better.  If you want a fun place, go!  Have fun.  If you want somewhere that you can have a decent conversation, choose somewhere else.
