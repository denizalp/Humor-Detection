I went in yesterday for an eye brow wax. I just moved to this area and am looking for a new salon close to home. The staff seemed very friendly and the place was really clean looking. Only reason for the 1 star.\nI was not impressed that they do not have a room to do your waxing. Instead they put a bucket\/stool thing in their hair wash basin and do your wax in front of anyone else having services done. I have had to let my brows go for close to a year with minimal waxing\/clean up due to a bad threading incedent... I asked the girl to just clean up the stray hairs and not to take a bunch off. After one of the most painful waxing experiences ever, she brought me a mirror and I was horrified. I look like I have sperm above my eyes. Thick in the middle and pencil thin at the halfway point thru the end of my brow. WTF? It's not like that can be fixed! As she looked at me all proud and asked how they looked, I said 'uh, very thin...' She said 'oh you should have told me not to thin them out so much.' Well sorry, but I thought when I said clean up and not to take a lot off, that you would get the picture since you are a professional waxer. Much to my dismay, I sit at my desk with sperm brows and a surpirsed look on my face at all times. Looks like it's back to letting them grow in and going across town to my last wax lady who was amazing. By the way, this was at 4pm yesterday and my skin around my brows are STILL red and puffy :(
