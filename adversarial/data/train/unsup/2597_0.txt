I dedicate my 100th yelp review to XS!!!\n\nPlease note that I spent the week in Vegas (not weekend)!\n\nTHIS PLACE IS BEAUTIFUL. And I love how the Grandview (time share) had hook ups to this place. Complimentary admission for guys and girls! So if you're staying at a time share (and especially if it's the Grandview... hit up their front desk for hookups! They're free!!) The wait in line was probably 15-20 minutes which wasn't bad. We were in the back of the line too.\n\nEmphasis on beautiful. So many colors, dance floor was big enough, the outside was open but not as open as it would be on the weekends... also beautiful. Anyway around 11 the club was poppin'! As in I actually had room to dance! Sure you have the few bumps from people coming from outside and vice versa to get air, but other than that, just enough space to dance!\n\nDrinks are expensive, yeah. I bought my cousin an adios for $16. After that he made friends with bottle service VIP people while I danced with many guys to get many free drinks. That's how it's done.\n\nOverall, place is beautiful. Yeah, I already said that. Definitely my favorite nightclub in Vegas! I want to go baaaaack!!!
