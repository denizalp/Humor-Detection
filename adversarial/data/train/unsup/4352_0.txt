Often times I've driven down Penn Ave en route to East Liberty and literally have passed this place. It truly is a gold mine for glass lovers and those who are aspiring artists.\n\nDuring my recent visit here I got to learn from the owner that there is an artist in residence and that this artist is planning to open a glass shop over in Lawrenceville.\n\nClasses and workshops are held here plus they host special events. This Friday I learned there will be an event where you and a friend can learn how to create and fire a pumpkin. I had the opportunity to watch a craftsman design a drinking glass and shape in the fire. They have both an upstairs working area as well as downstairs. The shop is located as you enter but there are pieces all around. There is also a very small parking lot next to the building. Free parking however, is available on the side streets.\n\nThe glass furnaces are located upstairs while downstairs they have the flame studio which is another teaching area they use. Here I got to see stained glass redone from salvaged glass. One was made to resemble East Liberty. They had a second one designed to resemble Friendship where this studio is located.\n\nThey have some beautiful works for sale and I was impressed that some of the glass is made out of Pyrex. Special orders can be made and engraving and glass coloring is available as well. I truly was impressed with the glass creations made of the city and Lost Kennywood-part of Pittsburgh's hometown amusement park.\n\nI did not get the opportunity to inquire about pricing for pieces or for classes themselves but it is always worth a treat to watch someone create, burn, and even blow glass.\n\nConveniently located near East Liberty it is a short walk to that neighborhood or back towards Friendship to see what else is in the area.
