This Courtyard has had the lobby and rooms renovated, modernizing a business traveler chain with vibrant colors and clean, modern lines.  24hr fitness center and indoor pool.  Located near campus but also close to local businesses, the mall and a bunch of restaurants.\n\nYeah, it's located by the highway... but... uhm that's where hotels are usually located.  I'm in a room that faces the highway right now, and I can barely hear the traffic.  No biggie.\n\nMy one beef with the renovated Courtyards is that breakfast is no longer included in the price of the room.  While I'm not a huge breakfast eater, especially when I'm on the road, I can't help but hum 'Don't Know What You Got' every morning I walk out the door to my rental car.
