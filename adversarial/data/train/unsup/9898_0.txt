I would give it a solid 3.5 if i could so I had to opt for a 4\/5. We were a group of 4 seated in the solarium style room at the front of the restaurant, so we were isolated from the \"garden\" part. This sort of bummed me out as I didn't get to experience the lush greenery of the resto. We ordered the Baby What's Your Name 48oz pitcher to share, which was good but nothing special. On to the food, we ordered everything to share. We tried: oysters, fried tofu, tuna tataki, beef tataki, shrimp tacos, maple salmon sashimi, the Kampai Garden Salad (which is basically a large, awkward to serve and eat deconstructed salad...) It came out to around $45 each. I was told that this place was dressy but it's not really... most people were casual. The downside is how hungry we were after we left lol ....... let's just say it's a good thing there are so many fast food options Downtown ;)
