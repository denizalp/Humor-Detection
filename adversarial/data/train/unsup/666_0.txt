Worth the $20 (or less with coupons) for the experience of the glass floor alone.  And if you're in North Vancouver BC, for $10 more you can have a better experience while you and lots of kids are jumping up and down on the Capilano Suspension Bridge!  That structure really moves, while the glass floor more than holds its own.\n\nThe panoramic view is also a big plus and for some reason I haven't been cursed with the long waits.  I have also done the \"lie on the ground\" photo which turns out great.  And after one time, there really is not need to go back.  And considering all the stuff Toronto has to offer, why would you?
