Tina's is now offering The Buffet Menu seven days a week for $9.99 each.  I ordered from the express lunch menu however. My meal was $7.99 for a bowl of bangus sinagang, two chicken on a stick (bbq) and beefsteak. It came with a small shredded cabbage salad with thousand island dressing. The chicken was cooked well with a sweet flavor. The beefsteak was great! It was tender, moist and not too salty. I almost forgot to mention the steamed rice. It came out perfect. They have free Wi - Fi and ample parking is off street and free. All around it was a good meal with attentive service. The soup could have had some chunks of fish added to my bowl, this was the only thing that I could find to mention negatively.
