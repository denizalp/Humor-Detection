*** TABLEAU IS LOCATED AT THE WYNN IN THE MOST UNSPOTTABLE PLACE NEAR THE ELEVATORS *** \n\nI came to Tableau for a brunch with my friend, knowing how beautiful the dining area was, with top service and amazing food. \n\nTHE STAFF -\n\nKnowing the Wynn is one of the most popular Hotels in Las Vegas, with the extensive reputable five star service, I just had to come here thinking the restaurant would be no different.  I think the security guards that helped me and my friend actually find this restaurant were more accommodating than the staff that worked here.  Although we did make reservations, we still had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, even though half the dining room was empty.\n\nTHE FOOD -\n\nI ordered Tableau's parfait for starters but I said no peanuts because I'm highly allergic to peanuts; what do you know? There's a cashew in my parfait! Last time I checked, a cashew was a peanut. I didn't send it back because my friend wanted to eat it, but there is a lack in communication that I do not tolerate. \n\nMy entree, I ordered the Tableau Breakfast, since nothing else was very appetizing to me on their menu. I asked for eggs over medium and my eggs were runnier than the Nile River, it was like soup and I just couldn't eat it. Big let down.  The Pastry basket that came with my meal was pretty cool, but it lacked anything I liked.\n\nI think I only enjoyed the tea I had, which came in a cute little pyramid package! Very delicious tea!\n\nA side note: You have to be dressed well to be seated; meaning, shirts are mandatory and you can't wear a swim suit without a cover-up.
