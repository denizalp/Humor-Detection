Press, hope you don't switch from awesome urban cookie \/ Ollie cakes to really not good Caketini.  Oops, too late.  You already did.\n\nAt least you have those comfy leather chairs to hang out and chat.  Oops, you removed all of those and packed the place with really uncomfortable wooden ones instead.\n\nThank goodness your baristas are all really nice helpful folks.  Oops, those folks left and were replaced with hipster kids that seem slightly annoyed to be waiting on you.
