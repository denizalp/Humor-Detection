Kabuto has wonderful age tofu. I've been her numerous times with my boyfriend. We are still new to the area and last week when we ate at Kabuto's, we noticed that our car was running out of gas. The owner gave us directions and told us to call the restaurant if we ran out of gas before we got to the gas station and that he would help us. That is wonderful customer service.
