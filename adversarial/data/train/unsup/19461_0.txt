Note #1: CASH ONLY. An ATM can be found inside. \n\nNote: #2: This used to be Pip's Diner and changed hands in 2010. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/pips-diner-pittsburgh?hrid=BIFCI4_ttRi7QaPe_1Ahpw#src:self\n\nJohnny's is as close to the archetypal American diner as you'll get in Pittsburgh. It's claustrophobic, only breakfast and lunch are served, a long counter acts as a centerpiece, lottery tickets are sold, and flanneled, burly, unshaven men are its primary customers. \n\nThe bill of fare is simple and mostly consists of eggs, home fries, omelets, french toast, burgers, and other sandwiches. One can't get Eggs Benedict or have Simosas with brunch here.  Hell, you might receive cross-eyed looks for even mentioning the word \"brunch\" to your server. \n\nTherein lies Johnny's appeal. \n\nJohnny's Steak, Egg, & Cheese Breakfast Sandwich can be had on white bread or a bagel, and contains meat that is as dainty, succulent, saliferous, and flavorsome as the best corned beef. Nothing about this steak conjured images of old shoes being pulled out of boiling pots of water. The lettuce and tomato were garden fresh, the white bread was cottony yet sturdy, and the bright yellow American Cheese deliquesced onto the meat elegantly, no doubt while underneath a cover on the flattop grill. \n\nAlso devoured were a trio of paradisiacal pancakes that were fluffier than a Maine Coon Cat and as golden as the dawn. Butter and syrup were close to superfluous; the sign of transcendent flapjacks. \n\nKay's Raisin Bread French Toast was a touch overdone as was her strip of bacon. Redemption came in her grits, which just needed some butter, sugar, and salt to become the slice of Southern, maize-derived heaven that they were. \n\nDon't allow the rough, trailer park exterior and rusty, underpass locale discourage you from making a stop at Johnny's.
