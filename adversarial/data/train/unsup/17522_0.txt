I came here today and ordered spring rolls, they were really good. Small, but super fresh and good. I wish they added sprouts and cilantro, charged a buck more and made them larger (starving as I write this). My first time prior to this venture here I ordered a ton of stuff, not just spring rolls. The eggrolls here are excellent. They refer to their eggrolls as spring rolls and spring rolls as their summer rolls so use caution when ordering so you are not let down or pissed off. I know Thai restaurants use the summer roll reference term but this is not a Thai restaurant. Asian mix for sure though. They have a great lunch special that is mainly Chinese food and at $5.95 for a solid meal, you can't beat it. The establishment is really clean and modern, definitely could dine in here. The customer service is excellent. Thank you for the quick lunch fix and great service :)
