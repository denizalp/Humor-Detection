5 stars for the soups\n3 stars for the sandwiches \n\nWhenever I eat here, the lobster bisque and the wild mushroom bisque are a must. The consistency of both soups are always perfect - thick, very luscious and creamy. They are also slightly sweet, richly decadent, packed with quality ingredients and incredible flavor.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm not too crazy about their sandwiches. I haven't found a sandwich that that blew away my tastebuds yet. Their sandwich options are unique, but they are also lacking the body of flavor and substance that would typically impress me - they are all so dry and bland.\n\nSOUPS:\n- Lobster Bisque - I am seriously addicted to this soup! Plus, I love the generous chunks of vegetables swimming in the soup, it makes for a satisfying and comforting meal in itself. 5\/5\n- Wild mushroom bisque - This is another winning soup. The wild mushroom flavor is extremely complex and savory. You can really taste the earthiness and nuttiness of the wild mushrooms in every sip. 5\/5\n- Tomato bisque - Slightly tart, slightly sweet and very comforting. This is a great choice with grilled cheese. 4\/5\n\nSANDWICHES: \n- Honey Cilantro Carnitas - the pulled pork was moist, but it is also pretty bland and not seasoned properly. Also, the honey cilantro glaze sounds amazing, but it didn't have a pleasant taste to it - it tasted like processed ingredients and chemicals (even though they advertised it to be \"house-made\") The sandwich filling: cabbage, non-existent pickled red onion and bread were also very dry and not memorable. 3\/5\n- BBQ Pulled Pork - they used the same pulled pork as in the carnitas sandwich above - so the meat was moist, but bland. I also wasn't a fan of the BBQ sauce that they used. The sauce didn't have any bold, sweet, or tangy flavor - it was too basic and generic. The overall filling and flavor was very dry and boring. 2\/5\n- Pesto Chicken Panini - the pesto flavor was extremely weak and the chicken was very plain. The overall panini was dry and bland. 2\/5\n- Crab Avocado Melt Panini - my boyfriend enjoyed this one the most. The crab flavor isn't strong, possibly because they used imitation crab? But the avocado made the sandwich creamy and the bacon added a necessary saltiness. 3\/5\n\nThis is a dependable lunch spot and I hope I find a sandwich I'm crazy about soon. I love that they stand out in a crowd of sandwich shops by giving away complimentary chocolate covered strawberries! A sweet treat is always appreciated at lunch.
