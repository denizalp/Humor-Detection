I had high expectations for this diner, but unfortunately, I was highly disappointed with my meal. I ordered the Vegetarian Hash, which is actually vegan. It came with tofu scramble and a tempeh-laden potato hash. I was very excited to try this as the description sounded amazing and it looked SO good in the pictures. There was no flavor! How on earth do you mess up potatoes, onions, and tempeh! Those flavors just naturally compliment each other. Not here. And my hash had mushrooms in it, despite there being no mention of mushrooms on the menu's description. I hate mushrooms! The tofu was also flavorless.  To add insult to injury, they piled 4 slices of dry ass toast atop this dish. Like, why? \n\nThe only good thing about this visit was the vegan milkshake. My shake consisted of vegan chocolate chip ice cream, chocolate sauce, and a cherry on top. They didn't have vegan whip cream but I didn't really miss it. The shake was thick, rich, and delicious. They also give you a lot for the money. That shake was worth an extra star all by itself.\n\nI would come in just for one of their delicious vegan milkshakes, but that's about it.
