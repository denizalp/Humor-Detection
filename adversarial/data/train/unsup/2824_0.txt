If you are thinking of adding some beauty in your yard, Little Baja is definitely the only the place that you want to shop. I recently purchased a gorgeous fountain and several pots for my yard and I could not be happier. Every one on the staff was so helpful and patient about helping me make the right decision for my home. The service was fantastic! Thank you Little Baja for helping me turn my yard into something special. \n\nTyra N.
