Took my phone iPhone 6 Plus in last week to get the screen repaired. Called around beforehand and their price was very reasonable and the reviews were great. Had a few kinks come up so the phone took longer to repair than normal but Grant made it up by throwing in a screen protector. Their customer service was fantastic. If I ever need another repair, I'll definitely be back.
