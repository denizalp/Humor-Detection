Came here after a while...menu change so which is ok.. I orders a drink never had before when it came way way after I ordered it..\n I saw the bartender attend to several people before making my drink...food was ordered the waitress seemed moody which after seeing the place I kinda understand but still service with a smile how Lolo's always been..\n\nFood...meh..now the wow it used to be...i been here to the Gilbert location and it is always hit and miss..today was a meh....the greens were not as good as before chicken seemed soggy...\n\nWait my drink finally came...wow horrible... to much bitters destroyed what could have been a great drink....\n\nTop it off the place was a pig pen no one seemed happy.. I will continue to go to the main place and really begun to miss the old little house where i knew the waitresses and they greeted me with a smile and apologized if slightly messy slow service and so on...\n\nNo happy..Gilbert has lost my service....
