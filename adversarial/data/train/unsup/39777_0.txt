We went here based upon the recommendation of my son. We were looking for booties for both our dogs; upon entering the store we were greeted by the most pleasant young lady named Jasmine. She not only showed us what they had, explained the differences and even tried them on my dogs to make sure they fit. This saved us from making any mistakes purchasing the wrong size. She then took the time to help my husband fit a harness for his little dog. Prices are a little high but the service makes up for it. And Jasmine should be commended for her customer service. Definitely will come back
