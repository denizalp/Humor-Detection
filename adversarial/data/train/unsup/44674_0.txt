One of the best places to go for authentic Chinese food in Montreal in my opinion! Affordable prices, quick service, and consistent food! Everything is very tasty and I keep coming back for more...PM is where I go when I need comfort food. \nTheir Japanese tofu with eggplant is one of my favourites, along with Buddha's feast!
