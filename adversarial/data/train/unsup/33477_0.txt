First of all, customer service is very tacky. Two years ago they fix my refrigerator and which they did a terrible job, drill a hole on the back of the fridge I have no idea why: charge me $100 dollars for freon+ $65 for visit and fridge still not cooling enough. Secondly, again refrigerator isn't working right: call again costumer service so wicked I bought insurance is not like I have to supplicate dang this people awful and disgraceful. They send a technician he came add freon seal a tube on compressor saying is going to make ice and work just fine. Today I wake up all my food ruin gone bad. Call again; they don't have a loner fridge neither cover the lost of all my food. Technician comes again he saids compressor broke over night because air went inside the pipes since it was a leak. Now I don't have a fridge and no food. This company does not have a compressor in stock they have to order it. Day third they haven't call I guess I have to call them back that's just great. Making a complain with the BBB today unacceptable. In conclusion, National Home Warranty is a horrible company please don't waste your time and money not worth an effort.
