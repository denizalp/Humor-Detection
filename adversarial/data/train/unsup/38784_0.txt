Went here for dinner today. The atmosphere in the restaurant is great the staff very friendly and the food was amazing. I had the Shepherds Pie  and it was by far the best I've ever tasted and a friend of mind had the Salmon and he really enjoyed it as well. Prices are very good for the quality and amount of food you get and great selection of beer. I would recommend this place to anyone if your in the area give it a try you will not be disappointed!
