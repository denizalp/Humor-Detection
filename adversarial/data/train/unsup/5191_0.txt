While out seeing downtown and all the change and progress that has gone into this little stretch on Main Street here I thought that we would go and check out the antique stores. This antique store is one of the best down here that I have been to. There space is huge and decorated so well. The way the light comes in the front windows just illuminated there store so well. The store is a celebration of all things old that can be new again. \n\nAs one walks through the store they are divided into little areas that are leased by individual buyers. It is such a great business model that allows a whole bunch of individual sellers to showcase their wares. I was impressed at this store since when browsing and one finds something they must have, you want to know the price first off. Everything in this store is behind glass too and the protection of their valuables. One usually thinks the glass means it is an impossible amount, but not here. They post their prices on top or visible so that the tag can be seen clearly. That way one knows how much the item costs. This is a wonderful store that sells some really inexpensive items. If you are searching for something look no further than here, also one could find new treasure that you need too!
