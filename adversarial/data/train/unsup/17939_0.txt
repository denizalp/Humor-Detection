02\/07\/12\n\nMet up w\/ Violeta for happy hour today, and what a nice change in atmosphere from former Cafe Carumba's!  I really liked the all-glass wine closet display behind the host's desk- what a nice touch!  Cool indoor atmosphere\/vibe, as well.  I wouldn't mind spending more happy hours here in the future.\n\nI was hungry and thirsty, so I ordered two apps, the short rib sliders and roasted butternut squash ravioli w\/ brown butter sage sauce, and a glass of their white wine blend, which had a bit of moscato in it.  Everything was very good!  I'd order all three again, most definitely.  Especially the ravioli and the glass of white blend.  :D\n\nHmm... I'm thinking another happy hour here is going on my calendar soon!
