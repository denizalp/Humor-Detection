I Always have a great experience at kelly's definitely one of my favorite spots in pittsburgh. I have been going there for many years now and have enjoyed many of their servers\/bartenders. My friends and I really like the server with the blue\/ purple streaks in her hair. She always remembers our choice of beverage and almost gets them for us before we even have to ask, wicked nice and personal. We really love that about a bar and she makes us want to hang out there more than once a week which we usually do.
