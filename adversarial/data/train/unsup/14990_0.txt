Don't know...... either inconsistent ......Or are some dishes are better than others??????......Maybe it depends on who's cooking???????\n\nI'm happy that on my way in I saw a grade \"A\" health inspection and I am also very happy the spicy basil dishes we had last time were very good.\n\nWe thought we'd try some different things this time.\n\nWe started with Potstickers. They came out fried and the filling wasn't very flavorful but what I didn't care for most was the texture of the filling. It was solid and creamy like an omelet. I thought that was weird.\n\nI had the spicy lemon salad. Now that was pretty good! I liked the flavors and the chicken was good too. The only thing not right about the salad was the pineapple chunks. I couldn't identify  was they did to the pineapple. Canned pineapple would have been better.\n\nMy husband had the dan dan noodles. Beef chewy and sauce was not the best. Not balanced and very smokey.\n\nMy last visit was very good...\n\nEither inconsistent\n\nMaybe some dishes better than others\n\nPerhaps it depends on the chef that's on?\n\nDon't know
