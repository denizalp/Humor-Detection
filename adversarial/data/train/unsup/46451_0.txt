I visit orange pearl pretty much every day. i've tried to limit my visits after getting my card statement...i saw charges each day labeled orange pearl--i am totally hooked on their yogurt and the level of service from their employee.\n\nit's a great feeling that they know who their repeat customers are. I visit the location at 6300 W Charleston Blvd and as soon as i walk in they type in my order and get to work preparing it--it's always delivered with a smile .\n\nthe decor is amazing, bright, cheerful with good tunes playing in the background. don't pass this place up!\n\nso far i've redeemed 3 loyalty cards from orange pearl and have almost completed by 4th.
