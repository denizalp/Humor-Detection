My new go to place for noodles in Vegas. Not just because its my namesake but because the food is delicious. The hand cut noodles are thick and chewy. Perfect! \nMy meal on this visit was the Shang beef noodle with the knife cut noodles. The broth was rich and full of beef flavor. The beef was very tender and tasty. Although it was a deep beef flavor, the broth was not overwhelmed with fat. \nI definitely will be back to try the other options on the menu.
