This place, just like the area, is mediocre. \n\nHere's how my day began and how I ended up here: I had to take my car for a routine oil change down the street and they have shuttle service so I decided what better way to kill some time and take care of myself than by getting a nail fill by the best reviewed nail shop that is semi close by.\n\nLocation: I ended up getting stuck here waiting for my shuttle service and it was kinda scary. Would not recommend walking around in this area. Some of the stores in this complex were vacant, plus there were some homeless people sprawled around.\n\nCustomer service: I called in advance to see if they could take me if I was walked in at 10:30am. The lady on the phone sounded really nice and eager. When I got in, the lady that took me was short  (in time, not height) and not as nice. I would try to start a conversation a couple times but most of them ended after a word response. There was an older lady at the end of the row, she seemed tired but kind. She might've been the one I spoke to on the phone. I wish she did my nails... she was funny to the customer that she took care of.\n\n\nNails: I got a nail fill for the first time in my life and asked for her to redo it as a coffin shape. It was terrible. I usually don't like having to tell the nail lady to fix something but it was crooked and then she filed even more and made it more crooked. My thumb nails weren't symmetrical or the same size when you put them side by side, you should still see the crack from where my nails grew after she filled em. At the end, she asked me if it looked good and I politely said yes because I gave up after I tried to tell her to fix it. I didn't want to be that anal customer but I am going to yelp honestly about it.\n\nI am giving two stars because I don't want to be mean but I would not recommend to anyone and do not plan on going back.
