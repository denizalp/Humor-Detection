Tower City shame on you.  This used to be the place to go. I can remember the crowds and what a big deal it was to go.  Now it is filled with ghetto urban flare and bums. They no longer hang the awesome moving Christmas decorations like they used to. During the 90's they had stores like Gucci, Coach, and Burberry. Now they have Urban Wear, Quick Stop Lottery, and 10 places to get custom cartoon character air brushed t-shirts.
