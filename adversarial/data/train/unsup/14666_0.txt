I had a great time at my first visit to this classy cocktail bar.  It starts with the menu, which is like a short novel.  Don't be overwhelmed: the bartenders and waitresses are happy to guide you to the perfect concoction and if in doubt, there's a map in the back of the book...er, menu.  I liked the menu, it was a lot of fun to peruse.\n\nThe drinks are expertly made with fresh ingredients, most of which they make themselves on the days they're closed.  If you want something off the menu, they're happy to create something just for you.\n\nI can't remember the names of drinks at the moment, but mine had tequila and coconut, which was good.  The fruity\/creamy drink Amy got was even better.  \n\nPrices are high, but the drinks are excellent.  This is a \"hang out and enjoy a couple drinks with friends\" kind of place, not a \"get wasted and forget all your woes\" kind of place.  \n\nThey highlight bad Yelp reviews.  I think that's funny.\n\nThe bill is kept on a tablet, and credit cards processed the same way! It saves time and paper (probably) but let's be honest, it's just cool.
