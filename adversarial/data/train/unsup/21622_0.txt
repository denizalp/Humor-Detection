Holy sh$#... It's been awhile since I've seen this and I've heard they've made changes, but I can't imagine it's enough. Without exaggeration people (more than a few) got up and left and fairly early. I paid my $$ so I stayed til the end. (bad call!)\nFor Criss Angel fans (the few remaining out there). This isn't Mindfreak. It's VERY elementary stage magic. You can see similar at theme parks and carnivals. \nFor Cirque fans. Keep walking... The acrobatics are minimal. This is the only Cirque show I've seen with ZERO \"WOW!\" moments.\n\nThe Good: I'm reaching here, but the costuming and choreography are good. Wade Robeson knows how to choreograph to the haunting, dark look. (although I've heard this part of what's changed)\nThe Bad: Again, the magic. I expected way, way more based on Mindfreak. Unfortunately, this makes me think his show is TOTALLY fake. Like, nothing but actors and special effects fake, but who knows. \nThe Ugly: Criss Angel himself. For the centerpiece of the show and it's \"host\", he comes off as wildly arrogant. He expects you to adore him and assumes the audience finds him charming, attractive, and mysterious. He actually comes off as awkward, douchy, & frustrated that we don't explode in rapturous cheers.  \n\nHow is this show still running?! Avoid at all costs. Not worth free tickets.
