Chain\/franchise restaurants - I automatically expect each one to live up to their name as much as their name has a good or bad reputation.  Baton Rouge has always been a place with decent food and a good atmosphere.  The first one I ever went to was in Boucherville, QC years ago.  Since then they've been in Toronto for quite some time and even though I don't go too often to this place it is a nice treat when I do.\n\nOf course when I come here I'm usually getting a steak since it's on that level or they try to be on that level with the most comparable restaurant (the Keg) and they come close but I have to still give it to the Keg over both Baton Rouge because of the level of service.  \n\nMy last visit to Baton Rouge while it was a group of over 20 I still felt like I had to chase down servers to get drinks.  At one point I had to stand up and flag one of them.  I couldn't really move from where I was sitting because I was up against a wall and we were cramped and it would have been hard to do so.\n\nBesides the level of service not being up to the same standards as the Keg, I can say the food while good, just doesn't have the same flare to it.  It's hard to describe... little things like the salads at the Keg are served cold... not frozen but cold.  To me it seems like the servers are just more experienced at the Keg.  \n\nI keep comparing BR to the Keg I know but it's because they are so alike.  I had ordered the rib steak and it was very good.  They don't ask you to cut into it and say whether or not it was cooked to my satisfaction and it's just those little things that separate BR from something that could be considered a different level of service.\n\nTo reiterate, I shouldn't have to ask for drinks... it should be the other way around.  Besides that the quality of Baton Rouge overall is decent and the service I would think is a more based on how each place is managed.  This one in Woodbridge could use a little refining IMO.
