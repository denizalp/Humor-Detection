I work nearby and get sick of fast food for lunch so I go here a couple of times a month at least.  I am starting to wonder why.  At least 50% of the time they mess up my order.  The service is hit and miss.  Today I ordered soup and a grilled cheese to go.  When I got back to work and opened up the bowl of soup it was less than half full of soup!  I had to go back and got a half hearted \"sorry.\"  There was no offer to comp it or give me a free drink or anything.  By the time I got back to work my lunch break was up.
