Yuuuuck. I never expect much when I go to iHop or Denny's, but this place was terrible! If you're going to pay almost $30 for a diner breakfast, you'd at least expect decent food and service! \n\nOur server's name was Mary and the host raved about her at every opportunity he got, which just came across as creepy and annoying after the third comment was made. There were crumbs all over the table, and everything just felt so sticky! \n\nI had some waffle plate and my husband got some type of omelette. Everything was cold and Mary finally decided to give me a refill and ask us how our food was 10 minutes after we were done eating - it sucked, Mary! \n\nDo yourself and any other folks you plan on taking out for breakfast a favor and splurge a little bit by spending an extra few bucks a couple of streets down in old town where you'll get tasty food and decent service.
