In the middle of korean owned and korean ran family restaurants, is Barrio Coreano. A Mexican\/Korean fusion restaurant that gushes casual dining as soon as you walk in and up the stairs. The playful, energetic atmosphere is accentuated by the neon signs, vibrant music, and combination of dim lit and bright seating spaces. I felt like I was walking into an alley party, decked with brick walls on either side and complete with the long\/narrow overall layout of the restaurant.\n\nThe long layout makes for seating to be a bit crammed. My table was separated by a two inch gap between neighboring tables and I felt a consistent breeze from the waiters\/waitresses walking by closely in the tight quarters. I wasn't bothered though. I enjoyed the intimate environment, offset by the high energy kitchen which was perfectly viewable from the back and the lively conversations happening from the tables around us. \n\nThe menus are on chalkboards hung on the side walls. Items were divided in 4 categories (apps, entrees, tacos, desserts) but the server comes around and literally explains the menu to you in full. A bit more in-depth than necessary but much better than a lack of service in comparison.\n\nApps range from 7-$14, entrees $20-$36, tacos $5 and desserts $6-$9. All on the pricier side of casual food which is probably the only thing I disliked about Barrio. \n\nI ordered the scallops with jicama and watermelon salad app (good, but not interesting enough and not quite worth $14). The beef short ribs, which were extremely tender, tossed in a spicy and sweet Korean sauce. Octopus taco (very tender but not flavorful), Kapungki Chicken taco (one of the best dishes I had here) and Chihuahua cheese with tofu pico taco (Fried cheese with the trimmings, don't let the tofu throw you off it's minor).\n\nThe prices are on the higher side for what it is, portions are a bit small which isn't justified by what you pay while the flavors you experience aren't out of this world or super exclusive either. Overall I had a fun time at Barrio Coreano. The atmosphere is unique and lively, great for a casual date. The food is done well and tasty, the service is extra attentive and welcoming, and the concept is well executed throughout.
