My husband and I love this place... especially since it is right up the road from us!  I always go for the Grilled Chicken Taco combo plate and my husband loves the steak burrito that is ginormous!  They give my 15 mth old a free cheese quesedilla too!  You ahve your choice of pinto or black beans with your combo plates and they serve Horchata :) YUMMY!!  A little spendier than most Mexican places but worth every penny!!
