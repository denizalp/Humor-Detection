Stayed here again recently and it looks like they got some of the kinks out of the system.  I learned from my previous endeavor here, so I ended up self parking at a public garage and not getting gouged by the valet price this time around.  Also this time around they seem to have the wifi working better, the signal never dropped for me which made it easier to get things done before I left out of my room.\n\nMy view was less than stellar this time around, but it was still pleasing.  This time I had a view of the city, which, come on, is one hell of a city to begin with.  The room was perfect this time around.  Everything that was suppose to be in there, you can read that as I had a chair for the desk this time around, was accounted for.\n\nThe only reason I cannot give five stars this time around was because of the bathroom.  I like the concept I had in mine where there is no shower curtain.  Instead they have a partial glass wall.  It looked beautiful, but water still managed to get everywhere, even when I adjusted the showerhead to point away from the opening.  Plus the stall needed more a slant for drainage.  It drained fine, but water built up at the back of the stall making me worry that it wouldn't drain properly in enough time for me to finish my shower.\n\nCheck out is simple, leave your key in the room and head on out once you are ready to go.
