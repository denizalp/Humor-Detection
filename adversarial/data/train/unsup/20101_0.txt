I went here for my birthday, I called to make reservation, they said we don't talk reservations.... got there they said I shoulda called n made reservation.... party of 8 waited HOUR N HALF then gave us different booths!!! And our waiter said we couldn't b on same check cuz the other table wasn't in his section, I WAS charged for my birthday ice cream!! It was HORRIBLE!!  DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!! RUINED MY 30TH BIRTHDAY!! Food ok, staff so bad I will tell everyone I know to go to bell location!!
