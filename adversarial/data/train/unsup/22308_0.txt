Everything I had was absolutely spectacular. From my eggs benedict special with hatch chiles and potato cakes to the veggie curry to the chicken and waffles with oranges, I was such a fan.\n\nI will say that my special was kind of ridiculously priced for the amount of food I got. It was delicious but I did not think two teeny little eggie benedicts needed to be $16.\n\nThe service was great, especially considering the LOUDMOUTHS at our table :) :) \n\nI would definitely recommend the brunch, but you do have to get there early because there is a straight up Disneyland line to get in to the brunch. \n\nMimosas are ordinarily the tits, but since I was going to yoga and then work, I abstained. Definitely get the all-you-can-drink as it's a way better deal.
