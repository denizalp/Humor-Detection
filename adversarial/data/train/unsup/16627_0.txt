I am beyond upset with this location, my daughter went in with my 2 year old grandson and ordered herself a sandwich and my grandson a ice cream cone. For some reason her card strip would not read and they would not manually input her card number stating that in the past it would not charge the card and the company loosed out on money. My grandson just pointed to the staff and said ice cream. They would not even give him a tiny sample cone just to make him happy. I am not expecting anything free but not to run her card manually or even give him a sample cone is beyond my comprehension. I called and the shift leader stated, I am sorry I couldn't give him a cone as that would be theft and I would loose my job. Corporate should have enough faith in their management team to be able to make a exception in these kind of cases. I was not asking for a huge banana split by any means, but come on now, a sample cone for a 2 year old. I am going to crawl up the corporate chain as this is so wrong for such a HUGE company to make this policy of not handing out a sample baby cone if this type of situation happens.
