Pro: it's close to home.  (Unfortunately that's the only thing)\nCons: customer service is poor to say the least. \n1) went in to get the new E40 beer but couldn't find to so I asked the cashier.  He told me they probably won't carry it because it \"attracts the wrong kind of people\". I was floored! \n2) Sunday, I wanted to get some wine.  I saw they had Earl Stevens Selections Function Red  but I was hoping to get the new Tropiscato or sweet red. Since i couldn't find it I asked at the counter \"do you have Earl Stevens Selections Wine?\".  The cashier may have been new (which is fine ) so they asked another employee that was sitting off to the side of the register.  She quickly said,  \"we don't carry that because our store is too small.\" If that were true,  I wouldn't have a problem with the answer,  however you DO carry it because you have the Function Red! I felt like she was just trying to get rid of me. \nSadly, that wasn't the first time I asked for something in that store and was told they didn't have it and I  found it myself on a shelf.  \nLooks like I  will have to drive out of my way to another Lee's or find a store  somewhere else.
