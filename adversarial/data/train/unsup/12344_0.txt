As I stated in my previous review, and as a couple other reviewers mentioned as well, their customer service or lack of it was a problem.  That review was 2015 and I can say I really had not been in the store since then, but because I do shop online occasionally I can only assume that's why I received a $20 GC.  Not sure what to expect I decided to visit the store to use it.  Now, I love to find a deal so I went straight to the sales' section, which I do still think this store has a good selection of.  There were two sales' associates working and I was greeted and offered assistance the entire time.  After trying on a few items unfortunately only one item worked.  During check out even with my one sale item and using a GC I still feel like the salesperson treated me like I made a $500 purchase and to top it off I received a thank you card a couple days later in the mail.  I would include her name but I couldn't decipher her writing.   Due to this recent experience I won't limit my bargain hunting to online only now and will visit the store again soon and hopefully my experience will be just as pleasant.
