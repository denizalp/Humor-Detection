The staff was awesome but I'm not going to say too much about the food because I'm not too familiar with Ramen. The food wasn't bad but I thought the pork belly portion in the Miso bowl could have been a little bigger. I also got the Rice Crispy Squares; they were good, I probably would order them again if I happened to be there again but I probably won't crave them ever. I paid $27 for the Ramen bowl, Rice Crispy Squares, and a water. In my opinion I think the price was kind of high being that the Pork Belly portion was kind of stingy. Like I said I'm not a Ramen expert but I think I've had better Ramen elsewhere.
