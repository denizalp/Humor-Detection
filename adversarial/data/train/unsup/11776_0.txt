Dr. Avila responded to my post saying that she takes pride in the work she does and that she only makes recommendations on what a patient should consider having done.  Dr. Avila, you advertise yourself as a dermatologist with years of experience your patients come in to your office trusting you and your recommendations.  Based upon my experience as well as other yelpers your recommendations are not only incompetent but dangerous.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  I am confident that your unethical practices will catch the attention of medical boards. I hope that your license is rightfully revoked.
