Amore Pizza & Wings is a decent lunch spot. Their $5 dollar specials are a welcome relief from the $10 -$12 dollar lunches that are so rampant in the North Scottsdale area.\n\nTheir Italian sausage comes with some thinly sliced green peppers in a sausage roll. I would suggest that you tell them to add the red sauce that they use for their meatball sandwich instead of the au jus that they give you. I think their meatball sandwiches are excellent. \n\nAlthough I have had mixed results with the Chicken Parmasean Sandwich. Last time I had it in late December it just didn't taste good, like it had freezer burn. The few times that I have had it before that incident in December it was very tasty. That's why I'm giving Amore 3 stars instead of 4 stars.
