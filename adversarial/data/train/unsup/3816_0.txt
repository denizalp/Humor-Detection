This is by far the WORST business I have ever stepped foot in. Not only is it in a Horrible area but the employees are the rudest, most arrogant people. I called ahead to see if they had a product & was told by 2 different employees (in the same day) that they had one left. Since we live an hour away I called ahead to have them hold it & was assured there was in fact One left in stock & they would hold it til the end of the day. After driving an hour through never ending construction we finally made it to this disgusting place only to find out they didn't have the part. We were told \"money talks\" & even though we put it on hold they sold it to someone who offered the money first. Horrible Business. Horrible Customer Service. This place is trash & is definitely not the place to bring your wife & kids. If it IS absolutely necessary for you to go to this awful store I recommend having your concealed carry.
