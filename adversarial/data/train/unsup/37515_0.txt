I wandered into Durumi & Chocolate Shoes one day after staring at the dress in their window for some time. While I only had 10-15 minutes to browse, I found myself never wanting to leave! \n\nThis store is full of unique pieces of clothing, shoes, handbags, and tons of accessories. The prices are reasonable (front window dress was $95), with shoes around $60-$100 and accessories varying in price. \n\nIt really is the kind of store you can get lost in - even though it isn't that big. There is just so much to see, touch, and try on - especially in the shoe section! So many cute pairs that I have to go back and buy.\n\nMy one downside of the store was that a lot of cute items had real fur on them - wish they would go faux! \n\nI want to meet and be friends with the buyer for this store. Seriously worth a browse.
