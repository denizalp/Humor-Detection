Ohhhhhhhhhhhh, Wal-Mart. How I detest shopping at you. HOWEVER, same as most poor Americans, I cannot and will not stop shopping at you. Mainly because I refuse to spend a few extra bucks at another store for the same exact sh*t.\n\nAnyway..... Yes, this Wal-Mart is decent. I went to one in the NE area, and needless to say, it was very scary. Because this one is in Henderson, it's pretty safe and there aren't any people outside begging you for money, or asking you to help them return stolen merchandise.\n\nI know two people that work here, and they are really nice. Add one star for that lol. The second star is for the nifty little nail salon they have inside. The third star is for cleanliness and safety.\n\nMy main issue with this Wal-Mart is every time I pick a line, it always ends up turing into a five hour wait to get rung up. HENDERSON, aren't you supposed to be the rich area, here? I think you can afford to hire some more damn cashiers. \nAnd for the love of God, start enforcing the \"20 items or less\" rule. I usually never have to buy more then 10-15 things at any given time at Wal-Mart, and it never fails... I pull my cart up to the Speedy Lane, and there is some as*clown in front of me with 180 f-ing things in their cart. Jerks.\n\nOk, done ranting now haha
