Sunday afternoon:\n\nBurger fries and a captain and coke. \n\nThe burger was good, just over cooked for what I like. It still had flavor and juicy but more med well. \n\nThe fries, the toppings etc it was all good.\n\nThe drink was good not too much and not too little. \n\nPrices were good and the picnic tables outside was a perfect place to eat.
