This place taste great and used to be wonderful until they changed their whole menu. The chicken is good with a semi spicy topping on them after they fry them. The fries are snow string and fried nicely.\n\nMy problem is they used to give you 3 chicken strips and fries in the 'lunch box' but recently changed it to 3 chicken wings and fries with a drink. If you know anything about a chicken you know that wings have almost no meat on them and are extremely difficult to handle when immediately out of the fryer. The strips were easy to eat and could be cut up if needed. They used to let you upgrade to gravy fries, Nacho fries or loaded fries for no extra charge. Now they have three options: gravy and works for a $3 up charge and plain included. I have no problem paying for the upgraded fries but they are not very flavorful compared to the previous fries. \n\nTheir service is always nice and pleasant but seems to have changed and the atmosphere is different. I'll probably go back but not for the lunchbox because it was for sure not worth the price this time. I left feeing hungry still which was not great.
