The rooms are horrible! Casino is ok and you are close to everything on the strip which is why I'm giving 2 stars. \n\nWe weren't able to check in until 5:00 (when we showed up at 12:00 to ask when the room would be ready, all they told us was try coming back BETWEEN 5:00 and 6:00. They weren't sure if it would be even be ready at 5:00). \n\nOur carpet in the room had a huge wet spot right by the door. \n\nThe room reeked of weed! Was such a strong smell.\n\nThe lamp was broken\n\nThe phone didn't work\n\nThere was no mini fridge. \n\nHorrible lighting...so dark in the rooms. \n\nShowers didn't get hot\n\nAC had a burning smell. So bad we had to turn it off. \n\nAt 10:45pm, we got a knock on our door and it was maintenance. He said I need to come in and change a bulb in the bathroom. It was just me and 1 friend at that time and we didn't call and didn't want some random man coming into our room. We told him we didn't call and there was nothing wrong with the bathroom light, but he said he needed to get in to change it. All he said was \"maybe housekeeping called\". He refused to leave and walked right pass us into the bathroom, just to flip the lights on and then leave. Super sketchy, rude, unprofessional and annoying!\n\nMy other friend got her own room and her key deactivated on day 2. She went to get a new key card and they refused to give her one because she didn't have ID. Makes sense why for security reasons, but how could she show ID when it was locked in her room!? After a while of her arguing that point, they said they would send someone up with her to check ID when she opened the door. THEY MADE HER WAIT 20 MIN BEFORE SENDING SOMEONE UP WITH HER! And then made her walk back down to the front desk to show the ID. The whole process took about 45 min :\/ good thing we didn't have a show to catch!\n\nI do not recommend planet Hollywood! And I don't plan on staying here again if I go back to Vegas.
