This is my first time coming to Vegas.  They make a great great great impression to me, and make me want to stay here next time. (I know it's expensive, but I want good experience too.)\nAnyways, this is the story.  I bought phantom ticket on ticketmaster.com, and I called to Venetian to verify the pick up place and all the info that I need to know before I watch phantom.  Their customer service was fantastic.  They are so patient and willing to help me and give me all the answer they can find.  \n\nWatch Phantom in The Venetian was the right choice.
