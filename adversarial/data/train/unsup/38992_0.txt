Authentic chinese food at the strip. Reasonably priced, i can actually say that it is very affordable considering it is inside the Venetian casino. The shumai, siomai or simply pork dumplings, it is just so delicious. I had to order 2 every time cause it is jusy so damn good. The fried rice is a good portion, i can say it is good for 2 people. My husband had the beef brisket soup noodle and it is just like being in China. This place is one place u would always come back to. One day, we ate there twice. For lunch and dinner, just can't get enough of Noodle Asia, and oh did i mention that service is fast. They have about 5 or 6 cooks in the cooking station and they make it right away so it is yummy and hot when served!
