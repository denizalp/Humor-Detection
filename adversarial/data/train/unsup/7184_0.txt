Unassuming little spot in a random strip mall off 7th St. and Pecan. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you step inside, atmosphere takes over. Dimly lit with a sleek design... The menu features a variety of burgers. Be sure to check for the special burger of the week. Their beer selection is also spot on and they have a couple taps featuring local brews. \n\nI enjoyed the black bean quinoa burger and LOVED the green bean salad. Ted had the cowboy burger with fries. I snuck a few french fries and had serious side envy. The fries were perfectly seasoned, crunchy and hot. Yum! \n\nWe're looking forward to visiting again and are excited to have discovered a little neighborhood gem so close to home! I think I'll try the Seoul Burger (kim chi with bulgogi sauce, green onions and pickled cucumbers) next time.
