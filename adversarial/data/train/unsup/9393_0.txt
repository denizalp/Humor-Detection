Vegas shenanigans always takes me on the hunt for some delicious pho to cure that hangover disease...\n\nThis time it took me to Viet Noodle Bar. Large, spacious and clean looking restaurant nestled in Chinatown of Vegas. \n\nLiked the pho rib-eye and spring rolls. \nDidn't really like the thai iced tea nor the vietnamese coffee w\/ condensed milk, both of which were too sweet. \n\n++PROS++\n+ Clean, lighter color broth that is tasty and not too salty or packed with MSG\n+ Rib-eye meat is very tender\n+ Huge portions\n\n--CONS--\n- Pricey. $11.95 for rib-eye pho\n- Noodles are a bit too soft and clumped together\n- RIb-eye meat is also SUPER clumped together, had a rather annoying time unclumping my meal\n\nOVERALL...\nYes I would come back. Although on the pricey end, portions are generous and broth is pretty tasty. Also, when I asked for white onions on the side they really piled it on and didn't jip me. Yay for finding a yummy pho spot in Vegas! :)
