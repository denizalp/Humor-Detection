I honestly loved this place before. However,I get really mad about silly&rude service from waiter. \nWe sat in tatami and ordered 2 drinks. I waited my drink about 15mins and the waiter never shows up to bring my drink,and take order. It was slow on that night. He never come to my table even I called him. So I decided to go walk to him and ask where is my drink? And he answered me,'when you sit in tatami,you have to take off your shoes. I didn't bring your drinks cause you don't take off your shoes'\nWTF? Sorry to use bad word. But seriously. WTF.\nwhy don't you tell me when you let us sitting in tatami?\nIf me,I will tell to customer when I bring drinks to them. You spent your 15mins to waiting us to take off the shoes? Wow I'm clapping to his patience!! \nAnd who do you think you are? I thought he was my professor of Japanese culture! He was acting like I'm not giving you candy if you fail. \n\nWhat a hilarious services I ever had in my life hahaha\nBtw food was so good!
