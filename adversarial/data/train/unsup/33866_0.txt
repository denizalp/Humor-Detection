I've only been there once and I enjoyed myself. I went with my kids and they loved it! \n\nWhile the burgers were good, and my 11 year old felt like Habit would give IN N OUT a run for their money, I think we most enjoyed the ambiance. Indoor and outdoor seating perfect for this time of year and the music was nice; comfortable. The restaurant, condiments and restrooms were clean and well kept. \n\nThe burgers were good, its apparent the ingredients are fresh. The fries and the onion rings are frozen, yet are good and were crispy! I will be returning to try more on the menu! Its perfect for the kids burger craving and salad for my weight watching!
