I have been a customer of Maryann for many years and have 10 properties that she insures as well as my 2 autos.  This company always gives me the best deals and this year I received a phone call from Susan who works for Maryann explaining that she had a way to save me some money on my rental properties.  All told she saved me over a thousand dollars and I am eternally grateful.  The amazing thing about it was that I never solicited her to save money.  She is the one that called me.  Everytime I call I always get the most friendly service.  I highly recommend Farmers Insurance with Maryann.
