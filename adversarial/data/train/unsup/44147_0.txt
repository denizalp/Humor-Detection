This was the 3rd and last time we come here for dim sum. If you are not Chinese they sit you at the back where the carts don't come or the food is cold when it does. Waited 15 mins for the first cart. Service is poor and with the exception of the chicken feet which were great, the rest of the dim sum was mediocre and overpriced.
