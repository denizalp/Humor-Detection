My friend was staying at Paris and wanted to try this place out, so I joined her for lunch. We got sat on the patio, which is only elevated slightly over the Strip but still has a nice view of all the buildings and the Bellagio fountains; they also had heat lamps out (January), so it was very pleasant.\n\nI ordered the chicken and waffles and my friend had the club sandwich. The chicken and waffles were really disappointing. It was just chicken breasts in very light breading, so not at all what I expected. The waffle texture was also really weird - it managed to be dry while rather chewy. Definitely not worth the time for chicken and waffle lovers.\n\nMy friend did like her club sandwich, and it was a large sandwich (although for the price - $18, which is pretty bad even by Strip tourist trap standards - it had better be). My friend did complain about her side salad ($1 supplement with the club sandwich, to replace fries) as it was just vegetables - no leafy greens.\n\nService was not good - the food took forever and waiter was not attentive at all, so I can't rate this place higher than 2*. Would look for somewhere else even if you want to sit outside with a view of the Strip.
