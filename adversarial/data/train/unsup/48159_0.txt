I attended the store's grand opening on a Saturday evening. I was impressed with the variety of merchandise and the employees seemed friendly, asking me if this is the first time I've been in. One explained that the merchandise is made from recycled materials, and there are a lot of unique items which I haven't seen in other stores locally. Besides home decor, there is some clothing with an Audrey Hepburn theme. \nThe shop is small, which makes it difficult to move around when more than a few customers are there. I saw a few items that I'm interested in and will definitely be back. \nOverall, it's a nice addition to the new upstairs Market in Tivoli Village.
