Apparently Toronto Pearson Airport has been designated the \"go-to\" employment location for individuals too slow for a US DMV counter, and not bright enough to be Wal-Mart greeters.  Canada's version on TSA and US Customs pre-clearance staff seem to share a universal bond of bad attitude, slow pace and the \"not giving a rat's patootie about the \"customers\" they \"serve' (air quotes sarcastically intended).  Canada doesn't even have the excuse of being a Third World country, and they are not even truly Socialist, so there's little excuse for their sloth.  Nor for the five-mile hike that International connecting flight victims are forced to make. Leave AT LEAST four hours between connections if you are returning to the USA, or another actual country.\n\nNow let's address the UTTER LACK of sit down restaurant facilities in the appropriately named \"F\" Terminal (I can think of several F-words to describe this blighted outpost.  if you have the misfortune to be scheduled on a flight leaving out of the \"F\" terminal, i would advise stopping for a meal in the main part of the terminal (prior to the Death March down the nearly-deserted hallway that leads to the forlorn little outpost that is the \"F\" terminal. Not that choices in the main terminal good, but you at least have several bad options to choose from, as opposed to the dismal little three-seat deli that is grandly (and misleadingly) termed the \"Great\" Canadian Bagel Shop.
