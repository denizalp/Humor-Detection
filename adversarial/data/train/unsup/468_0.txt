Extremely expensive, ultra high-end retailers ONLY. As such, this place is always deserted. But, I guess they only need to sell one thing a month to make rent and then some. It has a new and classy interior, but it is also basic and boring. Don't even bother just looking, as the window displays are minimal and salespeople don't even bother to come forward if they don't judge you worthy.
