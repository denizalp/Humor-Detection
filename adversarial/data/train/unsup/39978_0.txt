Food was very good and unique.  Yellowtail taquitos, sepia robata and Peruvian corn were distinct highlights.  Ambiance and service left something to be desired, though.  The room, while interesting was very noisy with tables right on top of each other making discreet conversation a chore.  The waitress didn't bother explaining the menu or offering suggestions other than a quick listing of specials.  Despite ordering at least 6 dishes, all the food arrived at the same time.  So much for pacing the meal!\n\nWe were done our dinner in 40 minutes and feeling rushed by the staff were eager to leave.  Would return for lunch or appetizers but nt again for a leisurely meal.
