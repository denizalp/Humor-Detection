We came a day after Father's Day.  Boy was it packed here.  We waited about 45 minutes until our turn.  It was nice coming here once for the show, in my opinion.  The ice cream was ok.  Nothing too special.   I wouldn't come and wait in line for this ever again.  LOL, it's not worth it.   I ordered the Coffee n Donut, our other group ordered, Kit Kat, Smores, and Peanut Butter.  I do have a food allergy...luckily I only ended up a small rash on my chest.  They do mix contaminate everything here.  Bring your epi pen is a must! \n\nTips for the team, I know it was super busy.  You still have to come out and clean your lobby and change the trash like a normal business does.  All the tables and seats were covered in ice cream from all the other parents who didn't clean after themselves.  It's not a good experience for other first timer and regular guests.  \n\nAlso, invest in a sign to keep the front door closed at all times and another rope for people to wait outside in line.  It's not cool the staff keeps yelling over the customers to keep the door closed.
