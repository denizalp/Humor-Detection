This was  a little gem of a restaurant in Leetsville, PA.  A gritty little town on the Ohio just down the road from Swickely, PA which has addresses that used to belong to the steel barons back in the day and now home to Mario Lemieux and others.  The restaurant served good mexican fare and I had the mahi mahi tacos, along with chips and salsa and the chocolate flan for dessert.  There were nice touches inside such as using the heavy mexican blown glassware.  The night was pretty slow but probably not unusual for a Tuesday evening in mid January.  My issues are all things easily corrected.  One, the place was  freezing.  I would  have died for a little warmth.  This in fact leads to my first complaint.  The chips could have been kept in a warner as they come to the table stone cold and the salsa, while flavorful lacked  any spicy heat and was served at refrigerator temperature.  The fish tacos were excellent but I would have liked a little chipotle aoli to spice them up a little.  Now, the dessert...Oh My God...it was a masterpiece.  The chocolate flan must have been made in massive dishes.  A 3x3 chunk of lovely cake topped with a perfect flan was served on a chocolate drizzled plate along with strawberries and fresh whipped cream.  It is almost indescribable. While I didn't imbibe in the margaritas and stuck to draft XX amber I saw their tequila list and it was impressive.  The staff was fairly attentive although aloof.  I would  definitely go back as I was travelling on business and this little place made the trip a little less dreary in the mid winter.
