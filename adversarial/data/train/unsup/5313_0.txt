I have been a loyal customer for almost 2 years now met a lot of great people here but found out recently that i am no longer allowed. Tish the GM is a fake as shit, because I don't agree with the bs way she runs the bar or treat her employees I can no longer come in. It's sad that her personal feelings have so much to do with how she \"manages\" the bar. She recently let go a great bar tender without reason that I and many others did not agree with. There are still some great employees there that I would still go see but it's is pretty pathetic that they now must also suffer because of Tish insecurties. This will probably be deleted, as are all the other reviews about her but I will repost it....Â  So to all my luckys fam ILY all, see you at sporting life!
