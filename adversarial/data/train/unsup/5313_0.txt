LOVE LOVE LOVE THE day spa pass.... $25 per day!!!\n\nThe Service: FANTASTIC! Very professional and personal. Gave spa tour once check in. \n\nThe Amenities: Jacuzzi, steam room, sauna room, lounge area, shower, locker room, etc. Magazine, fresh fruits, snacks, coffee & tea are available. Lots of towels available everywhere in the spa.\n\nThey have all the hair products and everything you need in the shower room.  \n\nThe staffs are constantly cleaning the common area. Very well maintained. \n\nInstead of  playing in the casino, I prefer to stay in the spa for hours... only cost me $25 all day!! Good deal~
