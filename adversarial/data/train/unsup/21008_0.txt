What a shit show this place is. It was fine until later when they weren't limiting the number of people on the dance floor. You literally couldn't get off the dance floor because the VIP ropes were in the way. Asked a security guard if we could go through the ropes just to get out, he said no. I guarantee they were in violation of fire code. I thought about decking the security guard in the face as then I could probably get out quickly, but opted to struggle with my fianc√© for twenty minutes to leave this death trap. I've been to a lot of clubs all over the world and this was by far the worst I've ever been to.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, this country uses the \"stamp\" system. Well, actually a series of stamps. Nice, wet stamps that seem to rub off on things, like your shirt. Because of this, I now have a nice black stain on the inside and edges of my handmade bespoke Singaporean dress shirt. Yay. I guess wrist bands would be too much of a hassle. \n\nP.S. Jamie \"Motherfuckin\" Foxx was amazing. This venue doesn't deserve him.\n\nP.S.S. I reserved our tickets through AMEX Platinum concierge and have made a point to let Vince there know that they shouldn't recommend this venue to their customers.
