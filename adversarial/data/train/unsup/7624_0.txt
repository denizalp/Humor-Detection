Love the name, love the park. My dog absolutely loves it here. Plenty of room to run free and and mingle with the K9 Krew. So far all the owners pick up after their pooch so it's always a \"land-mine free\" zone. \n\nAs with most dog parks, it's divided into size. One side for the Big Dawgs and one side for the Tiny But Mighty! Nice trail just over the hill as well. Great for taking a stroll or catching up on your cardio.
