Apparently the most affordable meal in Bellagio, yet totally overpriced, mediocre fast food. The burger was OK. The fries were lukewarm and stale; they'd obviously been sitting under a heat lamp. Portions were NOT generous at all. The McDonald's down the street probably has better food for a third the price.
