What a joke. My wife and I saw Brian Setzer here on December 18th. I have seen Setzer countless times and this venue was hands down the WORST ever. To begin with, they misrepresented the stage layout. I bought two orchestra pit \"front row\" tickets. When we arrived we learned the stage rotates so we got to stare at the back of his head most of the show. Next came the awful annoying \"dancers\"...people from the audience that had bad seats that decided to march themselves down to the front to stand right in front of the first row seats and completely obstruct our view. Security? Try fat overgrown meatheads...let me elaborate...when my wife politely asked the people \"dancing\" (more like drunk stumblers) to move so she could see the show, one of the smart asses turns around and says \"smile\" to my wife and snaps her picture! Really? Not to mention it's clearly marked no cameras. What did security do? Nothing besides tell US to stop \"making trouble\". Wow! unbelievable! This venue is awful. I will NEVER return here; horrible overpriced joke of a venue. I will see setzer again because he's an amazing guitar player, but never will I see him here. Save yourself the trouble and check this venue off your list stat...more like a junior high musical venue at best
