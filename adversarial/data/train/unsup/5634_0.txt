Not a bad space at all and tons of parking nearby.  Person at the front desk made me feel like I was wasting her time by asking questions (maybe she just had a bad day?).  Either way not very helpful at all and I almost walked out even after paying.\nI'd like to try this place again but the \"feel\" was not very friendly.  Maybe I just had great experiences at other places so I'm disappointed.
