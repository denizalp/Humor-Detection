Avoid like the plague!\n\nWent with five girls for a economical brunch before hitting the pool\/slots. Everything was terrible about this place- so bad that I  made a severe mental note to warn THE OTHERS on Yelp before they made this tragic mistake.\n\nWe ordered our meals and a few of us ordered coffees. The waitress came on the other side of the table and told my cousins to \"slide those coffees over there will ya\" to me and my sister. Totally rude. Then, she said \"the bread is getting toasted it's coming\" after we asked where the bread was. Ten minutes later she comes out and says \"oh there actually was no bread but here! take this garlic bread instead\". \n\nThe garlic bread was literally seeped in a garlic broth and microwaved, so my sister was the only one with balls to ask for just bread and butter instead. When the waitress came back, chunks of butter were thrown onto untoasted white bread. Ridic.\n\nI'm not one to complain, but I usually LOVE Denny's and have never had an issue with it back home. The meals we got were literally slapped onto the plate, half-assed, and small. This Denny's made my heart die a little inside.\n\nWaitresses never refilled our coffee, disappeared, and we had to go to the kitchen to find someone to pay our bill.\n\n\nTip had the shape of a donut. A small angry donut.
