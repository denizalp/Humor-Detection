Ok. Before you are heading out, ask yourself a few questions....\n\n1) do I have children\n2) do I like fried foods\n3) do I want to step on a 3 year olds finger near the arcade space\n\nIf you can answer yes to all three of these questions, this place is for you! Soooo many kids. So many unsupervised kids. This place actually made me very nervous. My husband and I ventured out to this location for our nephews birthday party. We have a 3 month old, so we took him along. I literally almost tripped over multiple kids. The staff were not saying to any of the children, don't run, don't lay on the floor...it was just a free for all. \n\nThe food was o k. It is all fried. They have a couple of salads. I don't recommend coming too hungry because you will just eat a bunch of snacks. \n\nIt's a bit messy as well. I believe I saw a couple gnats at the bar. \n\nNow the 8 year old whose party it was loved it. They have a nice party room in the back where kids can host functions. They assign waitstaff for your particular party and they are to help with everything. The young lady assigned to us did just that.
