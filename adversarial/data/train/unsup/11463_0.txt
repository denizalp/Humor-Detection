Whew! I've been waiting for other people to write reviews on this place so that their only review wouldn't be a bad one. It was last fall I think when we came here, but the memory is fresh.\n\nBecause a picture is worth 1,000 words, I'll just post the picture of the horrifying meal my boyfriend was served here. This is what they call a Medium-well steak. I didn't edit this picture whatsoever, because it's completely accurate in its existing nauseating nature.\n\n I don't even remember what I got, I don't remember liking it, but I was too horrified by what I captured in this photograph. The service was terrible, the woman who waited on us was rude, and the window treatments are made of...wait for it...cloth napkins. A creative use of napkins mind you, but not for a restaurant. This must be a 'regular' type place for people who don't know better. I was horrified, horrified. Terrible, terrible. It's amazing we didn't leave with food poisoning. Months later and I'm still upset about this experience. Avoid it, there are so many great restaurants in Cleveland.
