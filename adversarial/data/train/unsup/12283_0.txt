Adventure is the spice of life. So are peppers so hot they burn you twice. Such is the lesson learned at Los Reyes de la Torta, located in an otherwise unremarkable part of West Indian School, where nary a white boy doth travel. However, I found myself in the neighborhood when my employer asked me to take my car on our courier route to retrieve bank transactions for customers who otherwise wouldn't be able to make it into a branch. I love my job. I love my job. I love my job...\n\nBut I digress.\n\nThis location has a menu nearly identical to the Seventh Street location, except it's almost exclusively in Spanish. It's times like this I wish I was bilingual. However, the carne asade quesadilla I ordered was good with tender strips of beef; the chips were okay and the salsa was delightfully spicy and fresh. My server was exceptionally polite and tried to communicate with me, despite the language barrier.\n\nIt's hard to say if I'd make this a destination or not. Chances are, since I rarely travel to this area I'd only go back if worked called me out to this area.
