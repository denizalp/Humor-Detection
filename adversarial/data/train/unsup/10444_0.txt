We came to this place today because our favorite sandwich shop Ike's was closed for the holiday and this place is sort of a \"knock off\" of Ike's. There was no one else there when we came in, and the girl at the counter was very friendly. She was able to make a recommendation to me and I ended up really liking the sandwich, however, their bread to sandwhich ratio is off and their sourdough wasn't as crusty as I normally like. \n     The place itself is pretty nice, you can tell it wants to be a little fancier than it is, but it's comfortable. The menu is crazy, just like Ike's, there's definitely something for everyone. However, I was disappointed at their cheese selection. Being a gourmet sandwich shop, you'd think they'd have facier cheeses like havarti but they didn't even have mozzarella. \n    Overall, it was OK. This definitely doesn't take place Ike's.
