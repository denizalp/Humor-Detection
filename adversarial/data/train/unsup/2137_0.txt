I dunno... \n\nI loved their LA store.  This one in Vegas, though, is like the LA restaurant's forgotten (disowned) little brother with drug and gambling problem.  \n\nWhere do I begin? \n\nThe service was not rude, just nonexistent.  The food was overcooked (I couldn't help but think that the two are correlated).  We never got the refill of the tea despite the waitress' acknowledgment of our multiple requests.  The meat was tasteless.  And by God, it's the Vegas strip price at $28 per person. \n\nRemind me to never go off the strip in Vegas again.  Unless we're going to Rehab at the Hard Rock Hotel.
