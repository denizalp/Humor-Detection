Walked in to purchase 3 twin beds and one queen bed. The store clerk welcomed me and my two kids. He asked us what we needed and I said some twin beds. He said we have some clearance beds against the wall. A second customer entered behind us and said I called you about some tickets. The store clerk walked off to let us figure out what we wanted. I had no clue what they have or how to pick out the right bed. Really felt like this guy didn't care. I patiently waited while they talked about these tickets he was offering this other guy. Once they started talking about beds and we were still being ignored we began walking for the door. The guy told me that he would be with me in a moment. I said don't bother because I want to shop at a store that the first customer get served before the second customer. Will never return to this business. I went to Sleep America and down the street got great service from Christina and a good deal on some nice beds.
