This is where I happen to purchase my awesome 3G cruiser.  Like so many others, I experienced great customer service.  It is good boy customer service as it can be mildly awkward at times (but I'm a girl).  They let me try out all the bikes I wanted which was super awesome since I was spending the big bucks (at least in my world).  \n\nThey also helped me bling my bike with a sweet Paul Frank bell, a basket, a U-lock, my sweet pink helmet and tire stuff for all the nails I'll likely run over in the PHX!\n\nI had forgotten to write a review until now as I ended up going bike shopping with a friend yesterday.  I took her to Landis (just to check out another bike shop) and was super annoyed with the rude service there so I decided to head back to Sun Cyclery.  They helped her find something she loved and so I thought it'd be appropriate to send a shot out to my favorite Cen Pho bike shop.\n\nWarning:  The parking lot is kind of a mess so ride your bike if you can!
