I recently moved to Gilbert and went to Palace Nails and Spa on a whim. The place is very open--it's not like other nail & spas with \"\"\"\" lighting and an overwhelming smell of nail polish remover. Very open and chic, lots of natural lighting. I'm not quite positive who did my nails, but they were done very well and lasted for a long time. I would give them a higher rating...however I was charged $60 for simple black acrylics that were short in length. A little pricey and I didn't think it should've been. I went back to schedule my prom nail appointment and I was told that my longer, special shape, gel acrylics were only going to be $37. Very peculiar as to the $23 difference between a special event nail and your basic acrylic set with no gel...
