i've been w\/ PCF for a LONG time.  I do recommend them, personally.  I do basic banking, I find them to be professional and efficient.\nThey certainly promote a no-fee banking system, and competitive interest rates.  \n\nI've had a mortgage w\/ them, but would still recommend comparing rates before committing to them.\n\nPCF is versatile, they offer: Savings accounts, Chequing accounts, Interest-free accounts, GIC accounts, Mortgages, GICs and I'm sure more.\n\n~~~\nwhoa.  I just glanced at a few other Yelpers comments.  I've no doubt that their experiences w\/ PCF differ with mine.  :(\n\nI guess to you, the reader, take each review w\/ a grain of salt including mine.  \n\nBtw, the daily maximum that I can withdraw from any ATM is $800 in one shot and I think $1000 in TOTAL, daily (so in two transactions?)\n\nAlso, I do my banking mostly online and the site seems secure.
