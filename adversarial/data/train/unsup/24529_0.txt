Spring Garden Ave has more Japanese restaurants than the TTC has delays. The only one I find worth going back to is Kiyomizu - especially if you are a sashimi person. Fresh and melt in your mouth - and always excellent quality. I would say it is around 25% more expensive than the other Japanese places on Spring Garden but the difference in quality is stark - truly stark. And the sashimi boats are always accompanied with miso soup, salad and a small dolop of green tea ice cream. When I want to go cheap, I go to Ichiban on the same street but if I want quality, I go Kiyomizu.
