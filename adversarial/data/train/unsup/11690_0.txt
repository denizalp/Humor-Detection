This is a dive in the very best sense of the word.  Guy Fieri needs to come here!  \n\nThis fine establishment is located inside the Antiques Mall.  Walk in and go to your left.  \n\nMy sense of direction is not so hot and I started out thinking this was somewhere near downtown Chandler but it's closer to Warner on Arizona Ave.  I finally made it and Rand H. and Robyn N. were patiently waiting for me and my daughter.  Randy, the proprietor of this fine establishment was sitting at the table and greeted us warmly.  It just so happend that Sonoran Living had been in to do a piece on Randy and we anxiously waited to see it.  As soon as the piece was over, the phone started ringing, no joke!  \n\nAll three of the adults had the \"3-Legged Chile N Cheese Hot Dog\" and it was very filling and very good!!  My daughter had a Lil' Willy and scarfed it down in two minutes flat with a big thumbs up!  There were a couple of tables to sit and eat and Randy took our orders and we got our drinks and sat and chatted for a few minutes.  And if you are a Pittsburg fan, this is the place for you!  \n\nRandy is so warm and welcoming.  He is an excellent host and clearly loves what he does.  This is the kind of place that you want to come back to over and over again simply because the owner puts his best foot forward and does all he can for his patrons.  And when I went to pay the bill I even got a hug!  Now that is service!  My daughter's favorite food is a hot dog so we will be frequenting Pittsburgh Willy's.  I hope Randy doesn't get sick of us. :)
