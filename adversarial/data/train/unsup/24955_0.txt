We have always heard a lot about this club on H. Stern and such so we thought we would check it out.\n\ndownstairs is nice, but upstairs in the VIP is much, much, much more nice.  Girls are very hot and nice \/ approachable.\n\nBut it is VERY, VERY Pricey.  Regular lapdances are ok, $20, but if you are going to the VIP, be ready to blow at least $1500 easy if not more.\n\nThe hosts are very curtious and professional.\n\nWe will be definetly going back. :)
