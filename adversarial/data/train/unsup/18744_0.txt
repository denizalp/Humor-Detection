Today I made a reservation for the evening for a , couple massage. she asked my name, number phone as well as the name and the name of my husband. still wanted the card number to pay immediately. but it's good that we would like going to pay in cash.    on my way I'm called about the fact that we're going and we can later on for 2 minutes. She said that today we  don't  have appointment! I'm in shock! I met and ordered the nurse. and I paid her the money. I do not know how they work there but it is not a service!!!
