First time to Vegas, and as a Beatles fan, I was excited to see the show at The Mirage. Arrived at 6:30 to be seated for the showing at 7. The performance was just alright, don't get me wrong there was some amazing stunts. But nothing overwhelmingly awesome. However, the sound quality was beyond perfect! Which is why this show has 4 stars instead of 3. The pureness and rawness of the tracks they used for the show were amazing. I would go see the show again with my eyes closed, and enjoy it twice as much. Would have liked more songs to be added to it, however, considering the Beatles have such a wide range of songs to choose from. \n\nDon't forget to stop at the merch store before you head in! It gets super crowded after the show.
