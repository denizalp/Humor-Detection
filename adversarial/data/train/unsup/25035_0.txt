Delicious dinner, cute decor, and very nice wait staff. Our glasses were kept topped off with cucumber water the whole time we stayed. This was refreshing and felt luxurious.\nThe butternut squash risotto was fantastic, and definitely the best thing anyone in our party ordered. The curry flatbread was pretty good too, and it came with a bowl of perfectly executed kale chips. \nMy husband ordered the shepherd's pie, and found it a little underwhelming, and not as much food as he hoped for. The chocolate peanut butter pie we got for desert was really good, though.\nIf you prefer large quantity of food over quality, Fern might not be the best choice for you. But if you would like to eat at a restaurant with good flavors and healthy, fresh ingredients, and not feel gross when you're leaving, you will love Fern!
