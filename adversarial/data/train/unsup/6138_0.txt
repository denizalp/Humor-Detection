My husband and I recently bought a National Parks pass and have been on a kick to see some of our parks.  So this beautiful morning we decided to revisit Red Rock.  The skies are clear, and the sun is out, the temperature is not too warm, so what a way to spend an afternoon. \n\nWe're not much for hiking, but a brisk walk we do just find with.  After checking out the visitor center, strolling the display on the grounds and stopping at the gift center, we head back to the car to drive through the park.  \n\nIt's breath taking at times, and along the way, we see the physical types out hiking and climbing the rocks, some even have their dogs.  I say good for them, in a better life, I'd be one of them, but this old tired lady is not into it!  I much prefer the leisurely drive through, stopping from time to time to take that breath taking picture.\n\nA really great drive, and oh a great place for hiking (if you like that kinda stuff).  Be sure to bring water, a hat and some sun screen!
