our check engine light came on and we took it for a check engine light test. The test told us that the problem was an o2 sensor and that our fuel mixture was too rich. We took it to our mechanic who replaced the upstream o2 sensor. We drove it for a bit and the check engine light came back on. After taking it back to our regular mechanic, he told us that our flex fuel system needed to be flashed and only a chevy dealership could do that. Because we were in the area, we called this shop and made an appt for the next day. My husband took it in and after waiting 2 hrs was told that yes it did need to be flashed and they did that. They also told him that the o2 sensor was bad, he asked which one and they said they didn't know, he told them we had just changed out the upstream o2 sensor and they said ya it was the downstream o2 sensor. Convenient?! He asked how much it would be and they quoted us over $200! We had just had the upstream replaced for about $110. My husband asked them to just flash it and we'd be on our way. After our mechanic replaced the downstream o2 sensor for half the cost, we still had the check engine and fuel mixture problem. My husband called back the Chevy dealership and asked them if they had flashed it, they said yes, but if we brought it down, they would look at it again for no charge. My husband drove it back down there and as he was handing over the keys was told that they would not look it over free of charge, they would charge us the diagnostic fee of $114. We were just there 2 days ago for a diagnostic and paid that fee, but the problem was not fixed, now we have to pay again for a problem you failed to fix the first time? And why didn't they tell us that before my husband drove it across town? Seems like bait and switch and bad customer service and we will never recommend this dealership for any reason.
