All in the rapper, E-40's voice:\n\nDopeness n shiat.. all wrapped up in a quaint little package. I ordered me a Thai Wrap after reading all the hype on this damned inter web, and that thang was the bizness. Had a n*gg* lickin peanut flavor off my phalanges for realz mane. Garlic rice make a thugg feel nice. Replaced that chicken with mothafunkin sauteed tofu and felt real good about myself afterward for not eating dead aminals. Too bad I'm making like 4 slabs of baby back ribs thizz weekend. Funk dem animals mane.. I be eatin them shits on the weekend only. Lots of em too. \n\nMy side salad came in a tiny ass condiment container! Aye, That's a Wrap!! Quit skiggety skimpin on dem portions mane. \n\nHomie who took my order showed respek like a mugg... You wanna meet up fer lunch some time Yelpers?? Just Tell Me When To Go-\n\nHocus Pocus
