I haven't had fast food this bad in a long time. \n\nWe ordered a $4 combo with burger, french fries, chicken nuggets and a drink. We paid a little extra to replace the regular soda with root beer float. Since we got it to go, I didn't know how bad it was until I opened the bag. The sandwich is small and flat, french fries were either burn up or old. It was completely soak in oil. Chicken nuggets are burn and tasteless. Ok....I was thinking ...well they can't mess up on root beer float. I was wrong. The soda was so flat there was no carbon in it. And the vanilla ice-cream....it is also tasteless. \n\nI will have to say that the staffs at the drive thru was very friendly. Neverthelsss, the quality of food was so bad I will most definitely never come back here again.
