I visited this place twice and I am very impressed with the services. The staff very cooperative, informative, and fast. \nWhen you enter at the front desk, you will get your choice of heart rate monitor. I like the one like a watch ;). \nThe coach was very patient for a beginner like me to explained how to follow the exercise's instruction. The group is not too crowded and all my group very supportive and friendly. No grumpy face LOL. \nThe exercise started and finished exactly 60 minutes as you can see everything on tge tv screen, includied your name, heart rate, calories you burn, how to do, and the time. \nI highly recommended this place!\nOh, they also have a shower room.
