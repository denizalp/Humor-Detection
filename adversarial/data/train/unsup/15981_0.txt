Yes I went to Vegas and saw a movie? Problem.\n\nI went here on a opening weekend and it was not crowded at all... I think Saturday is the perfect day to go because everyone is gambling and clubbing.\n\nAnywho the theatres were small which was cool because it wasn't realy packed. The seats were kind of janky though. My seat was broken and leaned way back, cholo style.\nTickets were SUPER cheap 7.75. I was VERY suprised. You think Vegas and you think expensive, but that was not the case here.\n\nStadium style seating, no stupid teenagers, its all good. Im sure there were better theaters in Vegas but why waste money on a movie.\n\nI need my money for buffet action.
