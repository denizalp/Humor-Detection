The Old Spaghetti Factory serves its purpose. \n\nThe Old Spaghetti Factory is great if your dining experience is to fill one of these criteria: \n- children\/teen friendly \n- large group of people that like \"basic\" food \n- bang for your buck \n- you want to hang out with tourists \n\nIf you are looking for a great Italian dining experience, do not go here. The Old Spaghetti Factory will not make you think of your Italian grandmother or even your quarter-twice removed-does a great Godfather routine-Italian grandmother. \n\nLast night I took some of my family and my 3 year old God Daughter here. She loved it. Lots to see, crayons and paper at the table, people singing happy birthday, loud music and they had her requested \"meat balls with pasta\". \n\nWhen you order anything off the menu it comes with a choice of soup or salad to start, pop, your entree, ice cream and coffee\/tea. All for about $15. Was the food great - no. But, I had no expectations, and was going here solely for my God Daughter. She loved it, they had what she wanted, there was something everyone could eat, again - served its purpose. \n\nOf note, they do have some half decent girly drinks\/cocktails that if you order the larger version - you get to keep the glass. This place is quite large, so if you have a group of people with bland taste buds, this may be a good option. \n\nBonus points for the music. It was a 90's revival. I sang and seat danced to James \"Laid\"
