Thomas and Megan were awesome! They took care of us, explained everything thoroughly and it was one of the best buying experience we've ever had. Thomas was very knowledgeable about the products and their benefits and features to guide us through the buying  process. The information he provided us  helped us  make the best decisions for our purchases. We would highly recommend him to friends and family. Thank you so much! Megan was great to work with as well we felt very welcome and taken care of in her store. Thank you again!! If you go to this store definitely ask for Thomas
