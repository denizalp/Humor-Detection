Dr. Fisch is not your average cold handed physician running patients through the office like cattle. He is not that doctor with his nose buried in a clipboard while asking you awkward questions. For a fresh change he is not that businessman only thinking of profit. Dr. Fisch cares about your medical and emotional issues concerning your desire to have a loving and bonding family. His medical knowledge is second to none. He also exhibits an exemplary bedside manner. He literally will hold your hand throughout the whole process. His one-on-one communications anytime of the day or night help with any form of anxiety you might experience. He is also very honest about treatment. Standing next to Dr. Fisch is his staff. A highly skilled group (Suzette, Amy, Juanita, Emily and Jay) that believes in their mission to support Dr. Fisch delivering the highest level of respect and care to all that walk into the clinic.\nP.S:\nHopefully all goes well, we are expecting a Christmas baby :)\nUpdate:\nWe were blessed with a beautiful baby boy, he is 5 months & 1\/2 now...Thank u Dr. Fish..:)
