So impressed!\nI came here with 2 of my friends for lunch and I was really pleased with my experience here. The atmosphere is casual and laidback. Our server was Lani and he was great! Lani was extremely hospitable and sincere; he always made sure our drinks were filled, made all the right suggestions regarding our orders, he'd constantly checked up on us, and had outstanding customer appreciation. During our meal, Lani brought out samples of a sweet beer for my friends and I to try and I absolutely loved it. I'm not a huge beer drinker, nor do I like sweet drinks, BUT this particular brew was really on point. I ordered the calamari and the grilled ahi tuna (no butter) with brown rice and veggies and it was delicious! I highly recommend going here!...I cannot wait to come back here to check out their happy hour.
