Sat down and it took 10 mins just to be served water. Was never given a refill after that. Ordered the Bruschetta Tradizionale which was bland. Asked for salt, which was never brought to our table. Ordered the Cozze Seducente in a white wine sauce which tasted flavourless. As mains, we ordered the Veal Parmigiana which tasted alright and the Penne Salmone which tasted so fishy that it must have been spoiled. When asked if the salmon was fresh, we were told \"Uh... Um..  Usually\" by a young waitress. We also ordered the Fettuccine alla Romantini which tasted bland. Literally took three bites out of it and set it aside. The waitress took the Penne Salmone off the bill but didn't offer to take off the Fattuccine allla Romantini, even though it was basically untouched. No manager came by to apologize for the meal that was taken off or just to check on us. It was a disappointing night at this restaurant.
