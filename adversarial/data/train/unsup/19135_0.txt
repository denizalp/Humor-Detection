The Indian Cuisine is a great little spot in Thornhill to satisfy your Indian food cravings. I am of Indian decent and as such I've had exposure to amazing homemade Indian food both in Canada and back home and have also tried numerous fine Indian restaurants in the GTA such as The Host, Jaipur Grille, Bombay Bhel, Brar etc. \n\nI can easily say that Indian Cuisine is on par with these other great restaurants if not better. Food tastes authentic and is not oily or greasy. When I open my take out container at other Indian restaurants there is usually a layer of oil on top of my food, but not here. Ingredients are fresh and good quality. \n\nI've had take out, a la carte and the buffet and I can say the quality and taste is consistent throughout. Service is good also. The prices for a la carte are a bit high for Thornhill, but they usually have specials online if you check. Favourite dishes here are the Paneer Makhni (shai paneer), Palak Paneer and Mutter Panner. The naans are also amazing and cooked in an authentic tandoor. No fake pita type rip offs. \n\nI will be back forsure!
