I've been wanting to see this show for years and finally got to see it last week. Best Vegas show ever!! A must see for Beatles fans. The music, choreography, costumes, characters, acrobats, & visuals all amazing!! Two seats in section 206 Row P $214.56 (including tax & fees). I would recommend sitting lower than row P because I couldn't see both screens just one on the right side due to a high wall divider. Might not be a big deal to some but I'm weird and wanted to look both ways. The skits during each song had a meaningful story & made you reflect on that time period. The strawberry fields 32oz drink $24 from the bar was strong and hit the spot. The photos as you walk in will remain cherished for years to come $45, so buy them! Oh and don't forget to stop by the gift shop. Bought two quality t-shirts $60. I would definitely see the show again. Spending quality time & making memories with your teenager....priceless!! OXOXO
