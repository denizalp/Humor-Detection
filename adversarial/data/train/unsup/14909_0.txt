Oh Fiamma will you marry me??? Just promise to cook for us every day!! What a gem this place is, so cozy and quaint. From the homemade pesto, sorbet between courses, waiters that can barely speak English... The calamari app was so unusual with avocado (we got it sauteed instead of deep fried and it was so delish!) I had the pasta with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes and my friend got the fettuccine with mushrooms...Unreal meal. So full at the end of the meal we could not eat dessert but they brought us some complimentary homemade limoncello already cant wait to go back!!!
