One instead of telling me she couldn't do it she did exactly what I did not want. Customer service is so lost now a days then expected a tip after I TOLD YOU WHAT I WANTED.( For a overlay) I will never come here again and it sad cause my toes are cute just super disappointed she didn't round them out like I want it was awful if I wasent in a rush I would of went but out of respect of someone bringing me here I just will. NEVER EVER  go here. LIKE OH HURRY UP AND GET OUT I hate that this is literally the worst manicure I think I'm cry
