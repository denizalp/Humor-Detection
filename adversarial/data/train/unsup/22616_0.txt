Warnings: \n1. OEB only accepts cash or debit\n2. You need to download an app called NoWait and get in a weird virtual line that has a very inaccurate time estimate (don't be afraid if it says 3 hours, it is not actually going to be that long) \n3. You will want to eat everything on the menu because it is all so delicious!! I usually go with their famous breakfast poutine, which is an amazing concoction of crispy fried potatoes, poached eggs, creamy hollandaise, and various toppings. This past time I got the truffled butternut squash with poached eggs and it was sooo good and now creates a great dilemma for me about whether or not to keep getting their poutine or try the rest of their menu. Their coffee drinks have also never disappointed. I also love that they source their eggs from their own egg farm and the eggs are free range. OEB is one of my favorite brunch places in Calgary and more than worth trying out!
