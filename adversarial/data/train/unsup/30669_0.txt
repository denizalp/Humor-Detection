I can't give this company any stars.  They are THE WORST, no attempt to find your address.  The customer service staff say all the right things, but i had to call 5 days in a row, give the same directions 5 DAYS IN A ROW before some illiterate driver who couldn't be bothered, delivered my package.  The excuse: couldn't find my address using Google Maps...however, they did verify it was a legitimate address with the postal service, so why didn't their terminal manager call my city offices and ask them the cross street?  Or ask the post office what the cross street was...so I ordered from the same company again several months later, thinking that they would have entered my address into their computer....no. I have now called 3 days in a row, given again the same delivery instructions, asked twice to speak to a manager and yet no package.  Maybe tomorrow.  I won't buy from a company who uses OnTrac for their delivery
