Once I woke up from my nap, I quite enjoyed this show. And then I went back to sleep.\n\nYes, this is a tale of two shows. I hate to say it, but I found myself getting pretty bored during the first 20 or so minutes. I was actually falling asleep. I guess I'm just not connected enough to the b-boy world. It's not that I don't appreciate what they do. Maybe I just feel like I've seen it all before somewhere.\n\nBut that all changed once they busted out Beyonc√©'s \"Single Ladies.\" That woke me up in a heartbeat. The show is pretty funny overall, but from that point on, it was just hysterical. The whole Sebastian \"Kiss The Girl\" routine had me cracking up and all the ladies sighing a collective, \"Aww!\"\n\nClearly, the part I enjoyed most was the seemingly non-stop stretch where they play pop and hip hop and new jack swing classics that I instantaneously recognized. Everything from BBD to NKOTB.\n\nBut then the show managed to lull me back to sleep.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm still a fan. I had a great time and it was a lot funnier than I expected it to be. If you're a fan of music and dance, you'll love it.
