The line is never ending and the place gets RIDONKULOUSLY packed!!! I go at 9 usually just to get stamped that way I can leave and come back.\n\nMain dance floor is quite small and you do feel like cattle. The bouncers push you around and are quite rude.\n\nSo why is this place so special???\n\nFUNKTION-ONE sound system, IT WILL MOVE YOUR INSIDES!!! Including your bowels, so make sure you take care of business before the club. The sound is so powerful that I started to bring ear plugs just for this club because sometimes I feel like my ears are just going to blow at any given time.\n\nThe other reason, THE TALENT!!! Bajeebus, if you are an EDM freak, this is the place to be. Resident DJs are Kaskade, Above & Beyond, Dirty South, Markus Schulz, etc. This place attracts them all, so get your Untz Untz on!\n\nAlso the stage is pretty ridiculous too, the dancers dress in the most outrageous costumes. This girl once shot fireworks out of her bra (think Austin Powers femme bot).\n\nI've been to this club 4 times in the last two months and plenty more scheduled and I live in L.A. This is now the Mecca for EDM in U.S.!!!
