Men's bathroom attendant with cologne and buggle gum in a sports bar?  Really?  Yes, they do have one on occasion, and he takes all of the paper towels so you're forced to receive one from him after washing your hands in the restroom.  \n\nThis is a sports bar that has virtually nothing to do with being an Irish bar other than it's name.  Food is inconsistent, service is usually atrocious but understandable - they hire cute girls in skimpy clothing.  If you want the eye candy but poor service then this is your place.  A lot of broken glass in the parking lot and the place can get very noisy on weekends.
