I was hankering for some Korean food and came across this restaurant. So glad that I did because everything was excellent. My boyfriend got the sushi bento and I got the Korean spicy chicken bento. The portions were huge and there was a variety of sides included.  My sides were tempura shrimp, a gyoza, radish, salad, bean sprouts with spinach, and rice. We also got miso soup before our meal, but I'm not sure if it was included or they were being generous. They were definitely generous here with food. My boyfriend got extra pieces of sushi and we both got to try the hibachi steak. Everything was impressive and the staff was super nice. They also have wifi here, which is always a plus. I'll be back to try the bibimbap and ramen.
