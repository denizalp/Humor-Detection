This is the reason I love Groupon. It takes me to places that I would normally never go to, or give a reason to go to. Ninja Teriyaki completely surprised me, you can even say in a pleasant way.\n\nSo, this spot is located over on the east side near the Donut Hut, and around that area. Walking in, this place reminded me of hole in the wall joints that I am particularly fond of. After ordering, I sat down at the bar and awaited my order.\n\nFirst, the chef was kind enough to give me a glass of water to sip on. I really appreciated that. Shortly after, my food had arrived. I ordered a side of Hijiki, which came first. It was a marinated black seaweed dish that had other vegetables tossed inside of it. I liked it, it had a real clean taste, and the seaweed was fresh. I enjoyed the simplicity of it.\n\nThen the bento came up. The California roll was good. The crab was fresh and the rice was cooked correctly, so I appreciated that. The chicken teriyaki wasn't too sweet, and the chicken was tender and not overcooked. The mac salad wasn't overdressed and the macaroni was cooked to al dente. And finally, the tempura'd items, the mash potato and shrimp, were also very enjoyable as well.\n\nOn my next visit, I ordered the chicken katsu combo and the veggie egg rolls. Let me go on record by saying this, Ninja might have some of the best veggie egg rolls in town. The filling was amazing. As for the chicken katsu, the chicken was moist and tender, and the crust wasn't too thick, but was still crispy. Once again, the rice was cooked perfectly, and the side salad was a nice touch.\n\nI wanted to give it 5 stars, especially due to the great value for the quality of food, but I don't like how some business' handle Groupon. I mean, if I have 10 dollars worth of Groupon bucks, and my total comes up to 9.99 before tax, like... just let it go. I think that this will be a big reason why I won't come back here. Even though the food was great.. I just don't fly like that.
