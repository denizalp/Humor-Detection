The worst part of my personal experience here is the lack of any speed concerning checking out customers. 5:30 pm on a Friday with 4 lines open. 11 employees in sight and no one opens another line or assists the cashier with bagging.\n\nI blame the managers who are not addressing this. When this store opened it rivaled any other store. WHAT HAPPENED???  I actually drove past other stores to come here (Shakesphere and Centre Ave Market Dristict) today. \n\nTo the OWNER: please do something.
