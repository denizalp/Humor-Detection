I never thought I would want to arrive earlier than necessary at an airport... to eat!  Well, now that Sauce is open in PHX Sky Harbor, I make it a point to show up extra early for my flights.\n\nFriendly staff and quick, efficient service make Sauce an oasis in the middle of traditionally less than stellar dining options at the airport.  The whole process couldn't be easier - order at the register, take your number and grab a seat.  I like the long high top tables - great for airport people watching.  In less time than it takes to connect to the airport WiFi, your food will be ready.\n\nI have yet to venture farther into the menu than pizza, because I am perfectly happy with that.  A thin crust pizza paired with a generous glass of wine is a nice pre-travel treat, in my opinion.  And, doesn't that glass of wine make the whole security checkpoint process that much more tolerable?  :)
