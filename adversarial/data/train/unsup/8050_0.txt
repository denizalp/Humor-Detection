Brew Tea Bar is one of the newest and hottest boba shop in Vegas right now. With all the hype on yelp and my friends raving about this place, I immediately jumped on it like a fat kid on a cake. After giving this place few more visits, my verdict is: it's not that great.\n\nSERVICE\nService is consistently amazing here. Dennis, Sou and Louis really goes the extra mile to make sure you are happy with your drinks. It is nice to know that customer satisfaction is their number one priority. Two thumbs up for their service.\n\nDRINK\nWhen you are handed a drink personally, they tell you to let them know if you need any adjustments. Even though their willingness to adjust your drink is appreciated, I find that drinks are not that great when you have to keep making adjustments. Or when they offer many options and varieties of drinks but you only like one drink. \n\nI have tried their oolong latte, jasmine milk tea, hokkaido milk tea, cantaloupe milk tea, sunset on the beach slush and black tea latte so far. Out of all the drinks I did get to try, I only ever liked and will only order their jasmine milk tea which is sad to say. Their drinks just never really blows my mind like every other reviewers says. \n\nToo picky? Possibly. It's all a personal preference? True. But all the high praise and rave about this place is ridiculous to me. It's overrated. \n\nLet's talk about boba. Boba is inconsistent. It's on the softer side, sometimes too soft and mushy. They use longan honey for their boba which is nice, but can get too sweet. Honey from boba will dissolve in drink. Perhaps asking them to rinse the boba is a good choice. \n\nCONCLUSION\nPersonally after trying +5 drinks, I can safely say this place isn't really my cup of tea.
