My beautiful Thousand Dollar iPhone X was giving me software issues so I panicked and came here...to the Apple Store.\n\nThe store was truly as beautiful as my iPhone X.  This location was well lit.  The colour and amount of light and the balance in the store was near perfect, it could fool most eyes in making everything in there look flawless and beautiful.  I bet I looked a perfect 10 when I was in there!  Excellent job Apple.  \nEver wonder why the phones and tablets look so great in there? Now you know why.. the lighting...\n\nThe service was a little slow due to all the customers, I had to wait about 20 minutes before someone helped me, but when they got to me, they fixed everything in a snap and they made sure no other issues would arise. \n\nOverall a great Apple Store and a great experience, I'll definitely be back if trouble arises again.
