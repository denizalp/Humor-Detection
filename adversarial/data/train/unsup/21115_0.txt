I'm no restaurateur, so this review is strictly based on a consumer's point of view. When putting on different events around town, I'm sometimes faced with the challenge of purchasing some pretty unique items such as an alcohol pour, chef hats and more. And every time I'm faced with a unique purchase situation, I wonder... \"Where the heck am I going to find this?\" And then...the clouds aligned and I found Andrews Restaurant Supply. \n\nThis store is like a chef's dream. At least an amateur cook who likes to call herself a chef (me!). I walk in and I see easels, I see pop corn machines, I see professional knife sets, I set freezers, I see chef supplies...there's so much to look at it's almost over whelming! I know this is a store for restaurants, but is it a crime for little old me to shop there too because I want to! Every time I've visited Andrews, they've always had what I was looking for. The tools at this place make me want to cook twice as much as I already do! \n\nIn addition to amazing restaurant supplies,  the staff is very friendly and I learned that Andrews is the only locally owned restaurant supply store in Phoenix. And you know how we on yelp love to support local! So regardless of the drive, Andrews has made a customer out of me. And if my kitchen is fully stocked with professional tools here soon, I only have Andrews to blame.
