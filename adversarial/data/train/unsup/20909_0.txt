Me and my boyfriend went bowling one night and when we got there we stood in line, then when it was our turn, the cashier name Ana started flirting with my boyfriend! I thought it VERY unprofessional and VERY disrespectful! I advise all girls to keep an eye on her, she is so thirsty! The next time she does this again, her and her manager will hear an ear full!!!
