The origins of the Tohono O'Odham people are a matter of debate. Some believe they are descendants of the ancient Hohokam, whose presence in the Phoenix area dates back to the 3rd century AD. Others claim they migrated northward from Mexico three centuries ago. Their modern-day nation with its modern-day political boundaries is in southern Arizona, close to Tucson. And some of its citizens have opened up this totally awesome little shack on 7th Avenue for the rest of us to enjoy. \n\nLast summer I took a road\/bike trip through the Navajo Nation in northeastern Arizona, and first discovered the joys of something called \"Navajo Tacos\". I actually stopped at a hut, if you can even call it that (it was basically some boards held together by rope) less than a mile south of the Utah-Arizona border in the middle of nowhere. A cute, old, wrinkled Navajo lady made it for me and the very thought of it now makes my mouth water. I couldn't believe that this beautiful invention, which is so truly unique to Arizona, was something I'd never tried before. I was also sad, as I drove away, that I could only get it again by making the 4-hour trek to the Navajo Nation. \n\nI have no idea if a Tohono O'Odham Taco is the exact same thing as a Navajo Taco. At the risk of offending anyone, I will assume it is not. But let's just say that the Tohono O'Odham Taco does the same thing for me as the Navajo Taco did that sunny July day by the Utah border.
