Really cool little bar inside the Luxor.  Spent a good amount of time here on a crazy, busy Friday night.  I like the way they serve their drinks all fancy like.  I'm kind of a \"no frills type of girl\" for the most part but I thought that was pretty cool.   Even my beer arrived all pretty along with an unexpected shot of JD.  \n  \n  There's seating at the bar or the few tables surrounding the outer area if they're open. \n\n  It's at the perfect location because everything my crew was involved in was within the same area and it was super convenient to hang out at, instead of hovering around waiting on people. \n\nIt's small and more updated than some of the other larger, old school type bars that are in the lobby.  This one was my favorite.
