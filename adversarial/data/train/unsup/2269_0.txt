A Jewish girl walks into a (oh, wait, I am writing a restaurant review and not a J.A.P. joke)....\n\nWhen Scott's first opened many years ago, it was really good and had a lot more competition than it does now. In those days, there was Katz Deli, several Miracle Mile locations, Chompie's and a few other ill fated places (anyone remember Hollywood Deli?). I currently live in one of the best food meccas of the West Coast and can't get really good Jewish deli (Saul's is not great folks, and no, I have not tried Miller's yet). \n\nWhen Mom and Grandma picked me up from the airport, I had suggested we stop at Scott's to give them a try on the way to Sun City. None of us had been there in several years and I was really excited at a prospect for a delicious hot pastrami sandwich on rye. We got there, walked in and I noticed that the place itself looked a bit run down and dare I say, a little dirty? The owners are the same but the guy behind the counter who used to be friendly and Hamish just sat there like a schlub. We were directed to a table, and I immediately noticed how large their menu was. I ordered my sandwich sadly assuming that my regular hot pastrami would be (a) HOT and (b) on Karsh's rye since Karsh's is right next door. Neither was the case when my sandwich arrived and the pastrami was not delicious and I asked the waitress if I was mistakenly given the \"lean\" type of pastrami and she said I was not. Mom had a tongue sandwich and thought it was \"okay\" but she is not as picky (bitchy) as I am and Grandma had blintzes which did not look homemade but that of the frozen variety (I hope I am wrong here). Service was fair. Not warm and not quite the NY attitude that passes in these types of establishments.\n\nAfter our experience I will no longer suggest Scott's and will have them drive directly to Chompie's.
