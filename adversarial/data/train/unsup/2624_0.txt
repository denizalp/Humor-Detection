Had a great meal, the Carnivori is a delicious meaty pizza and is my new favorite.  This is a very nice little place that I'll drive across town to enjoy again.  Had never been here before and only found it because we searched for pizza near the Rhythm Room.  I live in Gilbert but I'm def coming back.  The owner came and talked with us for a bit and she's passionate about all her home made food.  Thanks Patricia!
