This is a pretty cool place, with sand...and water... and, well that's it really. The pool is tiny, and the state of the sand makes me wonder how clean it is. I mean, do they change sand every now and then to make sure there isn't any disease festering in it? Not only that, but when you walk down any of the walkways it is always covered in sand- which makes for less than ideal footing. I slipped a few times and my mom almost fell over at one point. And the lazy river is tiiiinnnyyyyyy, so very very small, more like a creek. Like, a dozen people can fit in it. Kinda.
