Decent little white tablecloth meal, and though I didn't have any real complaints about the food, it is obvious that the service was lacking.  I'm talking about the basics - water or softdrink being empty for 5 mins or so, long delay after meal before dessert, and identical entrees at the same table having items or lacking items that are on the other person's plate.  Why?  Did you run out of rolls and just give the last roll to the one person at the same table, and figure the other guy is SOL?  Why?
