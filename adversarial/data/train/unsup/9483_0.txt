This is our third New Year Eve here at CWMB.\n\nOur experience was less then pleasurable due to the fact that we were seated right in line with a cold attic blast from the front door. ( The temperature outside was 14 fegrees\/-4 degree wind chill.)\n\nWhen asked to be seated at another table, we were told ( in a less than half full restaurant) none where available.\n\nI had to place my coat in my lap\/over my chest to block the frigid air from the door.\n\nI am 66 years old. I have both rheumatoid and ostoarthsis. Sitting in the cold draft...was less than pleasurable. Therefore, cutting our leisurely New Years Dinner short.
