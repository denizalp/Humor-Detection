Oh man...came here on a Friday night (around 11pm) a few weeks ago looking to scope out my new neighborhood and fml.\n\nI walked in with my bf, looked around to the two guys playing the guitar and singing some folky crap, looked at the bar filled with sloppy looking people in what looked like their \"I ran errands all day but didn't have time to change into a clean shirt and jeans\" attire, looked at my boyfriend, laughed, and walked the eff out of there.\n\nI've set my expectations for AZ pretty low coming from the Bay, but this was YIKES.\n\nI'm being generous with two stars because this place could be okay for their food and maybe a happy hour, but good lawd after 8pm I'd go running the other direction.\n\nBlehhhh.
