Well, call me a fan. A super-caffeinated, stuffed-with-oatmeal-pancakes fan. \n\nAin't nothin' \"square\" about this place, totally hip to the groove! (Greg Brady voice) \n\nSquare Cafe was on point in every regard. My colleague (the one and only Rachel C, pancake master) arrived around 930 and were quickly equipped with waters and appropriate hot beverages. My coffee (which I needed desperately) was refilled graciously and often. We ordered up the lovely oatmeal pancakes, tricking ourselves into thinking they were \"healthy.\" Maybe slightly moreso than say...Snickers Bar pancakes, but these bad boys were very decadent, topped with mucho butter and pecans and peaches. I mean, really? REALLY!\n\nWe also split the Ranchero Omelette for some protein, which was fluffy, full of cheese and flavorful. Only complaint was homemade salsa was a bit runny, and wet eggs ick me out. Still though, I persevered. \n\nI loved it so much I hung out an hour after breakfast at a table outside sipping a half chai\/half coffee at a sweet sunny spot. \n\nThen I left FLYING. Whatever is in that coffee...works. Whew. \n\nService, food, ambience all exceptional. Great breakfast\/brunch\/lunch places.
