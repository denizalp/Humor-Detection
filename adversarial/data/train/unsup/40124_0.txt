I love the sushi here! It is fresh and never takes a long time to get to the table. \nIt is also nice because they offer a full chinese menu in case you have friends who aren't fans of sushi. The atmosphere is very cool, yet still appropriate for families.\n\nI will say however, that the service is slow. The servers don't talk very much and aren't the friendliest people in the world. However, my drinks always stay filled to the rim which I always find to be a major plus..\n\nOne time I went here for dinner with my fianc√©, and my server disappeared for about 15 mins. Although the other girl came by to ask if everything was ok, I was disturbed when our server came back smelling like pure cigarette smoke. . which is very unappetizing and unprofessional in my opinion.
