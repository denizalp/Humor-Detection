I grew up eating Portuguese chicken from Mario's BBQ. My parents used to pick this up all the time from its previous location just east of Hurontario and Dundas, and I can say that, despite the move, for the most part, the experience still stands the test of time - portions are still very large, and the hot sauce slathered all over the chicken is still unbelievably delicious.\n\nNote that the chicken is most likely oilier than you're used to. The chicken is coated in both hot sauce and oil, but it's super flavourful. The skin isn't overtly crispy (it's soaked in sauce, after all), but overall, very delicious. The chicken is definitely the standout; the fried rice is usually pretty average (but tastes great with hot sauce all over it - can you tell I love my hot sauce?) and the potatoes can sometimes be a little bland. But, when eaten together, everything melds together very well, especially when the sauce from the chicken drizzles over everything else - their hot sauce is magic. \n\nOn our last visit, for two people, we ordered the \"family special\" that includes a whole chicken, a medium tray stuffed with fried rice, and a medium tray stuffed with potatoes, for a little over $20. Great value and portion size - we had enough for dinner the next day!
