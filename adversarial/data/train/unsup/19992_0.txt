I am not one to give any company 5 star rating as there is no company that is perfect, that said when i was searching for a organic natural latex mattress i found a great deal of discrepancy in prices from retailer  to retailer, although the natural latex mattresses can not be shopped from your typical Mattress store it seems to be more of a specialized product carried by few and there prices can vary widely. \nthat said we came across Naturelle organic beds and can say \"we are very happy with the service we received but more importantly there product, the organic beds are as other manufacturers but naturelle has something about there products that stand out, \"there prices are the best\" the reason i was given was they are the manufacturer selling direct to the public allowing them to pass on the savings, they also made a point to mention there MSRP is lower than others as mattress suggested list prices seem to be inflated in the industry.\nin closing i found naturelle organic beds staff to be very honest and passionate about there beds this was the factor that made us purchase from them and we are happy we did. sleeping well is something you just can put a price on.\nNaturelle is a 4 Stars rating
