Cool decor and slide show with excellent pictures of Sammy Hagar.  Unfortunately, this is where it ends.\n\nOrdered the burger melt and a draft.  Beer was fine, burger lacked tremendously.  Biggest shocker was the bill - $10.59 for a draft?  I thought it was an error but it wasn't.\n\nIf you don't expect much, then you'll be okay.
