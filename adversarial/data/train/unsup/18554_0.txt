I've been here for both the industry Thursday nights, and for actual dinner on a random weeknight. \n\nTuesdays and Thursdays makes this place a bit of a watering hole for Bay street suits. And by watering hole, I mean alkiehawling hole. From 5-8, there's $5 wine, $4 draft beer and $3 mixed drinks! Not too shabby. If you're in the Financial industry, you might want to snazz up a little bit, because you're guaranteed to run into SOMEONE you weren't expecting....a high school not-really-friend, business school rivals, that person you couldn't beat on the debate team way back when. You know. Just random people! Gets old quick though.\n\nAll in all, Thursdays are fun and make for an affordable way to get from 0 to drunk before 8pm. \n\nFor dinner, I came on a Thursday night as well, just to see how the dining experience is affected by the rowdy financiers. Not bad, actually! I mean, I look through the glass and it looks like a zoo in Suits, but the noise control is decent!\n\nI tried the Lobster Ravioli ($18) and threw in $10 to make it a main. When it came, I was severely underwhelmed. AND I bit into a rather large lobster shell....Nope. Asked the server to replace the dish with another entree altogether, because I lost confidence in it. Replaced my entree with the Beef Tournado au Poivre and this was a great dish! Not know what a \"Tournado\" was, I had few expectations, but it said \"caramelized onions\" and hey! I love me some caramelized onions! This dish was a winner. \n\nService was perfectly fine. The server very graciously replaced my dish. But that's probably because I picked a more expensive option, hmmmmm!?\n\nSo. Dining would be a 3 star thanks to the shell, but industry nights would be a 3.5.
