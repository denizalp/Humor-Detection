From the second I walked in, this place was weird. From an awkward greeting at the door, to half the restaurant being filled with an art class of women painting kindergarten-quality sunsets at the behest of a loud patronizing instructor, to hot sauces being served in a rubber shoe on the table (what?), to an awkward server who came back several times to answer questions we didn't ask (he came back once to tell us the size of the tortillas), we ordered despite our instincts telling us to run far far away. We had an assortment of tacos including the specials of the day and regular menu fare but all of the meats were dry and under seasoned, and the tortillas were super greasy. The staff were friendly despite their awkwardness and they accommodated our noisy baby which we always appreciate, but it wasn't enough to merit another visit.
