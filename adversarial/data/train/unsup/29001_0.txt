First off Nikole was extremely sweet and patient while answering all my questions and booking my appointment over yelp. I was paired with Kyle and I am SO HAPPY I was. I went in looking for a nice sandy blonde with highlights and he beyond delivered. I don't trust anyone with my hair and now I will be a loyal follower of Kyle. He really listens to what you want and does a great consultation. Absolutely recommend him and the salon. The only down fall is it is expensive but it is beyond worth it!
