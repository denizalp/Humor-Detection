This is the worst most unorganized slowest CVS I have ever dealt with. Every time you come to pick up a prescription they act as if you've never called it in or it isn't there and then when they look for it they find it that is if you're lucky enough to get your prescription otherwise you call it in 3 days ahead of time only to find when you come to pick it up that it isn't ready and they didn't bother to call you that additional information was needed. This particular visit I set in the Drive-Thru for at least 14 minutes. If the car is taking that long shouldn't they asked them to come inside? CVS at 44th Street and Bell please get your act together!
