With some of the most spectacular strip views of any restaurant around here, I always expect so much more from this place. I love the ambiance. The space is inviting for small and intimate parties or big groups. I've been here with large birthday parties and for romantic date nights. The large windows in the back that overlook the strip are the perfect spot for a romantic dinner, and we've even seen an engagement happen there! The employees are friendly and the service is decent enough. But the food isn't consistent and I often wonder if the ravioli are fresh or frozen. It's been cold multiple times that I've gotten it. For these prices, which would be reasonable for a much higher end locale and a much more palatable experience, the ravioli just doesn't live up to my standards. And bread in a paper bag? This would be charming at, let's say, Pizza Rock, but here, it just seems out of place. This is one of my favorite locations to celebrate because of the views, ambiance and proximity to my house. But it just isn't my favorite dining experience.
