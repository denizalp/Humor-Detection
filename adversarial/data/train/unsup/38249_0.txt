Had the Creole Breakfast. The black beans were best I have ever had. The eggs and meat were bland and pork was only lukewarm. Not sure how you are supposed to eat the dehydrated shredded cheese. It didn't mix well with the meat or eggs and didn't taste much by themselves. Execution is a whole new subject. Our plates arrived at different times, not together when they did finally arrive. I asked for a water refill twice before getting it on the third request. The place was only a third full so I worry how they would handle it if they got busy. This was a rwo star experience for the wife and I but wish them the best in a location that has a new restaurant open and fail every year or two.
