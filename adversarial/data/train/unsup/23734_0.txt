Yummy spot. \n\nWent here with the in-laws after some golf. The hot & sour soup is delicious, as is their sweet & sour combo and chicken lo mein. \n\nMy only \"complaint\" is that the chicken lo mein noodles were spaghetti size and I was really looking for the wide fat egg noodles (chow fun, I guess)...this is most likely an error on my part because I had a hard time hearing the waitress's response to my question and was going by body language and hand gestures.\n\nNo matter, it was delicious anyway, the prices are awesome (check out the combo meals) and their iced tea is VERY good and freshly brewed.
