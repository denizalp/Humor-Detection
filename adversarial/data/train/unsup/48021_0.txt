headed back to NYNY because my future father-in-law was craving lox and had fond memories of Greenberg's.\n\nfirst, they ran out of bagels. it was 11:30 in the morning. how does a deli run out of bagels?? I had a turkey club that was pretty sub-par. the bacon was all fat. even though it was a counter restaurant the service was pretty bad. too many good delis in Vegas to bother.
