The wait was 15 minutes long..... we waited with no problem.\n\nWe were seated and later greeted by our waitress. \nI asked for water with lemon, and a spicy cilantro margarita.\nMy guy ordered a Stella.\n\nOur drinks took at least ten minutes to come.\n\nThe margarita was awesome.... Worth the wait.\nPossibly the best margarita that I have ever had.\nHowever, the Stella was lacking a little...and not as cold as it should have been.\n\nOne thing that really WOW'd me, was that they have a \"baby\" plate. \nThat I had never seen before, or heard of at any other restaurant. \nAnd it's complimentary! \n\nIt comes to the table, covered in saran wrap,  with a stick of cheddar cheese, a slice of turkey, apple sauce, and mini orange slices. \n\nGourmet, no. But very thoughtful. It kept her busy.\n\nWe ordered a BBQ chicken pizza as an appetizer, along with the shrimp with cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and slathered in BBQ sauce.\n\nThe pizza comes out, and it is the wrong size. That gets sent back.\nThe shrimp were quite good. I would have liked more cream cheese, and they could have gone a little easier on the BBQ sauce. \n\nMy water was almost gone... Our waitress walked by us at least four times, and didn't refill it.\n\noh, and did I mention that I was the only one at the table that got water.......? \n\nWhen customers are drinking, aren't you suppose to supply water..? Or do these people not watch Bar Rescue.?\n\nOne water between the two of us was kind of lame. Between our waitress and the supervisor, they both said that they were \"getting our drinks\" 3 different times... \n\nGeez. THANK GOD IS WASN'T SUMMER.\n\nWe both ordered another round.\nMy margarita was again, awesome. However, the Stella this time was flat and gross.. The supervisor took it away.\n\nThe right size pizza comes out, and we munch on that. It was good, like better than Metro Pizza good. Happy with that. \n\nStill waiting for water refills.\n\nI ordered the Frisco burger, on grilled sourdough, with thousand island and fires.\nMy guy ordered the beef ribs with fried Mac and cheese.\n\nWhen our food finally arrives, I take a bite. Salty.\nI take a drink of my water (waiting for ice cubes to melt, at this point).\nI take a second bite to make sure that I'm not too loopy.... Still salty.\nI pass it off to my guy (who loves salt) to try it. He thinks it's salty too. \n\nUGH. The fries were good though. Best fries ever.\nA bite is taken out of the fried mac and cheese, and it's not hot.\n\nI finally am able to flag down our waitress, and we let her know about the unsatisfying food. We take dessert (red velvet cupcakes) to go.\n\nThis was probably the longest dinner experience I have ever had in my life.\n\nThe check comes, and even with my over salty burger and the flat, warm beer taken off, our bill is $93. \n\nYes, $93. My guy thought I was joking.\n\nRed velvet cupcakes are Ok. Nothing Bundt Cakes has waayy better Red Velvet.\n\nStick to just drinks and appetizers here. Nothing else is worth it.
