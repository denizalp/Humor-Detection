You would think finding a dependable Chinese restaurant would be easy. It's not! I used to work by here and LOVE their lunch specials. Plus they are super speedy. Yummy food and reasonable prices... Sometimes I get off at Wellesley just to pick up grub from here on the way home even if it's out of my way. Mmmmm!
