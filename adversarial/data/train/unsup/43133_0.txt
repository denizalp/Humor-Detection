Went here when my family was in from out of town and was pleasantly surprised with the place.   Very good food ( table had the fried chicken and the burger as well as the brisket sandwich).  My nephew is a VERY picky eater and he was raving about his burger.   The staff are a bit snooty when it comes to the beer though. Not really helpful in helping my folks pick out something simple.   My Dad hated his beer and for the first time ever I witnessed him not finish a drink!  Not sure if they let you sample first...  Service is slow but the food was worth the wait.
