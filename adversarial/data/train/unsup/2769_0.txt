Popeye's is not just for breast men or leg men or even your every day garden variety wing man. They cater to the thigh lovers out there. I ordered a 3 piece thigh combo meal with red beans and rice along with a large drink for $7.64. The meal includes one of those delicious buttery biscuits. The chicken and the red beans and rice hit the spot.\n\nThe a\/c at the place is also just at the right temperature on one of those 112 degree days. I'm definitely including Popeye's in the summer lunch rotation.
