We always go here when in town with our friends because we LOVE the Double Diamond martinis, which is straight vodka which has been infused with fresh pineapple for two weeks. \nThe prices here are bit high, I believe it was $23.00 for my tenderloin and veggie kabobs i ordered this last time, which were tasty, but had a pretty significant flaw. My friend and I both ordered the kabobs, she ordered hers Medium, I unfortunately had to order mine Medium Well because I'm expecting. When our food arrived the server said he had failed to track which plate was which. I was not highly impressed because I told him I was expecting and therefore needed mine to be MW when i ordered. The server said we should cut into our meat and we'd be able to figure it out which was which. It ended up that I had the Medium and my friend the Medium Well, however I not knowing what Medium Well looks like, because I usually get Medium Rare, had no idea. I didn't figure it out until the end of our meal when I looked over at my friends plate and realized she had uneaten cut into pieces of meat that were dark all the way through and and my pieces i had eaten were pink in the middle. She didn't enjoy her dinner, and I ate something that was not healthy for me. I suppose I should of asked the waiter for his opinion after I cut into my beef, but I really think he should have tracked, or marked our plates, since I had stressed the importance of not mixing up the two to begin with. \nI will go to Firebirds again with my friends on our next visit next year when I can actually drink the DD Martinis, but I also plan on saying something to the manager about their lack of tracking preparation.
