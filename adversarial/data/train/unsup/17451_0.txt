Whoa- this place is too fun! You'll feel as though you've traveled back in time for a bit.\nFor those who have not been, you first drive through the entrance and pay per person. VERY affordable pricing of $7.50 per adult. They always have double features too, where you pay one price for TWO movies! Popcorn and candy is available for purchase where you pay for your entrance. Children (5-11) are only $1.25!!! Tuesdays are surprisingly even cheaper.\nThey'll tell you where to pull up and what channel to set your radio to. Try bringing a battery operated radio so that you don't kill your car battery- especially if you are staying for a double feature :-) All movies playing are recent.\nA concession stand is available with more affordable snacks than a regular movie theater, and bathrooms are located there as well.\nThis is the perfect place to come when it's cooler in Vegas. I see people bring lawn chairs to set on the ground, or those with trucks will turn their beds toward the screen. In the winter, bring blankets\/pillows and get cozy! Awesome place for a date night, or family night.
