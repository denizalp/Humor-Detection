I was soooooo excited to try this place after hearing rave reviews about it but boy was I disappointed. My bestie and I shared the cereal milk soft serve with Frosted Flakes b\/c hello?? You can't go wrong with anything cereal-milk because cereal milk is bomb! Well apparently you can.\n\nThe soft serve wasn't smooth, and it was incredibly salty. Somehow, the Frosted Flakes made it even saltier! I thought we had a bad batch but after reading some of these reviews, I realize that's the norm! We literally tossed it after one bite and it was $7. We pretty much paid $7 for a cute Snapchat\/IG story. Thanks I guess.
