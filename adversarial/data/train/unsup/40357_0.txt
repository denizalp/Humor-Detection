Dr. Suba is an awesome psychiatrist! He's very attentive to the patients needs and provides individual treatment accordingly. His office staff is above and beyond! He's very down to earth and extremely personable and approachable. I have been a patient of his for some time and I highly recommend him as a doctor for your mental health needs.
