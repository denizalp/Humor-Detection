Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-um!\n\nI rarely walk the strip in Vegas. I rarely venture out before sunset. LOL. In Vegas.\n\nThis time, awake and surprisingly not hung over, I was able to venture outside of City Center and explore a bit. Met my two bf's for mimosas and a late lunch. \n\nOur server was a super cool SF transplant. She checked on us often and kept the mimosa splits coming! I ordered the hearty chicken pot pie and tried the blackberry\/peach mojito. Refreshing!\n\nWeather was mild and pleasant for Jan but the outdoor patio heaters kept us warm and cozy. 3-4 hours and $100 each later, we were ready to head back to CC and take a pre-party nap. \n\nFood was yummy and filling and I think I'll come back if I visit with kids. This place is a huge dessert themed restaurant so if you have a sweet tooth, the famous Frozen Hot Chocolate is a delicious treat for those chocholics out there!
