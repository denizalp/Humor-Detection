As others have commented, this is a tourist trap because of the extensive advertisements. Location is close enough to be convenient to the strip but far enough that you take a cab or bus and wait.\n\nCustomer service is terrible. For a place that does it every day for 9 hours, they are terrible at estimating wait times. They told us it should be 1-1.5 hours. About 10-15 after we entered (3PM), they no longer allow people to order opportunities to shoot because they are so far behind.\n\nAfter about 1.5 hours in line, about 5-10 people got refunds. Thankfully, despite the sign, they offer refunds because they can't estimate true wait times. Eventually, 3 hours through the line to shoot.\n\nWhy do they have to overcharge so much? Too much overhead. 4 people to interact with before we wait in line - 1. Take our order. 2. Sign waiver. 3. Roll up requested targets. 4. Cashier. Seriously - steps 1-3 could not be combined?\n\nAfter we pay, we are essentially in line as is. Why can they not get more efficient and just tell us that it'll be about an hour and that you can come back at that time? With a small change to their cash register, the system can automatically keep everyone in order by assigning sequential numbers on the receipt.\n\nDefinitely better experiences exist SOMEWHERE ELSE!
