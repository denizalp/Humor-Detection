There are two types of people; those who can get past lackluster service, and those who can't. 5-stars for those who can, and 1-star for those who can't. I must appease the average, and therefore award 3 stars.\n\nThis last weekend I visited The Herb Box for the first time and truly enjoyed the food. I sampled a few different items off of the menu (stole bites from friends) and was impressed with almost everything. My personal favorite was the Brussel Sprout flatbread I had. Very unique and extremely savory. Nobody had any real complaints about the food quality\/quantity\/taste at our table of 12. Compliments to the chef.\n\nI don't need to bash the service, as there are already plenty of 1-star reviews that take care of that, and I agree with most of them. Quote of the night (40 minutes after we ordered and still hadn't seen food yet)...\nFriend: \"Excuse me sir, can we place our order\"\nWaiter: \"You already have ordered\"\nFriend: \"Oh, that was so long ago, I forgot\"\n\nI genuinely enjoyed the food, and am thankful I had a group of friends with me that helped occupy the time while we waited. I may be back, but I won't expect City Hall attentiveness.
