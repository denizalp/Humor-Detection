This is definitely the new choice for Chinese food.  New, clean, and good service.   Cando style is comparable to Vancouver's many Cantonese restaurants.   This would be our choice for neighborhood restaurant.   For those that are not Strip or Chinatown foodie crowd, this is the spot in the upcoming Asian food central on south Rainbow.  Price is above average.   Seafood is on the high side.  I would wait to get on a trip to RIchmond, B.C. to taste the magnificent seafood menu there.  The menu here caters to the different Chinese styles. This variety gives one the urge to pick and choose the style that you may crave at the moment, without driving to different types of restaurants.   This place also has 2 private rooms for special functions and gathering, providing privacy to the patrons.  Will be back to taste the rest of the items on the menu.  \nNote:  Chef -  please add more rice to the congee,  too watery.
