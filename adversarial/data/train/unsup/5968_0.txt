This store will never change and I mean that in a bad way. \n\nLet's start with the good. This location is in the same shopping center as a Target, Kohl's, World Market, and other common stores. The parking lot is huge and easy to access. The inside of the store is clean and well organized. I usually found the items that I needed were well stocked. On my most recent visit I was able to find water and food dishes for my cat that are dishwasher safe. Most stores carry hand wash only so this is huge for me. \n\nFor some time I would come here on my lunch break because the location was convenient for me. The thing that ended my trips were the long check out lines. Either there was a long line or there would be an issue that would make the line take too long. Consistently, there was only one cashier. This past weekend I decided to forgive and forget and run in since I was in the shopping center running other errands. Big mistake, nothing has changed. Even in the middle of the day on a Saturday there was one cashier. Eventually, a second was called, but neither line was going anywhere. The consistently long check out times will keep me away for good.
