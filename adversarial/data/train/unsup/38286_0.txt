Some friends and I ate here Monday night - service was awful.\n\nThree people ordered drinks, two beers and a glass of prosecco. Two glasses of prosecco and one beer came to the table - then it took 15 minutes for the other beer to get there. They weren't busy.\n\nWe all ordered food and it came and it was so so. My husband ordered a dessert, the brownie sundae, which was the saddest thing ever. My souffl√© on the other hand was amazing!\n\nHalf of our dishes got bussed and a waiter never returned to get more drinks. My husband had a soda and had to ask for refills. We never got water refilled.\n\nWe all tipped almost nothing - which is unusual, but this service was terrible. The worst service we have ever had.\n\nConsidering it was almost $35 for two desserts and a soda, we won't be spending our money there next time we are in Vegas.
