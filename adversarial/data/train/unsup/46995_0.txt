No casino for us is a huge plus. We aren't gamblers, and hate cigarette smoke. If you want to gamble it will require a walk or a drive from here but it's entirely do able. \n\nRestaurants:  We didn't try the hotel ones as we brought some food, and met friends for dinner in Henderson. You can walk to Sam Selzers steak house, and perhaps Bahama breeze.  The view from our room on the 15th floor was pretty cool. We saw the approach of a lot of planes into Vegas. \n\nThe regular sized suite is still pretty darn generous in size. I am sure it's larger than any suite hotel I've been in. Full kitchen let us bring food from home (we are 5-6 hours away) and have breakfast in the room at our leisure.   Home coffee.\n\nThe massive bath tub I just want to bring home.  I got some bath salts and was in it every night. There's room for two!\n\nFamilies would love this place as it makes Vegas almost family friendly. (I say almost, because let's face it, when you think Las Vegas, do you think, \"ooh! Let's take our five year old twins!\"\n\nMaid service impressed me greatly. The first day they added a cushy bath rug and noticed what shampoos, etc we used and replaced those.  Little things like this matter. \nFREE valet parking. Seriously.   Great, great staff.  Cookies at night.  VERY quiet. \n\nThis was our second time here and we will be back again!
