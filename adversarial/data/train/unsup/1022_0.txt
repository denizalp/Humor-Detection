This coffee spot is such a great fit for the area.  It's very open and airy with sofas, chairs, bar stools and lots of windows for people watching.  It has a very homey and comfortable feel as some people were working, meeting for coffee or just hanging out.  The baristas were super friendly and carried on conversations as they made drinks for their customers.  I ordered the iced mocha with oat milk and the grit bowl with mushrooms, roasted peppers, and onions.  I sat at the bar and enjoyed my iced mocha while the grit bowl was being made.  The grit bowl was really tasty and I loved the fresh mushrooms and other toppings.  They offer mainly a limited breakfast menu, a few salads and of course coffee and tea.  Check them out if you're in the neighborhood.
