I went there because I read reviews talking about a happy hour with half price rolls. I was there when it opened yesterday, and was seated at the sushi bar immediately. I was given the \"happy hour menu\", and started looking at the prices... $4.75 for a California roll... $9 for their special rolls... I was like \"this is half price?\". I decided to stay, since it was cheaper than a normal night for sushi.\n\nI wish I hadn't... not because of the food... but because of the treatment by the chefs. I ordered a total of 3 hand rolls, 1 special roll, and 2 other rolls. I was hungry, hadn't had lunch, and wanted to treat myself. I handed the first chef my menu. A second chef came in and began conversing with him in Spanish about work. Then the unthinkable happened... they started bad mouthing the fat white guy (me) sitting at the bar in front of them.\n\nThe 2nd chef asked the first: \"Todos?\" (All of it?), to which the other replied \"Si, todos\" (Yes, all of it.). Then the 2nd chef said \"No lo creo\" (I don't believe it).\n\nSo, being the polite guy that I am, I smiled at them and asked them (in English) to give me 1 or 2 rolls at a time. Instead, I get two platters of all of the sushi I ordered.\n\nI said nothing - my waiter continued coming back to check on me. The check came, and I figured I should say something. So I wrote on the ticket: \"Por favor, pregunte a sus camareros para no hablar mal de sus clientes en espanol?\" (Please ask your chefs to not speak badly about your customers in Spanish?). I got up from the bar, and told them \"Gracias por la comida\", and walked away.\n\nNot even 10 minutes after I left, I get a phone call from the owner\/manager. I tell him I am driving, but he wants to keep talking. I apologize and say I will call him back when I get home. I get home, and call him back. He said his chefs never said that, but apologized. He offered me a free dinner if I come back. I might do that, since the food was good. But - you know how when you go to a restaurant and while the food is ok, if the service is great you still walk away and give it a favorable review? Well, this is the opposite. Food is ok, service sucked. -1 star for the chefs.
