Great concept and good tasting pizza. Walking in we didn't know what to expect but seeing the dough in the air and the atmosphere was truly special. You can tell the pizza was good because everyone was smiling. \n\nThe specialty pizza's were a good combination. We had a Tropicalli and the BLT. We asked to have the pizza's cooked extra crispy and that was a great choice. The cheese was good, the sauce was tasty. \n\nOverall it was 800 is a great casual place to take friends who are visiting. The pricing was amazing. Just FYI the hours on Yelp are wrong they close at 10pm Sunday.
