Always a great place to come with friends for watching sports, playing pool, or even for their Wednesday weekly paintnite's. \n\nIf you buy the groupon for paintnite.com, u can come to paintnite for $25. Drink and eat while you paint. Each week there is a designated painting picked out already. Go on paintnite.com to see if you like the painting for that night. The paintings seem to be seasonal. \n\nYou may think the paintings are super hard but they honestly aren't too bad. There's always a teacher that goes step by step during the whole process. If you mess up, it's okay. It's meant to be fun and not too serious. Main part of the event is to drink and have fun. \n\nIf you are ready to eat, I would definitely recommend the Ranch Hand Burger. The onion straws really up the flavor on this one. Pair it with a cold glass of Blue Moon and you're set!
