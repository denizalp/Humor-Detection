Toto, we aren't in Downtown Las Vegas anymore! PKWY Tavern reminds me of Gold Spike. I dub it, \"Gold Spike on the West.\" You step foot in here and it's like whoa, we aren't in DTLV but it sure does have a Gold Spikey vibe to it. \n\nI love Gold Spike so that certainly is not a bad thing. \nNonetheless, I like PKWY Tavern for two main reasons: \n1) It's on the West side :) Ergo, it's more local and closer to my house.\n2) BEER -- SO MUCH BEER. MUCH. SELECTION.\n\nYou can find this located off of 215 and Flamingo next to the LVAC. You can actually see the building as you drive by the freeway, so you really can't miss it. \n\nIts ambience is just like Gold Spike -- casual, fun, quirky, relaxed. Tons of things to keep you busy here including games like jenga and bowling. It has a younger crowd\/vibe going on to keep it lively.\n\nThis place advertises its 250+ selection of beers. Talk about \"all you can drink.\" If you ARE on this side of town and like to frequent bars, I recommend joining their loyalty program. They have rewards for customers that drink x amount of different kinds of beer! And yes, I do mean you can get things like t-shirts and mugs, but I was told that you can get your own personalized party if you are that hardcore!\n\nTheir selection of beers means that there is one for EVERY single person. I like beer, but I LOVE cider. With that said, all you cider lovers should get the raspberry cider! I can't get enough of it.\n\nBesides all that, service here was kind of slow and the bartenders on the inside seemed like they didn't want to be there. Regardless, I did have a great time with my friends here and will be coming back! You just need to bring your patience as the service always seems to be a little on the slow side.
