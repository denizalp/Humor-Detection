This is a pretty good place and very busy. We came in on a week night, I was surprised how really busy it was.  We sat on the Porch, which is just an addition made to look like an old Southern style home.  It is nice. Nice old 50's style furniture. I like it!\n\nI had some Watermelon flavored Ice Tea.  It was truly good. Even had a slice of watermelon with it.  We had green fried tomatoes as an appetizer. So so on that not too good.  Dinner was quite good though. BBQ chicken, some ribs and briskest\nWe had enough to bring home for yet another dinner\nOur server was very good, her name was Allison. She went into a lot of detail about the menu items. I did appreciate that certainly.\n\nDinner was good and the side BBQ sauces are an added plus.
