Excellent tapas selections. Fresh, expertly prepared. Presentation of each plate was impressive. The wine selection made it easy to pair our tapas selections with just the right wine. Jordan, our server, was very professional, knowledgeable and helpful.  This was our first time at the restaurant, and Jordan graciously walked us through the whole evening. The Tahitian Pearl dessert was the perfect way to end an already enjoyable dinner. We will return!
