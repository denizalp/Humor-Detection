First time there and it was great. Had 6 of us and we got seated right away. Love the fact they put out little carafes of salsa two kinds and a huge basket of chips. Yum yum. The service was very good. I had a Montana margarita on the rocks it was very good. I also had their crab and shrimp enchiladas, they were very very good. We all had an excellent time and if they had these in California I would go back for sure.
