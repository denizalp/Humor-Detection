So far, every experience I have had with this place has been a positive one.  The service is pretty good and the food is delicious.   We ordered the tonkatsu special for $20 which included the tonkatsu of course, potato salad, cabbage salad, potato salad, miso soup, sashimi,  cold tofu, tamago, and dessert. We also ordered egg plant, zucchini,  breast with mozzarella,  bacon wrapped enoki,  and bacon wrapped scallop kushiage.\n\nThe tonkatsu was thick and juicy. It's also a good size plus it was cooked perfectly. The salads were salads. I don't have much to say about them.  The miso soup is one of the best ones I've ever had.  It's because it doesn't just consist of tofu and seaweed, it also has vegetables and mushrooms. The sashimi tasted fresh. The cold tofu and tamago was pretty normal.  All the kushiage were cooked perfectly.  Just order what kind you find interesting because all of them will taste good.  I love love love the yuzu sorbet. \n\nDefinitely a place to check out.
