Great bistro food in a cozy Parisian setting.\n\nI love all the French bistros in town and it's all about being transported back to Paris even if just for a few hours. This particular visit was for a business lunch and it was great. \n\nThe service has always been exceptional and the food was great with trying many different things including a large seafood platter which was incredibly fresh. One of my favorite things in the world is cheese and of course the platter was perfect with honey comb! When I spot the honey comb I instantly smile....\nI chose fish on this visit being one of the lightest options, a very mild bass. Everything that was ordered was great and it's a great spot for any reason.
