Came in during happy hour. Ordered the hamachi collar---they didn't have it, got the salmon collar instead, it wasn't bad, salad that comes with was pretty good. Ordered the forbidden rice dish, they brought it out unfinished... It was just the rice.... Asked about it, they brought it back out a bit later finished... It was good, but I don't think it would bring me back. I also ordered an inferno roll to go, not impressed.
