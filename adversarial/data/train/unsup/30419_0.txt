We found this place on a different website. Urbanspoon. It was listed as new and reviewed very well.\nCame here for lunch with Hubbie and the fabulous Shirley Martin. Shirley had chicken tacos with rice and beans, and said it was good, more food the she could eat. Garry had chick a chick a boom boom. He said it was delicious, spicey and made his nose run. I had the light combo. Just right. ( no rice and beans)\nAshton was our waiter and he made us feel very welcome, he was attentive, but not pushy. He clerked on our food and offered us dessert, carefully describing some wonderful selections.\nYou should give them a try.
