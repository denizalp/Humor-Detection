I have always enjoyed the food from this restaurant, I haven't had any orders messed up from here, the service is quick, and it has reasonable prices for the portions.  Although I usually order food to go from here, I have eaten inside a few times, but there isn't a very large seating area.  Everyone I have dealt with here has been very friendly and a pleasure to deal with.  In my opinion, if you are in the area, this place and Galangal are the two best options for the price around.
