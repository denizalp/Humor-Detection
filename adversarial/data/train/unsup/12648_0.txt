Wow.  \n\nIt's Jan 1 and no restaurant is open...except all the restaurants in China town!  The Golden Inn has always been a favorite and the food always fresh.   I shouldn't be surprised how busy this place is but either all of Calgary is clued into the fact that no other restaurants are open or this place is that good.  Maybe a little bit of both?\n\nHere are my notes:\n\nIf you're starving and it's a statutory holiday...yup. \n\nIf you're drunk and it's 1am....bingo!\n\nIf you're lonely and don't have a date...go rent a movie.\n\nGet the Gailan in garlic sauce!
