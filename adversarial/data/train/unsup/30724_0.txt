I purchased a house-load of furniture from Structube earlier this year, and while the furniture itself is nice, the customer service was some of the worst I have ever received. One of the pieces I ordered was backordered (a table), so there was a substantial delay. Nobody's fault. However, I had to call every few weeks to keep tabs on it, and every month or so I was told there was an additional delay of 1-2 months, with no explanation (also: every time I called, I was told that if I had a problem with the delay, I should just go buy a table somewhere else, with no apology). Finally, after 8 months of waiting, I spoke with a manager who realized that the item was actually available, but no one had notified me. Naturally, I was upset and asked for a discount (considering how much I had already spent, and considering that the delay was actually as a result of their incompetence, rather than a legitimate delays), to which I was told that I couldn't have one because it wasn't the store's fault. \n\nI'll NEVER shop here again, even though the furniture is nice and well-priced. I would strongly encourage others to look elsewhere--unless you have the time and energy to be on the phone every few weeks, doing the salesperson's job for them. I can't imagine how terrible the service would be if I had to return an item, and I imagine customers would be left in the dust, just like I was.
