After using the same dentist for 30 years, we opted to choose one closer to home when we moved to the Beaches. \nWe were a little hesitant at first to use this dentist after reading the negative reviews even though the office is located in our building.  \nAfter speaking with neighbours who are very happy with Dr. Bitaraf, we decided to give it a try. \nWe're thrilled, from the friendliness of Dr Bitaraf, her staff, the latest equipment and the excellent service we have received over the past year. \nAt no point have we felt any pressure to have extra work done which we had felt from time to time with our previous dentist. \nOur dental plan has covered all the costs which is important as we are now both retired.
