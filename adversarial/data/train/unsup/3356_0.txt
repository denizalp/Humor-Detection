I don't know if I would ever shop here again after buying a bag of chips for about $12, but it's always fun to stop in and check out all the cool stuff they have.\n\nIf I have the time I actually just take pictures or write notes of the stuff that I like there and try to find it around town for about 50-60% off. Now you might call me a cheapo but I'm not buying some chocolate for $80. Some items are however reasonably priced, check out the espresso bar it looks pretty decent!\n\nDean and Deluca I like you but I just can't afford you. However the quality of the items here is fairly high and there are always yummy samples around the store so it's worth a stop most of the time. My philosophy for shopping here is going to be eat $5 worth of samples before you buy the $10 product that should be priced at $5. Please don't judge me.
