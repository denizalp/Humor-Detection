Churn baby churn! Ice cream lovers, it is imperative you come try this place! Once you take your first lick, the rest is history! You'll immediately taste the trueness of the ingredient being used! Your taste bud will jump in rejoice! Promise!\n\nI tried the Peanut Butter, Toasted Coconut, and Madagascar Vanilla! You have the option to make it into a sandwich or a cone (waffle or pretzel).  Because I'm a sucker for trying new things, I opted for the pretzel! Bad idea! Clashed big time! It seemed like a good idea but failed! However, the sweetness and the saltiness did work, but as I crunched into the pretzel cone it tasted half stale and slightly buttery! That's just me!\n\nThe parking situation is very limited, so you might turn to Valet Parking.  The decor has that old school ice cream parlor feel but in an upscale kind of way.  Seating is scarce inside, but you can find more room in the back patio area.\n\nSeriously, come check it out and happy licking! =)
