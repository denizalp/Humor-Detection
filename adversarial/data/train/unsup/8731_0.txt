This place is right around the corner from my house and I have always wondered about it because there is zero flair to the exterior and it's in the middle of strip mall.\nBut because a friend who loves NY style pizza tried and loved it I decided to take a chance.\n\nThey serve pizza by the slice and true to NY style they are huge thin crust slices that you can fold over to get it in your mouth. If you see someone take a knife and fork to it, smack them. I assume it could only add to their authentic NY experience. THen show them how to eat it properly. Fold nearly in half, insert into mouth.\nIf you don't like pizza, you probably got dragged here with a friend but it's okay. They serve subs and salads too.\nI will definitely be back for a slice or two but hope to also try their Italian subs.
