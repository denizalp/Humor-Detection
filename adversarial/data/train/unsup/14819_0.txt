If I could give this negative stars, I would. My boyfriend brought my shih tzu Scout here for a groom for me with specific instructions on how I wanted her groomed. We had just moved here from Miami, and I usually request that the groomer not touch her ears or tail (which are normally meant to be long for shih thus), trim her face, and cut down her body. I also requested that the groomer not cut her eyelashes because she has long, pretty lashes. Instead, this groomer completely shaved down every single part of my dog TO HER SKIN without ever notifying me. When I came home from work, I cried. I can't believe they never contacted me. \n\nWhen I called to ask them why they had done this, the groomer became very defensive and refused to apologize. He blamed the haircut on my boyfriend, who he said he told he would have to shave some of her neck, and he agreed. That does NOT constitute shaving her entire body, and as the primary contact for the dog, this groomer has shown extreme lack of professionalism by not clarifying with me.\n\nI then spoke with the manager, who told me that my haircut choice was not humane. I have never met a shih tzu that was shaved down like this, and I have seen MANy shih tzus cut the way I requested. I have had shih tzus my entire life, and we have never had an issue getting their hair cut. The manager finally apologized and offered me a refund, but still could offer no explanation why they had not called me. She asked me to come back to maintain my dog, but Scout will never come back there again. I am traumatized.
