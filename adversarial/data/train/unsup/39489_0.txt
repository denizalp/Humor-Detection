We've been Great Buns customers for a few years. Everything we've tried has been excellent. Their prices are reasonable. The staff is very friendly. \n\nThe rye bread is the best, the apple coffee cake is delicious, apple strudel out of this world, brownies, turnovers, white chocolate dinner rolls, French bread, etc etc etc,\n\nThey also fill special orders such as kummelweck rolls, a special sandwich roll, I believe is native to Buffalo NY, for our Sunday football games.
