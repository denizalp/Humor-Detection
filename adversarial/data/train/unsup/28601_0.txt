This place is right across the street from the Monte Carlo.  \n\nPretty decent burger.  The have 4 sizes to choose from and four add-ins (cheese, bacon, chili, and an egge). I opted for everything but the chili and I was quite happy.  This burger is a step up from In-N-Out but still not as good as a Royal Robin Burger.  \n\nThe fries come in two cuts skinny or steak fries.  Nothing too special here. The onion rings were ok.  \n\nThe Maui-banana shake is very good.\n\n3.5 stars\n\nIn n out being 2.5 stars.
