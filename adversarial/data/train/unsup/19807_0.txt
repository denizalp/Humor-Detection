Food was decent, but service was horrible. I know it's not much of a big deal,  but when I went, I ordered my food and a drink. And CLEARLY on the menu it says that the cups are for their soft drinks and their special drinks as well.. (Including Horchata and etc.) so I was just planning to fill my drink with Diet, and then Horchata by the time I would be leaving. I went up (the Horchata was behind the counter) and the lady said she had to charge me $1 extra. And I kept saying that I don't see the extra charge anywhere on the menu.. And all she kept saying was \"I know it's not on the menu, but I still have to charge.\" Like what the hell? Why? There's no official pricing of an up charge, so I refused to pay for it.. And of course like any other horrible employee, she just kept pointing to the phone number on the wall and told me to talk to the manager. No point in wasting my time on an employee's ignorance. Thank goodness there's a Don Tortaco right down the street.. Don't waste your time here.\nAlso, here's a picture clearly stating EVERYTHING is included when purchasing a drink.
