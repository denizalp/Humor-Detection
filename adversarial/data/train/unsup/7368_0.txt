Poor service.\n\nMy bro in law was stabbed so he was admitted here. \n\nThe nurses wouldn't check on him. His catheter was full and they didn't change it until a few hours after we told them. \n\nHe was supposed to have his IV changed out and they didn't to it until the next day. \n\nThe nurses are pretty much bitches.
