My hubby and I loved doing business with this dealership mostly due to our experience with our salesman Calvin \"Chip\" and Sales Trainee Paul!  These guys were the best!  In fact everyone was very nice including Devon and the \"Joes\" in Finance and Crystal (our Genius helper). We got a 2011 328i for me which fulfilled a lifetime dream all because they were able to make a deal that worked for me! We will definitely be coming back to get my hubby an X5. Whether you are in the market for BMW or other type of vehicle these are the guys to see first!
