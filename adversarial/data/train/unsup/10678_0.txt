I'm a girl, and if I'm guilty of anything, it's that I love to shop.\n\nThere are plenty of decent and high-end shops (store listings: http:\/\/www.premiumoutlets.com\/outlets\/store_listing.asp?id=58), but when I go to an outlet, I expect great deals. Unfortunately, the \"deals\" here aren't actually deals. In the few stores that I did walk into (huge crowds are a deterrent), some of the merchandise had zero mark downs, and the ones that were on clearance weren't even steals...despite the long lines that may suggest otherwise. Fighting off annoying kiosks and crazed holiday shoppers is not fun. By the time we circled around, I was hungry and the food court options were far from appetizing. Ugh.\n\nBecause I rarely stay off the strip, coming to this place was quite the drive and not worth the gas. And since it's almost Christmas time, my best piece of advice is to avoid the parking structure because it's very difficult to turn back around to get out after your patience runs dry (I don't understand why drivers decide to park and wait where they're not supposed to park, making those behind him pull dangerous moves to bypass him by driving into a lane where there's oncoming traffic...C'MON!). There's side lots that are easily accessible.
