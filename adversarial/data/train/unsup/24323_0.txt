How is this place still in business? We ordered the seafood stuffed fish and there was NO seafood in the Mrs Cubson's mushy stuffing at all! I looked for the crab, there was none. Not to mention the $15 dinner price doesn't even include salad, really?!?! They have not spent any money on decor or the quality of food for sure, so not sure why they think they can charge more than a chain for tasteless mushy food .
