This restaurant ruined a first meeting between ourselfv3s and my son's future parents-in-law. My wife called early in the week to make a reservation and was told that the restaurant did not take reservations for parties less than 12. So we showed up at 6pm on Saturday night to get a table by 7pm and were told that they could not seat us that night. My wife explained what she had been told and they were just unhelpful-nice job of treating people well. So we were forced to find somewhere in a hurry and an important evening was ruined by these inconsiderate people. I suggest that they train their staff better when answering the phone.
