Hands down the best fried chicken ever!!!! It was so good we came back the next night for dinner again. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles with watermelon, everything was soooo good I've been recommending this restaurant ever since. Did I mention the service??? Talk about southern hospitality... The service was amazing! Most of the time your happy with one good waiter, we had three servers helping us. We never had to ask for a refill on our drinks they were there before we could turn around and we went on a Saturday night so it's not like they weren't busy with other customers.  Yardbird has went to the top of my list of restaurants to eat at in Vegas.
