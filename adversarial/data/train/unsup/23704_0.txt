Gah. \nI'm really torn on the number of stars to give this review.  I think I'm going with 2.5 rounded down. \nLets start with the good:\nService:  Very polite at the concession stand and at the ticket booth.  Smiles, and great customer service. \nThe theater itself was clean.\n\nThe bad: \nThose seats were SO uncomfortable!  Seriously...and I don't even go to the Luxury theater that often, so I know I'm not THAT spoiled.  \nThe bathroom was atrocious.  \nIt was ridiculously cold in there.  This theater and one other, I'm going to have to bring a winter jacket and gloves any time I go there. \n\nNot a big fan, but this also is not on my side of town, so the chances of me heading back anyway are slim...
