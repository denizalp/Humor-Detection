I attended Greg's one week course, which is not for the lazy student, and I had so much fun! Greg's stories all pertain so well to the lesson and really let the information sink in better. This class provides the right amount of hands on practice to ensure you walk in to a new job with experience as a bartender.  I can not stress enough how important it is to study! This class should be treated like a job and seriously.  Put everything on pause while you take this course and enjoy the process! The high stress mimics that of your new profession anyway.  Love Greg and Larry and the way the teach so much. 10 stars if I could.
