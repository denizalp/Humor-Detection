I have been wanting to check out this store at the Vegas outlet for awhile and finally got the chance to shop there on my recent trip to Vegas.  I was not disappointed!  First let me say, I have shopped at FCUK before at the Planet  Hollywood Casino once.  The store was over priced and a shirt was $60 to $100 dollars.  I'm all for paying top dollar for a good looking piece of clothing but seemed too expensive.  However, when I went to the outlet I could not get over the good deals they had.  Everything was pretty much affordable and nothing seemed over priced.  The staff were SUPER friendly!  So friendly,  they followed me around, helped me pick out a couple of shirts and had a dressing room ready for me.  I wasn't sure if they were hard up for a sale or just doing there job giving great customer service.  Needless to say I left with a tee-shirt, dress shirt and a sweater for wifey.  I think all for under $80 bucks.  Whenever my next trip to Vegas will be, this will be one of my stops.  I love wearing clothes that not everyone has, and whenever I wear my sweater with FCUK across my chest, I get all kinds of stares. LOL
