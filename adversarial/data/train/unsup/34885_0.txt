I was in town for work and Cien Agaves was able to accommodate our large group of 25 people. It seemed small on the first floor but really opened up on the second. I really enjoyed the artwork and Spanish themed baseball jerseys in the wall, such a fun vibe. We had an assortment of chips, salsa, guacamole but what really stood out was the queso verde with the pork. Simply fantastic! The house margarita seemed average to me, not too different than any other bar but I didn't try any of the specialized kinds (which I regret). Though everyone else got tacos, I stuck with a steak burrito. Very filling and tasty. For the amount of people our server had to deal with he was fantastic! Easily the best service we received on the trip. I'll be back for spring training at the end of the month and will come back for some lunch before the going to the game.
