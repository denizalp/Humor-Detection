This place was incredibly fun.  Only thing that stinks about it was no double bouncing :(  Fair enough though.  They have to keep things as safe as possible and if you're not with a party, you're in an area that could be filled with kids.  That being said there was still quite a bit of area that you can jump around in and off walls.  \nThe staff was really nice and helpful.  I was going to buy 2 hours worth of jumping but they told me for now, only get at max, 1 hour because I'd be tired?  Well, they were right, after 20 minutes, I was gassed.  I went over to the area where you jump into a pile of foam blocks to slow down and more or less rest.  \nThe power went out when I had 20 minutes of jumping left and immediately the staff told us that we will either get reimbursed or get a voucher that will give us another half hour another time.  They gave us the voucher which is fine because yes, this is quite the workout jumping around so yes I will be back and I hope to also come back with a group next time to get our own area and play some dodge ball.
