Funky space, amazing martinis, kick ass servers and a great space. Loving the lava lamps in the window and the location is perfect, right between St Denis and St Laurent. The dj was really good on the night we were there; she was spinning all kinds of tunes and the music somehow managed to not drown out the possibility of conversation. This is the kind of place that makes me stop, pause and thank baby Jesus that I am lucky enough to live in Montreal.
