Sub Par at best!! I want to know who is giving this place 4.5 stars?!?!\nI saw the fantastic looking burgers all over the lobby at the LINQ, and I really couldn't wait to try this place especially because Guy is known for his culinary excellence (I mean he has his own food show on the food network)\nEVERYTHING fell short at this place and I mean EVERYTHING!!! \n1sr there were tons of seating available yet the hostess made us wait 25 mins ( not that big of a deal maybe they were short staffed)\n2nd we ordered the firecracker shrimp wrapped in bacon and they came sooo dry; they were over cooked and almost tasted burnt\n3rd we ordered the Mac & Cheese burger and the Kobe Burger both were pointed out to us as \"the best burgers on the menu\" by the waitress\nLet me tell you I have had better burgers at In & Out and at a fraction of the price we paid for that meal!!\n4th and final \"nail in the coffin\" was it really wasn't even that busy and the wait staff just seemed overwhelmed \nThis message right here is for Guy (I'm sure he's too busy critiquing other restaurants to read this critique) Guy spend a little less time at other people's restaurants and focus on your own! It's got your name on it, you should take some pride in it and do something about \"famous food that just falls flat\" you have a show going around the country boasting their accomplishments all the while yours in Vegas misses the mark. \nTo be honest I wish I had my $$ back or had gone to In & Out right across the way and saved 79 bucks
