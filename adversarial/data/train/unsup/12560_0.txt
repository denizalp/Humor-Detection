Please stay away from this dealership.  These people are not nice people.  Go to any other dealership but this one.  \nMy father attempted to purchase a 2016 f250. He was helped by Chris Solano a Salesman there.  My father is a nice individual who would never disrespect another human being.  Specially not somebody that is helping him.  These people disrespect him and kicked him out of the property. I called to complain and the salesman stated that he didn't want to follow their car buying process of going in the office and gathering information first.  \nMy dad wanted to look at what he was about to purchase.  The sale a. Also stated that my father disrespected him and began to get angry.  That is a lie. To top it off I'm receiving phone calls from them asking me when will I go in to buy a car.  \nThese are not nice people.  Stay away.
