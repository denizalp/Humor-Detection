So, apparently I'm the Duke of this Wendy's (don't judge me). About once a week I crave the Fire Roasted Breakfast Burrito. It's got a wheat tortilla, eggs, Applewood smoked bacon, salsa...and other deliciousness. If my addiction makes me the Duke, then so be it (I said don't judge me...those burritos are good!).\n\nI don't really eat at Wendy's at any other time of the day, but the morning staff seem pleasant enough. And the place is clean. This is a solid Wendy's location as far as I can tell.
