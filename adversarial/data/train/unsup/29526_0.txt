One of my favorite places to eat in the world! We have been going here for over 20 years and it's food is as amazing as it gets! The service is wonderful, the owners and staff are basically like family to us now. \n\nThe food is to die for. If you want a good place to eat, especially for nice dinners such as birthdays, New Years, graduations, etc., this is the place to go. I recommend trying the tomato soup as well. It's amazing.
