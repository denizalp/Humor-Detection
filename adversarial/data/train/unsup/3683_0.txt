Broken Tooth; Restaurant Denies Help\n\nUPDATE 11\/14\/17:\n\nI received the check today for the cost of the dental repair. Thank you.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE:\nI received a phone call from another adjuster today who states that the claim amount is being mailed by check today. I will further update when the check arrives.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nI am a licensed doctor who does not believe in playing games or duping people.\n\nOn September 12th, 2017, I was eating ceviche at this restaurant and chipped a tooth on a hard object in the food. Another licensed doctor was my witness. The manager witnessed the piece of chipped tooth (which I still have in my possession) and took the incident report. The hard object must have been swallowed in the uncertainty of what was happening, and was not recovered.\n\nI went to a dentist shortly after, and was informed that to correctly restore the tooth, a crown was necessary. I provided that estimate to Paladar's insurance representative.\n\nThroughout the following weeks, I have developed progressive pain and inability to use my right mandibular teeth for masticating.\n\nToday, two months later, I finally received a letter from Liberty Mutual denying any responsibility due to, \"sufficient information.\" I have offered to release the radiographs and photographs to the representative, and they have never been requested; tell me what \"sufficient information\" has been used to make this decision?\n\nAs a medical professional, if I am ever in a position that has my action, lack of action, neglect, or accidental harm as the cause of any injury, I would be forthright and accept responsibility. I would not leave someone in a situation of pain and discomfort and inability to properly repair an injured body part.\n\nPaladar ownership, Pete the manager, and all persons involved in this claim should be ashamed of themselves for not stepping up and handling what is really a very small financial investment in taking care of an injured patron, extending goodwill, and maintaining a positive standing in current and potential patrons. \n\nI am in pain. I'm in pain due to fracturing a tooth on something mixed in my ceviche. For what would really be a small financial investment compared to even daily intake at this restaurant, Paladar could make the right decision to do the right thing. Instead, they have denied my ability to become pain-free and resume the ability to eat normally.\n\nShame on you.
