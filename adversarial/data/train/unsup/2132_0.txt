Love this place.\n\nI came last night with my best friend and in addition to the fabulous company, Saku Sushi again delivered an excellent meal with spot on service. We had the Fried Oysters (one of my new faves) The soft-shell crab, which is done in the same breading as the oysters and may have been a bit much fried food, but was also amazing. Next time I would have one or the other, but the decision would be hard, Dragon roll was huge and absolutely delicious and I had to have some sashimi as their salmon is like buttah! I've fallen out of love with cooked salmon over the past few years, but Saku's salmon sashimi has renewed my love for this fish!\n\nWe stayed until the end yakking and had 2 half litres of wine and my friend began with a sidecar. Our bill was just over $100 and we were satisfied and a little buzzed.\n\nDid I mention that I love this place. I love it.\n\nLove.
