I don't usually visit Roy's in Hawaii because their locations tend to be in shopping centers - not on the ocean. But here in Phoenix, I have found it to be a challenge to get really good, fresh fish and Roy's is my \"go-to\" spot when I am craving something coastal or Hawaiian. Our most recent visit was for an anniversary dinner, but despite reservations.....we were not seated for 1\/2 hour. My husband was told the earliest reservation he could make was for 5:30, but when we arrived we not only waited, but noticed the patio and restaurant was quite busy with customers seated well ahead of us. The fact that this was a rough start was soothed by Roy's always-fantastic food. We split the lobster ravioli as an appetizer, and the restaurant really should put this on the menu as an entree. It was \"ONO\" (Hawaiian for delicious). Speaking of Ono, how could I pass that up as my entree?? I didn't even read the rest of the menu! I went straight for the Ono, and I have no idea what the buerre blanc was, but it was roll-my-eyes-omg wonderful!. I have family members moving here soon, and this will be our special spot for many occasions in the future.
