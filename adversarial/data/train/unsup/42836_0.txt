I went to Carolyn's for the first time recently. I'm so glad I did. I haven't seen my hair look this healthy and good since I was a child. I've dyed my hair for over 20 years. Generally, I get it dyed and have to wait a few days for the color to fade a bit so I like it. This was the first time I can remember in years walking out of a salon and feeling excited about how my hair looked. I usually hate the first day I get my hair done, because of the texture after or the color being too bright since my hair is red. I was pretty amazed after seeing what Carolyn could do. I was ready to go out right away after and was proud of how my hair looked. It was so worth it to take time to find someone this talented. Carolyn is thorough, kind and knows her stuff. I really want to keep coming back to see her. It was so worth it!!!
