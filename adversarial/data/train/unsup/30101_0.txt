Atmosphere: upscale classic; includes blue velvet bank seating in the back. \n\nFood: incredible fusion cuisine. Although portions are small, I was satisfied. I would say it costs ca. $50\/pp to dine. You can tell that a lot of thought has gone into the items offered on their seasonal menu (see attached picture); to note: the mussels on frybread are incredible. On an interesting and impressive not, I found that many of the dishes change in palate as you chew. \n\nOverall: I looking forward to returning; friendly service, upscale dining experience.
