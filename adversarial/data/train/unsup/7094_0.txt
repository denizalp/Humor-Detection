Another Thai Tryst! Thanks To Gabi and Stevey I decided to try this place since you both gave a great review.\n\nI've got the Fever..........I'm craving Red Curry Like a Maniac.......\n\nThat's what I ordered, it's actually called Kang Ped Veggie on their menu, I added Tofu. (see pics)\n\nIt came with a small salad served with a spicy sweet peanut dressing that was actually quite good.\n\nThe Kang Ped arrives steaming hot! Loaded with fresh Veggies like Japanese eggplant, mushroom, zucchini, carrots, peas and bamboo shoots. The Tofu was perfect too!\n\nWhile very delicious the sweet flavor of the coconut was missing, I tasted alot of butter form the veggies being sauteed perhaps and plenty of spice, I just missed the sweetness I'm familiar with.\n\nAgain Generous portions and easy prices with a Tiki Lounge Ambiance and Friendly staff. \nI would come back here again, they have a pretty large menu and it's very descriptive to help out Thai Newbies like myself.\n\nJudging from the sounds coming from the surrounding tables I'd guess they were enjoying there meals as well.
