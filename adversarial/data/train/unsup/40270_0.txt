Since moving to Arizona several years ago, I've been going to Hairloks by Arlette!\nMs. Arlette and Dashonna are AMAZING at what they do!  Whenever you go there, its like visiting your sister or aunt's house!  They are very professional but make you feel at home! Natural Hair Specialists is what I call them!  I LOVE HAIRLOKS BY ARLETTE!!
