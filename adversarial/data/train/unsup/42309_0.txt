Service was great, staff very friendly and courteous, however a little overrated, mind you we all have an opinion. I ordered a side of grilled asparagus and a side of roasted peppers for 3$ each. The asparagus is served chilled with pepper and balsamic vinegar , but grilled first. Luckily I told them I just wanted mine served hot and grilled with olive oil and sea salt only and they were happy to do that. I assumed the roasted peppers consisted of a pepper cut in half, brushed with olive oil, spices\/ sea salt, and then roasted, boy was I disappointed. The peppers were thinly sliced, much thinner then one would see on a vegetable tray. There were 4, maybe 5 red and yellow peppers grilled sitting in a small bowl of oil. There was more oil in the bowl then I would consume in 2 weeks. They would be better off seasoning and basting before grilling and serve an entire pepper cut in half. If you need to raise the price to 3.50$ then do so. They have decent food for the most part, just ask how things are served because it may not be what your expecting. I don't mind paying $ for good food, but the prices sure don't reflect their chief.
