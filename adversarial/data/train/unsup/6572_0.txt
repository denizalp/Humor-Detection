Culinary Dropout used to be my favorite go-to destination in Tempe. I'm not saying the food is that great, it was more because of the personable and accommodating bar staff, great ambience, diversity of clientele, and live music on Friday and Saturday nights. However, on a recent visit, my husband and I experienced a rather unusual and disturbing encounter with Jason the General Manager that I won't soon forget. Call it corporate political-correctness run amok, but the way Jason tried to represent his other patrons at the expense of alienating two of his best was inexcusable. Jason was not rude, but let's just say he was a bit...snarky? smug? condescending? Jason came up to us from behind the bar and interrupted our conversation to explain that we were this night, or in the past, a bit too brash. I don't remember his exact words, but this was the gist. This is a bar, after all, and I thought it was typical for people to have loud and lively debates, but I digress. As I challenged him because he clearly did not have his facts straight, he refused to be specific, only saying that \"other people\" concurred. Humbly, I admit that my husband and I can get a little heated in our conversations, WITH EACH OTHER, and if Jason could have identified what either of us said that was rude or offensive, perhaps I would understand. During this berating session, I just looked at him completely bewildered because we had been there less than 30 minutes. Whatever his goal, Jason handled the situation very poorly. Would it not have been better for us to talk directly to the people we offended, if indeed we offended them?\n\nIncidentally, since it's opening, we were in the habit of spending over $300 a week at this Fox restaurant alone. We have chosen to spend that money elsewhere.
