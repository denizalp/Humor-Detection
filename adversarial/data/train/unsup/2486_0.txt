I am embarrassed to admit that I stuff my bowl to the hilt with food. Greedy yes but I want to make sure I have enough protein and veggies and the bowls seem so tiny. (Hey I said I was greedy) the service is always pretty good and the selection for you to choose is great.  Needless to say due to me being greedy, I always have leftovers. At least I am not alone when it comes to stuffing my bowl as I have seen others that are 10x worse than I am. Join their Genghis grill club for some awesome deals you can receive on your bowls.
