This place is just terrific.  Yelp pictures and photos guided me and my group to a fabulous and fun meal.  We all whipped out our phones for the free house shot courtesy of the Yelp check in.  A little bit of vodka mixed with a lot of pineapple juice.  Very expensive wine and cocktails.  I had the cucumber martini and it was pretty delicious.\n\nFortunately, my supplier picked up the tab as it was really on the high side but the selection was fun and unique.  We shared the hot rock sliced beef which is a healthy serving of super thin sliced raw beef cooked over a 600 degree rock that place in front of you.  A $34 Kobe beef burger and killer fries.  Super good.  Sides of the Mac n cheese with ham, lobster roll (which is chunked lobster in a cream sauce placed on a bread roll) and the adult tater tots.  \n\nFun, unique, upscale, gourmet, delicious, memorable and a great time.
