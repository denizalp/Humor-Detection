Awesome Korean\/Hawaiian comfort food selection in this casual joint. I came with a group of 9 and we were able to sit down at one of many large tables. The staff was incredibly friendly and happy. We ordered pretty much everything, but my favorite had to be the combo with kalbi, meat jun, and bbq chicken. Enjoy!
