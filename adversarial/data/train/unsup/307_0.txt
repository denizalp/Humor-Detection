The only thing I can think of saying after leaving this store is, \"Are you for real?\"  Read on you'll see what I'm talking about. \n\nI was greeted by a jubilant salesman who asked if I had been in before.  I told him it was my first time and his next question in a super ass loud voice so the whole tiny store can hear was, \n\n...\"What size do you wear?\" (with a Stepford wife look on his face)\n \n...No he didn't?  \n\n...Yes, He Did!  \n\n...Seriously?  (With a perplexed look on my face...)\n\nFor me People, this is taboo!   \n\nMy husband doesn't even know what size I wear.  For that matter, neither do I! \n\nEvery store I go to I'm a different size!\n\nSo smiling I said, \"I'm not telling you, or the whole store!\"  It was funny but yet unsettling.  Nonetheless, he was polite and friendly.  \n\nI looked around but walked out empty handed-do you blame me? \n \nI couldn't shake that $#%$ question outa my head!  \n\nThere were other ways I wish he could have explained the sizes. \nA no-no is asking a strange lady what size she wears in public when she's not even in a dressing room. Some discretion please! And wait until I want to try something on.  \n\nHomeboy was straight up trippin' Boo!\n\nThis store only carries three sizes, 0-1-2.  It's like a S-M-L so it was a little different.  I guess it would be great if I could actually come home with a size 0 right?!   Anyway a bit intrusive of a welcome, I was like, while you're at it, just ask me how much I weigh!
