While at the Silverton Hotel this morning I decided that I needed to remember and reflect on those that served what better to do that but with a shot. I decided to use jack as that celebratory shot to honor those that have gone but are never forgotten, and to those that are still here keeping all of us safe and free. The bartender was refreshing and even made small talk for a while but I did not stay long. \n\nThe lights in this bar for so amazing they change colors on their own too. The colors shift from soft hues of purple, red, and blue. It is so relaxing and such a great concept and edgy atmosphere. The bar chairs are all captains chairs which are very comfortable. At each of the chairs is a gambling machine. I did not play today but have in the past. These are the older type machines that have blackjack on them . That's my game too! Great little place here on my side of town to have shots and honor our great nation under such ambient lighting!
