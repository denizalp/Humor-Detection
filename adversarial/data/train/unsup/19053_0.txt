Butters was a great spot for our Sunday brunch. I was anticipating a very crowded restaurant, with a long wait, much like its sister restaurant Butterfield's on Shea. I was pleasantly surprised that we were seated right away. \n\nNeither hubby or I could decide between the breakfast and lunch menu. Everything we saw that was brought out from the kitchen looked enticing. Hubby opted for the corned beef hash skillet with raisin toast! He proclaimed it as the best corned beef hash he's had here in the valley -- quite the compliment. I, being the pickier eater of the two of us, ordered the grilled cheese sandwich on artisan bread with bacon . . . my preference always is the bacon had to be done very well and the fries, almost burnt. And that is pretty much what I got and loved every bite! \n\nService was friendly, but not overwhelmingly so. Coffee and iced tea were both refilled without having to ask or wait too long. The restaurant itself is pleasant, clean and well laid out. I hope to be able to sit on their patio soon, if we get a day below 100 degrees. Expect nothing fancy. The bathrooms were immaculate. Prices are very reasonable! \n\nI loved that the employees get to eat in the restaurant on break . . . if they sit next to you, then you'll know what to order next time. The salads looked so delicious! \n\nWe'll be back . . .
