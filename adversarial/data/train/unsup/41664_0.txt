Visited the Guild with friends last night.  It was my second trip there.   Both times we were looked after by the very lovely and capable Sara.  Excellent service.  I love the menu here.  It is very unusual in Calgary, a town full of Earl's and Earl's clones. I had the brisket - you never see brisket on the menu in Calgary.  It was excellent and very tender as brisket should be.  The French fries here are exquisite. If your meal doesn't come with the fries, make sure they come with one of your dining companion's dish so you can mooch.  Otherwise ask Sara to bring you a side.  The wine list is mid range and more than adequate. The ambience is lively.  I highly recommend a visit.
