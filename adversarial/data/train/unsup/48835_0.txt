I went to Four seasons yesterday for a fill  After 40 min of service,  I asked the girl doing my nails if she had done nails before.  the skin around my nails is raw and sore.  Shellac is bubbled and peeling off. Each nail is different from the other .. My nails were dirty with shavings of sanding nails when shellac was applied.  The WORST nail service I have ever had
