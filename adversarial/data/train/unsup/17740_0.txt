Awesome experience buying a car Joey in sales was very nice as were the financing guys. Did have a few bumps such as the a\/c and a check engine light all which was try one thing hope it works, trial and error I completely understand but they took care of me very well. Bryan and Raymond in the service department was always nice all round great experience they will be seeing my business here from now on and I will me recommending all my friends and family to buy cars from them or to use their service department!!! Thank you guys!
