The food and Service was disgusting. My wife and I had Chili and both of us had severe stomach problems .  I  should go to the Health Department.. I have pictures of the So called food. I spent over $30.00 FOR A CASUAL lunch and for Dog food? Are you kidding? I had one bite of each item and left it . I want a refund . I was there about 3:30 pm 1\/11 . There is a serious problem with this location.\n\nYou would not eat what you served me.\n\n\nDISGUSTING
