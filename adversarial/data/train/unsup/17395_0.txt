This place is bizarre. I worked in a bingo hall part time for several years through high school and then casually to fill in so I know bingo is always full of interesting characters but this place takes it to another level. I got here at 3 PM on a Sunday and the locals were in a rampage because the manager some how screwed up a game. One customer was ranting so loud about how stupid the place was and the rules were useless and they were ripping people off as she waited in line to buy cards for the next round (apparently she's hooked). The staff is a little useless. I had to tell three workers it was my first time there before a customer finally had to step in and tell me how the place operated. The games were actually fun, the prizes were ok (a lot of 200 dollar-ish ones), and the prices were good (about $17 for one of everything). I wasn't successful in winning anything. Right before it was over the caller announced that the 7 PM session was any book for $1. I assumed I misheard or it meant something different. I curiously waited around and watched the regulars go to the counter, order massive books of cards, and give the worker a loonie. Damn. And I just paid like $6 for a smaller book? Of course I stayed. No will power haha. Round two I paid $12 for one of everything and ended up closer to winning but still no luck. Also the prizes in that round included 6 prizes of at least $1,000. The weekend  7 PM session is definitely the one to hit. Try to sit alone in a corner, though, I ended up with a pleasant old lady next to me who repeatedly yelled \"What a c--t\" every time the caller didn't call her number or another player call bingo... I'll go back because I'm a sucker for weirdos and a closet gambling addict.
