Unaware pool service was scheduled I arrive hone to fund a van parked in front of our driveways.\nI call out in both yards to see who is back there and no reply.\nI cover half the yard and call out again and finally get some sort of response.\nI ask the guy to either pull into the driveway or move vehicle so it's not blocking drive.  I also inquired about what he was doing to which he replies \"um, and who are you?!\"\nI am officially po'd now.\n'scuse me, you're trespassing and asking who I AM?!\nI am the home owner -\nNOT liking.
