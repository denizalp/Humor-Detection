Probably the most amazing cinnamon roll I have ever had!  We walked in and started looking at the menu, plenty of people working behind the counter.  Not one person greeted us or said hello (And they were not busy, there was no line). No one asked if we had questions or if it was our first time there.  We went to order and literally, the only words that the guy said to us was if our order was for here or to go.  He didn't say hi or anything!  If that was my business that just barely opened, I would be greeting everyone warmly and kindly.  It was like they were pissed we showed up at 3 in the afternoon.  I would definitely go back for the cinnamon rolls but definitely not because anyone was nice or friendly.  Geez!  Desserts are supposed to make people happy!!!  We ordered the lemon frosting with raspberries and pie crust.
