Hey everyone, what's for lunch? Come on over to Yasi's Place for your next nosh! \"Yasi\" sounds like the name of your local baker or sandwich maker and the atmosphere is really neighbourhood-y and welcoming. They serve brunch on weekends and Mondays but you can get certain breakfast items anytime. It's a shame they close so early but I imagine this to be the type of place that the neighbourhood freelancers, stay at homes and high school kids come to for a quick and tasty bite. \n\nWithout the power of Yelp I would never have heard of Yasi's Place, much less stumbled upon it in my Toronto travels. It's in the middle of a super residential neighbourhood just north of the super sketchy neighbourhood that touches Lansdowne. \n\nI ordered the daily special, which was Scrambled Eggs with Asparagus, Wilted Spinach and Goat Cheese. Instead of what I'm usually accustomed to when it comes to ordering scrambled eggs (runny eggs with one wimpy vegetable), this was a veritable vegetable medley! The asparagus and spinach were perfectly sauteed and abundant. I also ordered a yummy soup of the day to split with my brunching parter-in-crime, and it was a vegan Smoky Black Bean and Tomato. I was so torn about what to order that I *also* ordered lemonade. You could tell it was fresh - super tart, tangy and refreshing. Oh, and let's not forget the free individual pots of coffee or tea before 11am.\n\nFinally, how could I resist this menu item that was staring me in the face from the moment I arrived: \"BETTER THAN SEX BROWNIES\". Hell yeah. The brownie was essentially a chilled, ganach-tacular concoction that was so dense and rich I had to pause to make sure I wasn't eating an actual truffle. Absurdly good.\n\nAnd just to reiterate what others reviewers have rightfully mentioned, the place is tiny, cluttered and eclectic. Lots of cutesy knickknacks, mismatched chairs and picnic tables, vintage salt and pepper shakers and the like!\n\nCash only.
