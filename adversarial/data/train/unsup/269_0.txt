Brunch, Lunch, Dinner or Happy Hour - Sierra Bonita Grill does EVERYTHING well!\n\nAmong my favorite items:\n\nFresh Squeezed Margarita - served in a martini glass, this is really something special.  No icky sweet pre-made mix here - just a wonderful blend of Reposado tequila, orange liqueur, fresh lime juice and agave nectar.  \n\nBacon wrapped shrimp - among the very best I have tasted, the four large shrimp make a gorgeous presentation atop the plate drizzled with barbecue sauce along with a side of a slightly spicy remoulade.  Amazing. \n\nSouthwestern Benedict - there is no better reason to have brunch.  Two green chile beer biscuits are topped with savory ham, panko crusted poached eggs (sounds weird, they are delicious!) and roasted poblano hollandaise.  \n\nI can't stay away from Sierra Bonita - the friendly staff and fantastic food never disappoints.  Ever!
