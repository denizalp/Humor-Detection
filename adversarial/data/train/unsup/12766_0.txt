I am so excited that there's a new boba place in AZ! \n\nAesthetic - cute decorations and bonus points for mini Harambe figure\n\nThey need to re do their menu. And definitely need to change the \"cheese topping\". It's essentially a creama drink. Don't be scared by the \"cheese\" in its name. I ordered the matcha latte milk tea with egg pudding. \n\nDrinks are delicious and will definitely be back to try  all the other ones.
