I know that Ross J's has been around for quite some time.  Shame on me, that it took me this long to eat here. I'm in the area from time to time and have been to Blue Fin and Sumo, but never here until recent.  The food at Ross J's is comfort island food to me.  Here, you can get pretty much the same dishes that the rest of the Hawaiian joints have.  But here, the prices are cheap and the portions are huge. We arrived one early evening for a quick dinner with friends.  I ended up getting their Loco Moco and Portuguese Sausage Masubi.  Total came to about $7, which is a steal.  Both were full of favor and did I mention the servings?  My Loco Moco had enough rice that was drenched in gravy, topped with eggs, and complimented with two hamburger patties.  If I'm in the area, specifically in this side of Henderson, I now know where to go if I'm craving some comfort food at a great deal. \n\n\nLoco Moco:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=7S7rzrgGKlbyeW9aTEjyiA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nPortuguese Sausage Masubi:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=bsDfORivIAUj9CIkPL5FyQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ
