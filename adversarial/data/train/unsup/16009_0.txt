I was in desperate need to get my eyebrows done, and the usual place that I go to closes early at 5:00 PM or so.  Considering that I work downtown from 9-5, there was no way that I was going to be able to make it back uptown to make it before closing time.  \n\nSo, I was searching on yelp for new places to go to.  Surprisingly, there was one place that's down the street from where I work (located on Dundas)!  So I went to the website for Perfect Threading, and they recently opened a new location - literally right next door to my work place!  So I went after work.  The location is tucked away in the shopping concourse at 700 University.  I went in, and they quickly took me in - there wasn't many people there.  \n\nThe woman wasn't the best at quickly threading.  It was quite painful!  She should've been fast and quick.  However, it seemed like it was taking forever.  However, the shape of my eyebrows is great!\n\nCost about $8.40 - not including tip.  They also give you this card where you get 9 eyebrow threads, and get the last for free.
