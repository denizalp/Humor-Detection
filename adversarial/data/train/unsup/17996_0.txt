Come get your hair girl!\n\nThis is the place because GRAND is the true statement for this location. It is like a warehouse of hair, beauty supplies and much more. Sally's Beauty Supply comes across as a small scale compared to Grand Mart. They have everything you need not just in one brand but many. All the years I have shopped here everyone has been super friendly and willing to help. I believe their prices to be reasonable compared to other beauty supply stores that I have shopped at. I have also found items that I do not find at most beauty supplies stores.\n\nThey sell wigs both human and synthetic. They sell extensions in different styles, lengths and colors. The staff will help you select the best product based on what may work best for you. They also sell heating tools such as flat irons, blow dryers, and curling irons. They sell makeup too. Not top brands but generic.
