One of my absolute favorite spots in town! My fiance' & I had our first date there! We enjoyed the degustation menu o. Valentine's Day and it was superb. Our server, Michale I believe, went way above and beyond for us. (I was on chemo and started feeling unwell so he got everything boxed up including dessert and even helped my fiance get me to the car!) We love this place!
