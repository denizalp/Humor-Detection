There aren't many of these out there anymore maybe this is the last one I'm not sure.  I grew up coming to this Hoss's and I still enjoy coming here and bringing my family.  My kids love coming here because they can eat all that they want and I usually let them get whatever they want.  Some things have changed here throughout the years but this is still a nice place to bring your whole family and get stuffed.  \n We usually don't wait long here but on the last time that we came here we had to wait like 10 minutes. Tables were ready but they just weren't ready for all of the customers for some reason.  We sat down to look at the menu.  Basically you order a meal and then you pay little extra for their big salad bar or it comes with your meal.  The kids get a kids menu to choose from and you can add the salad bar with their order too.  I usually like to order some chicken with fries and get the salad bar.  I stopped doing this because my son loves steak and the kids steak is too small for him so I get a big steak and we share it!  We got the tips and it was cooked really good.  It's not the best of best steaks but its not bad at all.  We enjoyed it.  At the salad bar I usually get a big salad and they always have a lot to put on it.  They have soups, cinnamon bread which is always tradition to get, and a lot of other good items to go with your meal.  Then at the end I get their frozen yogurt and put a lot of toppings on it.  By the end of the day we were stuffed but I wanted more ice cream.  \n So take your family here on a Sunday or Saturday night.  The price is right and you get to eat so much.  It's clean too for a buffet and service is always good here.  There isn't another place like this Hoss's.
