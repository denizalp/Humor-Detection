So I really didn't like the girl at the cash register, and I hated the fact that they were out of a major amount of ingredients and didn't apologize. Fortunately the food was really good, even amazing considering it was airport food. Wonderful and flavorful warm Spanish rice, great beans, your choose of chicken and steak and salsa. \n\nThey're rude but they offer really good food.
