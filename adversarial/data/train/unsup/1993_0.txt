Let's all agree that this place is expensive. Let's also agree that they do a few food dishes right, and the rest are just so-so (and not worth the $$). But I keep coming back here.\n\nIt's just a whole lot of fun. The high ceilings, the classic decor, the great location, the busy\/noisy atmosphere, the beer selection...\nEven in the menu's copy there's a playfulness that shows they just want you to have a good time. Just a great place to hang out with friends\/coworkers.\n\nTips: Belgian Frites (amazing and great value) + wings. I brought a date here once. I forgot her name. But I clearly remember the frites. \n\n4 stars out of 5.\n\nJimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food:\n[*] Disappointing. Just...no. \n[**] Not very good. Will not return. \n[***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality. \n[****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints. \n[*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time.
