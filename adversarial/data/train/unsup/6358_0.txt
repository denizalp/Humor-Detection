This was our first time staying at Excalibur Hotel and by the varying reviews, we were a little unsure of what to expect. So here's my review and what we honestly thought of the hotel.\n\nExterior:\n\nThe exterior of the hotel is bright and definitely stands out, especially at night. It actually looks quite magical. However it does not seem \"child-like\", as some may have mentioned.\n\nInterior:\n\nThe interior of the hotel is nicely decorated and fits with the theme of the medieval castle. And yes, when you walk into the hotel there's a smell of cigarettes and cigars. That's because you have to walk through the casino to get to the check-in desk. Although I can say most hotels did have a smoke odor since you are permitted to smoke in there. The hallways are also musty and have a distinct smell, however that didn't bother us that much since we knew we weren't spending a lot of time at the hotel.\n\nThe check-in desk:\n\nWas fast and friendly. We had no issues with check-in.\n\nOur Room:\n\nWe had a basic non-smoking room with a king size bed. Though the room was nothing to rave about, it was comfortable, and we had a spectacular view! It seemed as if they were in the middle of trying to upgrade the room as some things looked newer, while other things looked older. It was clean though and comfortable. My only complaint is that there is no tub, only a stand-up shower. At times I just wish I could have soaked my feet, but that's okay. We had a hair dryer, plenty of towels, and all the normal hotel necessities like an iron and ironing board. I should also mention that our room DID NOT smell. It was only the hallways.\n\nThe \"Time Share People\":\n\nYes, there are people ALL OVER the hotel trying to get you to go on a four hour tour to buy a time share. They will try to bribe you with money, free tickets, free dinner, etc... Just know in advance that it's a big waste of time, so unless you're broke and need the money, DON'T do it. NOTE: These people WILL hound you and follow you around asking questions. At first it was a bit overwhelming, but finally we realized that if we told them we were leaving that night, they pretty much just left us alone and told us to have a good night. A little white lie never hurt, right? You will also encounter these people all over the strip. We used the same trick on all of them and it worked every time.\n\nRestaurants:\n\nExcalibur has several restaurants to choose from, including their buffet.\n\nDick's Last Resort: Yes, it's fun. But I just don't understand their logic of giving crappy service and making fun of their customers. They make you silly paper hats with crude comments, pretty much throw your plate of food at you, and slam your bill on the table. What gives? I have a sense of humor and could laugh at the hats, but the rest of the \"act\" was just stupid.\n\nExcalibur Buffet: We were really wary about eating here. It was significantly cheaper than most other buffets in the area, but we decided to give it a try. In all honesty it wasn't bad. But it wasn't great. They had a nice variety of foods to choose from. (Just don't eat the scrambled eggs! Yuck!) This is also the only buffet I've been to here that you had to get your own drinks. I was okay with that though. No biggie. It's worth it to go to for a quick breakfast when you don't feel like cruising the strip for a place to eat.\n\nOther Stuff:\n\nPools: Yes, Excalibur does have several pools. Compared to other hotels, they're just mediocre, but if you're just looking to spend a few hours there, it's no big deal. To me, a pool is a pool. The only disappointment was that the largest main pool was closed for the season.\n\nThunder From Down Under: As if it's not bad enough there's advertisement for it everywhere you go, but now when you walk into the hotel there's a \"station\" that has two strapping young lads from the show with minimal clothing on. As you walk past they give women very sexy looks and try to lure you in for a picture with them, which you have to pay for. On several occasions I had the \"thunder from down under\" guys say, \"Do you want a picture taken, sweetie?\" Well no, sweetie, I do not want my picture taken with you. In all honesty is seemed a little creepy and I felt like I was being propositioned by a male prostitute.\n\nSo all-in-all, Excalibur is a decent hotel for the money. Would
