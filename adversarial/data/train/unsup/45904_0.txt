I came here early in the morning, although more people came in for lunch time and the place became quite packed.\n\nI got the \"Loved\" acai bowl and an Americano for breakfast. It was quite tasty although fairly expensive, and did not keep me full for too long. However, this place does have a nice atmosphere and the staff are quite friendly. The order was also prepared fairly quickly, and it started getting quite packed by lunch time.
