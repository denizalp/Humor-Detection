I am not gluten free but really like this place for lunch, the cauliflower wings and teas are really good! I love the idea that people are really trying to have a gluten free environment for those that have celiac disease and so they can still enjoy cakes and pastries. The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is how long it takes for the food to come out, you can be there an hour waiting sometimes.
