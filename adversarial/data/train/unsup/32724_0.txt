I've driven past Tony Roma's many times but never thought to give it a chance.  I got an email from travelzoo for a $39 three course meal for two so I decided to check it out.  I must say I was quite pleased and I will be returning (& paying full price!!).\n\nIt was four of us who went so we ordered quite a large amount of food.  We had the appitizer sampler to start with. It was gooooood, but lacked flavor.  My husband and I each had a white sangria and it was great as well.  \n\nFor entrees we had Ribs, the little filet things (I don't remember what they are called), half bbq chicken, a chicken salad, and shrimp scampi (I think that was everything) along with many sides! Everything was very very good.  The restaurant wasn't too busy at the hour that we went, so I think we lucked out there!  The meats were very tender and juicy.\n\nWe all also shared the dessert trio...and O M G! I was expecting the desserts to be tiny but they weren't.  It was even hard for all four of us to eat all this food.\n\nThe service was okay.  It wasn't over the top phenomenal and it didn't suck... but I saw every other table got bread with their meal.  Is that something that comes with a certain meal?  Not that I could have eaten it anyway, just curious.\n\nI liked it!
