So so so affordable. And tasty! Probably my favorite meal we've had in Vegas. I guess I'm not about glamour but about good old fashioned cooking. \n\nI have no idea what their restaurant looks like because we ordered delivery via yelp's Eat24 service. Only $3 for delivery! And who wants to walk outside during 107 degree weather? Not me!\n\nTheir pad see ew noodles were excellent. Papaya salad could've been crispier\/cooler but it could've warmed up from the sweltering heat. Who can blame that poor little papaya salad then? Not me. I wilted from just sticking my head out of the hotel doors. \n\nPad Thai a little too sweet for me, but still good. \n\nAnd did I say this place was affordable? Fed 4 adults and 2 kids for $58 after tax, tip, and delivery. And we had leftovers. Unheard of in these parts. Thanks cafe Thai for keeping it sane here in Vegas.
