I should have ordered an iced tea or something like that to go with my coconut cake, but the sign for the chocolate volcano, billed as a summer drink, was very enticing.\n\nI took my receipt and had a seat.  The place was quiet when I was there about 7:30 PM on a weekday.  Shortly, a server brought my cake and a bit later, she brought my volcano.  Carb overload.  Is Sweet was sweet. \n\nThe cake was OK.  It was a little dry.  I didn't ask if the bakery items are made in house but my guess is that they are not.  Presentation of the cake on a wooden platter was nicely done.\n\nThen came the chocolate volcano.  It's a frapp√© that very thick, very rich with a ton of chocolate flavor, and then topped with chocolate powder for an extra chocolate kick.\n\nI will stop in again but I'll make sure if I get a pastry that I'll get a more reasonable drink or just stick with water.\n\nThere is plenty of parking.
