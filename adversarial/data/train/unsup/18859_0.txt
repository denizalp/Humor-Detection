I went go-karting for the first time ever earlier this month and it was SO MUCH FUN. I used to play racing video games all the time as a kid and it was so much fun to claim that I actually learned something from them!! The staff here is nice, though a bit...\"speedy\". They run through the rules and instructions very quickly, so if you're a first timer, listen close and let your fears go! Everything will be ok, just keep your arms and legs inside the kart and pay attention to the flagger! \n\nThe track is simple, but that's ideal for someone like me. If you're looking for something crazy, don't come here. Actually, come here anyways! You'll definitely have fun. Who couldn't?! \n\nMy proud moment was when I lapped a group of men that were racing the same round as my boyfriend and I and they (although in a very sexist way) complimented my driving skills afterwards. YESSSS.
