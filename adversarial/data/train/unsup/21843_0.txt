When I got to Ruby's I was seated immediately but the main guy didn't want to listen to what cut I wanted to get. He was in a huge hurry even though there was only 1 person waiting. Zero conversation, which isn't a big deal to me but I was astounded when he ended up drawing blood from my ear! He blamed me for the cut, right in the center of my ear...Then he said I should be smarter than that if I went to school in Madison. When I left he pointed at my ear and said have fun...laughable professionalism. Customer service is non existent here. I have never left a review on Yelp before but after today's experience, I feel obligated to warn others. GO TO NOGGINZ
