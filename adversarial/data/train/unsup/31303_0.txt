My grandmother was the patient and I am posting on her behalf and the experience I went through with her.\n\nThe operation at Body by Kotoske is a complete joke. From start to finish it has been a horrible experience and I do not see one shred of how anyone could leave a positive review at this center. \nSurgery was scheduled for a Monday, and because the employees here were not doing their job and did not get the correct paperwork from all sources needed surgery was rescheduled for Tuesday at 7 am. The doctor was over 2 hours late for surgery with not an explanation or apologies. The initial post op appointment resulted in a large layer of skin being ripped off from the dressings, an extra pain and added stress that was unneeded due to carelessness. \nThe week postoperative appointment was also a nightmare. Appointment scheduled for 9 am and again over 2 hours with no explanation other than the doctor is still in surgery. \nI would never recommend anyone waste their money here. For the amount of money spent, it is not worth it to deal with this level of unprofessionalism. Find a good doctor that values your time as well as a good surgery experience.
