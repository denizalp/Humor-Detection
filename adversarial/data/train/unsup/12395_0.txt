We came here for a drink on a Friday night and I must say, we didn't have the best experience! We sat at one of the booths\/tables along the wall and since there was only 1 bartender running the entire place, service at the booth was very slow. My stepdad didn't get a drink for a LONG time so we eventually went up and ordered ourselves. I totally understand being short staffed but then maybe rope off\/close the table area so that guests don't sit there and expect to be waited on. Just a suggestion! \n\nAs we were leaving around 9 PM, the live music was starting! They do have a great stage area and i'm sure this place in hopping during the later hours. Since there are so many great bars in the area, i'm not sure if we'll be back.
