Super easy to rent a car here from Avis. The line was long but moved quickly. A short drive dropped us off right in front of the door. We found our way inside to no line whatsoever. We got a BRAND NEW Dodge Charger. I was happy take that for a spin out on the streets of Vegas for the weekend! Everyone at Avis was friendly and helpful. Return here is really easy! There is lots of signage directing you exactly where you need to go and the shuttle pulled up to take us back to the airport within a couple of minutes of us waiting at the curb! I wish all off site car rentals would be this easy. I will have no issues with renting again while in Vegas and will use Avis to do so.
