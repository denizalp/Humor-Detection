I had a delicious grilled chicken sandwich (avacado, brie, tomatoes) today with a cappuccino for lunch. The sandwich was really good, the cappuccino was veering on the bitter side with less aroma than expected, but the atmosphere here is definitely one of the greatest draws for the place.\n\nThis teeny tiny places has two red curtains the hides the place as you walk in the door, making you feel like you're walking into some kind of stage. Inside is small, cute, and cozy, perhaps fitting no more than 10-12 patrons at a time. A lot of people come to get things to go. We arrived at 11:50am and there were only one other table occupied. As we approached 12:30, the place became packed. \n\nPrice-wise, the place isn't cheap. 8-9 dollars for a sandwich. I did have an enjoyable time here and it's definitely a great place for people who work in the area to stop by for lunch.
