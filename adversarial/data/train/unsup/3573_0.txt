Planet Hollywood was the perfect fit during my trip to Sin City! The main reason I chose this hotel was the free parking. PH is one of the few hotels left that does not charge parking for guests and visitors. Another advantage to PH is the Miracle Mile Mall located inside. Many of your favorite stores can be found here along with an array of food options and other attractions. The parking garage is located towards the rear of the building and you will have to walk thru the mall in order to get to the hotel lobby. \n\nWe were allowed to check-in early and it was as easy as it gets. Everything is automated now, no more interaction with front desk clerks. The machine is touchscreen and you follow the prompts and it dispenses the keycards to your room. The room (1745) was fantastic. It was spacious and clean with a partial view of the Bellagio fountains. The bathroom was bigger than I expected complete with a walk in shower and full size deep tub. \n\nThe casino was modern and hip with Hollywood decor and dark tones. Chef Ramsay's Burger restaurant is located along the casino floor, you can't miss it, just look for the firewall! At night, you'll find some hot ladies dancing on top of the bars throughout the casino. \n\nService was terrific. When I checked in, I quickly received a text from an automated concierge that will assist you with everything from room service to booking shows. I saw plenty of security throughout the property and all the staff we had contact with were prompt and professional. This is not a luxury hotel, it has more of a trendy and easygoing vibe to it. There's a theatre that hosts popular musical acts throughout the year. When I was there J Lo performed multiple times. \n\nJust like the rest of hotels in Vegas, PH has multiple pools, spa, workout area, etc. In terms of location on the Strip, across from Bellagio and next to Paris. It's a short walk to Caesars, New York New York and Aria. I would definitely stay here again in the future.
