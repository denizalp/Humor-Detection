I was in the need of purchasing another cheese slate & saw online that Sur La Table carries them.\n\nI always get overwhelmed walking into these stores, because you have no idea where to look. Thankfully, a nice employee saw my confused expression, welcomed me to the store & asked what I was looking for. She walked me right to the cheese plates - which they were closer to the floor, so I probably would have been wondering around all day had it not been for her. :D\n\nWhile the slate was super heavy & I declined buying it, I was thankful for the employees assistance.\n\nThe store was very neat & organized & seemed to have just the right amount of employees working.\n\nParking is troublesome, as it shares space with the ever busy Whole Foods & Viva Chicken.
