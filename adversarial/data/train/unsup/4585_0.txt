So, my drivers side brake light went out, and I needed a new one.  This location was on my way home from work, so I stopped in.  I was greeted right away and asked how I could be helped.  I told them what I needed, they looked it up on the computer, went to the aisle it was in to get it for me, rung me up and I was on my way.  The guys in the store were very friendly!  Asked me how my day was going, how my Thanksgiving was etc etc.  Really personable dudes.  Because of that, I would not hesitate to stop in here again to get some auto parts.  Might not be as cheap as getting something online, but if you need something now, and want great customer service, then this is your place!
