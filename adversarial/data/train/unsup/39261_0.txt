Terrific place for a great bottle of wine--or an entire case. Proprietor Josh is smart, knowledgeable and can find you something you've never had but are sure to love in any price range. Located in 7th st market means you can grab some great bread and cheese while quaffing a glass with Josh. Our go to wine shop in Charlotte.
