Yup, really good. Loved it! Took my mother for dinner, we are a vegetarian and a vegan and there was loads of choice. The food was delicious, the flatbreads fresh and warm, the dips freshly made and tasty. We ordered spicy potatoes which were fabulous and so were the chargrilled artichokes. All in all a really great meal paired with a mid priced but decent bottle of Pinot. Five stars!
