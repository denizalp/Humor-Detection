How hard is it to find decent Thai food in Durham? Impossible it seems. \n\nWe ordered Tom Yum Noodle Soup, Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai, and Red Curry and Lychee with Fish. They said it would be 45 minutes for delivery. \n\n60 minutes pass and still no food. When I called, I was told that their driver never showed up and they needed to call someone else in. They apologized but there was no incentive (free spring rolls maybe?). I expressed concern that the food will be cold. They said that it should be ok. I told them that my husband is upset at the delay. For our troubles, we'll get free spring rolls on our next order. \n\n90 minutes after ordering, the food came. The driver apologized and gave a completely different story for the delay. The food was cold. The Pad Thai was gummy as all the sauce was absorbed by the noodles. It was all clumped together. The Tom Yum was too sweet. The Red Curry did not have lychee which is strange as the name includes it. \n\nI'd give this place zero stars if I could. I guess my search for decent Thai in Durham continues. Or I'll just cut my losses and head t in to TO instead.
