Finally tried it today and omygod i get the hype. Usually there's a long line but today it was quite short and went by super fast. The cashier was really nice and patient. \nSeeing the cheesecake being stamped with the logo is so satisfying.\nThe cheesecake is fluffy , light and not too sweet. I dont like cheesecake but this one is a winner.
