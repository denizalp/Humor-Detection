I enjoyed my first experience at Fired Up, we had the mac n cheese balls, bison burger w coleslaw, and chili.  I really enjoyed my burger, I like them more dry than juicy, so it worked for me, and the toppings went really well to give it a smokey taste.  My sister enjoyed her chilli, calling it \"the perfect chilli taste\".  I would try a different side and appetizer next time. The atmosphere is loud and comforting, so feel free to bring everyone you know and have a great dinner out!  Rocco (the owner) is great and will come around sometime throughout the night to find out how things are going :)\n\nnote: though there's heat lamps, the patio is windy and chilly, especially going in to fall!
