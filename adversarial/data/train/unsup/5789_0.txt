I've been taking my shoes here for years and am uber satisfied with their work. They're great for dress shoes and boots, but holy $hit, their tennis shoe game is on point. I don't know how they do it, but if you take a pair of dirty old tenny's here, they will make them look like brand news. I've had all kinds of work done here in the 10 or so years I've been going here: conditioning, cleaning, resoling, heel repair; prices are good. My only gripes with this place are twofold: 1) they don't and probably will never take credit cards so you have to come prepared with cash. 2) their hours are fairly limited. Otherwise highly recommended.
