Good ol' Three Angry Wives! Always reliable, rarely disappointing. The Wives has always reminded me of the Winchester in the movie Shaun of the Dead. So in the event of a zombie apocalypse, feel free to meet me at the Wives while we can have a nice cold pint and wait for everything to blow over.\n\nThis dimly lit bar\/restaurant adorned with numerous TVs is a great spot to go watch a hockey or football game if you don't mind being around a little bit of cigarette smoke. Some of the cool features this bar boasts include a self-service beer tap system built into a couple of the tables, Golden Tee golf video game, separated bar\/restaurant\/lounge areas, and a TouchTunes music sound system. If you end up doing a little too much day drinking at the Wives, conveniently located next door is a vitamin shop where I am certain you could try to drunkenly stammer out your request for some hangover prevention goodies.\n\nThe bar food here is top-notch. I have had the Reuben sandwich served with fries and a pickle, pretzel bites with cheese and mustard, and the nachos. The Reuben was spot on in terms of quality of corned beef and sauerkraut and portion size on the bread. The pretzel bites are one of those appetizer items you order that you simply can't keep your hands off, and before you know it you are reaching for another bite only to discover you had sadly already eaten the last one! The nachos came with the standard fixin's and were rather mediocre.\n\nThe beer selection at the Wives isn't bad at all. I believe they have around 12 beers on tap, plenty of bottled beer, and of course a full bar in terms of liquor for any number of various mixed drinks. The bartenders mixing up these drinks are very attentive, fast, and friendly. I wish the same could be said for the waitresses, as this was sadly the only problem I had with the Wives.
