Southwest Airlines, i would like to thank you for many reasons. I would also like to thank a complete stranger named Jen on Flight 1146 05\/29\/2018 Las Vegas to Houston.\nJen, my 12 year old daughter was flying by herself. She told me how kind you were on the flight. My daughter had to change planes in Houston, Jen left the plane she needed to stay on, just to escort my daughter to her next flight. That melted my heart completely. Thank you for your kindness. I'm so grateful for you.\n\nSouthwest, your employees are amazing. They gave my daughter pre check. Constantly asked if she needed food, water, or had any questions. They were overly sweet and I'm soooo grateful! Southwest employee Kayla in Houston, thank you to you also. You made her feel safe, comfortable & confident. You left a big impression! I left my daughter in your hands and you took such good care of her. I could not be more thankful.
