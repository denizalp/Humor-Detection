The only club in vegas that plays nothing but hip hop all night on Sundays. AND its free for locals yayyyyy!!!! Alot of hot girls and good music. Only 2 things they need to step up. $13 for a 12oz can of carona.... hell na and there's  absolutly nowhere to sit if your tired. Unless you want to cough up alot of $$$$ for a table. Hope u like standing all night.
