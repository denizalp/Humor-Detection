Got reservations and was sooo excited!  Just got back from 9pm dinner. Had a great meal with good company. \n\nI don't want to ruin the surprise for those who have reservations so I will save my review and pics till after Tues!\n\n-------\n*pics posted*\n-------\n\nFrom the moment I found out about Charpop on the yelp events page, I was excited and the suspense only grew from there.  As we waited 3 long days for our reservation confirmations, and then waited till 3 days prior to find out about the *secret location*, to hearing about the event on Global news and knowing that it was fully booked in 2 mins and that thousands were wait listed.....  I was getting more and more excited by the day.... by the hour! :) (Have I rubbed it in enough?!?! haha)  ;-)\n\nWe drove by the industrial area where the pop up restaurant was located, a lady in a fur coat came up to the car to greet us and directed us to the back of the building where we were suppose to find a blue 'X' on the door where the restaurant is... felt very CIA spy like... hahaa.\n\nEvent was held at a warehouse\/kitchen space of a bakery. We were seated at a table of 8 - concept was table sharing, so we shared the table with 2 other couples. Idea is to share the experience with strangers and also make friends along the way. We liked our neighbors and even decided to order all sides to share (Beets, carrots, potatoes- which were damn good, and lamb croissant).  \n\nWe were seated right next to the kitchen & it was nice to hear, see, and be so close to the bustle of the kitchen - made it feel very 'Hell's Kitchen' like. hahah.\n\nWhat we ordered (besides the sides):\n\n1)  Pig ear salad: expecting cartilage-y bits in the salad, instead they shaved it and deep fried it so it was crispy slices atop a salad (which really could of been anything if you didn't know it was pig ear) ... & the salad was too salty, not sure if it was the pig ears or the salad itself.\n\n2) Beef tongue on brioche - This was DELICIOUS!  I've had tongue before and would generally describe it as lean, & a bit chewy... but this beef tongue sandwich was sliced thin, and SOOOOO tender (can't emphasize enough how tender it was)... and soooo yummy! This was by far the best dish of the night.  \n\n3) Beef cheek - First time and didn't know what to expect.  It was good, and reminded me of brisket... only the best parts of the brisket - lean (no fat) but super tender!\n\n3a) and we had a taste of our neighbors sweetbreads which was also good.  What are sweetbreads?  Google it! hahah (well, it's the thymus gland).... I liked that the chef didn't shy away and try to hide it but instead showcased it and presented well. I was hesitant to try it but I liked it.  \n\n4) Cast iron Cinnamon roll \n\nGreat experience - 5*
