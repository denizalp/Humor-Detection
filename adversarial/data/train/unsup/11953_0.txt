Holy Mother Of God, I just got a case of food poisoning from this place that was so bad I was surprised I didn't retch up my shoes. \n\nI ate carnitas here at two o'clock. By five o'clock I was flat on my back. And by nine o' clock I was driving the porcelain bus. I became Mr. Creosote from \"The Meaning Of Life,\" unleashing like a firehose until six hours later, at three in the morning when I passed out into a fitful semi-stupor. Eating here basically ruined the last day and a half of our vacation. \n\nSo, to sum up... \n\nI DO NOT recommend eating here. \n\nI DO recommend a kitchen fire and salting the earth where it once stood.
