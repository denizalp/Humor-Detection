I've tried this new place several times now so I figured it was time to write a review! I'm a big fan of fajitas and Juan's does it right! The veggies are really good and the seasoning is tasty. Best of all, the kitchen uses high quality meat and it shows. If you don't want beans and salsa, they'll sub a very hearty portion of garlic butter vegetables that are really yummy! \n\nThe tableside flaming fajita show is a lot of fun for kids and adults. It's a neat gimmick. I do think the portion size on the fajitas for 2 is a bit small; you are better off paying a little extra and order your own fajitas. \n\nThe chips are pretty good and the salsas are tasty. I really like the bean dip, it's my favorite. The service has always been absolutely amazing. Out of the few times I've dined here, only once did it take a super long time for our food to come out of the kitchen. I don't know what was going on, but it took over 30 minutes. Usually they are pretty fast, making this a great spot to grab a quick and healthy meal before going to a movie, out shopping, etc. \n\nI only have two criticisms for the place: 1, make the portion size on the \"fajitas for 2\" a bit larger and 2, I wish the kitchen would serve homemade tortillas. The tortillas are so bad I usually ask for none to be brought to the table. \n\nOverall, the restaurant is cute and comfortable, the prices are fair and the food is good. What's not to like?
