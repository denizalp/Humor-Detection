I'll give it you, Ruth. You figured out the perfect business model: Dare to charge opulent prices for an 'exclusive experience' and everyone's gotta have it. Hell, I did. I wanted that exclusive 500 degree sizzling plate people 'ooh and ahh' over. Gotta be honest. I remember more about burning my thumb on that plate than I do the steak. My $59 hockey-puck-sized petite filet was in fact, perfectly cooked and bursted of buttery carniverous delight. So you won there, Ruth. Oddly, the flavor I remember most is the nuked rubbery seaweed flavored shrimp resting atop such a beautiful cut of roast beast. The salad and sides were good, but not memorable. Same w the creme brulee.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't find a true hero in the Ruth's Chris experience. There's nothing I can say about this place, be it the vibe, service or food that justify the price. Especially since you can, (with a quick Google-search and some tenacity), learn how to make a steak surpisingly comparable to Ruths for 1\/2 the cost. If you know this, you walk away feeling a bit duped, even a little angry. \n\nThe server's had sold me on the fact that the beef we were about to eat is the top 3% in America. In all fairness to Ruth, there's simply no way to give the time and attention required to make every steak great and pump them all out in a night. Ruth knows you don't understand this. Thats why they've got you in their restaurant. The guy sitting next to me got the most expensive cut on the menu (the $100 cowboy ribeye) and offered me a bite (It damn near burned my mouth it was so hot.) The number 1 food crime in America is not letting your steak rest before served. How could u do this to a man who just paid $100 bucks for a slice of cow? And I hate saying this but it tasted so damn....average. Not even half as good as the $27 ribeye I got at Pappy's way out in the desert. \n\nAfter all the great things I've heard Ruth. We gotta talk.
