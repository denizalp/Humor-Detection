For my first review as official Pittsburgh CM I'm going to tell you all a funny story...\n\nI didn't attend Pitt but I have been in this building a handful of times.  We (as in Burghers) and Pitt students are so lucky to have this beautiful historical landmark in our fair city.  As soon as you step in you're just blown away by the architecture of this place.  I appreciate modern buildings, but you just feel like there's so much history packed into these kinds of spaces.  \n\nIf you're a Pittsburgher and haven't come to check the Cathedral out, you really should take a walk around.  I'm sure if you're a Pitt student you may feel as if you should set up a cot in one of the rooms you've been there so much.  Either way, it's still pretty to look at!  Even if you're daydreaming in class.\n\nOK, now funny story time....\n\nI was riding the Mon Incline back home one day and was stuck on it with some tourists (happens a lot in the summer).  This woman was pointing out landmarks for her friends\/family.  She turned towards Oakland and said, \"that's the Cathedral of Learning.\"  She was pointing directly towards a radio tower.  I know I was rude, but I couldn't let her be so wrong.  So I said, \"actually the Cathedral is a little more to the right.\"  I wanted to say, \"to the right of that radio tower\" but I held myself back for fear of going over the edge of rudeness.  In my heart I just felt like she was doing a tour guide disservice to her captive audience.  I know I was probably just being rude.  \n\nAnyway, find a knowledgeable tour guide or Pitt student and head over to the Cathedral, it's better than a visit to a radio tower!
