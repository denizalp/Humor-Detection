Not quite Café, or cafeteria, or grocery store... It's a groceteria! Is that seriously a thing? Is this a made up word? The world may never know, but luckily after reading this review, you'll know that it's a good place to go if you're looking for any of those things!\n\nFOOD!\nThey've got a really solid kitchen, pumping out tasty goods to eat there or take away with you, and they're often bustling about getting ready to cater some fancy-pants party. (Fancy-pants party throwers take note.)\n\nGROCERY!\nIf you're looking for a really great selections of all things adult (excluding \"beverages\" and \"entertainment\") ...I'm talking adult food here, like, stanky cheeses, olives, charcuterie, forcefully fattened duck\/duck\/goose liver, (fois gras,) and fungi that can be found only by trained pigs, (Truffles!), you're in a in a great place. Sorry for making all these things sound less sexy than they really are, they're all by far my favourite things to put in my face, ever.\n\nThey've got a decent, little selection of organic and local produce and meats as well making it a possible to do a fully high-end product refrigerator restock.\n\nCOFFEE!\nThey've got a full on Café section complete with Barristers. Objection! I mean Baristas - that will making you a smoking cup of joe so tasty it should be illegal. Is it? I don't know - time to let the other guys step in.\n\nIt's a great place to meet for a quick lunch, take a meeting and pick up some Mans Eggs. It's a local supplier.
