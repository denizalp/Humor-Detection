Oh my gosh, we are so happy this place opened!!!! We eat here about 3x a week, normally we get a to-go order  of the crying tiger, two orders of the sweet sticky rice, and order of the #13 soup medium hot and two large THAI Ice Tea's....YUMMM!!!! The dining room experience is nice and the people are very friendly. If you are in East Mesa- for sure visit swan thai!
