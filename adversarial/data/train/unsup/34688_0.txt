This new location is absolutely wonderful ! The d√©cor is modern industrial very sleek and tasteful with the high ceiling and the display of drinks . So much attention was pouring into the details such as the matching chair and stools , the little station tucked in corner for pour over , vintage bikes on the back wall  , the subtle blend in of the beautiful art work . I found Its hard not to fall in love with this place .  \nThe barista was cheerful and very patient . After I decided to order the cappuccino I glanced at the drinking menu on the counter so I started debating maybe go for one of their selection of pour overs , looking more exotic with good amount of choices. I also inquire about where is the bean from the one they use for espressos  ( they have more than 3 kinds of beans for espresso ) with the info I happily decided to go with the cappuccino. He smiled at me and said I could come back to try the pour over ! I am always grateful for people who has patient could tolerant my indecisiveness also I am fond of the informative and the knowledge they passed along . I was more than happy with my cappuccino , adding a bit of honey its complex with balanced acidity
