We love watching Guy on Triple D and his name is what brought us to the restaurant.  I have to say that the food was amazing (Mac-n-cheese burger and the Motley Que).  Last time we were here we are at Burgr, but Guys place was hands down better.\n\nThe only thing that was better than the food was the service, Chris Anderson and Elliott took care of us and they were both above and beyond expectations.\n\nAs a matter of fact my wife and I are going back tonight to try more selections off the menu.
