LOVE this place!\n\nThe White Brick Kitchen has never disappointed me. I love the coziness of it and all of the servers have been great!\n\nFor brunch, the Scotch-ish Eggs are AMAZING!\n\nFor dinner, their Vegan Country Captain is a delicious stew that can satisfy any belly (even a non-Vegan one) on a cold night. Their Shepard's Pie is also super yummy!\n\nDefinitely go here!!!
