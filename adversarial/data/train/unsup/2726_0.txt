I will always love Golfland\/Sunsplash and I'm not ashamed to admit it.  Although I wish it wasn't filled with dirty, screaming kids that pee in the water, I still find it to be pretty darn fun. \n\nIn my younger years, the crazy water slides that made you feel as if you were about to catch air and plummet to your certain death at any moment were my favorite.  Now, you'll find me in the lazy river. \n\nI see nothing wrong with lying in an inner tube as the water pulls you around a stream over and over again.  \n\nBring lots of sun block and reapply it often or you will surely burn to a crisp. \n\nThe Waikiki beach with its huge waves is fun too, but it is filled with so many people that it's usually better to stick to the less popular attractions if you don't want to get hit by flaying limbs.
