(edited on 11\/17\/12)\n\nI have been there about 7 times. I like to sit outside - to watch Bellagio fountain show. \n\nFood quality wise, you can't compare to Robuchon or Bouchon - Mon Ami Gabi is a French version of Denny's. That's for sure. Or maybe worse... \n\nI've had Ground Ahi Tuna Burger and Bacon Cheese Burger - nothing special, nothing better than burgers at Hard Rock Cafe.\n\nI've had seafood crepe - it is OK. Seafood is not fresh. Could be using frozen seafood.\n\nGratin - greasy - heavy - rich - if you like to gain fat, this should be fine. I am worried if someone get heart attack. \n\nTrout - i remembered it was no good. \n\nFish and Chips - very thin sliced fish make it pretty greasy. Kinda same as one at Todd English at Aria. (it was my fault to get fish&chips at French bistro, yo know)\n\n(newly edited) \n\nI USED to like all their mousse and pate - along with oysters to pair with wine - with a great fountain view. However, I went back and it was a huge disappointment.\n\nJumbo Shrimp Cocktail - when the server put the dish on our table, something was wrong - shrimps looked kinda brown - we thought it was some sort of spices,,, then as soon as we ate it, we realized that it was an unfresh, oxidized shrimp! It tasted like dirt. Horrible! I'm sure they use the same old shrimps for other dishes. Gross!\n\nLiver Mousse and Pate - I guess no one orders these items here - I could tell because all the edges were all dried out - pretty disgusting. \n\nEndive salad - It is not a great experience to have green leaves turn brown and wilt. \n\nMussels - bad,,,,, They didn't break my expectation. NOT FRESH! At this point, I was concerned about food poisoning. So, I asked to get a check. It was enough...\n\nWhen the food, especially seafood, gets old, they should throw them away - because you know, there is a risk of spreading food poisoning! Don't give me these stained shrimps, dude.\n\nBtw, frites are better than Lay's potato chips. Complimentary Baguette is pretty terrible. You can get better baguettes cheaper at Albertson's.\n\nMy suggestion - never get seafood here if you know what decent seafood tastes like. Just get burgers - cheap and simple. I guess those people who are giving 5 stars just eat burgers and steaks, not seafood. \n\nService - not that great - too busy all the time - my server wasn't nice at all - she didn't stop at our table. No refills. I saw she was chatting for a while at another table, tho. \n\nYou will see all the men in black here - they indeed look professional in a funny way - but imagine if they change it to Denny's uniforms - surly enough, they would fit really well.\n\nAlso, when I made a reservation today (Sat. Nov 10 2012 around lunch time), the hostess was really rude over the phone.  This is Karma on Yelp, haha.\n\nI have been going there to see Bellagio, not to enjoy food and service, but it was way too terrible.... I will never go back again.\n\n1 star is for Bellagio's fountain show.
