This Medical office is the worst in the Valley. You can't get in to been seen when you are sick. you can only walk in then what ever doctor you get becomes your new doctor. That is ridiculous. The wait times are horrible. the book keeping is horrible I received a bill for 2 copays from 6 months earlier that I paid at time of service. Good thing I used my credit card and kept the receipt. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
