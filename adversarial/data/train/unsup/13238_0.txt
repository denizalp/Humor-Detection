This place is supposedly for pizza, but I'm going to let you in on a secret.\n\nSure, their pizzas are \"VPN certified\", sure they're pretty good, but the real hype here should be for their spicy meatballs.\nDear lord.\nThe meatballs are made with a blend of meat and some other spice--rosemary? I don't know, but it's fragrant. They come with a slightly crispy slab of garlic bread and spicy tomato sauce.\n\nIs it juvenile for me to like meatballs? Because if it is, then I am so totally underage.
