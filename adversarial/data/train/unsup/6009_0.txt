Since my first review we've gone here three more times.  On two occasions we got the table by the big bay window, and that was awesome!  We ordered what we usually order every time we go there, and it was outstanding.  Before I had mentioned how unimpressed I was with the longgggg wait time, however, we've discovered the secret!!  Don't go around the typical meal times!  *duhhhh!*
