Truly get what you pay for. Room carpets filthy. Furniture must be 15 years old and shows it. Water stain in popcorn ceiling. Toilet seat old and loose. \n\nPlus: newer flat 32\" screen TV. Bed not too bad; not firm but not too saggy.   Refrigerators on request at no charge. \nPaid less than $20 weeknight (plus $15 resort fee) and got high floor.  At least I found general cleanliness ok (carpet excepted). \n\nBooked here because they had access balconies but the doors have all been permanently secured. \n\nFinding the registration lobby from the parking garage needs map and turn by turn directions. Worst ever journey from self park to lobby.  Very poor signage.   Once it's figured out, not nearly as confusing. Although the self park entrance \/ exit from Koval is a nightmare. \n\nI know Caesars recently took over and they're spending millions but they have a long way to go. \n\nWould probably upgrade next time, except already in a deluxe room. I guess there's actually worse.
