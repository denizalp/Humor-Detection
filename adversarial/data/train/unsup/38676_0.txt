I called this place to place a cake order. First of all, the person who answered the phone answered, \"Hello?\" I had to ask if I was calling a bakery. It was so loud, I could barely hear him. After confirming I was calling the right place, I told him I needed to place an order for a cake. He put me on hold. A couple minutes later, he was back on the phone and asked \"Sorry, what did you need again?\" I again said I needed to place an order. He responded, \"Okay, I'll have her call you back.\" I asked if he needed my number. He confirmed that he did, and then put me on hold AGAIN. Mind you, the entire time I still can barely hear him, because it is SO loud. I hold for about a minute. I come back on and, after obtaining my number, he says \"Okay so you want to pick up your cake early?\" For the third time I told him I needed to order a cake. He told me Scarlet would call me back. As soon as I hung up, I called another place and put my $350 order with them. Scarlet never called me back.
