Sometimes I wake up just really craving some Korean food. \n\nI'm glad i found his spot not to far from my home!! \n\nWent in yesterday and ordered my self a bibimbap. I don't know why but I absolutely love the idea of a rice and toppings inside a ridiculously hot stone bowl.  Maybe it's all the crispy bits of rice that form at the bottom. \n\nOnly thing I didn't like about this place you are limited to 2 sides of banchan (at a time?) I don't like having to choose sides. \n\nI will be back though and very soon!!
