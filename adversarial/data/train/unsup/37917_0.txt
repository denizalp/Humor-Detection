My fiance come here often. It's the place that 3 years ago I started to fall in love with him,  so the place is special to us. \nWe love the casual atmosphere,  comfy seating, Eddie the dog, the loaded fries platter, etc.\nThe drinks are great.  My favorite is the cucumber mojito,  which isn't crazy priced like their other beverages. \nLast time we went,  we ordered some new drinks to try out something different. ....MISTAKE. The drinks were tasty BUT we had zero idea that our drinks were about $20 a piece...wow... neither were blow you off your feet epic to warrant that pricing..period.\nWe'll still come back but we'll be less likely to try new drinks as we do not want a billion dollar beverage bill at the end for having a couple drinks.  Lol
