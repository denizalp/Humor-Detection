I have removed my 5 star rating from The Martini. After several visits, we have learned that it isn't the \"friendly\" neighborhood bar we thought it was. While their drinks are VERY good, the treatment of customers is not so good.  If you tip the bar staff with each drink, you get exceptional service, but if you withhold the tip until you pay your tab in full, they tend to treat you like an unwanted visitor.  Even going so far as to turn the music off when your selections come up.  We have been told they don't like Southerners or Texans. We did move here from the Boston area, but are FROM Texas\/Georgia. Our accents and music preferences gave it away.  So if you are a Southerner, beware.  While we now live in NV, they make us feel unwanted to the extreme that we will never return to this establishment.  Our money will be spent elsewhere.
