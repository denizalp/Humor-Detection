I don't eat 'bad' around the holidays for good reason. However, I have people around me that wish to sabotage the wonderful principles I have about eating healthy and not stuff myself throughout the entire year, by bringing home items like cookies, pies, cupcakes and cinnamon rolls. More recently this physique destruction has been in the form of cookies from Cookies in Bloom. \n\nThey're are so amazing, just all that you could want in a Christmas cookie and more. I've eaten about two so far, and about to have another right now! And their design are just so adorable. I felt really bad biting into that snowman's behind, but he asked for it. And $3\/per cookie makes you feel really guilty if you don't eat them, since the person that bought them decided they weren't exactly what they were looking for. (My mom is secretly jealous of my size 2 figure...)\n\nThese fun cookies also come arranged in baskets and designed for all holidays and occasions. I'm really trying to watch it, but I can't resist them...you know, Bikram's can only do so much for you when you overly eat sugary sweets like this on purpose.
