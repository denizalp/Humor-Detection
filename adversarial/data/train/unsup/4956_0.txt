Excellent customer service. I tried calling this morning but realized they didn't open until 10am. At 9:50am I received a text and a missed call from them. When I finally was able to get back with them they were very helpful and gave me a quote for my phone glass repair. \n\nI went right after work and they fixed me up. When I called the front desk informed me that they didn't have the same color as my phone but I said it was fine. However after I got there the owner called and said he found a silver piece but it would take an extra 20 minutes for him to pick it up. I was fine with black but I thought it was really nice for them to offer to try to get the same color. \n\nIt can get kind of boring to wait without a phone but they have movies to watch so the time goes by quicker. Note: Bring cash! They have an ATM but it charges a fee. \n\nHighly recommend for all your phone repairs. Staff is extremely knowledgeable. A customer that was leaving as I arrived was on his 7th repair. Crazy!
