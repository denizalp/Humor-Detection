I love Ramen Isshin, for its Service, Food, and Ambiance.\n\nSERVICE - top-notch\n\n1. The servers are always so friendly (as you'd expect from an authentic Japanese restaurant). \n\n2. They will accommodate your needs. I don't want to trouble them too much, but if you ask for \"less salty broth\" or \"package half of the okonomiyaki to go\", they will help accommodate. \n\n\nFOOD - unbeatable selection\n\n1. Ramen: you have several broth to choose from. On top of the tradition 3 salt (shio), soy sauce (shoyu), and miso, it also has the Tan Tan (Chinese-Japanese hybrid with sesame and chili) version to choose from. \n\n* also note, you can ask for Kaedama for an extra round of noodles for when you have broth leftover.\n\n2. Okonomiyaki: much better than Okonomi House. This item is in the menu, but since it doesn't have a picture, it's kind of hidden under the Appetizer section. I could be wrong, but I think this is the Osaka-style okonomiyaki.\n\n3. Karaage: the deep fried chicken is the best I've had. It's very crispy, and has deeply soaked flavour. \n\n4. Mango Pudding: a little expensive at $3.80, but it's definitely worth it to get this freshly made daily dessert. The cool, sweet taste perfectly complements the hot, salty ramen you had earlier. \n\n\nAMBIANCE - comforting\n\nThe wooden interior, with ink calligraphy on the walls teleports you away from the Downtown rush. I especially love the wooden spoons for the ramen. So much better than silverware to keep you immersed.\n\n\nIn summary, Ramen Isshin keeps me going back to it again and again. Sometimes, I go back twice in one day...
