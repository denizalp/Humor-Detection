Love this hidden gem in Mississauga. Been here a handful of times. I've tried the Masala burger, Masala fries, Cajun fries, and Apple Butter burger. \n\nYou can tell this place knows what they're doing. The beef patties are made fresh and it's made obvious by how the beef crumbles, the way ground beef should. The bun is nice, warm, and fluffy. The Masala burger is my favourite as the seasoning gives the burger so much depth of flavour. Could have been spicier, but it tastes great nonetheless. The Apple butter burger for me was decent, couldn't quite taste the apple and to me it tasted very much like plain ol' BBQ sauce. It is still very good and I would order that if I'm craving for something saucey.\n\nThe fries are good because of the seasoning, although they could be crispier. I prefer the Masala, but Cajun is very good too. This is my favourite burger joint in Mississauga with Golden Star in North York a close second.
