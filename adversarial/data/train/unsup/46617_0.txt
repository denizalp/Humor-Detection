Spaghetti n meatballs, too blend n no flavor, meatballs taste it was made couple of days old in the fridge. $25 for tasteless spaghetti is not worth. My 12 year old niece can make better than this \n\nFried calamari, taste not bad bcuz of the sauce. Without the sauce will be tasteless. \n\nMushroom pizza, Bloody damn salty and watery. It's not from cheese it's from inside. Felt like I was they were serving frozen pizza. $18 mushroom pizza, I had to return it bcuz it was damn salty\n\nI ordered Italian pizza, which is I had to wait but it's okay. As soon as pizza arrived, \nFirst pizza was burnt underneath the pizza n over cooked. I had to cut it with the knife to get a slice.\nSecond, as soon as I pull out the slice of pizza, all the topping n cheese fall off from the pizza, only left with burnt pizza dough. \nThird, I had to cut pizza with hand, it rips pizza like it does not look like a pizza. \n\nI spoke with the manager (Asian person), his cool. I felt bad for telling him. Return the pizza twice. I love pizza but this was the bad pizza I have had. \n\nFood is zero quality\nPpl, they are cool. \nI would give them 2 or 3 star range but yelp is all about food and venue, I would rate them 2 stars\n\nThey need to change the menu or change the chef\nAnd make every fresh from scratch.\n\nManager comp all the food. I was expecting that but will left tip for the server. $26 tips. \n\nBad part, I had to run to restroom after bcuz my stomach was hurting
