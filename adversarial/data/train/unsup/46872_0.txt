The atmosphere is lively with great Spanish music. The chicken chicharr√≥n was delicious as was the braised short rib dinner. I added yucca onion Brussels sprout  fries which did not disappoint. I was surprised as I don't like sprouts but loved this. My friend ordered the empanada and we didn't really like them. Great place.
