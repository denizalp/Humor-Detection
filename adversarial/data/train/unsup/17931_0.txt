After we visited the garden my friend told me I had to try the best lemonade, so we headed off to Gertrude's, its right at the entrance\/exit of the Botanical Gardens,  we were shown table on the inside but had a view of the patio outside, it was perfect. Also learned that Gertrude's was a farm to plate place, using ingredients fresh from the farms around Arizona. \n\nI swear I only went to try the lemonade, but I am a sucker for eggs benedict so when I saw them on the brunch menu I knew I had to try them! By the way, the berry lemonade, it's pretty amazing, even if you are someone who does not like lemons, or lemonade (like me) take my word on this, you will love it! It was lemonade, fresh herbs and fresh berries, and it was perfect and refreshing! \nGertie's Benedicts was a visually beautiful dish, English muffin , house-made Canadian bacon, spinach, poaches eggs drizzled with hollandaise sauce served with fingerling potatoes, and this dish tasted as good as it looked! Fresh and delish!  We also ordered a bowl of fresh fruit & coconut mint syrup, this too was great tasting!\n\nThis was a great find and glad I had the chance to try them out!
