OMFG. This is my favorite sushi in town. We brought family out of town here for lunch and they were pleased and extremely satisfied! We shared an array of rolls including the spicy tuna roll, spider roll, California, sexy crab, etc. Also enjoyed some miso soup, seaweed salad, and a couple of Kawabas (delicious Japanese kolsch style beer)! Not our first time here, and certainly not our last! Thanks to all the staff for creating a great experience for us!!!
