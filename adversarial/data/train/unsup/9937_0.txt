So I am a huge fan of Dive bars...  If you are not, then maybe this place won't tickle your fancy as much as it tickled mine.  Let me say that this place embodies the spirit of cleveland.  Blue collar, open to everyone, neighbors chatting with neighbors, accepting to everyone, laughs all around!  \nSo we walk in after starting at the Velvet Tango Room.  That is some place you gotta take out of towners but not a place to hang out if you know what I mean.  Check it off your list and be gone.  So we wandered around the corner and found this cool brewery apparently owned by the same people that own the Duck Island Club. I think.  It was huge.  It was getting late not sure I remember correctly lol. \nAnyway, we have a few brews and snacks and wander over to the Duck Island club.  The age of our group was from 28 ish, to 80.  Yeah go figure.  So we get lubed up across the street and walk in ready to go.  The bar was full.  IT was crowded but not uncomfortable.  Literally all ages and types in there.  We order drinks and maybe some shots...  Everyone is talking and pretty soon a 20 something college student with a 40 of miller in starts chatting up my 80 year old mom.  They are laughing and gesturing.  Wonderful.  There is an old jukebox on the wall and people are feeding it.  Wait, shots all around...  Ok.  Then someone pops in Stacey's Mom on the jukebox and the entire bar breaks out singing. Soon were doing shots with the bartender and a collection of locals who are now our new best friends.  Laughs all around.  Met a good bunch of very nice, very fun and just good people in there.  Wandered out some time after 1 might have been pushing 2 am.  UBER guy met us right out front.  It was snowing and gorgeous.  What a fun night!  Can't wait to go back there!
