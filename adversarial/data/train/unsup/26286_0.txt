Imagine going to McDonalds for a Big Mac and finding out they've decided to only serve that particular sandwich (their most popular) once or twice a week.  That's what purchasing bread at Great Harvest Bread Company is like.  Well, no...that's what Great Harvest would be like if the girl behind the counter was flipping you off with a smile on her face at the same time.\n\nIn my opinion, their best item (besides their oatmeal chocolate chip cookies) is their loaf of Cheddar Garlic bread.  It's quite possibly the only reason why I still stop by this place anytime I'm in the area.  However, it's been a few years and I figured they may have replaced that item in that time.  So, I called one of their locations and was told that they still serve that particular bread on Wednesdays and Saturdays.\n\nThis past Saturday, my father was looking for breadbowls for a soup his wife had prepared and I suggested Great Harvest.  We walked in and each got our complimentary piece of bread by the rudest girl that I have ever been helped by.  I looked at their racks and noticed a lack of Cheddar Garlic bread.  At this point, my sister asked the same girl if they had any in the store to purchase.  She responded with a scoff...\"I only make that bread on Thursdays.\"  Trust me when I say that you informing me that this item is unavailable will hardly lead to a meltdown on my part.  What I can't handle, however, is your show of annoyance at my inquiries and complete lack of customer service.  I not only won't be back, but I'll make sure to provide any friends, business contacts or general aquaintances with an alternative business that is only too happy to treat their customers as if they're actually wanted.
