I hate to do this because this has been the place that I compare every other Chinese place to. I've been getting the chicken fried rice from here for 12~ years. I ordered it again today. \n\nI got home ten min later and my car seat was covered in oil. The bag bottom was drenched in oil. The container was styrofoam rather than the usual box. It had leaked oil everywhere. The rice tastes absolutely terrible and I had to throw 3\/4 of it out. \n\nI don't know what's happened here but it makes me upset. I won't give up on you just yet, but I threw away $7 today.
