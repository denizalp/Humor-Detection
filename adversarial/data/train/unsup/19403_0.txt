Ordered 8 entries from this location through Eat24. Estimated delivery time was 45-600 minutes. An hour later received a call from Eat24 that this location is backed up and my order was transferred to Rainbow location. 20 minutes later, a call from Eat24 again: sorry but the new location doesn't carry items from your order. Ok, fine, I chose something else. 10 minutes later a call from the new location: Oh we just want to verify your order and will get to it asap. Really? I ordered an hour and a half ago and my order has not even been started! I will not even await for the food to give a rating. It's a one star since I can't give less and I will not order from them again even if the food is absolutely amazing!
