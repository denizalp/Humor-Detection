Had a wonderful dinner here last week. Service was great-very friendly and helpful. Ambiance is amazing-cozy lounges outside and in, beautiful decor and black and white films projected in the rooms. The food is also delicious, specifically the fried chicken which even made my vegetarian sister drool. Wooo-eee! Can't wait to return for more!
