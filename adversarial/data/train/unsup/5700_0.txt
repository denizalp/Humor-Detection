I'm not particularly emotionally-invested in the South Point, and they already have like a thousand reviews, so I'm just gonna keep this one to bullets.\n\nPROS\n-Decent movie theatre, and it's not a Regal\n-Decent late-night coffee shop\n-Cheap place\n-Pretty OK rooms, especially when the price is considered\n\nCONS\n-lackluster gaming (no full-pay video poker, for example)\n-so-so food \n-parking is often a hassle and a walk, and the valet isn't quick\n-it feels like a giant, discount gambling warehouse.\n\nAnd that last one is the one that seals it up for me. For whatever reason, I don't particularly like being in there. Doesn't mean I don't go, I just don't enjoy it very much. So yeah, pretty much the definition of 3 stars, as far as I'm concerned.
