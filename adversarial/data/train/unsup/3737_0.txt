This is my third time to this location. They're great. Jason and Mike are the chiropractors usually at this location. Both are professional, courteous, and attentive. I've seen Jason 3 times and my back is much for it. Porcha, at the front desk, is kind. They can implement various forms of re-alignment of subluxation. It's a great service and plans are available. I took the $49\/mo plan, 4 visits for that price.
