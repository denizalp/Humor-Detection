I have been twice since it opened, the first time we went they made a couple mistakes on our order, but they were quickly rectified and it was understandable since everyone there is new. The food has been excellent with good pricing. It's clean with a fun atmosphere. If you simply compare to Baja Fresh and their pricing it's easy to see how much more you get for your money at Wahoos.
