Meh...  I've had better.  \n\nThe decor was pleasant and trendy, and the waitresses seemed very friendly (well except for the guy who sat us, he looked like he really didn't give a crap if we were there or not), but the food was just meh...  \n\nI had the lemonade and it was a perplexing mixture of not enough lemon or sweetener.  It tasted so watered down that I wasn't even sure it was lemonade, and the sweetness was just barely there.  I even asked the waitress what it was to confirm that I actually received the lemonade.  (Everyone is raving about it here though, so I must've had a VERY bad batch... ?)\n\nWe shared some cheese curds and they were very tasty.  Horribly greasy, but quite tasty.\n\nI got the lobster mac and cheese.  My macaroni noodles were mushy, the cheese was too greasy (puddle at the bottom of the bowl) and salty, the lobster was overcooked and chewy and the whole bowl was boiling hot; a tell tale sign it had either been under a heat lamp or microwaved.  Not exactly the wonderfulness on a fork that I envisioned.\n\nMy husband got the meatloaf that was on special that night.  The red sauce that it was swimming in was very spicy in an acidic way (which is not a good thing) and the acidic nature of the red sauce clashed badly with the more muted, cheesy scalloped potatoes that accompanied the meatloaf.\n\nOverall this as a pretty weak (and expensive) experience at a restaurant that I had MUCH higher hopes for.   \n\nI'll try it one more time to be fair and then I'll decide for good if I just hit it on a bad night, or if it's just a case of 'average food in a trendy setting, being over hyped by soulless hipsters who (in a bitter twist of irony) have almost NO taste of their own'...  \n\nProbably the case.
