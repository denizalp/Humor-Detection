While the food and drinks are average at hot taco it's all a gamble about what type of service you will receive with it. When we arrived at hot taco there was a wait, so we went to the bar. The bartender was extremely nice and attentive, we got some drinks and she was nice enough to bring us chips and salsa. When our table was ready we asked to be moved to a booth (I had two large men in our party, the table was a bit too small), the hostess rolled her eyes, sighed and said I can clean one off when I get to it. So after watching her clean our table, I had to ask if it was ready. We sat at our booth for 20 minutes without an acknowledgment, literally nothing so much as a hello. One of the people in my party let an employee know we hadn't been served and she said, let me check on it. After another 10 minutes without service we decided to leave. On the way out, we let a few servers know about our situation, they could care less about he poor service, like the rest of the staff. It doesn't matter how average the food is, if the employees don't care for our service then they don't deserve mine.
