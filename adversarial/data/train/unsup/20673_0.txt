I wish I would have read the reviews before buying my Groupon to this place. Scam! I made an appointment with the receptionist and requested that my exam and cleaning be on the same day because I live almost an hour away. The day of the appointment they couldn't find me on the schedule and said they have the wrong number for me on file (which ended up being the correct number) and that they tried calling me several times. 40 minutes later I get called back to get my exam. The hygienist said that she would only have time for the exam and not the cleaning. I told her that I specifically asked for both because I live so far. She apologized and said that if I were to come in at 9 like I was scheduled, that I would have been able to do both. I told her that it was scheduled for 10am, not 9am and luckily had saved the voicemail and had her listen. She apologized and said there is still nothing she could do. After the exam she tells me I wouldn't have been able to do the Groupon cleaning anyway because I needed the deep cleaning and that I have 10 cavities (never had a cavity in my life) that will need to get filled. She told me to wait in the waiting room until I was called back in. I went back in and was given a quote for $3,000 worth of dental work. I asked if I would still be able to get the Groupon cleaning and she said that if they did the Groupon cleaning and not the deep cleaning that it would \"go against the practice\".
