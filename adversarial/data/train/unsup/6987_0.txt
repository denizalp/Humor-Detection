Loved everything about this restaurant: the atmosphere, the food, the service.  It was all perfect.  I had the Udon Noodles with Chicken.   it was really delicious and the serving size was great.  My friend, Pam, had the Pad Thai Noodles and seemed to enjoy them.  The server kept checking in to see that everything was okay and she kept refilling my iced tea.  Impeccable.  I loved the masks and wall adornments.   There are two main seating areas in the restaurant, both very inviting.  Not many people were there when we were, so it was rather quiet and very good for conversation.   That's a good thing, since we talked for three hours straight and could have easily gone another two!  I drove from South Charlotte to get to Kung Foo Noodle and it was worth every mile.   The restaurant is in the back of Birkdale Village and was easy to find.   Can't wait to return to try some of the other exciting dishes that were on the menu.   Two Thumbs Up, FER SURE!
