Okay, first off, Rachel was flippin' awesome!! My buddy and I had second thoughts about this place after we had ordered our beers so we talked to Rachel about it and told her that we didn't quite understand the menu. She explained to us how the menu worked and recommended a few items. Rachel was amazing! Have I said that enough times already?! No!! She was the only reason why we stuck around and ordered so much food, it was crazy! Rachel was courteous, patient, and understanding! I, myself being in the service industry, really appreciated the effort Rachel put in to dealing with difficult customers like us. I mean, seriously, we're always very indecisive! I would come back to Cibo's every time I'm in Calgary only because Rachel works here! Thanks Rachel!!\n\nI guess everyone wants to know how the food was. It was awesome! We got the Rotisserie Chicken with Blood Orange glaze and the Beef Sirloin, then to finish off, we had the most delicious Tiramisu I've had in a long long time! Tiramisu is highly recommended!\n\nGreat service and food overall!
