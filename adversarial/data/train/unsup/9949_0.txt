I knew better than to bring a small party to Buca di Gutbombâ„¢, but was overruled and 3 of us had dinner here. With the massive \"family style\" portions these guys serve, 3 is just too small of a party, unless you order carefully (and I'm not sure that's actually possible). We ordered a pepperoni pizza, which was a giant lake of grease and just wasn't very good, a salad that would have fed 5-6 people and was marginal at best, and something else that was forgettable. Tab was huge, service was glacial, the entire experience lousy. Definitely won't be back.
