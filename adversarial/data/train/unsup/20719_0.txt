After many hours of research and reading reviews, we found Daniel and the Myriad Group online and decided to send an email to request information. We were delighted to hear back from Daniel within a couple of hours and so our \"Exploration\" journey began.  Danny and the staff were friendly and professional throughout the entire process, and we never felt alone in our journey.  We have purchased several homes in the past and realize that things can be stressful and overwhelming, but not this time. Daniel went above and beyond to ensure that we found the home we wanted and was there to guide us the entire way.  Before we met to view homes, he provided us with lists of homes to view online, then he spent several days driving us all around Phoenix to familiarize us with the city and the suburbs and to view the homes that were of interest to us.  He explained the different rules and regulations that apply to the state of Arizona.  After making an offer on our new house, Danny negotiated with the sellers to get us the best possible deal. After opening escrow, he continued to follow up and guide us through the entire process till closing.  He was present at the closing, turning over of the keys and he even presented us with a welcome home gift.  Daniel's personality is fantastic and we would recommend him to anyone who is in search of a home in the Phoenix area.
