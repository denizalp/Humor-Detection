We have been taking out son to the Gilbert office to see Dr. Kent, who we love.  Our daughter was born 7 days ago and today is her first day out of the hospital.  The Gilbert office was booked so we were referred to the chandler office.  Long story short, we showed up 15 minutes early to fill out paperwork, we did not see the doctor until after an hour plus of waiting.  When she finally came she did not introduce herself or apologize for making us wait for an hour with our newborn.  Two things that I would assume to be common since.  We love dr Kent but with her leaving, there is absolutely no reason to trust these people with my children's well being.  2.5 hours total time out for 1 newborn doctors appointment.  So, do yourself and child a favor, throw a dart and find a better practice.
