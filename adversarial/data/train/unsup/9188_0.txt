This is as good as it gets because the price for the quantity is actually redick. Cobb salad....small...4.20.... if you check my pic you will see the size of this so called \"small\" salad..... I will never buy take out salad again from anywhere else but this place. The line up can get crazy but the people that work there are speedy gonzales styles and i just LOVE it. You can sub stuff in and out and there is no extra cost! like this place is wonders and other salad houses should take some tips (AHEM FRESHII) And if your thinking of going to Longo's and hitting there salad bar DONT DO IT cause its so not worth it. You can get 2 times that at this place for literally half the price. The Large salads here are actually unreal. I dont know how anyone finishes them. I also dont know how the place makes money, They are loading on the toppings....3 spoons full of Avacado.... like huh?? just wicked\n\nyou can get salads as wraps too and they have some soup...dont pass up this place. Its in cumberland terrace....if you enter from Yonge st go straight down the hall...its beside the soup place. If your in cumberland its on the top floor.
