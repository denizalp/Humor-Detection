I have drove by this place a hundred times, after reading these reviews I finally decided to venture in. What a mistake. This place is the worst of everything, high prices small servings , horrible food and a mind numbing slow kitchen. 45 minutes to get our food and the place was empty two other tables going \nEven after sending back a entree and a appetizer which where inedible, bill was still over 60.00, for two plates of paper thin chicken breasts. I could write more about this dump, but why waste the time.
