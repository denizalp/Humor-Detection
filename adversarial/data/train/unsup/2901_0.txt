The Liberty has an amazing atmosphere. Unfortunately it is at that point you should turn around and leave, because the experience will often only get worse.\n\nOn our latest visit, several opted for a high-top table in the bar, where we watched one server clean a table - three times - and multiple servers pile dirty plates onto another table. Maybe the kitchen had no room for dirty plates. Yet for some reason they didn't want to speak to us, as clearing tables seemed to take a priority. It could have been us, and that is okay, but it doesn't speak highly about their service.\n\nAfter we were asked about drinks - and we did place an appetizer order - we eventually received the drinks, which ran dry before we ever saw someone again, and the food never did come out. Since the appetizer order was ignored and the drinks were never refilled, we opted to ask for the check and leave.\n\nJust another disappointment at The Liberty.
