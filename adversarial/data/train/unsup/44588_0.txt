Not going back.  Went on a sunday so we got the seafood buffet.  The crab (served cold) barely tasted like crab.  Shrimp was ok (how do you mess up peel and eat shrimp?).  The rest of the seafood was pretty bad.  Over cooked scallops.  Dry fish.  \n\nOther than the ribs, all of the other meat was dry and overcooked.\n\nI was eating with family and we had 9 people.  Got stuck with an 18% gratuity charge because apparently it's harder to pull plates on a table of 8 or more.  It must be because we ended up putting our used plates, after we had filled up a new plate and come back, on the table next to us.  After we were done eating they left the plates.  \n\nDesserts were the best part but not worth the $150 we paid for 2 adults, a 12 year old girl that doesn't eat much and a 10 year old.  No, we didn't order anything to drink other than water.  I don't expect much from buffets normally but this one was a disappointment.....especially for the price.
