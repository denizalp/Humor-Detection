We came early (around 10:30), so it was quiet. The seating area was very clean and well lit.\n\nThe girl making my salad was pleasant enough. She was really quiet though, so I felt like I kept repeating \"what?\" Which was kind of annoying.\n\nOnly thing I really dislike is that they are REALLY skimpy on the toppings. This isn't our first time here and it's by far the \"smallest\" salads we've ever had (by small I mean toppings - always PLENTY of lettuce lol).\n\n$24 for 2 chicken salads and 2 drinks. Decent enough. We'll be back. It's a nice switch from burgers or tacos.
