Way overpriced. We were surprised to find out we were charged about $3 for the ranch and blue cheese that came with our wings. Well vodka and tonic was almost $6. Beer was even more. Coke was $3. Service was ok. Fries and wings were so so. I wouldn't go back. Ended up being $50 for a coke, a beer, one well drink, two orders of wings and an order of fries. Pricey for a mediocre lunch for two.
