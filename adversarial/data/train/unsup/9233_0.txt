I ordered the Spolumbo's Special Italian Panini to go just before closing. After getting to my destination I eagerly unwrapped the sandwich expecting meaty deliciousness. Instead, I got a roll with lettuce, tomato and cheese. Was there Mortadella - NO! Salami-NO! Proscuitto - NO! Capocollo - NO!\n\n The sandwich maker forgot to put any of the meat on the sandwich!\n\nSeriously, how clueless do you have to be to forget to put meat on a meat sandwich? Unless I feel like unwrapping and inspecting all take out orders before I leave the premises from now on it is probably easier to just go someplace else.\n\nEpic fail.
