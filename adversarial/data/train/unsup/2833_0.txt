Stayed last week for 2 nights. We had the offer for a $75 food and beverage credit when we booked the room but I totally forgot all about this up until recently. This was never mentioned during check in, no emails, or additional information was given throughout our stay which would've come in handy since we ended up ordering several times through Postmates instead just to get additional good and beverage delivered to our room. \n\nAnyways the city view was nice to say the least. Majority of the view is mostly of a construction (for ninja warrior) across the lot but the strip itself was visible enough. The AC takes a while to cool up the room but the cleaning lady was nice enough to clean up after our mess that we gave her a well deserved $20 tip. One of the guys that hails the cabs on the taxi que was also great. He remembered and would always ask about how the previous night at the (whichever) hotel we went to went. Now it may just be because we kept tipping him, or it may just be that he's an awesome dude, but either way, it was much appreciated. \n\nThe hotels location in general was both a good and a bad thing. Cabs always gave us the option to go through the strip or go trough the back which made going between mandalay and our destination much easier. It was just too bad that there weren't any decent nearby food places that was within a quick walking range. \n\nOh and the Uber pickup\/drop off is just by the front which makes it less of a hassle if you want to use that. \n\nOverall, we might stay here again the next time. Just bummed that we never received that $75 food\/beverage credit
