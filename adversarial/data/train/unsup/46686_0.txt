This is currently my second favorite buffet to eat at. The quality of the food really impressed me, in fact its probably the best quality food I've eaten. I just rank Rio's as number one since theres more variety there. The fact that they offer gelato here makes them a winner in my book. And the price for the buffet is reasonable compared to the other overpriced ones that aren't even that great. Go here. I definitely think this one is underrated.
