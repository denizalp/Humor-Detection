In the middle of New York\/New York hotel and casino you will find Greenberg's Deli.  Bottom line, it was good food at a decent price (at least for Vegas).\n\nI just wanted something quick, and they delivered in the form of a warm pastrami sandwich.  It was totally filling and not fatty.  As you stand in line you can watch as they shave the meat, everything tasted fresh, the bread was really good and I was genuinely happy.\n \nThis is not a restaurant type of place but there are tables that you can sit at and it's very casual.  Plenty of nearby people watching.  :) \n\nI will definitely be going back there again on my next trip out to Vegas!  Did I mention you can also get beer and wine?  You can!
