The only reason I am not giving this five stars is that we almost didn't go in based on the rude and openly disdainful older woman who was hostessing.  Initially, she ignored us and then reluctantly handed over a menu.  We opted to go in and honestly, very happy we did.  Our server, Cliff, was awesome.  He was clearly knowledgeable about every menu item, happy to offer suggestions based on our comments and questions, and did not steer us wrong.  We had two delicious entrees, served in a very timely fashion.   Service prompt and attentive without being overbearing.  All in all, a great dining experience!
