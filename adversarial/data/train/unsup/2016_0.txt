So delicious!  Everything was well done and served with care but the standout for me was the Iron Pot Rice.  It's like a Chinese version of the Korean stone pot rice but with crispy bits of pork in it, no eggs.  The rice on the bottom was crispy and the whole thing had great flavor.  Would want to eat this again.  The restaurant is beautifully done, clean, relaxing and the food is fabulous. Prices are very reasonable.
