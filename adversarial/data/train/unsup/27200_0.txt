I almost wanted to not leave such a glowing review so that this casino would remain \"undiscovered\", but honesty prevailed. We were here last night after being so disappointed with the Strip: the overbuilding, the crowds, the prices, the congestion. Being way off the Strip, the Silverton does not attract foot traffic. Indeed, it needs to be a destination in its own for anyone to end up here. But once we did we were so delighted!! Clean, new, uncrowded, with so many gaming options as well as other things to do (ahem- mermaid grotto???). There were food prices that reminded me of old Vegas, an absolutely splendid buffet, a generous and fun Player's Club, and a staff that seems to actually enjoy being there. We will return to this casino next time, not as a chance encounter, but as our primary destination.
