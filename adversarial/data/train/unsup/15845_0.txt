Many of the high rollers (especially Asians) prefer to gamble in private. Nevada law is built on public gaming. A few years ago they changed the law to permit these private clubs. The initial rules involved a $500 minimum, a $1 million dollar credit line and a direct video feed to the Gaming Comission, including pan and tilt to look at your hand.\n\nThese rooms have suddenly become slightly more available. The Gaming Commission just lowered the amount required to get into one. You know need a mere $300,000 in credit to play. Also the minimmum bet of $500 has been eliminated.
