I discovered this cool little pizzaria restaurant on one of favorite websites Groupon, but there was not much information online since ut was fairly new. The menu looked enticing and sexy per my reseach and Yelp investigation. We discovered it is located on the 2nd floor (Key Information because it is in a center) in Town Square, directly adjacent to the Blue Martini.\n\nWe started off with the Sicilian Chicken Soup which was absolutely flawless and amazing. Perfectly seasoned and full of flavor. We also ordered  Chicken Picatta which was very good. The chicken was great but the noodles could have been a tad more cooked they were a bit to firm but other than that it was perfect sauce and all. The Salmon which Spinach was a little larger than expected and the sauce was Sooooooo good. It was definitely a must order. Perfect texture with an amazing crunch on the edges of the salmon. \n\nGroupon usually never steers me wrong lol and once again helped me find a gem. Big Shout out to our waitress Mary Lynn (I think that was her name) who was super friendly and helpful. Ask for the Puerto Rican waitress she will talk you death lol but she has a sweet personality and cares about her customers which was much appreciated. I would reccomend sitting outside so you can enjoy the fresh air and view of trees etc. Sorry we didn't try the pizza which was getting all the love in others reviews but I can eat pizza all day back home in NY\/NJ lol
