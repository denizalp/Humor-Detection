It was our first night at Oreganos as a blended family. I'm the mom and I've finally met the man of my dreams. We bought a house just down the way. Unfortunately- our ticket got lost. We were happily enjoying a bottle of wine and conversation and before we could eve ask what happened... A manger came out and took care of everything. We even were moved to a table with a heater- as we were outside and it was cold. Thank you Oreganos, for making our dinner a success!
