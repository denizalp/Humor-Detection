One of the lens I look through when writing reviews is that I would never want to harm a business, harm their revenue stream, imperil people's livelihoods, etc.  Do no harm; that's  not asking too much.\n\nThat being said I will throw some shade at a family member, one of your family members also-our benevolent Uncle. . .Uncle Sam.\n\nThe USPS is a trainwreck.  The culture is abysmal, the employees (while the hiring of veterans is commendable and the right thing to do) are in dire need of strong direction and even better management.   \n\nTime in the morning is sacred.  Most commuters know this, respect this, live this.  We all have to be somewhere at or close to a certain time.  I've been carrying a Nordstrom return around in The Truckia for two weeks and since I had to get gas at QT and this Post Office was only two blocks away (read maybe 90 seconds) I decided to run over and drop this off.  Like I said, it was a parcel so I knew I would have to go inside and use the Dropbox because it wouldn't fit in the envelope drop. Let's add 15 seconds to my 90 second tour.\n\nI grabbed the package and ran in-only to be stunned with a sign that clearly had been there for days. . \n\"Dropbox broken, take package to the front desk.\" \nWell, the front desk isn't open until the  sun is warm and certainly wasn't this morning.  Let's just say the package is back in The Truckia and Nordstrom is still using my money.\n\nSeriously Uncle, develop a business plan and instill a sense of urgency with the rank and file.  I've seen moss grow faster than most of the employees can walk.  The three deadman walking in the US right now is Sears, K-mart, and the USPS.  The first two should be mercifully taken off life support but the USPS needs a bypass and a roto-rooting of the first degree. You're the butt of so many jokes for a reason.  Clean up your act and start performing like a proud organization of the USA.\n\nAnd I want my 115 seconds back.  I'll even take stamps for payment.
