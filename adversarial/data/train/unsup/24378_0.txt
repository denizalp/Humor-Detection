A-OK for what it was. I paid $44 for Wednesday night, and $89 for Thursday night. Not bad. The room is basic. Boring. No frills. We originally had booked a King room, but last minute my friend joined us, so I was able to call the day of check in and switch to two Queens. \n\nMy bathroom at home is fancier than the one here, but it got the job done. We really had no complaints. The beds were pretty comfy, and I am really picky about beds.\n\nThe casino is okay. I just play slots, and they had a good selection. I was never asked if I wanted cocktails, so I did purchase one at a sports bar and it was $10, not bad.\n\nThere is a Starbucks located near the elevators, which was nice. The valet was super quick and we never waited long for the car. \n\nWould I stay here again? Maybe if I could get the same cheap rates I got for Thanksgiving. If it would be any more than that, I would just stay somewhere nicer.
