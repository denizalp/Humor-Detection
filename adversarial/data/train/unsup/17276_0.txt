This place is one of a kind \nI come here 3-4 times a week and we always feel so welcome, they make us feel at home. \nThe music is so nice and not to loud. \nBefore we found out about this place we used to go to deferent hookah lounges in Vegas but all of them were dirty and the hookah wasn't so good..\nI love how clean this place is. \nThey also serve some really good food and awesome appetizer menu. \nThe alcohol menu is large and the prices are very fair. \nAnd sure the music is awesome.  \nVery recommended!
