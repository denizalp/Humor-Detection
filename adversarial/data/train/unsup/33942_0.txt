Dined on a Wednesday evening around 6 p.  We had a seat not far from the bar with a view of the kitchen. Our waiter came over immediately to take our drink orders (tap water) and informed us of the specials.  Complimentary bread (onion focaccia and Italian) and butter was served. The focaccia was excellent, Italian somewhat dry.\n\nWe opted to share the Asian Chicken Salad and the Sausage and spinach pizza. The Asian Chicken salad was excellent and they split the salad onto two plates (a nice\/convenient touch) and was very filling.  Shortly after, the pizza came out and it was piping hot and very good.   A little hard to cut with our butter knives but very good.  A perfect amount of food for two.\n\nTotal tab with tip $43. Our first experience at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant and we'll be back!
