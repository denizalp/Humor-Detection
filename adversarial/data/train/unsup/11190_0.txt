Nordstrom Scottsdale Fashion Square Cosmetic counter.  I don't have any idea what type of commission plan the EVE LOM representative is on but, today ,7\/13\/2014 at 4:20 she was so aggressive I left the store!  That has never happened to me in any store let alone Nordstrom!  I actually have to make my purchase on Amazon or Sephora now!  She did not represent Nordstrom as we know it!  Terrible experience ! And I left without buying the shoes I came for.
