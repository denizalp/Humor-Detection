I stayed here last year for Memorial day weekend. Although, we spent a pretty penny to have a good time, we figured it would be worth it as we were just looking to have a good time. A full time working couple just looking for an awesome weekend, we debated between hotels a lot and ended up staying here, big mistake!!! \n\nTheir customer service SUCKS, their concierge desk doesn't seem to be informed on anything in their own casino, let alone anywhere else. Anytime we called to ask a question from our room, we were given the WRONG information. I even spoke to their manager and he first blamed me for relying on the employees for the information. What upset me the most from this trip was not the, customer service or concierge desk but the lack of concern on the part of management.\n\n I am sorry but the management at WYNN needs to be taught a few things about the hospitality industry. My boyfriend was also upset because we requested and then paid an additional amount for a view of the strip, which we got a weird corner one. Anyway, I don't recommend staying here. Stay anywhere but here, these people do not care for your experience!!!WASTE OF MONEY, THE TIME AND A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.
