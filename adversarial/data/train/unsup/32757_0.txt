Came here with a friend last night. Simple, legitimate Japanese food (no mayo -fusion-dragon rolls here).  Was craving tonkatsu, so I got the Katsu donburi, and it was well done. My friend got the tonkotsu ramen (the hearty pork stock ramen that is ubiquitious in Japan) and I must say it was like I was back in Kagoshima all over again! Although my friend didn't listen to me and failed to slurp the ramen and thus eat it the way the food gods intended!\n\nSimple is best.
