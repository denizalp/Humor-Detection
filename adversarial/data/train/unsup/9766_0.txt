I finally got myself to this, and it was open!  This is a combination of nature preserve and community park but they are separate so don't expect to be doing Frisbee in the middle of the nature preserve or see native animals roaming the playground.\n\nIt looks like a very nice facility and area but I was disappointed that there are only walking trails, no auto route, as it's unbearably hot for most of the year and there is very little shade in the nature preserve part, and the shortest trail was half a mile one-way.\n\nIf I happen to go back in winter, I will definitely get out on the trails but probably not any other time of the year.
