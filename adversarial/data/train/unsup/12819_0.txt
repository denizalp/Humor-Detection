In-N-Out Burger - (Flamingo & Sandhill)\n\nCongrats to In-N-Out Burger Store #334. \n\nAs of today, this is In-N-Out's newest restaurant. This restaurant is new, and half the staff is new.  I went with my usual...two Flying Dutchman's (four patties and four slices of cheese).  It was good, but if I'm going to be honest, it wasn't the best Flying Dutchman that I had this week.  The burger patty wasn't as juicy, and the patties were a tad bit undercooked. The cheese paper was awesome, though.  Leave no trace!  The line inside the restaurant wasn't as busy as the drive thru and because this location is only 2 weeks new, it's as clean as can be.  I'm sure that I will be back.  Heck, I'm in the area a lot.  Of course, I'll be back. 3-stars for now. \n\nBy the way, my cashier stated that I was the first person to order a Flying Dutchman at this location. You're welcome.  I am honored.
