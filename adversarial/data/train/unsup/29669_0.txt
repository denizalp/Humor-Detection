Not happy, to say the least. I paid for a private room for my dog for five days, and grooming...... and he came back beaten and with a bruised elbow. Funny that they actually said that he could not be in population with any other dogs because he is not fixed,  however they also said that he made\" friends very well\", \"and got along with many other dogs\". I had to pay $294 and had to take him to the vet for another $175 worth of antibiotics and Rimadyl. Do not use this boarding facility under any circumstances.
