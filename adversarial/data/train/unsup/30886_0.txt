Cravings an omelette for breakfast but outta eggs? Well this is the place to go for a lazy Sunday Omelette breakfast or brunch. Service is good, food is as eggspected omelette, lots of options. I liked the low fat option, one yolk and the rest egg whites to make my omelette. \nGood portion sizes as well. This location is usually very busy on weekends but the wait isn't long at all, so don't let the line up scare you.
