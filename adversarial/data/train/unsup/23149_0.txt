I came here with one of my close friends, because we were both hungry and wanted to try out a new restaurant. After looking into a few places, we decided to come here. \n\nDefinitely a love\/hate relationship with this restaurant (no, I'm not joking ha), and this is why:\n\nPros:\n- Amazing food, although it seems like small portions when you order, it will rack up at the end \n- Really good music\n- One of the best looking bars in the area \n- Kind waiters\n- Good place to come with a bunch of friends and catch up\n- Cool concept\n\nCons:\n- SUPER slow service (yes, it was that bad)\n- Dirty washrooms (trust me, you should hold it in until you get home)\n- Expensive\n- Floors are super sticky\n\nAll in all, if you want to have a good time with good music, food, drinks and vibe with your friends, this is your spot. However, I advise you do not use their washrooms and don't expect amazing service.\n\nP.S. CASH ONLY!
