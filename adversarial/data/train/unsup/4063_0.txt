Very friendly and knowledgeable staff that was patient and explained everything to us first timers. \n\nThe spray tan is a VersaSpa and is really nicely maintained equipment. Took less than 5 min. You choose your level and wether you want tinted out clear. Clear shows up 6 hrs later and tinted you can see the color right away. \n\nThe whole place is very modern and feels clean.
