We'd received a Groupon gift certificate for them and had brunch there today. We went online and reviewed the menue, which was standard breakfast items. Called ahead to get our names on the seating list. Good idea, the wait was at 20 minutes when we arrived. Got seated pretty quickly but next to the kitchen. Ordered a Cafe Mocha, came quickly and was pretty good. Our food order came pretty quickly as well considering the crowd. Got a lot of food for the price but it was pretty average tasting and bland, not well seasoned at all. I'll give thm a thumbs up on the service and quantity of the food, but the quality is what's keeping me from coming back.
