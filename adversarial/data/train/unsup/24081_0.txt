I came here to get a PO box. I admit I was a little scared after reading the reviews, but thought I'd at least give it a try since it is in the most convenient location for me. I was pleasantly surprised with fantastic customer service. \n\nI mentioned the bad reviews and was told the person responsible for those awful reviews no longer works there. I hope this location can get their stars back up because they deserve more than 2 for sure!!
