Very disappointed with their customer service. Ordered pizza through GrubHub which we've done before with little issue. Pizza arrived about 20 minutes sooner than the 60 minute quote, wasn't expecting that but yay, we get to eat sooner than expected! We paid through the GrubHub app (including tip) so the driver gave us our food and that was that. \n\nLiterally 2 minutes after the driver leaves we get a call from the restaurant. The guy said, \"Our drivers work for tips, you probably don't know what that's like.\" \nThis, of course, caught me off guard. I did tip the driver, in the app, it shows you right on the grub hub receipt. I tell the guy that I did tip online, and instead of apologizing for his rude accusation, he hangs up on me. \n\nThis was the most unprofessional and simply rudest thing I've ever experienced from somebody in the customer service industry. I don't plan on every dealing with these guys again if they treat their customers this way. \n\nUpdate: owner messaged me and we talked on the phone. He was very apologetic about the incident. He said this issue is not representative of how they do business and apologized. I have no reason not to believe him. It's a shame how one employee having a bad day can affect how people see a business. Bumped review up to 3 stars for the owner reaching out.
