I wish I could give them zero star. We had this insurance for just two months. First they told us the monthly payment is 190. They got 230 for the first month which did not make any sense. Then they sent us some forms and raised our monthly payment to 514$ and when we cancelled our policy they charged us 230 more for the same month. Don't waste your money on this company. They suck your money for mo good service.
