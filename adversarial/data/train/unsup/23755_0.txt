Drove by here a million times and it had decent reviews so we decided to try it out this weekend.\n\nIt was okay. Like half of what i tried was pretty good...the other half not much. This is a buffet so my expectations were low. Good thing is, there was a lot of selection and once i figured out what i liked i rolled with it..\n\nTurns out the sushi was pretty damn good...and not on the first round because i just grabbed the few pieces that were out, and they tasted clearly as if they had been out a while....So there i sat..watching...waiting...hoping...and yes finally- Sushi man came and put out a few freshly cut rolls. I got up and hoarded like half of it....Redemption for this place. (Redemption saved them from 1 or 2 stars)\n\nSo if sushi is your thing, here's my tip: Get a table where you can keep an eye on the sushi counter, and patiently wait for new rolls to come out...be selfish and don't worry about the rest of the patrons.
