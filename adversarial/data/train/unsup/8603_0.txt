Apparently they used to wheel Aladdin round in a cart, and he'd say can I have one of these, one of these, and one of these for dinner, and point at everything he saw. That's where the expression \"Ala Cart\" came from. ;)\n\nGood middle eastern food in Pittsburgh - two locations - nom nom nom.\n\nWell this is pretty delicious, excllent Kofte Kebab.\n\nThey're pretty cheap, which is good, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I'll have to try some other things, but Kofte is my go to dish and they make a good one, not the best I've ever had but good. Bear in mind there is also one of these in Squirrel Hill, and others in nearby towns (I think there are one or two in Ohio too). \n\nBut as for their food, I'm impressed, now leave me alone and let me think of the names of at least 35 of Ali Baba's 40 thieves.
