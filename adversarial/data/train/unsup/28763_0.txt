5 of us came here for the Mothers Day brunch. We all had a choice of 3 starters, 4 entree's, a potato or carrots, and 3 desserts. I had the lobster bisque, potato, prime rib and cheesecake. The bisque had way too much tomato base and had a very strange flavor. My cut of prime rib was fatty, maybe 1\/2\" thick and tough (I always thought prime rib was sliced very thick to maintain juice) and was maybe a 4 to 5 ounces. The potato was good but dry, and the cheesecake was just ok. The other peoples meals were mediocre also. All this for $40 per person.....I've had better meals for a lot less money.
