My family likes to have brunch here when we're all together in Vegas.  It's casual dining-Wynn style.  The place has a great sunny, relaxing feel to it.  It's roomy with the tables spread far apart.  The service has always been wonderful.  I love the salads here.  The menu changes whenever we've been there and everything I've ever tried, I've loved.  I had one of the best lobster salads I've ever had in my life here.  I really enjoy this place, will continue to visit, and highly recommend.
