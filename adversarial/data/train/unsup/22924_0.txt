I am a huge fan of New Mexico style food, Carne Adovada being one of my favorite. I kept reading \"best authentic new mexican\" in the reviews. I couldn't disagree more. The food has an extremely heavy gringo influence for the worst. Could not serve this anywhere in New Mexico. I have never had Carne Adovada with pork that was dry and tough. As a cook, my guess is the pork was made days ahead of time and reheated (poorly). Then to make things worse, the adovada sauce had a distinct charred \/ burned taste to it. Cheese crisp had no crisp and was soggy instead. This is authentic to where I don't know other than here.\n\nNot sure where all the great reviews are coming from. The only thing I can guess based on the crowd was that they have a lot of very loyal customers that are of the retirement age (or older)  and have been going there for years. Certainly nothing wrong with that. \n\nThey had a full dining room with only 3 servers and one bus person and service was slow at best. I don't blame the servers as it was apparent that they were completely overwhelmed and doing the best they were allowed to do. Servers were even making the drinks\/cocktails\/margaritas for their tables. Wanted so much to like this place, but it was simply not a good experience. The owner \/ manager even came by and took our menus before we even ordered and without ever asking if we were done with them. In fact she never said a word to us. No one ever came by to ask how the meal was or to refill drinks.\n\nThey did take the uneaten Carne Adovada off the bill, thank goodness. Definitely won't ever be back.
