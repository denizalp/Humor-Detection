First of all I'm SHOCKED this location has an average of four stars. I would definitely give other locations four starts, but not this one. \n\nI arrived at Buffalo Wild Wings around 4am on a Sunday morning, completely coherent. I was shown a table relatively quickly. However, that is where the quickness stopped. When my party arrived the restaurant was NOT bust. At all. \n\nIt took awhile for the waitress to approach us. When she did she quickly asked if we would like anything to drink or if we would like any appetizers. We ordered two queso dips for the table and waters all around. \n\nWhen the rest of the party arrived she came to take our food order. She was not very friendly. Very straight and to the point. Two people (out of 8) ordered beer, which usually comes BEFORE the food. \n\nAfter she left our queso arrived. It was COLD. Not even luke warm. Cold. We knew that our waitress would not come back anytime soon, and we were hungry, so we just ate it. \n\nAfter about 20 minutes we started to wonder about the beers. Where were they? We flagged down the waitress and told her to just cancel the beers. She apologized for the wait, explaining they were busy (note, they were just starting to get busy, she had plenty of time to bring the beer prior). We feel as though she should have brought the beer anyways, like most restaurants would. \n\nWhen our food arrived it was hits and misses all around. All the wings seemed on par, but NONE of the wraps had sauce. HOW. They use wings in the wraps, and wings have sauce right?\n\nOf course it took forever to get our check and she was less than authentically apologetic. I hate writing poor reviews and rarely do. It takes alot for me to do this, but this was just an all around bad experience.
