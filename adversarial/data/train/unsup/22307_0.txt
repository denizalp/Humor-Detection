We went here looking for item my husband wanted for his rifles and they had those items listed they had them in stock on their website so we looked them up and put them in google maps and headed out not realizing we were on the other side of town. \n\nSo after 30 minutes of traffic and who knows if it was the best way to go we found them. We were greet and asked if we could be helped and my hubby told them exactly what he wanted and that's what they had. And we absolutely had to peruse the gun inventory and ogle all the great carry hand guns. \n\nThese guys were very very friendly, great prices and very knowledgeable. We will definitely will be back next time we are in time. \n\nThey have such a great selection of long guns, hand guns, carry conceal and tactical. Ammo, clip and accessories. A really all around one stop shop I would highly recommend. We were happy with price and definitely service. Nice people.
