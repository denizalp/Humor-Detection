Visited this restaurant tonight since we enjoy Vietnamese food as a family.  First time trying it out.  Was very quiet.\n\nMy husband ordered #106, Chicken with Mushrooms.  Sauce was bland.  Mushrooms were out of a can (like really?).\n\nKids ordered #50, Charbroiled chicken, spring rolls on vermicelli.  The spring rolls were good.  The chicken tasted like shrimp (my daughters quote) and the vermicelli sticky.  Our kids typically devour this dish (in other Vietnamese restaurants) and they hardly ate it here.\n\nI was feeling like Pho and ordered #21 Sate Chicken Noodle Soup.  They brought me Beef Noodle Soup.  So I flagged the waitress and told her.  She brought the bowl of soup to the kitchen and apologized.  Two minutes later she returned with the same bowl of soup and said you can continue eating it if you wish.  I said no and she left without the soup.  So it sat on the table.  2 minutes later she was back with a bowl of chicken that she plopped into the bowl of beef pho and said here is your chicken, its ok now?  I was truly mortified.  I wonder how John Gilchrist would have felt.  I had another 3 or 4 bites of the soup and since I really didn't enjoy the flavour all that much (the chicken was bland and did not take on the flavour of the soup) I didn't want any more.  Plus it was slightly gritty (?).\n\nDisappointed = Yup.  I do have to say the service was very quick and our food came out steaming hot.  However each dish was disappointing enough for us that we will not return or recommend this restaurant.
