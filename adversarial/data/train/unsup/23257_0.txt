You know all that loose change you have jingling in your pockets?\n\nYou could spend it on some trans-fatty processed crap from the convenience store that'll make you feel a little gross after you eat it; or head over to Korea Town for fresh walnut cakes filled with wholesome sweet potato or red bean.\n\nSix little walnut cakes (called \"hodo kwaja\" in Korean), stamped out by an ornate machine, are just $1.50. How? (Lack of unions?)\n\nThe hodo kwaja look like walnuts but have a sponge cake layer on the outside while the puree filling is dense and smooth. They're not too sweet in that subtle Asian tea-snack way.\n\nI'm dying to have them hot off the press and am considering stalking the premises to get them super fresh. Who's with me?
