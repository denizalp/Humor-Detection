I'm looking forward to returning and trying the chorizo mussels.  The short rib pizza and wings were delicious.\nThe service was very friendly and the decor set a nice evening-out mood.\nWish I would have tried this place sooner... :)\nAlready planning our corporate Christmas lunch\/dinner here... :)\n\nOh... almost forgot to mention... the duck fat fries were so good i didn't want to spoil them with ketchup... :)
