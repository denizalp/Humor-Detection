I was skeptical going in, thinking I'd need to stop for dinner on the way home.  The cucumber water is great, and very refreshing.  The Tribal Tacos, though not necessarily taco-ish in the traditional sense, we're delicious.  The OM burger, which I didn't have, is on my list of dishes to try soon, because it looked delicious and reportedly was.\n\nThe dessert was on another level.  The vegan chocolate cake was hands down one of the best cakes I've ever had, vegan or otherwise.
