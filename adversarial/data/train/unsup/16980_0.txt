Ran into La Bliss for a quick polish change today, I loved that it's a cozy room with you and your beauty guru.  It's quiet, clean and I got a great polish change!  I found out she also does waxing and lashes!  Great for one stop shopping and one on one service!  I really enjoyed being the only customer in the room, no body asking questions, no phone ringing..You walk in, get your service done quickly.  I'm a fan!
