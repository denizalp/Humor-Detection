Slowly but surely, the void in Charlotte of good coffee spots is being filled, and nothing makes me happier! The newest and coolest additions is Not just coffee! Oh how glad I am that I live only a couple blocks away :) What's great about this place you ask? The coffee of course, but also  the friendly baristas, the interesting people sitting next to you at their small bar, and last but not the least - the fact that they are located in the cutest little indoor market in uptown! They primarily serve coffee and tea, but if you're hungry there are so many options for food in the market. Sure they are a tad bit pricier than usual, but in my opinion, the entire coffee experience there makes it all quite worth it. \nMy husband and I enjoy walking over on a random evening for the perfect latte (hot or cold!) or a pour over. I like a simple cup of coffee, so what's most important is that the coffee be rich and flavorful, and that's what you get here. The hot lattes, apart from being delicious also look very pretty. I am yet to try their flavored lattes (and hot chocolate; which looks amazing), and this Saturday is looking like the perfect day to do just that! :)
