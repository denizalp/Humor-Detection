Best apartment living experience I've ever had! Natalie and MJ were so much fun, but also always took care of buisness. I lived there 5 years (long time, I know) and never had issues with anyone on the property. I was annoyed by some loud, bad music once but management called and took care of it. Seriously, that was the extent of drama at Altessa. It was low key, well kept, great neighbors, cookies in the office, fun event mixers, and the best location in LV. \n\nI know it's not cheap. But it was worth it. I only moved because I finally bought a house.
