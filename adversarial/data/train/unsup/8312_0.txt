I was back in Pittsburgh for a weekend to attend my graduation ceremony. And I surely wasn't giving up this rare opportunity to grab a bite at Pamela's. We were a group of six people. After waiting for about 30 minutes, we were given a spot. Together, we shared a ham omelet, a morning-after breakfast, a plate of blueberry hotcakes, and a fish sandwich. This was all more than sufficient for the six of us. \n\nAs usual, everything was delish.
