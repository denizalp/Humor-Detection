Yep, I am the guy that generally wants to go to sleep when the lights go out at a concert.  Having flown so much over the years in economy class, when I sit in a small, tight seat with tons of people crowded, with no leg room, and when the lights go out, I tend to go to sleep!  I have slept at so many concerts.  OK, maybe it is just me and I get bored.\n\nSeeing Elton John was a anniversary gift for the wife and we went with our friends. Yep the seats were tight and the place was crowded however....\n\na. Elton John is a great performer and he really likes to entertain and please the crowd.\n\nb. He is energetic, fun, engaging and can still play and sing with a ton of energy.\n\nc. He tells a few great stories and has at one point, those sitting at the very front come around him and his piano to sing with him.\n\nd.  His band seems very \"experienced\" but they are a very lively bunch.\n\ne.  I enjoyed listening to his songs and being entertained.\n\nHe doesn't come out for an encore, but you know that right away by how he acknowledges everyone.  Great show, great entertainer and great time.
