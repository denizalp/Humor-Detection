I made a point to stop at Keith's because of the reviews I read on Yelp. Sadly, my experience wasn't as great as the other reviewers. Three people in front of me ordered the famous Keith Special, which turns out to be a pork sausage with BBQ sauce if I remember correctly. I'm not a huge fan of pork sausage, so I ordered the Turkey Sandwich. The sandwich came with cheese, lettuce, mayo and mustard, with an option to substitute the mustard with cranberry sauce. It was Keith's 40th anniversary, so sandwiches were $1 off and came with a bag of chips. \nI'll give the sandwich points for the bread being super fresh and soft, but otherwise it fell flat. There was about 2 thin slices of deli turkey, a couple shreds of iceberg lettuce and bland cheese. Thank goodness for the bread or I would have been starving after. It's nice that a small mom and pop place can stick around for so long, especially in Calgary, but I think this is my first and only visit to Keith's.
