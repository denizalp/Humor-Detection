It was a blessing in disguise when I tried to bring my parents to the 30 minute long wait at Sunrise Cafe on Mother's Day after church. Lucky Foo's did not have a line, and my dad gets grumpy when he is hungry so we decided to venture over there. \nWhen we walked in, we were greeted very warmly by 2 women who gave us a 5--10 minute waiting period. I definitely felt that \"new restaurant\" vibe because we were asked by about 3 different people if we'd be helped\/assisted\/ordered yet. Which is fine, you could just tell they wanted to impress :-)\n\nI don't why, but the thought fusion food turns me off. That makes no sense cuz I'm a very eclectic person! I was a little wary to eat there at first, but I ordered the chicken katsu and waffles. The katsu had a...different flavor that maybe I'm not used to since I'm so familiar with Aloha Kitchen's katsu. The waffle was delicious though and the plate was presented very nicely. My mom though. She got the Forbidden Black Rice bowl!?!!!!! \n\nThat mess was amazing! So good that I went back 2 days later just to order it. I've never had black rice before and all the flavors they combined are so complementary of each other. It's a bit pricey for how much food you get, but asking around, I heard that black rice is fairly exclusive and all the ingredients were probably similar. \n\nThe manager (Michael, I believe) approached our table to ask about our meal and hooked my dad up with a card and a coupon. Our server Sandee was really friendly and well versed on the menu. $50 for a flavorful Mother's Day brunch is not bad at all.\n\nI'll be back for that black rice bowl and probably some other things.
