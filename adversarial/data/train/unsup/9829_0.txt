Stayed at Aria for 4 days, 3 nights... come to think about it, this is about as long as I'll ever stay in Vegas.\n\nPERRRFFECCT amount of time in my opinion! \n\nI love the casino floor because it's clean and well maintained--granted the place is new, but so what? So far so good, because nothing beats NOT smelling like an ashtray by the time you're home.   Seriously, I got home and I sniffed my clothes... smelled delicious--like PINE SOL... haha.\n\nThe pool area is a decent size, separate pool areas and spa areas to suit everybody's needs.  They check room keys, but nowhere near as aggressively as Mandalay does.  Clean water, minimal kids... or should I say, minimal ROWDY kids... parents did a good job of looking after their little ones.  \n\nThe buffet is located on the Promenade level which is awesome because it's off the casino floor--you will forget that you're in a casino by the time you leave the buffet.  I didn't eat at the buffet because I was too busy drinking my alchy and being passed out under the bed of my room.\n\nSPEAKING of ROOMS.  Aria has one of the nicest rooms I've ever been in.  Everything is controlled by a bedside touch screen remote.  My favorite feature is the SLEEP feature where you can literally turn everything off and close the curtains w\/ a touch of the button.  Wake up the next day to ultimate bliss.  The other cool open is the Service and Privacy lights outside the door are all controlled by buttons from within as well.\n\nState of the art unfortunately will have it's dangers... at Aria it comes in the form of the MINI BAR in the room.  WATCH OUT! Everything is weight sensored! DO NOT remove items and place your personal items inside. \n\nAll in all a great experience.  A lot of good and nothing bad... nothing SPECTACULAR either which is why it's a 4 out of 5 for me.
