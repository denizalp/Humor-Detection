This store is OK. The quality of the furniture isn't that great. The furniture looks good initially until you inspect it further and closer and then it just looks cheap. This is a good place to get furniture if you're just starting out. It's comparable to Ikea or Walmart or any other store that has a lower end furniture at a low price. \nThe store is also good if you're just looking for a certain piece to finish off a room. They have nice throw pillows that are fairly cheap. They also have a clearance section that has dramatically reduced prices on items that were once floor models. Regarding the sales people, some are good and some are bad. I've walked around and had a great salesperson very helpful then the next time I went in a lady salesperson was very rude and very unhelpful. When I asked her if they carried a tall dresser similar to a lingerie chest she shook her head in a no direction before I could get the whole sentence out and continually shook her head No while I was still talking. After I walked around the store I found: exactly what I was referring to but unfortunately it was the wrong color so I didn't buy it. I also asked her if they carried  a specific black nightstand. She said all they had was one in the children's section. After I browsed the store I found several nightstands I described to her.  But unfortunately they were $300 a piece and I didn't want to spend that for a nightstand. Especially for a lower end quality.\nSo all in all the store is  fine for certain pieces or people just starting out but you wont get high end long lasting furniture here.
