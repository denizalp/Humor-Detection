One of the most fun and unique shows in all of Las Vegas.  This show is great for all ages.  From the minute the show starts Jeff is witty warm and engaging.  Then he takes it to the next level balancing ladders with his chin and juggling all sorts of challenging objects.  He keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire show and there is never a dull moment.  This is the second time I've seen the show and the best part is he is always adding new bits so you can bet I will be coming again soon to see what else he changes up. Jeff Civillico Comedy in Action is one of the true gems on the strip.  You don't want to miss this show if you're in town.
