I wasn't impressed with Kelly's as a restaurant.  Half of the menu was unavailable while I was there because they were in the middle of changing it.  Everything I wanted was not available.  Once I received my food, it wasn't the best either.  It was a sandwich.  How hard is that to make?  \n\nAnyway, this place is better for drinking and going out, not eating.  All of the old town people go here now, so it's one of the new hot spots.  I'm not sure I love the crowd though.  It's filled with bitchy girls and douchebags.  Check it out for yourself if you'd like.
