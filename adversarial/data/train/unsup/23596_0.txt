This restaurant was picked based on our group winning the competition we were in today.  We had a choice of 8 restaurants and this one had the best Yelp reviews.\n\nAfter a short walk (less than a block) from our hotel we arrived at the restaurant.  Since we had reservations, we were immediately taken to our table.  Table location was kind of funny, upstairs and outside in an area beside the stairs.\n\nWe had multiple wait staff due to group size.  I found all of them to be both friendly and informative.\n\nWe ordered multiple appetizers and drinks.  One of the appetizers was a meat and cheese sampler that was awesome.\n\nI ordered a flatiron steak and scalloped potatoes.  I have to say, that due to the size of the side, I had to share.  I think everybody agreed that the potatoes were the hit of the meal.  \n\nThe steak was small but prepared well.  I like my steak to be more flavorful than what I was served.  I would probably order something else if returning.\n\nWould I return?  Without a doubt.  We had a great time and I would like a second helping of those potatoes:-)
