I had purchased a coupon on Groupon to give this place a try. I was pleasantly surprised. The waitress was extremely nice and patient. We started off with the mini rillettes; absolutely delish!! I had the Confit sleeve; reminded me of KFC fried chicken which in my books is NOT a bad thing. I also had a little sample of the torchon de fois gras which was spectacular! For the main course I had the duck marget with foie gras sauce. Keeping in mind that I've never actually had duck breast before until that night, I had a bit of a hard time getting it down. But it can also be because I'm a crazy and felt like the duck was SUPER rare. My boyfriend had the duck burger with foie gras. I was told it was wonderful but extremely heavy.\nAs if all that food was no enough, we finished our ultra light supper with dessert. I sampled both the Grand Marnier crème brulee and the Tarte Tatin. It's either because I'm not a huge dessert person or the fact that I ate about 17 pounds of duck but the dessert wasn't for me. The crème brulee was TOO \"Grand Marnier-ish\" (yes there is such a thing) and the Tarte Tatin was like a brick in my stomach.\nOnce I've digested the 17 pounds of duck, I would definitely go back! But for the moment, I need to stick to salads.
