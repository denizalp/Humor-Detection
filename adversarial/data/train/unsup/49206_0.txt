Las Vegas parks kick ass over any park in San Diego and this place is a prime example. Tons of play features for the kids that all compliment the dessert landscape. Tons of shade with plenty of trees and canopied table areas. Huge grass area greener than anything I've seen back home. Lots of parking. Even have a security guard cruising around on his bike who was really friendly. Great job Vegas.
