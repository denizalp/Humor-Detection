My foodie friend and I checked this out today. We tried the pandas, fish and bean. I am not a big fan of beans, but it was good. The fish version was nice as well. I had the oxtail entree and my friend had the stewed beef. Very nice well seasoned. Plantains we delish. Nice music and a chill atmosphere. They are trying for a liquor license. A good beer would have topped the meal off.
