Finally had the chance to go here after watching it being constructed for what seemed like a decade. Had the fried egg sandwich with bacon, and it was really good. The quality of their ingredients is obvious, as the bacon was thick and flavorful, the eggs were delicious, and the bread was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. \nThis restaurant is a refreshing change of pace from some of the other options around downtown, and will hopefully be here to stay. Can't wait to go back and try some lunch sometime.
