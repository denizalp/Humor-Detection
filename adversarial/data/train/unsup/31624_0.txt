Working with National Stone for getting granite installed in my kitchen and two bathrooms was a smooth process from start to finish. Jim the salesperson was knowledgeable and the estimate was done quickly. The office staff was friendly and efficient. Everything was completed within two weeks of signing the contract and the results were beautiful as you can see from the photos!
