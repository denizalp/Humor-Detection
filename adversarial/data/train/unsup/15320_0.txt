This is the first review I have ever written! I spoke with someone on the phone yesterday about coming in to test out some essential oils today. I drove 5 and a half hours from Indiana and then realized I was going to arrive 5 minutes after 5pm so I called to place my order in advance over the phone. The woman explained there was nothing they could do, for they were closing in less than 10 minutes and they would not wait 5 extra minutes for me to arrive. I own and operate a highly successful company. We had planned to switch suppliers this week... I don't think they know what 5 minutes just cost them. I am now searching for a new supplier and I highly recommend that you do the same! Do not buy anything from Bulk Apothecary!
