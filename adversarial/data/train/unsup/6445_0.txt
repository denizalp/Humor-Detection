Fried seafood doesn't get any better than this. I live in D.C. but my grandparents live in Cleveland and what better reason to come visit dear ole granny? SHARKS! \n\nThe service is great - super friendly folks.  There's a T.V. so you can sit and watch the game while you wait (carry-out, only folks). \n\nI always get the fried jumbo shrimp with a different side ... I'll be honest, the fries are almost always soaky due to the fried seafood inside.  Sides include green beans, mac and cheese, etc. \n\nThe fried fish is good too but I highly recommend the jumbo shrimp! It's about 11.99 for 1\/2 pound of shrimp and a side. \n\nThanks Shark for always being there for me!
