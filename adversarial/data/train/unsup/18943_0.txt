This is a great location and not very busy on the inside. I have started to come to this Costco to avoid the lines in Summerlin. They have some business sized supplies - bulk meats, danishes, etc. The shortened hours are the downfall of this location... its hard to get into here before they close M-F and they are closed Sundays.
