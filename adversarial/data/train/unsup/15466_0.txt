This is the reason I like shopping with a small local place.  I went in late in the afternoon with a leaky tire.  He confirmed my suspicion that I would need a new tube and proceeded to install it while we chatted about bicycles and small business climate.  Then he tried to charge me less than the service was worth, especially as I did not have to make a second trip back to pick up the tire.\n\nThey have been in business with the same owner for I think over 20 years, now in their 3rd location.  I have an issue with a seat post so I will be back in soon.
