Love it!\nThey're a new location and it's bigger than the Rainbow store. There are several tables that are great for studying and the ambiance is very relaxed. The service is terrific, the gentleman that helped us (the last 2 times we visited) was very polite and helpful. This is honestly our new favorite boba place. Their boba is made fresh and you have an option to choose how sweet your drink is. I would definitely recommend the taro milk tea with boba.
