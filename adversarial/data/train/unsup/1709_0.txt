After years of running around Dilworth and passing this storefront on the corner of Euclid and East Blvd, I finally got a chance to go in and check things out.  They were having a nice sidewalk clearance on a gorgeous fall weather day, but I was surprised at everything that was offered here in this store.\n\nMy main mission was to get gift wrap... but ended up getting a gift bag with tissue paper (yes - I got lazy.... and I didn't know if I could find tape in my own house).  But the selections here are unique.\n\nThere is a large book section (that surprised me) and a ton of other novelties in this store that could occupy one's afternoon for hours.  Saw everything from party favors to gifts for cubicle-mates.  \n\nLove the 20-year history behind this gem in Dilworth.  It's definitely worth checking out to find a gift, or even just creating new conversations with friends while browsing.
