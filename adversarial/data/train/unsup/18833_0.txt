Since there are no zoo's in Vegas we come here to see animals.  Haa haaa-just kidding. My kids love to come in to pet the bunny's.  They have been asking for one for the longest time, but since I don't want to add anymore chores to my list of things to do, we come in to visit them on a regular basis! \n\nWe have a \"pet\" fish so we come in to buy fish food. The doggies are so adorable.  We have seen and held a few puppies and the staff has always been very courteous, helpful, and nice.  \n\nLots of other critters here too like turtles, hermit crabs, baby rats, snakes, birds, fish and a tarantula-yuk!  \n\nStop by to say hi to the puppies, although I don't like big dogs in kennels, some of them could have used a big yard:(
