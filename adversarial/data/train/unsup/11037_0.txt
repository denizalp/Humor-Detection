I fell in love with Manic the moment I sat in their smooth wood seating, reading a book and enjoying a good, strong coffee. Their coffee is strong, yes, and so good that I have only had their espresso a couple times. \n\nNow, I have the caffeine tolerance of a caffeine-a-holic and let me tell you, after one of their lattes I feel that sweet kick one only gets after getting their fix.\n\nComfortable, artistic atmosphere, great staff, awesome thinking place. \n\nSo Manic Coffee, thanks-a-latte for being awesome.
