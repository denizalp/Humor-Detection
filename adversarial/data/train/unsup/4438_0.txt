I had the Tiroler Gr√∂stl, a sampler of diced meats with German style potatoes. It was a tad salty for my usual taste, but overall very well prepared and seasoned. Service was very slow, and I had to wait much longer than usual for drink refills and general table service.  \n\nOverall assessment: Good food, dated decor, and waitresses leave much to be desired when it comes to attentiveness.  I would go back and back and try something new, in hopes that the lacking service was due to an off night and not normal operations.
