We almost didn't dine here, we were able to get a seat outside and were seated pretty quickly for a busy Friday night. We browsed their tiny menu and decided to pick something and stay since we were hungry and already seated and I didn't feel like finding another place. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, smoked trout and some cocktails. Our drinks were perfectly made; they sure know how to make a good Old Fashioned. The food was ridiculous, every bite was delicious. They're a busy spot on a Friday night and the servers were awesome even though they were super busy. It's a little pricey but totally worth it.\n\nI was happy we stayed, we left very content and I would definitely return.
