Yum Yum. I came here with my sis-in-law for a random Friday lunch. It was busy but we were taken care of quite fast by a fantastic server.\n\nThe menu had a list of many mouth watering dishes making the choice hard. When we asked for suggestions, we were told to begin our journey with \"The Remedy\". Remedy for what? A hangover, hunger, life? Yes. It just really satisfied everything. A return trip is a must.\n\nAlso, amazing cappuccinos. Soooo good.
