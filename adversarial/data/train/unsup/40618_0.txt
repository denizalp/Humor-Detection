I was really happy with my meal. The service was wonderful. I had a gift card so I ordered a few items to sample.  Ruben sandwich....great sandwich.  Nothing wrong with it. Nothing exceptional about it either though. Matzo ball soup.... really good and the noodles tasted like butter which was really something special.  Bagels and bialys.....now I really don't want to take anything away from them here because based on other people's reviews there is a big difference between a bagel you get at Einstein Bros and a legit NY bagel.....personally, I haven't met a fresh bagel I didn't like and without having the competition right next to it for the sake of comparison....I can't tell the difference. It was a good bagel and the strawberry cream cheese was homemade which was unique and delicious. I'd never heard of a bialy which is similar to a bagel except it's not boiled like a bagel,  doesn't have a hole,  and is slimmer. I didn't care for the taste or texture of the bialy. It was salty and it was cinnamon raisin. I cut it in half, the top half was light and fluffy and the bottom was so tough I could barely bite off a knock to gnaw on. If I lived close to it, I'd go there for lunch or breakfast often to support a local mom n pop, but it wasn't so great that I'd cheat on the local businesses here in Gilbert and drive to Scottsdale to visit them.
