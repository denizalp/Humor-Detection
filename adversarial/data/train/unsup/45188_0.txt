I came in for the Harvest party where they collected donations of food to feed families in need. They also had a raffle where they gave away different treatments and I WON a free treatment!! So I booked it right away with Cindy. I recently moved to Las Vegas and my skin is freaking out! I came in today with extremely thirsty skin.  It started to crack from dryness but Cindy knew what to do and literally rescued my skin!  She did a moisturizing mask AFTER the pumpkin facial and derma sweep. My face felt like it was coated in a soft glove of moisture without the stickiness that some products can leave behind.  I'm 30 years old and my skin is going through many changes but after seeing Cindy I have faith that my skin is on its way to recovery.   \n\nThank you, Cindy!
