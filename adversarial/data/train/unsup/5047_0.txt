This was my first time eating at Brixx. Certain beers were offered at $3 (not sure if it was a happy hour things or it's a certain day of the week), but there were quite a few options available. I opted for the Laguitas IPA. If you're a fan of IPAs, this one is pretty good. \n\nFor a meal, I decided on the buffalo Chicken Pizza. It was fresh and delicious. The service was a little slow and parking is a bit limited, but there is parking in the adjacent shopping plaza. Overall, a good experience.
