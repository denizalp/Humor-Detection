I love Madison. A lot. So anytime I get to go I really look forward to it, especially when I get to check out places I've never been to before.\n\nI'm not a super crafter when it comes to beads and jewelry, believe me, but I do enjoy making things from time to time. It's really fun for me to just browse through bead stores, too.  \n\nTo get right to it, Indus Beads is bullshit.\n\nUnfortunately, there's always kind of an pretentious air when someone walks into a place that caters to a very specialized and specific area that they (the customer) aren't completely familiar with. I think a lot of that has to do with a customer's own personal insecurities (a casual music lover walking into a tiny record store and feeling like the clerk is a total elitist asshole right off the bat, for instance) but sometimes the customer isn't crazy and the store IS just run by a bunch of jerks.\n\nHello, Indus Beads!\n\nSeriously, would it have helped if I walked in wearing an, \"I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING, I SWEAR!\" tshirt? Would you have treated me with a little more respect, Indus Beads? Would you have made me feel like my business was actually appreciated? Whatever, it doesn't matter anyway. The place was filled with crappy stock that looked like it had been collecting dust for years.\n\nStupid Indus Beads!
