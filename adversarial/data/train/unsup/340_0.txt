What a scam of a \"business\".  These guys are the most unreliable company I have ever dealt with. I might as well just make a list.\n\n-I was told 2-3 weeks. Took 7 weeks.\n-I was sold on a white pebble, was given gray. Of course the salesman blamed it on ya and threw in his tough \"contract\" talk.\n-there was NO communication between the superintendent, the office, or anyone else for that matter. They wouldn't respond to calls, emails, or texts.\n-they removed my old spa, but left it sitting on my grass for over a week (without my permission or knowledge), killing my grass.\n-after adding a Baja step, they left a huge bag of cement in my front yard (without my permission or knowledge) damaging the landscape.  \n-the superintendent sold us on different lights than our original choosing, only to find out his pricing was way less than what the salesman advised. \n-They would tell me I was the first job and be there in the am, show up around 3 or later. Sometimes vice Versa\n\nThe outcome of the pool is great.  But I would never recommend this company to get your pool remodeled.  Not even to my worst enemy.
